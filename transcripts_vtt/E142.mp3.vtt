00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
[Amit Varma]: The purpose of the organization was to set protocols by which mail could be exchanged

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
[Amit Varma]: between the 22 different nations that were part of it.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.360
[Amit Varma]: You could say to create the HTTP of the offline world.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.880
[Amit Varma]: As the 19th century drew to an end, one of the problems it faced was how to enable a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: person in one country to pay the return postage for a letter from another country.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, an Italian immigrant to America might send a letter to Italy to his aged parents

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.920
[Amit Varma]: and may want to enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope so that they can reply without having

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
[Amit Varma]: to buy stamps.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.880
[Amit Varma]: But obviously, American stamps will not work in Italy and he can't buy Italian stamps in

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
[Amit Varma]: America.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880
[Amit Varma]: So what to do?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.240
[Amit Varma]: The Universal Postal Union came up with a clever solution in 1904.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.640
[Amit Varma]: This was basically an international stamp called the International Reply Coupon or an

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.440
[Amit Varma]: IRC, which would be valid anywhere and which could be purchased in any of these countries

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.200
[Amit Varma]: for a fixed amount of local currency.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.680
[Amit Varma]: The system works superbly and aspiring writers of a certain vintage may remember that as

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.280
[Amit Varma]: recently as the 1990s, publications abroad would ask you to submit your writing to them

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.760
[Amit Varma]: with an International Reply Coupon so that the polite rejection letter they would send

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.960
[Amit Varma]: you would be at your cost.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.240
[Amit Varma]: Now the Universal Postal Union is an upstanding organization and not the subject of this episode,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800
[Amit Varma]: but their IRCs set in motion an interesting scheme.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Now remember, these coupons could be bought across all these countries for a set amount

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
[Amit Varma]: of local currency.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But what happened when currencies fluctuated?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.480
[Amit Varma]: An IRC would automatically become cheaper in one country than another.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.260
[Amit Varma]: And currencies did fluctuate wildly because of World War I.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.240
[Amit Varma]: As the war came to an end in 1919, an Italian immigrant in Boston received some International

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.900
[Amit Varma]: Reply Coupons in a mail from Spain.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500
[Amit Varma]: He realized the opportunity for arbitrage here.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.720
[Amit Varma]: He calculated that if he bought $1 worth of IRCs in Rome, it would be worth $3.30 in Boston,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.240
[Amit Varma]: a profit of 230%.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Other countries had even more devalued currencies, such as Austria, and he could make even more

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.960
[Amit Varma]: money there.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.360
[Amit Varma]: So he formulated a business plan.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Buy IRCs cheap in Europe, make a profit selling them in the US.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.160
[Amit Varma]: This was an entirely legitimate business plan.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.400
[Amit Varma]: There's nothing wrong with buying cheap and selling expensive.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Our man needed money for this though, and he had already burnt his fingers with various

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.600
[Amit Varma]: failed enterprises in the 15 years since he'd left Italy.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.400
[Amit Varma]: No one was going to lend him large sums of money, but he figured he could get the capital

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.720
[Amit Varma]: he needed from small investors.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.680
[Amit Varma]: He formed a company called the Securities Exchange Company, the SEC, which sounds respectable,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and advertised a scheme promising that anyone who invested money with him would get a 50%

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.120
[Amit Varma]: return in 45 days.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.880
[Amit Varma]: This is a mad rate of return.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.560
[Amit Varma]: He even turned a few of his initial investors into agents, giving them 10% of whatever investments

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.120
[Amit Varma]: they got in.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Everyone who invested automatically became an evangelist of the company, as they rationalized

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.920
[Amit Varma]: their investment and began recommending it to others.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.160
[Amit Varma]: Over time, as initial batches of investors actually received that 50% interest, they

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160
[Amit Varma]: became bhakts.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.960
[Amit Varma]: They often reinvested their money while selling property to gather other funds to invest.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Old women invested their savings of a lifetime.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.360
[Amit Varma]: Early men mortgaged their homes to add to their savings that they'd already invested.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.680
[Amit Varma]: In February 1920, the total investments in this scheme were only $5,000.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.680
[Amit Varma]: A month later, $30,000.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.200
[Amit Varma]: By May, over $400,000.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.520
[Amit Varma]: By July, it was bringing in millions.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.840
[Amit Varma]: Once newspaper coverage started in late July, it started bringing in a quarter of a million

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.600
[Amit Varma]: dollars a day.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Estimates of how much money was invested in the scheme vary from 15 to 20 million dollars,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.960
[Amit Varma]: and 20 million in those days would be around 250 million today, close to 2000 crore rupees.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.320
[Amit Varma]: The thing is, none of this money was actually invested in IRCs.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Our enterprising entrepreneur found it hard to get hold of IRCs bought in Europe and found

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.800
[Amit Varma]: no way to sell them in the US.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Also, the total number of international reply coupons available worldwide was a fraction

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.040
[Amit Varma]: of the number that the invested money would buy.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.080
[Amit Varma]: So the scheme clearly could not work.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560
[Amit Varma]: How did the whole enterprise work then?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Simple.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.240
[Amit Varma]: The securities exchange company basically paid out its investors from the money of later

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240
[Amit Varma]: investors.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.720
[Amit Varma]: Put simply, the first batch would be paid out by the money of the second batch, the

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.040
[Amit Varma]: second batch by the money of the third batch.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And as long as the investments kept increasing, as they did because of the high praise by

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.840
[Amit Varma]: earlier payouts, all would be well.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.280
[Amit Varma]: But at some point, this would have to end and the whole scheme would collapse, as this

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.880
[Amit Varma]: one did.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.520
[Amit Varma]: This sort of fraud, robbing Peter to pay Paul, goes back through the ages.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.440
[Amit Varma]: But in the popular imagination, they are now known by the name of this Italian immigrant

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.520
[Amit Varma]: who founded the securities exchange company, Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmi Tebaldo Ponzi,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:41.880
[Unknown]: Charles Ponzi.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, inspired by recent events at famous internet unicorn

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400
[Amit Varma]: OYO.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.640
[Amit Varma]: I decided to do an episode on Ponzi schemes with my good friend and frequent partner in

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.000
[Amit Varma]: crime Vivek Kaul.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.320
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to the discussion itself, some happy news for fans of either Vivek or

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320
[Amit Varma]: me.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.400
[Amit Varma]: Vivek and I have started a new economics podcast called economic funders, in which we take

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.080
[Amit Varma]: you through one economic concept per episode, explaining how it applies to everyday life.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.240
[Amit Varma]: The first episode of economic funders, for example, is about the sunk cost fallacy.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.840
[Amit Varma]: And we discuss the Vietnam War, bad marriages, and why you should not finish reading a book

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.880
[Amit Varma]: if you're hating it just because you started.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Economic funders is available exclusively on Storytel, the fantastic audio book platform

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.680
[Amit Varma]: that has supported the scene and the unseen in the past.

[Amit Varma]: But self promotion apart, there are plenty of great audio books available on Storytel,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.880
[Amit Varma]: including classics like Raag Darbari and Kashi Kasi.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.480
[Amit Varma]: The Hindi and Marathi collections are particularly awesome.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480
[Amit Varma]: The English collection is also great.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And now they have economic funders on there.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.680
[Amit Varma]: The first five episodes remember, please use this link to sign up Storytel.com slash funders.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And now before we begin our discussion, an actual short commercial break.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Hey, I want to thank Intel for supporting the scene and the unseen.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.360
[Amit Varma]: If you haven't already, I recommend you check out Intel vPro.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.560
[Amit Varma]: Intel vPro is a business platform that makes sure you have the best combination of hardware

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.900
[Amit Varma]: and software running.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.520
[Amit Varma]: It maximizes productivity and security.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Like I get so frustrated when I'm trying to open a large media file and it's taking forever.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.640
[Amit Varma]: It just does not happen with Intel vPro, which makes your computing experience as smooth

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.640
[Amit Varma]: as butter.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Please don't eat your laptop though.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.080
[Amit Varma]: I'll talk more about the different ways in which vPro increases your productivity in

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.200
[Amit Varma]: the coming weeks.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.680
[Amit Varma]: But today, I'd urge you to check out Intel's 8th generation vPro processor.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.520
[Amit Varma]: This processor is much faster on both mobile and PC platforms.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.880
[Amit Varma]: Hell, it's so fast, you won't be able to keep up with what you're doing.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Do hop on over to Intel.in slash vPro that is vPRO to learn how to make your productivity

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.920
[Amit Varma]: and your business's productivity go through the roof.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.920
[Guest]: Vivek, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920
[Guest]: Hi Amit.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.320
[Guest]: Thanks for having me.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, explain this OYO funda to me like their founder Ritesh Agarwal is apparently spending

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.040
[Amit Varma]: an enormous sum of money buying back shares of his own company.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.160
[Amit Varma]: What's happening and where did he get the money from?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.680
[Guest]: So basically, you know, I mean, I don't have any internal information.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.840
[Guest]: But from what I have read in the media, what he seems to be doing is, you know, he is offering

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.760
[Guest]: his shares as a collateral, raising money against those shares and buying new shares

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.240
[Guest]: and then offering those shares as a collateral, raising more money and buying even more new

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240
[Guest]: shares.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:08.040
[Guest]: So, you know, so if you know, if you look at it from what you just said, this seems

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.800
[Guest]: to have a structure of a Ponzi scheme and so which is where it is important to differentiate,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.960
[Guest]: you know, Ponzi schemes can be fraudulent and then there can be schemes which have a

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.520
[Guest]: structure of a Ponzi scheme, but the idea is not to defraud anyone.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.620
[Guest]: So in this case, obviously, you know, the idea is not to defraud anyone.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.560
[Guest]: But if you look at the overall structure of all these platform companies, they have a

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.280
[Guest]: very, very Ponzi structure.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.200
[Guest]: Now, why is that?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:46.080
[Guest]: That is simply because, you know, what they are aiming for is a monopoly in their line

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080
[Guest]: of business.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.120
[Guest]: Now, there's a concept called network externality, which basically means that, you know, with

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.840
[Guest]: every extra user on a particular network, the value of that network goes up.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.880
[Guest]: So to give you a, you know, a very, very simple example, Alexander Graham Bell invented the

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
[Guest]: telephone.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.040
[Guest]: Now, if only Mr. Graham Bell continued to have the telephone, it wouldn't have made

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
[Guest]: any sense.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.600
[Guest]: But let's say, you know, one more guy started having a telephone.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.400
[Guest]: So then Mr. Graham Bell could talk to that guy, then another guy, you know, had a telephone

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.400
[Guest]: and so on.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.720
[Guest]: So more the number of people, you know, who had a telephone, the more the value of the

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:32.280
[Guest]: telephone went up, or to give you a more contemporary example, all of us are, you know, there on

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.040
[Guest]: Facebook, because all of us are there on Facebook, right?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:43.240
[Guest]: We're not there on any other social media network of the kind that Facebook is.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.160
[Guest]: There were other networks of that kind, there was MySpace, there was Orkut, which was particularly,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.440
[Guest]: you know, very, very popular in India.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.880
[Guest]: But once Facebook sort of became the place to be in, everyone sort of moved to Facebook.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.040
[Guest]: Now, what happens here is now, how does it apply in Oyo's case?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.800
[Guest]: Now, Oyo is in the business of renting out hotel rooms, okay.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.280
[Guest]: So obviously, it needs hotels to list on the website.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.520
[Guest]: And it also needs people to come onto the website and book those rooms.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.800
[Guest]: Now, so basically supply and demand.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.600
[Guest]: Now, how does it create demand?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:29.400
[Guest]: It creates demand by offering discounts, so that people come in and book rooms on Oyo.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:36.080
[Guest]: So the more people who come on to Oyo to book rooms, the more, you know, hotels should be

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.760
[Guest]: interested in listing themselves on Oyo.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:47.440
[Guest]: And now, how do you get more people to sort of come on to the network is by offering huge

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.320
[Guest]: discounts.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: And what happens is that the discounts are so huge, and not just in case of Oyo, I mean,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.240
[Guest]: it works across any other, you know, platform company, you know, right from the way Uber

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:09.280
[Guest]: and Ola started to how Swiggy and Zomato are working right now, is, I mean, you offer large

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:16.600
[Guest]: discounts and because of that, you face what is known as high cash burn rate, okay.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:23.240
[Guest]: Now, this is just basically a jargon, which the platform guys use for, you know, for a

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.640
[Guest]: simple word of operating losses, I mean, you operate at a level where the price that you

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.200
[Guest]: sell your product at is not profitable.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.920
[Guest]: Now, in order to keep going, they need new money to keep coming in.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:42.520
[Guest]: And as long as the new money that keeps coming in is greater than the cash burn rate, the

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.360
[Guest]: company keeps operating.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.560
[Guest]: So which is why, you know, if you look at Oyo, given their international aspirations,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.560
[Guest]: they need a lot of money because, you know, how do you get people on to Oyo if you don't

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.320
[Guest]: offer discounts?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.320
[Guest]: So if you look at the structure, the structure is very similar to that of a Ponzi scheme

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.400
[Guest]: where the money being brought in by investors, as long as it is greater than the money going

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.480
[Guest]: out, which is basically the losses that the company is facing, the company keeps running.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:20.000
[Guest]: Now, the aim here is to become a monopoly in that particular area and then sort of make

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.940
[Guest]: all the money that you can, I mean, monopolies can simply make money by existing.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.920
[Guest]: So that is what every VC wants.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.160
[Guest]: That is what every leader of a platform company wants.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.560
[Guest]: Now, the thing is, it doesn't, you know, it happens, but it doesn't happen with all companies

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.640
[Guest]: and not all the time.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.160
[Guest]: So let's take the example of the search engine business.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest]: Now, you and I will remember that when the internet first came to India, there was nothing

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120
[Guest]: like Google.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.480
[Guest]: There was, you know, there was AltaVista, there was Yahoo, there was even something

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.760
[Guest]: called AskJeeves.com.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.080
[Guest]: And then Google came along in 2000 and gradually took over the entire business.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.040
[Guest]: And now the only search engine that, you know, most of the world uses is Google, unless you

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040
[Guest]: are in China.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.040
[Guest]: I mean, then that's a different story.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.560
[Guest]: So Google makes monopoly profits, same is the case with Amazon.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:21.480
[Guest]: So the way the entire platform business has evolved is, you know, is very, very Ponzi

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.240
[Guest]: in structure, because everyone wants to be a monopoly.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.680
[Amit Varma]: So I think in the course of your explanation, there are basically four separate kind of

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.240
[Amit Varma]: points that you're making, and I'd like to sort of break them up one by one.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.680
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, a standard Ponzi scheme, where you correctly point out that a Ponzi

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.480
[Amit Varma]: structure may not always be part of a fraud.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.560
[Amit Varma]: In this case, the structure that Ritesh Agarwal used to buy back his shares is like a Ponzi

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:55.600
[Amit Varma]: structure in the sense that he is first, you know, using his existing stake to buy a further

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.360
[Amit Varma]: stake and then using that to buy further and so on and so forth, which has a very Ponzi

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.360
[Amit Varma]: like feel to it.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come back to discussing Ponzi structures and frauds in the rest of this episode.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.760
[Amit Varma]: The second point is about network externalities, which, you know, is something that all networks

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760
[Amit Varma]: obviously.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I mean, that's how these big sites like Amazon and eBay and what OYO is attempting

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.000
[Amit Varma]: to do and Somato and so on, that's kind of how they function.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And there's nothing about it, which is not legit, it's standard, it's, you know, there's

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.600
[Amit Varma]: nothing per se, wrong with that logic, and I don't even know why it's Ponzi-like.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.600
[Amit Varma]: What you sort of refer to as Ponzi-like is, I think, and which I was going to ask you

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.160
[Amit Varma]: about separately anyway, is that the structure through which these guys get one round of

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.480
[Amit Varma]: investing and then another and then another, which is really the greater fool theory where

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.200
[Amit Varma]: everyone is investing.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And in some cases, you don't really care whether the business is viable at that stage or is

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.880
[Amit Varma]: ever going to be viable.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.480
[Amit Varma]: All you want is at a later stage of funding, you can sell your share and move on.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.920
[Guest]: So basically, all you want is that, you know, you put your money and then that money leads

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.640
[Guest]: to more monopoly.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And then that leads to a greater valuation and then you can eventually...

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.760
[Amit Varma]: So in fact, so a lot of the for example, Ritesh Agarwal's buyback of his shares is actually

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.200
[Amit Varma]: the people he's buying out are the early investors of the company.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.920
[Amit Varma]: So even if OYO eventually fails, those the early investors can all say that we made a

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.320
[Amit Varma]: wise choice because they actually sold at a profit, they invested something, they sold

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.200
[Amit Varma]: at a profit, maybe they sold to, you know, SoftBank or to Ritesh Agarwal himself, it

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.360
[Amit Varma]: Ritesh Agarwal, of course, he's getting the financing for this from Nomura, which has

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.720
[Amit Varma]: a heavy SoftBank investment.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And I find it sort of hard to comprehend how they can be a greater fool in the sense at

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.960
[Amit Varma]: this scale, there is no one SoftBank can sell these shares to, where is the cash out for

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.240
[Amit Varma]: them, unless they do an IPO at insane valuations and common investors.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.440
[Guest]: Which is what happened to Uber, I mean, if you look at Uber, Uber was being financed

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.800
[Guest]: by all these VCs.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
[Guest]: Including SoftBank.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
[Guest]: Including SoftBank.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: And now it's being financed by the shareholders.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.120
[Guest]: I mean, the losses in the last quarter were $5 billion.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120
[Amit Varma]: So...

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120
[Guest]: And the IPO got cancelled.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120
[Guest]: So...

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120
[Amit Varma]: The WeWork IPO went through.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120
[Amit Varma]: The WeWork IPO got cancelled.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120
[Guest]: Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.120
[Guest]: My bad.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120
[Unknown]: You're confusing.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.720
[Guest]: So Uber, in fact, even had a line in their prospectus, which said that we might never

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720
[Guest]: make money.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.720
[Amit Varma]: So, the fourth point that you raised that I kind of want to talk about is the monopolies

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720
[Amit Varma]: aspect.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, every business wants a monopoly, though the thing here is that a monopoly is

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.880
[Amit Varma]: only problematic when consumers suffer.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:53.000
[Amit Varma]: The argument I would make in the case of the seeming monopolies that Amazon and Google

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.880
[Amit Varma]: have built up is that, number one, they are monopolies only if you sort of consider what

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.480
[Amit Varma]: they are doing in a narrow way.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.620
[Amit Varma]: For example, Facebook is a monopoly in social media, yeah.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.200
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that they're not a monopoly when it comes to how do you spend your time

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.080
[Amit Varma]: or how you connect with others or how you communicate with others, where there is a

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080
[Amit Varma]: lot of competition.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.080
[Amit Varma]: So in that strict sense, they're not a monopoly.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.360
[Amit Varma]: Second, there are no barriers to entry.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.160
[Amit Varma]: Other people can and do enter all the time.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.760
[Amit Varma]: And even a seeming monopoly at a particular point in time, like Microsoft once, may be

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.720
[Amit Varma]: completely irrelevant a decade later.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.640
[Amit Varma]: And the third point is that as far as any of these so-called Internet monopolies are

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.720
[Amit Varma]: concerned, we are still getting extremely cheap prices from Amazon.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.640
[Amit Varma]: We are still getting Google search delivered to us free.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.760
[Amit Varma]: We are still, you know, not having to pay for Facebook.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.400
[Amit Varma]: So I don't really, I mean, first of all, I would object to the definition of those companies

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400
[Amit Varma]: as monopolies.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, I would say that, you know, there are no barriers to entry as such.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And as long as consumers don't suffer for it, like I hear a lot of alarmists talk about

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.680
[Amit Varma]: how that they will now spend VC money, they will build up a monopoly and after they have

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.120
[Amit Varma]: driven everyone out of the market, they will raise prices, and consumers will suffer.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.520
[Guest]: But the point is, no one actually in this, among these Internet companies actually raise

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.520
[Guest]: prices.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520
[Guest]: No, I don't agree on that.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.440
[Guest]: If you look at what is happening with Uber and Ola, and at least in the last one year,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.360
[Guest]: is that prices have gone up dramatically.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.960
[Guest]: And now it's reached a stage where, because they've managed to destroy, and I'm talking

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.480
[Guest]: about Mumbai here, not the other cities, because they've managed to destroy a large part of

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.040
[Guest]: the normal Kali Pili business, there is an overall shortage of cabs.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.040
[Guest]: So you get so earlier, what used to happen was the P cars used to start sometime in,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.040
[Guest]: you know, in the evening.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: Now there are, you know, prices are high, almost all through the day.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.160
[Guest]: So there are I mean, so there are issues, it's not as straightforward as I agree with

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160
[Guest]: you on Google.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, but my argument about Uber and Ola is that number one, they brought a necessary

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.280
[Amit Varma]: disruption and raise the supply and the supply is still higher.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, when I left home today, I didn't feel like driving, I was guaranteed

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.680
[Amit Varma]: an Uber, maybe I paid more for it than I would have liked to because of peak surcharge, but

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680
[Amit Varma]: fine.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And I could also have taken an auto but the point is the autos were there if I was in

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.000
[Amit Varma]: South Mumbai, I would also get the Kali Pili.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.800
[Amit Varma]: What has happened is that the supply has gone up the number of people who can rely on public

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.000
[Amit Varma]: transport has gone up massively like so many women tell me that they feel much safer because

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.560
[Amit Varma]: along with all the other options which still exist, they also have the relative safety

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.240
[Amit Varma]: of an Uber or an Ola.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they have added to the options and I won't be convinced that they've actually

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.400
[Amit Varma]: made the public transportation market worse till I actually see data on it.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Because my anecdotal experience sort of indicates that, you know, but anyway, I mean, that's

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.720
[Amit Varma]: another argument for another day, that's another argument for another day, we can agree to

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.180
[Amit Varma]: disagree and listeners can make up their own mind on that.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.400
[Amit Varma]: But all of this apart, I mean, what really struck me as a Ponzi element was that the

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.320
[Amit Varma]: fact that he is pledging his existing shares to buy more shares and then pledging those

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.120
[Amit Varma]: to you know, buy more shares and it's not really a scam because these are willing participants.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.840
[Amit Varma]: I think Nomura is giving him the money Nomura is also funded by SoftBank.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Basically, this seems to be like SoftBank fooling itself, which they are entirely entitled

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520
[Guest]: to do.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And even if they were fooling others, these are, you know, open transactions, they're

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.840
[Amit Varma]: not actually lying about it.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.720
[Amit Varma]: So it is perfectly fine.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.720
[Amit Varma]: However, Ponzi schemes typically in the way that we understand it outside of the structure

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.840
[Amit Varma]: typically frauds, tell me a little bit more about, you know, you co wrote a paper in 2003,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.400
[Amit Varma]: which I had the pleasure to read, you send it across to me.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:51.040
[Amit Varma]: And that had a whole bunch of sort of Indian examples of earlier Ponzi schemes.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.840
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about those.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:01.680
[Guest]: So, you know, it's, it's, I mean, Ponzi schemes have been in India for a very, very long time.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.200
[Guest]: And so I'll give you a few examples here.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:13.240
[Guest]: So one of the earliest, you know, guys who sort of became famous for running Ponzi schemes

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.960
[Guest]: was actually an employee of, he was a bus conductor called Ashok Sheregar.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.080
[Guest]: And he ran a number of Ponzi schemes in Mumbai, the famous ones being Vaibhavi Lakshmi, Money

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.620
[Guest]: Circulation Scheme, Golden Chain, Dhan Varsha, Kuber and Diamond Circle.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.640
[Guest]: And what he used to do was obviously he promised a high rate of return and the initial investors

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.960
[Guest]: were appointed as agents with a promise of 2% commission on their investment.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.600
[Guest]: And the commission was to be passed on when the agent brought in two or more investors.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.240
[Guest]: So the new investors were again appointed as agents.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.200
[Guest]: And so the cycle went on.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.120
[Guest]: Now, obviously, Sheregar did not have a business model or anything in place.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.760
[Guest]: He was just, you know, raising money and the money coming in from the latter investors

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.280
[Guest]: was being used to pay off the former ones.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.800
[Guest]: And obviously, as long as the money coming in was more than the money going out, the

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.400
[Guest]: schemes ran and then they collapsed.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:18.160
[Guest]: Now, in case of Sheregar, you know, it was a blatant Ponzi scheme where he did not have

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.420
[Guest]: even a semblance of a business model in place.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.320
[Guest]: But normally that is not the case.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.380
[Guest]: You know, all Ponzi schemes have, not all, but a lot of Ponzi schemes have some sort

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.560
[Guest]: of a business model in place, or at least they try to sort of show that they have a

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560
[Guest]: business model.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.440
[Amit Varma]: Even Charles Ponzi had that whole international reply coupons.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.120
[Guest]: So I don't know if you remember that, you know, in the 90s, there was this boom of plantation

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120
[Guest]: companies.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:55.120
[Guest]: And the most famous of the lot was this one called Anubhav Plantations run by a gentleman

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.120
[Guest]: called C. Natesan.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.200
[Guest]: Now in one of his schemes for a deposit of rupees 6000, the investor was promised a piece

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.200
[Guest]: of land measuring 300 square feet, with three teak saplings planted on it.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.360
[Guest]: Now, and this is a fairly elaborate, you know, business model.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.600
[Guest]: For 20 years, Anubhav would be the caretaker of the land and the trees.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.780
[Guest]: In the first six years, the investor would get rupees 1000 back every year.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.020
[Guest]: So at the end of, let's say, six years, his money that he had invested would already come

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.200
[Guest]: back to him.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.880
[Guest]: And a 1000 rupee return on a 6000 rupee investment is pretty high.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:38.160
[Guest]: I mean, it's almost 16-17% per year, I mean, that's not a bad return at all.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.920
[Guest]: Added amounts of rupees 6000 and 12000 would be returned to the investor at the end of

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.640
[Guest]: the sixth year and the twelfth year.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.000
[Guest]: When the scheme ended at the end of the 20th year, the investor got either rupees 3 lakhs

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.520
[Guest]: or 40 cubic feet of teak.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:58.120
[Guest]: Now, the assumption was that each of the three teak trees would yield a volume of 1.13 cubic

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.520
[Guest]: meters and each cubic meter of wood would be sold at rupees 88,286.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.320
[Guest]: Now, I mean, this assumption was unrealistic and it never worked.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.040
[Guest]: And obviously, what Natesan was doing was he was taking the money being brought in by

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.320
[Guest]: the older and newer investors and paying off the older investors.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.800
[Guest]: So a lot of these schemes have a great, I mean, what looks like a business model in

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.880
[Guest]: place.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.520
[Guest]: And this is something that has sort of, you know, gone on forever.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.960
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at some of the newer Ponzi schemes also, you know, a few years back,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.520
[Guest]: there was this scheme that came into light called the Stock Guru.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.920
[Guest]: So Stock Guru had a very simple business model.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:49.280
[Guest]: They promised returns as high as 20% per month on the basis of, you know, buying stocks at

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.280
[Guest]: a low price and selling them at a high price.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:58.280
[Guest]: But 20% return per month, obviously not possible and not possible, I mean, it may be possible

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.760
[Guest]: in an odd month here and there, but it's not something that you can guarantee.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.120
[Guest]: Now, obviously, what they were doing was, you know, moving money.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:13.000
[Guest]: And apparently, and, you know, after a point of time, the scheme collapsed.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.480
[Guest]: So yes, I mean, so most Ponzi schemes have a legitimate business model in place.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480
[Guest]: Also, you know...

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.400
[Guest]: As in they promise what appears to be a legitimate business model.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.020
[Guest]: Yeah, so it promises, it appears to be a genuine investment opportunity.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:36.520
[Guest]: So another great example here, and again, I mean, I'm using all these 90s examples,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.840
[Guest]: because, you know, when I wrote the paper, you know, we had only the 90s examples, right?

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.800
[Guest]: So this was written largely in, I think, 2002-2003.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: So I don't know how many people would remember, in some time in the late 1990s, there was

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.120
[Guest]: this company called Home Trade, which advertised extensively.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.680
[Guest]: They had Hrithik Roshan, Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.520
[Guest]: I mean, maybe it was not even late 90s, it was probably early 2000s, because Kahona Pyaar

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.880
[Guest]: Hai came only in the year 2000.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.360
[Guest]: So anyway, the dates here are, I mean, we can all Google the dates.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.440
[Guest]: So Home Trade essentially had a, again, you know, sort of a business model where they

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.000
[Guest]: took money from cooperative banks, based in Maharashtra, and a provident fund called the

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.600
[Guest]: Seaman's Provident Fund for investing in short dated government securities.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.160
[Guest]: So again, you know, some semblance of a business model.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.080
[Guest]: The problem was, in most cases, no investment was made.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:41.400
[Guest]: And when the investment was made, these securities were pledged as collateral to raise more money.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.760
[Guest]: And the money would then be diverted into stock market financing, where higher returns

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.520
[Guest]: could be earned, at least, you know, the hope was.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.520
[Guest]: Now, when a bank inquired about the securities, Home Trade would reply that the securities

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.920
[Guest]: had gone to RBI for clearance.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.560
[Guest]: I mean, during those days, things used to work manually.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.560
[Guest]: And doing this, Home Trade bought itself time of around six to eight weeks.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: On the date of maturity, you know, when the security had to be redeemed, Home Trade had

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.020
[Guest]: not invested, you know, or it had diverted money into the stock market.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.880
[Guest]: So what they would do is they would go to another cooperative bank, raise money from

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.720
[Guest]: them, and pay off the first one.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.080
[Guest]: And this is how the story went.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.400
[Guest]: And, you know, and we used to sort of wonder as to, you know, what had Sachin and Hrithik

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.160
[Guest]: and Shah Rukh got to do with the entire, you know, company, because nobody really understood

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.920
[Guest]: at least in the public domain as to what, you know, the company actually did.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:43.400
[Guest]: So it's just that these brand ambassadors provided that legitimacy to the company, you

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.360
[Guest]: know, and then people went in.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.960
[Guest]: So these ads were basically meant for all these cooperative banks to impress them.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.640
[Guest]: Hey, boss, you know, we are paying these guys.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.320
[Guest]: So you know, you can lend us the money.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:03.360
[Guest]: I mean, so the point here is that a lot of Ponzi schemes have big brand ambassadors.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.560
[Guest]: So the best example here is, and I mean, I hope both of us don't get sued, is that of

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.560
[Guest]: Sahara.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.160
[Guest]: Sahara used the Indian cricket team as their brand ambassador, I mean, for a very, very

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160
[Guest]: long time.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.200
[Guest]: I mean, they also sponsored the hockey team.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.560
[Guest]: Now, obviously, when a normal guy who is depositing money with Sahara, I mean, whatever, you know,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.320
[Guest]: the 50 rupees or the 100 rupees or whatever he, you know, deposits daily, he looks at

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.360
[Guest]: the fact that these guys are sponsoring the Indian cricket team.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.320
[Guest]: I mean, there is no bigger brand in India than the Indian cricket team, right, at least

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320
[Guest]: much through the 90s and the early 2000s.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.560
[Guest]: I mean, now we can debate because there are badminton stars and yeah, but I like cricketers

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.720
[Amit Varma]: are still the biggest guys, right?

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:55.240
[Guest]: So when you have the cricket team, sort of wearing the logo, wearing a company's logo,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.880
[Guest]: obviously, people, you know, will give it money very, very easily.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.200
[Guest]: Now, the problem was, Sahara also was in multiple businesses all over the place.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.360
[Guest]: But you know, whether these businesses were making money, no one really knew.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.760
[Guest]: The core business was chit funds, basically.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.640
[Guest]: But it wasn't, I mean, once upon a time, that is how they started.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640
[Guest]: What are chit funds?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
[Guest]: Are they Ponzi schemes?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640
[Guest]: No, they're not.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.880
[Guest]: So I'll explain what are chit funds.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.800
[Guest]: So chit funds are essentially, you know, you know, what kitty parties are, right?

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.200
[Guest]: Okay, so they're basically kitty parties with a twist.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
[Guest]: Okay.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.240
[Guest]: Now, what happens in a kitty party is that, you know, women come together, and they contribute

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.400
[Guest]: a given amount of money every month.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:46.640
[Guest]: And then a chit is sort of, you know, selected, and, you know, the name, you know, who are

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.560
[Guest]: the woman is whose name is on the on the chit gets all the money contributed in that month.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:31:00.040
[Guest]: So let's say, there are 12 women, and they get 10 bucks each, 5000, 10 bucks, an illustration

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:08.360
[Guest]: of example, so there are, let's say, 12 women, and they give a lakh each 5000, 5000, so 5000,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.120
[Guest]: and they meet once a month.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.520
[Guest]: So when they pool the money together, it works out to a total of 60,000 rupees, 12 names

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.440
[Guest]: are written on a chit on sheets of paper from these chits, one chit is drawn, and the woman

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.880
[Guest]: whose name is on the chit gets the rupees 60,000.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.400
[Guest]: Okay, as simple as that.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.160
[Guest]: Now, when they meet next month, 11 months, 11 names are written on the chits, one name

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:35.040
[Guest]: is drawn, and that woman gets the money, then when they meet again, then 10 names are written,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040
[Guest]: and so the cycle works.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.400
[Guest]: So, so eventually, you know, there is one woman left who in the last month gets the

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.800
[Guest]: 60,000 rupees.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: So basically, what is happening here is that, you know, every month by putting in 5000 rupees

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.440
[Guest]: every month, you get 60,000 bucks at one go, and you can then do something substantial

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.440
[Guest]: with it, right?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.640
[Guest]: Now, of course, the problem here is that, you know, some women might drop out, some

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.400
[Guest]: may not be able to pay.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.320
[Guest]: So someone who's already got the money may not pay.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.880
[Guest]: So I mean, there's nothing, you know, that stops people from doing it.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.480
[Guest]: Now, a chit fund actually works slightly differently.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.320
[Guest]: Now, again, let's assume that there are 12 women, and they contribute 5000.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:21.440
[Guest]: So this means a total of 60,000 has been collected every month.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.880
[Guest]: Then what happens is that the amount that is collected is auctioned to the 12 members

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.280
[Guest]: after a minimum discount has been set.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.640
[Guest]: Now, what does that mean?

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.640
[Guest]: So let's say the minimum discount is 5000 rupees.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.920
[Guest]: This means that the maximum amount any woman can get from the total rupees 60,000 collected

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.840
[Guest]: is rupees 55,000, okay?

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.760
[Guest]: After these discount bids are invited, all the women bid.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.380
[Guest]: Now, let's say one woman bids a discount of rupees 12,000.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.040
[Guest]: So this is the highest discount that has been bid and hence she gets the money.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.320
[Guest]: So since the agreed on discount is 12,000, she would get rupees 48,000.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.520
[Guest]: But then there are some, you know, other organizing charges, etc, etc.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.040
[Guest]: So typically, she would get something like a 45,000 rupees.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:14.500
[Guest]: Okay, now, the discount of 12,000 is basically the profit that the group as a whole has made.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.320
[Guest]: And then it's divided, you know, 12,000 divided by 12.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.480
[Guest]: So 1000 rupees goes to every member.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:28.200
[Guest]: So now, of course, the woman who got the 45,000 rupees will now keep contributing, you know,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.280
[Guest]: 5000 rupees every month for the remaining 11 months and in every month, there will be

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:40.840
[Guest]: a sort of an auction and the woman who sort of offers the maximum discount will get the

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840
[Guest]: money.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.800
[Guest]: So this is how a chit fund is supposed to work.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.880
[Guest]: So chit funds are not Ponzi schemes.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:54.720
[Guest]: But what happens is, a lot of people who because chit funds are in the imagination of people.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:00.920
[Guest]: So a lot of people who run Ponzi schemes, call their investment schemes as chit funds.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.240
[Guest]: So which is why chit funds have got a bad name.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.480
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at a state like, you know, what used to be erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.120
[Guest]: now is Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, there are lots of big chit funds that are run in

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.040
[Guest]: that state and they have been around for a while now.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:25.120
[Guest]: So in a way, you know, a lot of Ponzi schemes have spoiled the, the name of chit funds.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.440
[Guest]: So, so it's not all chit funds are not Ponzi schemes.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.640
[Guest]: But Ponzi schemes are run in the name of running a chit fund very often.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.440
[Guest]: And so chit funds are basically kitty parties, which gives us a great promotional code for

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.340
[Guest]: the quote for the episode.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.080
[Amit Varma]: What also interests me is the point noting like while prepping for this episode, I read

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.720
[Amit Varma]: this biography of Charles Ponzi called Ponzi scheme by Mitchell Zukov, which you also read.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And excellent book, which I would recommend and which also has one interesting element

00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.080
[Amit Varma]: of every Ponzi scheme, which is that once people get there, once the first batch of

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.680
[Amit Varma]: investors when they get their interest for the first time, number one, what they tend

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.360
[Amit Varma]: to do is they tend to reinvest it immediately, because they are obviously greedy.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.920
[Amit Varma]: So you don't even have to pay out the entire batch of first investors.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.360
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, once they actually get the money, like you've put 100 bucks and got 150 bucks

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: in 45 days, you become a hardcore evangelist for the company, you tell all your friends,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.760
[Amit Varma]: you tell your relatives, you sell your house and put that money in.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.480
[Amit Varma]: And it's just one thing upon another, which is, you know, and towards the end of this

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.680
[Amit Varma]: episode, we'll kind of discuss human nature also and why we as a species are particularly

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.720
[Amit Varma]: prone to such frauds.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, other animals eat, you know, the fellow members of the species, but they don't cheat

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.080
[Amit Varma]: them in this way.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:50.400
[Amit Varma]: And one angle I'd also like you to expand upon is a multilevel marketing, the MLM angle.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.440
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, one of the things that you mentioned, which was true of Ponzi also,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.820
[Amit Varma]: which is true of say, Sharagar, what you were saying, is that he turned his early investors

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.640
[Guest]: into agents.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.960
[Amit Varma]: And then those agents got a commission, and they had more sub agents.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And that sounds very much to me like a multilevel marketing.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Guest]: So multilevel marketing now, in case of Ashok Sharagar, he was just getting agents.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.960
[Guest]: Now, if let's say he had a product attached to the entire thing, let's say, you know,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.420
[Guest]: every agent had to sell a bar of soap for 100 bucks, something, you know, some special

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.420
[Guest]: bar of soap.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.880
[Guest]: Now, that would have given him a legitimate purpose, right?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.700
[Guest]: So if you look at a lot of multilevel marketing schemes, I mean, even though they sort of

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:35.720
[Guest]: come attached with a product which needs to be sold, the money actually is made in getting

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: more and more members.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.520
[Guest]: Even those, you know, if you look at even, you know, I mean, legitimate MLM schemes,

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.800
[Guest]: you know, the money is basically made by getting more and more members and then selling them

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.600
[Guest]: those products, right?

00:36:52.600 --> 00:37:03.160
[Guest]: Now, the problem here is that if you do not enter the MLM scheme at a higher level, and

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:09.200
[Guest]: if you enter it at a lower level, I mean, by then it's too late to make any money irrespective

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.560
[Guest]: of whether you're in a legitimate scheme or you're in an illegitimate scheme.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:20.200
[Guest]: Now, you know, if you're in an illegitimate MLM, if you're in what is an outer Ponzi scheme,

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.200
[Guest]: I mean, you need to take into account the level that you're entering it at, but then

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200
[Guest]: how do you figure that out?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.880
[Guest]: There is no way of doing that, right?

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.640
[Guest]: So the point I'm trying to make here is that if a Ponzi scheme becomes too big, it collapses

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.880
[Guest]: under its own weight, okay?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.800
[Guest]: So let me just give you a very simple example here.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.280
[Guest]: Let's say someone starts a Ponzi scheme, okay?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.040
[Guest]: He gets 100 members and each member is supposed to contribute 10,000 rupees and is promised

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.840
[Guest]: a return of 50,000 rupees at the end of one year, okay?

00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:01.840
[Guest]: Now, if every investor who's promised, I mean, if the guy sort of doesn't want to run away

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.120
[Guest]: with the money at the very beginning and wants to sort of be in business at the end of one

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120
[Guest]: year.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:15.920
[Guest]: So every investor who's paid 10,000 needs to be paid 50,000 rupees, okay?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.280
[Guest]: Now so for every investor who has to be paid off, the guy needs five new investors to come

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280
[Guest]: in.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.160
[Guest]: So for five new investors, he needs 500 investors, okay?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.960
[Guest]: Because then the money will balance itself out.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.960
[Guest]: Now let's say at the end of second year, he wants to continue going again.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.960
[Guest]: So for 500 investors, he needs 2,500 investors.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.600
[Guest]: Then for 2,500, he needs 12,500.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.160
[Guest]: Now by the time you reach the ninth level, the number goes up to something like 19.6

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.000
[Guest]: crore or some very big number, right?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.800
[Guest]: So that is not, I mean, you know, to get so many people involved is simply not possible.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.440
[Guest]: So which is why, you know, eventually all Ponzi schemes collapse under their own weight.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.360
[Guest]: And which is why even in an MLM scheme, if you are even in a legitimate MLM scheme, where

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.400
[Guest]: you actually make money by selling products, if you're entering it like too late, there

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.680
[Guest]: is no way you can, you can only buy products beyond a point everyone else around you would

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.720
[Guest]: already be an agent, and they would already be buying products of the company, which is

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.640
[Guest]: something which happened to Amway in a very big way, you know, people who entered it in

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.400
[Guest]: the early stages made a lot of money, but by, you know, by the time it actually picked

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.840
[Guest]: up and the general janta got in, you know, you had some five Amway agents.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, both of us are old enough to remember a time where, you know, the biggest pest in

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.320
[Guest]: your social circle was the Amway agent, because he would be freaking desperate, because he's

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.360
[Amit Varma]: at the bottom of the scale, he has no way of making money, he's invested tons of money

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.760
[Amit Varma]: into this shit.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And it's like you meet them in parties, you meet them at kitty parties.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.520
[Guest]: I mean, they used to have these parties, they used to organize kitty parties too.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.840
[Guest]: In fact, the other point that you know, talking of Amway, it reminds me, so if you look at

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.180
[Guest]: these MLM companies, I mean, legitimate and illegitimate, they organize these meetings

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.920
[Guest]: where they get their star, sort of, you know, early investors who've made a lot of money,

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.360
[Guest]: and then these guys come and give these motivational talks.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.740
[Guest]: And you know, then everyone starts to feel no, you know, we can also do it.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.980
[Guest]: But then it's not about, you know, there was nothing that they did, they just happened

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.560
[Guest]: to be at the right place, at the right time and entered the scheme at the right level.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it was as simple as that, you know, and they might even drink their own Koolaid

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.160
[Amit Varma]: and they might even think this is a fantastic idea and that they've made so much money like

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.520
[Amit Varma]: one of the interesting things I learned about Charles Ponzi was that at one point in time,

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.280
[Amit Varma]: he had $7 million in the bank, and he could just have taken his family and gone back to

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Italy.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280
[Amit Varma]: He wasn't even an American citizen.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.400
[Amit Varma]: He was still an Italian citizen and could just have left and gone back to Italy.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:58.040
[Amit Varma]: But he stayed on because he was actually of the belief that he would come out of this

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.360
[Guest]: okay at the end, he managed to convince himself.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:06.080
[Guest]: So he had, I mean, the number that I remember writing in the paper, he had 40,000 investors

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.280
[Guest]: who had invested $15 million at the peak of the scheme.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the figure that I've read somewhere is at the peak, it was about 20 million, which

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.720
[Amit Varma]: would be 250 in current terms, but whatever it was, it was a ton of money and and a lot

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.800
[Amit Varma]: of it actually went into paying back the earlier investors and all that.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.600
[Amit Varma]: But at one point in time, he had 7 million free lying around and he could just have fled

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.960
[Amit Varma]: and he chose not to flee.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.600
[Amit Varma]: And eventually, of course, he spent two jail terms of five years and I think seven to nine

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.240
[Amit Varma]: years respectively, and then he was deported because he wasn't an American citizen.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:44.760
[Guest]: And he died alone in a welfare hospital in Rio de Janeiro of all places in 1944 or something

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.120
[Guest]: 4949.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.080
[Amit Varma]: And his wife also left him in all this and lived to a ripe old age.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.640
[Guest]: In fact, he tried running more Ponzi schemes later in his life.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Oh, really?

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.640
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.640
[Guest]: I didn't read about that.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.160
[Guest]: I mean, something to do with land in Florida, from what I remember reading, yeah, that that

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.280
[Amit Varma]: was in fact, after his first jail term, when he came out before the second jail term, he

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.960
[Amit Varma]: tried to do something with land in Florida, which again fell apart because he couldn't

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.960
[Amit Varma]: raise funds.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, it might actually have worked.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.320
[Amit Varma]: But it's not unlikely that a man with so many jail sentences before is unable, which is

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.800
[Guest]: why he went from Boston to Florida.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.480
[Unknown]: I mean, those days.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it wasn't, you know, like separate countries are mostly, mostly like separate

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800
[Amit Varma]: countries.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.040
[Amit Varma]: So fascinating stuff.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.200
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, Ponzi schemes is not just something that happens at the unsophisticated

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.880
[Amit Varma]: level of housewives who are buying Amway products or whatever, they're very sophisticated.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And we've seen this.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they continue to the present day.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.680
[Amit Varma]: And we've seen this most recently in the case of the multi billion dollar Ponzi scheme run

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.680
[Amit Varma]: by Bernie Madoff.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.960
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about that.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:57.320
[Guest]: So Bernie Madoff was this guy who, you know, every rich American wanted to invest with,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:04.400
[Guest]: because he gave stable returns, he never lost money, and he was Jewish.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:10.120
[Guest]: So that that helps now, but what he was doing all along was basically rotating money.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:15.980
[Guest]: And when the financial crisis stuck, it just became very, very difficult to continue rotating

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.880
[Guest]: money because prices of everything sort of fell.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.060
[Guest]: But even then, his scheme sort of showed a positive rate of return, you know, when everything

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.000
[Guest]: else was crashing and hedge funds were sort of shutting down a dozen.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.120
[Guest]: And but ultimately, you know, he just got fed up of it and, and, you know, went and

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:41.320
[Guest]: told the authorities that this is what I've been up to and, you know, and obviously, you

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.360
[Guest]: know, justice got done and he was put in jail and so on and so forth.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.840
[Guest]: But the interesting thing here is that, you know, no one caught on to it for so many years,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.160
[Guest]: it was, you know, if he had, if he had managed to sort of write that brief period when the

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:01.080
[Guest]: financial crisis stuck, he would probably have continued, you know, even now.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.600
[Amit Varma]: So there's a very nice book called Anatomy of a Ponzi scheme by Colleen Cross.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.600
[Amit Varma]: And in that she looks at a whole bunch of Ponzi schemes.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.040
[Amit Varma]: And if I remember correctly, half of the biggest 10 of all time, fell apart because of the

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040
[Amit Varma]: 2008 crisis.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.880
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, like Madoff scheme, no one had, which is the biggest, I think, at about 65

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880
[Amit Varma]: billion.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.120
[Amit Varma]: No one had actually noticed this was a Ponzi scheme, it was a respected investment fund

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.960
[Amit Varma]: or hedge fund in different cases, and you kind of put your money there, they're giving

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.600
[Amit Varma]: you stable returns, it seems to be, you know, they just seem to be good investors, nothing

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600
[Amit Varma]: else.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.160
[Amit Varma]: But the 2008 crisis meant that, you know, there was a liquidity crunch among investors,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.880
[Amit Varma]: too many investors asked to take their money back.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:47.360
[Guest]: And, you know, the scam fell apart just out of the country running it.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:54.640
[Guest]: So yeah, which is so even even closer to home, I mean, I mean, they were West Bengal in the

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.240
[Guest]: last decade has had their fair share of Ponzi schemes.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.120
[Guest]: And I remember one of my father's friends, you know, called when when when when I think

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.560
[Guest]: Sarada was the scheme which went bust, he called up and said, Hey, you know, I lost

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560
[Guest]: so much money.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.640
[Guest]: And it's not like, you know, only the uneducated lot, even the educated lot puts money into

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.320
[Guest]: these schemes, and then they lose.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:23.680
[Guest]: So in fact, the Sarada case is also very interesting that they really cashed in on the celebrity

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.880
[Guest]: part of the Ponzi scheme to make themselves, you know, sound legitimate.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.520
[Guest]: So I just like to sort of read out something here.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:41.440
[Guest]: So Sarada, you know, was run by a gentleman called Sudipta Sen, okay, Sudipta Sen, Sudipta

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440
[Guest]: Sen.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:49.240
[Guest]: Okay, if you were to pronounce it in the proper Bengali way, Sudipta Sen, okay.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:53.440
[Guest]: So Sudipta Sen ensured that the Sarada group had huge presence in the media.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.200
[Guest]: I'm quoting the business standard here, which says his first entry into the space was through

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.440
[Guest]: Channel 10.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.360
[Guest]: And thereafter, he expanded into Dailies, The Bengal Post, if you remember that newspaper,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.880
[Guest]: and Sakaalvela, which obviously means the afternoon.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.040
[Guest]: In 2010, Sen bought out Tara Channels as well.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.580
[Guest]: At the time of closing down, the group had 10 media outfits, news TV channels, newspapers

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.580
[Guest]: and magazines.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.600
[Guest]: Now, this gave a lot of credibility and helped building the brand.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:27.080
[Guest]: The cine actor Mithun Chakraborty was the brand ambassador for Channel 10.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.800
[Guest]: The Trinamool party was also seen being close to the group.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:37.440
[Guest]: Now, this is again a Sarada agent called Reba Mitra, you know, telling NDTV.com when the

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.760
[Guest]: scam sort of came to the fore.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.680
[Guest]: We put our faith in Sarada because big leaders of the Trinamool like Madan Mitra, Didi, the

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:52.120
[Guest]: Chief Minister, Kunal Ghosh, Shatabdi Roy, Mithun Chakraborty, when these big people

00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:06.880
[Guest]: are with them, government people, then would this money be stolen from us?

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:14.000
[Guest]: Now, I mean, this is a very, you know, this is how the entire scheme got its legitimacy.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.120
[Guest]: And you know, the interesting thing is the, the kind of returns that all these schemes,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120
[Guest]: you know, offer.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:28.480
[Guest]: Sarada was offering returns of anywhere between 17.5 to 22%, so, which is something that sort

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.240
[Guest]: of, you know, attracted a lot of people to, you know, put money there.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.720
[Guest]: You know, another interesting scheme that, you know, I would like to talk about, and

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.800
[Guest]: this is also a recent one, is called PACL.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800
[Guest]: Okay.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:48.240
[Guest]: Now, this was big in and around, you know, Delhi and North India until, you know, the

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.000
[Guest]: Securities Exchange Board of India cracked down on it, and the scheme had managed to

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.440
[Guest]: sort of, you know, raise as much as 50,000 crore from people.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.920
[Guest]: Now, they also had, you know, their business model was very interesting, so-called, not

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.640
[Guest]: the, I mean, there was no business model actually.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.840
[Guest]: So it told people that they were actually buying rights to a plot of land when they

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.480
[Guest]: deposited money with the company.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.440
[Guest]: Now, when they wanted the money back, the company would sell the land, but apart from

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.880
[Guest]: this underlying fiction, it worked very much like you could walk in and deposit money for

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.880
[Unknown]: a high return.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880
[Guest]: Okay.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.120
[Guest]: Now, obviously, there was, you know, they were not selling and buying land and all that,

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.760
[Guest]: they were just rotating money.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.440
[Guest]: So this was one of the, you know, the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent times.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:43.480
[Guest]: And what happens is, you know, when these fraudsters get caught, you hear a lot of news

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.240
[Guest]: and then everything fizzles out.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.200
[Guest]: So we never really come to know as to whether these guys were convicted, what happened to

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.200
[Guest]: them?

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.440
[Guest]: Did people get their money back?

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.400
[Guest]: I mean, all this news never reaches us.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.580
[Guest]: And these schemes, you know, continue in one avatar or the other, I mean, there was one

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:09.800
[Guest]: in Bangalore, which recently sort of, you know, came out, that was also associated with

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800
[Amit Varma]: real estate.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.320
[Amit Varma]: No, in abroad, I think the standards is that when Ponzi schemes get uncovered, then all

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:21.400
[Amit Varma]: of those early investors, they have to give up that whatever return that they got on it,

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.120
[Amit Varma]: and that goes into a central pool.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.520
[Amit Varma]: And then the overall pool of investors are paid from that in a pro rata way.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.560
[Amit Varma]: So you do actually end up getting some of your money back, like in the original, like

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:39.280
[Amit Varma]: in the Charles Ponzi scheme, for example, I think people got about 27 out of every hundred

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:47.760
[Amit Varma]: dollars I haven't heard of anything in India, of course, in what's also interesting in India

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:54.000
[Amit Varma]: is that all the examples we've discussed are Ponzi schemes done by private parties, where

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.440
[Amit Varma]: it is willing individuals who even if they are fooled, at least voluntarily part with

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:05.580
[Amit Varma]: their hard earned money, even if they're fooled on false premises, and obviously the organizers

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.800
[Amit Varma]: of those fraud should go to jail.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.200
[Amit Varma]: But after the break, we are going to talk about government run Ponzi schemes, which

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:19.800
[Amit Varma]: are run at a far larger scale, and aware of the people who are actually losing money,

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.480
[Amit Varma]: have that money taken from them without their consent.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.800
[Amit Varma]: And in some cases, they aren't even born yet.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.160
[Amit Varma]: These are Ponzi schemes of which the victims are future generations yet to come after a

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:40.160
[Unknown]: short commercial break.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:51:07.260

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get on with your show.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.420
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen. I'm chatting with my friend Vivek Kaul about

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:24.460
[Amit Varma]: one of his favorite subjects, Ponzi schemes. And I said before the break that we'll talk

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.820
[Amit Varma]: about Ponzi schemes run by the government of which we are the unwilling victims. But

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:36.020
[Amit Varma]: before we do that, Vivek has some other entertaining examples of private Ponzi schemes, which he

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.420
[Amit Varma]: would like to tell us about.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:44.300
[Guest]: Okay, so you know, one of the in the state of Tamil Nadu, some enterprising entrepreneurs

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:50.180
[Guest]: ran a Ponzi scheme around the emu bird, where, you know, you invest money and this entrepreneur

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.140
[Guest]: would rear these birds and when they were sufficiently big, he would sell meat, their

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.140
[Guest]: oil etc.

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.900
[Guest]: He'd give you, you know, whatever money that you're interested in.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.900
[Guest]: Ponzi scheme around cows.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.740
[Guest]: Don't go there. So, so this was one interesting scheme that I remember. Another interesting

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:13.980
[Guest]: scheme was something called Speak Asia. I mean, a lot of people would remember it. Now,

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.460
[Guest]: so basically, Speak Asia had a very, again, it had a business model. And the model was

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:24.180
[Guest]: that in order to become a member of Speak Asia, you had to invest 11,000 rupees. The

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:29.060
[Guest]: investment was for subscribing to the electronic magazine issued by the company called Surveys

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.060
[Guest]: Today.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:36.020
[Guest]: Now, this allowed the member to participate in two online surveys every week and make

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.380
[Guest]: rupees 500 per survey or rupees 1000 per week. This when converted into an yearly number

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:47.100
[Guest]: came to 52,000 rupees. So the an investment of 11,000 rupees gave you 52,000 at the end

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:54.580
[Guest]: of the year. So which is a return of 373% in one year, not bad at all. Now, obviously,

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:59.100
[Guest]: you know, there were no surveys or even if they were, they were, they were not as many

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.540
[Guest]: as were required to sort of generate the return that the company had promised. So ultimately,

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.820
[Guest]: the scheme collapsed. Now, in my particular case, you know, the reason I remember this

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:14.620
[Guest]: very well is that at that particular point of time, I used to work for a weekly personal

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:20.340
[Guest]: finance newspaper. And Speak Asia had a half page ad in it. So you know, imagine a Ponzi

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:25.180
[Guest]: scheme being advertised in a personal finance newspaper. I mean, Speak Asia had ads all

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:31.460
[Guest]: over the place. Yeah, it wasn't just just that, just that newspaper, the ads were published

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:38.420
[Guest]: in but including that newspaper. So another interesting scheme that I remember is is was

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:45.700
[Guest]: a Russian Ponzi scheme called MMM, which finally came to India as well. And they you know,

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:52.060
[Guest]: where they were the most blatant of the lot in the sense that they offered to grow an

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:59.580
[Guest]: initial investment of rupees 5000 to rupees 3.4 crore at the end of I mean, and there

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:04.740
[Guest]: were some and when I wrote pieces against that Ponzi scheme, there were people who got

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:10.100
[Guest]: back to me in order to tell me that, you know, I didn't understand the business model. So

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:14.460
[Guest]: it happens every time, you know, this is a standard response when you write on a Ponzi

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:19.340
[Guest]: scheme, people write back to you that, you know, you don't know anything about this.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:27.180
[Guest]: So you should shut up and keep your theory with you, because we are actually making money.

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.900
[Guest]: And that's the best part, you know, as we discussed, the initial guys always make money

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:36.620
[Guest]: and then they become, you know, evangelists for the company and go around telling people

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.140
[Guest]: that boss, I have made money, this is safe. And you know, you can also invest in it.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:45.180
[Amit Varma]: But in this case, who's going to put 5000 and actually make 3 point whatever crores

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.100
[Unknown]: at the end of the year, how many more suckers do you need for that?

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.980
[Guest]: People did fall for it initially.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.300
[Amit Varma]: In the case of the government, of course, there's no falling for it, because we are

00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:03.540
[Amit Varma]: willy nilly entrapped into it by way of being taxpayers and which matter, we do not have

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.540
[Amit Varma]: a choice.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:08.220
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit like, you know, earlier before this, when we were having breakfast at the

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:12.460
[Amit Varma]: most excellent car social, we had Sid's very posh breakfast with ham and cheese omelette.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.500
[Amit Varma]: And over there, you when I mentioned to you that, when I was speaking about how America's

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:21.820
[Amit Varma]: social security is a Ponzi scheme, you said why India's also expand a bit.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:29.180
[Guest]: So basically, you know, if many of us invest in small savings schemes run by the post office,

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:35.220
[Guest]: this includes everything from, you know, the post office accounts to post office monthly

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.660
[Guest]: income scheme to public provident fund and so on so forth.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.180
[Guest]: Now, the way it works is very, very interesting.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:49.860
[Guest]: So all this money essentially is collected, and it comes under the National Small Savings

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.980
[Guest]: Fund.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:59.380
[Guest]: And what happens is, so let's say, in a given year, 1,50,000 crore is the money coming into

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.380
[Guest]: these schemes.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.380
[Guest]: Okay.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:07.940
[Guest]: And in that year, if 50,000 crore is to be redeemed, then 50,000 crore is taken from

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.280
[Guest]: that 1,50,000 crore and redeemed.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:17.940
[Guest]: And the remaining 1,00,000 crore is a revenue in the annual budget of the Indian government.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.940
[Guest]: Okay.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:25.420
[Guest]: So, so what is happening here is as long as the money that keeps coming into these schemes

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.900
[Guest]: is higher than the money that needs to be paid off to the investors whose investment

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:35.220
[Guest]: is maturing, you know, the scheme will keep running.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:43.300
[Guest]: So it has a structure of a Ponzi scheme wherein new money is being used to pay off the investment

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.940
[Amit Varma]: that is being redeemed.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.060
[Amit Varma]: My impression was that whatever you sort of deposit is invested by them into something

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.020
[Amit Varma]: else and they get a rate of return there and that is a basis.

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:57.220
[Guest]: No, so what happens is the money is first repaid and then the remaining money, the National

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.300
[Guest]: Small Savings Fund is invested into various things.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:06.460
[Guest]: But then what if you know what it is invested in, you will not, you know, it will screw

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.740
[Guest]: you up even further.

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:14.620
[Guest]: So the NSS of money right now, a lot of it is has been lent to the Food Corporation of

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.620
[Guest]: India.

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.620
[Guest]: Okay.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.380
[Guest]: Because what happens is now, so Food Corporation of India buys, and this is something we've

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:26.700
[Guest]: discussed before, buys rice and wheat primarily directly from the farmers.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.180
[Guest]: Of late it's also bought pulses and oilseeds.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:35.460
[Guest]: Now it buys rice and wheat at a certain rate, but it sells them at a very, very low rate

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:41.580
[Guest]: through the public distribution system, through the ration shops in order to fulfill the terms

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.260
[Guest]: and conditions under the Food Securities Act.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:50.900
[Guest]: So obviously the difference is huge and this difference has to be refunded to the Food

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:56.540
[Guest]: Corporation of India because otherwise, you know, the institution will collapse.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.540
[Guest]: And so what happens is that in every budget, the government has allocations towards food

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:06.660
[Guest]: subsidy and a lot of this food subsidy allocation goes to compensate the Food Corporation of

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.060
[Guest]: India.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:14.380
[Guest]: But in the recent years, what has happened is that the Food Corporation of India is not

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.660
[Guest]: being refunded totally.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:24.020
[Guest]: So as of March 2019, the money that the government owed the Food Corporation of India was more

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.340
[Guest]: than 1,60,000 crore.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:31.820
[Guest]: Now if this is the case, you know, so if the government is not repaying the Food Corporation

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:36.580
[Guest]: of India, the Food Corporation of India has to borrow that money from somewhere in order

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.700
[Guest]: to continue to be in business.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:44.580
[Guest]: So of the 1,60,000 crore, close to more than 90,000 crore, I think 94,000 crore, if I remember

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:49.380
[Guest]: the number correctly, has been borrowed from the National Small Savings Fund.

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:54.220
[Guest]: Now why has it been borrowed from the National Small Savings Fund is because if they were

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.460
[Guest]: to sort of borrow that money, you know, from the normal banking channels, then they would

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:05.580
[Guest]: crowd out the private borrowers and then interest rates would go up even further.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.780
[Guest]: So it's a huge, huge mess.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:14.220
[Guest]: I mean, if you start digging into the accounts of the government, it's just bizarre beyond

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.740
[Guest]: a point.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.820
[Guest]: So this is a I mean, so this is one example, this is one example of how a Ponzi schemes

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.260
[Guest]: being run within the government.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:31.220
[Guest]: The other thing is, as we talked about the entire idea of a fiscal deficit of a perpetual

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:39.340
[Guest]: fiscal deficit is nothing but a Ponzi scheme, I mean, if you if you look at it, now, I mean,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:45.940
[Guest]: any government, most governments across, you know, across the world, and this includes

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:51.300
[Guest]: central and state governments, run a fiscal deficit, which basically means they don't

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.340
[Guest]: earn as much as they spend.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:01:01.740
[Guest]: Now, in order to finance that fiscal deficit, they need to borrow money, okay, and they

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.300
[Guest]: borrow money.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.060
[Guest]: And this fiscal deficit continues.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:15.860
[Guest]: So basically, what is happening here is that at any given point of time, if the money that

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:21.820
[Guest]: has been borrowed by the government has to be repaid, how is it being repaid?

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.580
[Guest]: It is being repaid by borrowing more money, okay.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:31.140
[Guest]: Now, how does the government borrow money, it borrows money by selling government securities,

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.140
[Guest]: right.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:37.300
[Guest]: So these securities are sold, and the money comes in and it is used to pay off the government

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.020
[Guest]: securities which are maturing.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:44.940
[Guest]: Okay, now these new securities when their time to you know, comes when they are to mature,

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:50.940
[Guest]: then the government borrows more money and repays this.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:56.380
[Guest]: And so the so the structure goes now, the thing here is this can only happen if the

01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:01.700
[Guest]: government is borrowing money in its own currency.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.700
[Guest]: Okay.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:09.420
[Guest]: Now, if you look at a lot of South American countries, they end up borrowing in dollars.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:13.740
[Guest]: Because you know, borrowing in dollar is cheaper than borrowing in your local currency.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.060
[Guest]: But the problem there is then, in order to repay those dollars, you need to earn those

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.660
[Guest]: dollars as well.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:24.020
[Guest]: And in many cases, they don't have they are unable to earn those dollars.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.700
[Guest]: And then finally, they just default.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.540
[Guest]: So which is not going to happen in the Indian case, because the Indian government at least

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.940
[Guest]: up until now borrows majorly in rupees.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:44.500
[Amit Varma]: And also apart from further borrowings, I suppose how they services debts is also of

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.820
[Amit Varma]: future taxpayers.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:49.600
[Amit Varma]: So one way of doing that is the two ways of doing that one is that either you raise tax

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:55.340
[Amit Varma]: taxes in the future, which means future taxpayers are paying for your profligacy today, or you

01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:00.060
[Amit Varma]: can simply print money which leads to inflation, which is of course a tax on the poor.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:04.720
[Amit Varma]: And it's a future poor, who are therefore paying for your profligacy today.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.220
[Amit Varma]: In either way, this is sort of a Ponzi scheme through time where effectively and this is

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.020
[Amit Varma]: one of the classic criticisms of the Social Security in America, where you are basically

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:20.620
[Amit Varma]: borrowing from future generations to spend on current ones, and which is expected to

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:27.140
[Amit Varma]: be a crisis when for example, the baby boomers reach retirement age, and you know, at some

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:32.860
[Amit Varma]: point in time, that scheme is expected to inevitably fall apart unless reformed drastically

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.860
[Guest]: before.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.860
[Guest]: In fact, so I wanted to make a couple of more points.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.100
[Guest]: Now, you know, look at all the small savings schemes.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:44.060
[Guest]: If you speak to any corporate economist, he will tell you that the interest rates on small

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:49.500
[Guest]: savings schemes need to come down, because they are higher than bank deposits.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.420
[Guest]: And in order to compete with small savings schemes, banks need to offer a higher rate

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.480
[Guest]: of interest.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.220
[Guest]: And because banks are offering a higher rate of interest on the deposits, they need to

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.740
[Guest]: charge a higher rate of interest on their loans.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:06.500
[Guest]: Now, the reason that, you know, interest on small savings schemes cannot come down dramatically

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:10.500
[Guest]: is because the government wants money to keep coming into these schemes, because if money

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:16.100
[Guest]: doesn't come into these schemes, how are they going to pay for all the you know, money which

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.060
[Guest]: is maturing all the investment which is maturing.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:26.500
[Guest]: So which is why the rate of interest on on on on small savings schemes will always be

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.020
[Guest]: higher than rate of interest on fixed deposits, because otherwise the entire Ponzi structure

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020
[Guest]: will collapse.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.660
[Guest]: Now, if the Ponzi structure collapses for a private guy, he can just run, but for a

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.540
[Guest]: government, the government cannot run, right, the government will have to still pay all

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.140
[Guest]: the money which is maturing, which will come from taxpayers, which will then have to come

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.540
[Guest]: from, you know, other parts of the budget, which basically, and when it comes from the

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.620
[Guest]: other parts of the budget, then the problem is that you have to cut expenditure somewhere

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.900
[Guest]: else or raise taxes.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.220
[Guest]: So which is, you know, one part.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:05.540
[Guest]: The other interesting thing is, you know, is what economists call financial repression.

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:13.940
[Guest]: Now, financial repression in the Indian context is forcing banks to buy government securities.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:20.660
[Guest]: So by law, banks have to invest a certain percentage of their deposits in government

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.660
[Guest]: securities.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.460
[Guest]: I think as of now, it's around 18.75%.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:30.660
[Guest]: But banks on their own, I think, would probably have invested more than 25% of their money

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.100
[Guest]: in government securities.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:40.060
[Guest]: Now what this does is that it allows the government access to money, I mean, this is money which

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.540
[Guest]: has to come into government securities, I mean, the same is the case with insurance

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:49.360
[Guest]: companies where a certain proportion of, you know, money raised has to be compulsorily

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.860
[Guest]: invested in government securities.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:57.760
[Guest]: So what this does is it keeps the interest rates lower than they actually would have

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:04.980
[Guest]: been if the government did not force these institutions to buy government securities.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.060
[Amit Varma]: So there is, and,

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And not just that, I'm assuming that the cost of borrowings for us common people from these

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.420
[Amit Varma]: private banks is higher than it would otherwise would be because they have to make up somewhere

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.260
[Amit Varma]: for the inefficient investments in government securities.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:25.940
[Guest]: And you know, also, it is the interesting thing here is that this is also why the government

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.700
[Guest]: doesn't let go of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, because ultimately, a lot of money

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:37.780
[Guest]: that LIC raises through its so called insurance policies finds its way into, you know, government

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.780
[Guest]: securities.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:43.960
[Guest]: Also, you know, when the government is selling shares in companies that it owns, and which

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.260
[Guest]: investors do not want to buy, then LIC has to come to the rescue of the government.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:54.540
[Guest]: And then this money helps in you know, financing the fiscal deficit and so the Ponzi scheme.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:00.780
[Amit Varma]: So now, as you pointed out in the first half of the show, Ponzi schemes run by private

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.340
[Amit Varma]: parties have a natural end, at some point, they cannot continue anymore, and they fall

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.340
[Amit Varma]: apart.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.340
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.340
[Amit Varma]: Does this fall apart?

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:12.820
[Guest]: No, I mean, so this can continue as long as there are people, as long as there are people

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:18.020
[Guest]: and as long as you know, as I said, I mean, as long as the money coming into the, you

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:22.460
[Amit Varma]: know, government bonds is there, I mean, then which they can actually mandate as they do

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:26.860
[Amit Varma]: in the case of private banks, you know, it can continue up until then, yes.

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.620
[Amit Varma]: And we pay a price, which is sort of largely unseen.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.620
[Guest]: This is unseen.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is totally unseen.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.780
[Amit Varma]: This is totally unseen.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.980
[Amit Varma]: You'd also mentioned while we were chatting over our excellent respective ham and cheese

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:44.780
[Amit Varma]: omelettes with some superb black coffee that there's a certain kind of naturally occurring

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.540
[Amit Varma]: Ponzi scheme because of the nature of the financial system.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.380
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:56.460
[Guest]: So, you know, there is a Nobel Prize winning economist called Robert Shiller, whose latest

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:01.020
[Guest]: book Narrative Economics is brilliant, by the way, I'm also halfway through it.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.380
[Guest]: It's a great book.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:10.460
[Guest]: And also, you know, one thing about Shiller is that, I mean, unlike a lot of other economists,

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.220
[Guest]: he is not out and out theoretical.

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.220
[Guest]: And he does make predictions which come right.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:22.020
[Guest]: I mean, like, his book Irrational Exuberance came the first edition came almost a few months

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:26.820
[Amit Varma]: before the dot com bubble burst early 99, I think, if I remember correctly, then he

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:33.060
[Guest]: also his second edition of Irrational Exuberance came a couple of years before the real estate

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.940
[Amit Varma]: bubble burst.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.740
[Amit Varma]: So he does have a I also make good predictions like this episode is going to be released

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.740
[Amit Varma]: on this coming Monday.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:45.660
[Guest]: That's a very bad joke, even by your standards.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:54.300
[Guest]: So yeah, so Shiller essentially talks about, you know, naturally occurring Ponzi schemes.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:59.220
[Guest]: And so obviously, he calls them naturally occurring Ponzi schemes because they happen

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:04.700
[Guest]: without the contravents of a fraudulent manager.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:12.300
[Guest]: And so what he essentially says is, and I'm paraphrasing here, when speculative prices

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:17.540
[Guest]: in the stock market, I mean, share prices go up, creating successes for some investors.

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.820
[Guest]: This may attract public attention, promote word of mouth enthusiasm and heighten expectations

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.820
[Guest]: for further price increases.

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.940
[Guest]: The stock market is the best example.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.580
[Guest]: Stories about stock markets going up spread very fast.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.780
[Guest]: Investors in an optimistic mood might want to buy stock and take the stock price further

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.780
[Guest]: up.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.620
[Guest]: This leads to more investors entering the market, fueling an even greater price rise

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.060
[Guest]: and the cycle gets repeated over and over again.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:49.420
[Guest]: As Shiller writes, when prices go up a number of times, investors are rewarded by price

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.660
[Guest]: movements in these markets, just as they are in Ponzi schemes, OK?

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:59.880
[Guest]: Now, the high prices are not sustainable since they are driven by unrealistic expectations

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.460
[Guest]: of further price increases.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.980
[Guest]: The bubble eventually bursts and price crashes.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:09.620
[Guest]: Now, I mean, this works in, you know, so many different cases.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.660
[Guest]: I mean, you look at the entire, you know, the Modi bull run, the so-called Modi bull

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:18.140
[Guest]: run, which has been on since September 2013.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:26.120
[Guest]: I mean, you know, stock brokerages have essentially been driving this story over and over again

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.820
[Guest]: in various forms.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:34.700
[Guest]: But ultimately, the earnings of the companies haven't caught on to the price increases.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:40.020
[Guest]: So it's just the money that keeps coming in, which, you know, which drives up the prices,

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:45.220
[Guest]: making it a beautiful example of a naturally occurring Ponzi scheme.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:53.900
[Guest]: Or if you look at real estate, I mean, the rally between almost 2002, 2003 to 2011, 12,

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.500
[Guest]: 13, I mean, people used to just, you know, blindly invest in real estate because a whole

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.520
[Guest]: generation had seen just prices going up.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:09.340
[Guest]: But beyond a point, you know, the prices reached a stage where it wasn't just, I mean, prices

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:13.620
[Guest]: were going up not because there was genuine demand for these homes.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.700
[Guest]: They were going up because there were these investors who had money and they were buying

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700
[Guest]: and flipping.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.260
[Guest]: And ultimately, you know, even that game stopped.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.940
[Guest]: And if you look at how, you know, real estate has gone in the last five, six years, it's

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:32.060
[Guest]: it's by, you know, it's by and large been a mess, primarily because the prices reached

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.660
[Guest]: a stage where they just became unsustainable and, and prices continue to remain high, which

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.820
[Amit Varma]: is why the recovery hasn't happened.

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.580
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you and I have an excellent episode on why, despite demand having gone down in

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.800
[Amit Varma]: real estate prices haven't followed suit, which is not what you would expect, theoretically.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.380
[Amit Varma]: But I guess all bubbles in a sense, work in the Ponzi structure in the sense that let's

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.500
[Amit Varma]: say that there is a share of a company which should logically given sales and given revenues

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.660
[Amit Varma]: and all of that sell, you know, within a narrow band.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.540
[Amit Varma]: But when it goes above that, it's basically investors are then buying it expecting it

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.620
[Amit Varma]: to rise further, which brings a greater fool theory into play, because they are buying

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.860
[Amit Varma]: at a high price, but they don't care that it's too high, because you know, someone will

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:18.860
[Amit Varma]: buy it for higher, which is again a classic case of a later investor paying off an earlier

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.860
[Amit Varma]: investment.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.740
[Amit Varma]: And this continues to a point where because of all kinds of reasons, maybe the internal

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:30.300
[Amit Varma]: logic breaks down, or external events cause a crash, where it all kinds of falls apart.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.220
[Amit Varma]: And the last guy left holding the can goes down.

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:37.460
[Amit Varma]: But as you know, Chuck Prince, who was then head of Citibank famously said in 2007, when

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:41.060
[Amit Varma]: he was asked about this about, you know, why do you keep participating in a bubble and

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:47.300
[Amit Varma]: Prince said, quote, as long as the music's playing, you have to dance, stop, quote, and,

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.860
[Amit Varma]: and that's often what happens.

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:53.940
[Amit Varma]: So, all these people participating in this Ponzi scheme of stock market bubbles or real

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:58.740
[Amit Varma]: estate bubbles aren't necessarily fools, they're behaving rationally, because they see the

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:05.700
[Amit Varma]: high probability of a greater fool along the road, so that they can make a profit.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.900
[Guest]: And thus history continues to talk about naturally occurring Ponzi schemes.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:16.260
[Guest]: They've been described beautifully in this book, written by Charles Mackey, which was

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:21.380
[Guest]: published in 1841, Madness of Crowds, Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.380
[Guest]: Madness of Crowds.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:28.860
[Guest]: It's, I mean, highly recommended not, you know, if you read it, not every chapter will

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:29.860
[Guest]: be interesting.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.900
[Guest]: But some of the chapters are very, very interesting.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.620
[Guest]: And it's freely available on the link all these books we mentioned from the show notes.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:42.460
[Guest]: So in this book, you know, he describes the tulip mania in Holland, in the 1630s.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:49.260
[Guest]: The first account of tulips in Europe is from 1559, when a collector of exotic flora, Counsellor

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.340
[Guest]: Hermat, received a consignment of tulip bulbs from a friend in Constantinople, which is

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.540
[Guest]: now Istanbul, which he planted in his garden in Germany.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.180
[Guest]: His tulips drew a good deal of attention.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:06.020
[Guest]: In the following years, this flower became more and more popular among the upper classes,

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.940
[Guest]: particularly in Germany and Holland, where it became a custom to order bulbs at an exorbitant

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:13.540
[Guest]: price directly from Constantinople.

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.780
[Guest]: Up to 1634, this custom became increasingly common, and from that, affluent society in

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.260
[Guest]: Holland considered a lack of tulip collection to be of poor taste.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.740
[Guest]: So you need to have tulips in your house.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:29.020
[Guest]: Year after year, tulip prices rose, finally reaching astronomical heights.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:36.140
[Guest]: By 1636, the demand for tulip bulbs had risen drastically, and people started to trade them

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.660
[Guest]: in exchanges across many towns in Holland.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.540
[Guest]: Tulips were bought by well-to-do collectors as well as by agents and speculators.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:49.700
[Guest]: At the smallest price drop, they would buy only to sell it later at a profit.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.900
[Guest]: Many individuals suddenly grew rich.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.980
[Guest]: A golden bait hung tempting out before the people.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.100
[Guest]: One after the other, they rushed into tulip markets like flies around a honeypot.

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:06.340
[Guest]: At last, however, the more prudent ones began to see the folly that this could not last

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.340
[Guest]: forever.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.940
[Guest]: Rich people no longer bought the flowers to keep them in their gardens, but to sell them

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.900
[Guest]: again at a profit.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:16.660
[Guest]: It was seen that somebody must lose fearfully in the end.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.900
[Guest]: As this conviction spread, prices fell and never rose again.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.780
[Guest]: Now, you know, so this is how the Dutch tulip bubble played out.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.300
[Guest]: In fact, the tulip bubble is still playing out very well for Holland.

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:35.180
[Guest]: I mean, you know, people from all over the world go there to see the tulips.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:40.180
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, the question that I would ask for you to ponder about is how is buying tulips

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.540
[Amit Varma]: for investment back in the day different from, say, buying art for investment today?

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.700
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day, it's all about people's perceptions.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.700
[Guest]: 100 percent.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.540
[Guest]: I mean, see, value is perception at the end of the day.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.460
[Guest]: You take your shots and it goes where it goes.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460
[Guest]: Yes.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:01.020
[Guest]: So, you know, we were talking about, you know, naturally occurring Ponzi schemes.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:07.180
[Guest]: Now, if you look at the way a lot of private CEOs of private companies, private banks talk

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:16.780
[Guest]: these days, I mean, you know, they are perpetually trying to project a positive economic environment.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:22.060
[Guest]: I mean, if you ask them how well the economy is doing, I mean, they're rarely negative.

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:28.180
[Guest]: I mean, and I mean, one reason, obviously, is that no, no CEO in India wants to irritate

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.180
[Guest]: the government.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:34.860
[Guest]: That is a perpetual given, but beyond that, you know, they have a personal incentive in

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:41.220
[Guest]: ensuring that their stock prices keep going up simply because they own a lot of stock

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.220
[Guest]: options.

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:48.820
[Guest]: So, it is in their interest to ensure that they keep talking up the stock as well as

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.820
[Guest]: the economy.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:56.260
[Guest]: So, this is another excellent example of a spin off of a naturally occurring Ponzi scheme.

01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:01.300
[Amit Varma]: And added incentive is not just a personal stock options, but also that they are judged

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.380
[Amit Varma]: on short term results.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.540
[Amit Varma]: And one metric for those short term results is how well is the company's stock doing.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:15.020
[Amit Varma]: So, it is more profitable for them to say, do and say things which impact the short term

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:19.820
[Amit Varma]: performance of the company in the stock market, rather than the long term fiscal health of

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.820
[Guest]: the company, for example.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.540
[Amit Varma]: Not very different from our politicians.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.060
[Amit Varma]: Not very different from our politicians who are always fighting for elections and therefore

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.020
[Guest]: are in perpetual campaign mode.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:33.100
[Guest]: So, which again tells you that their structure is also very Ponzi in nature.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.740
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, one interesting thing regarding CEOs is the Lake Wobegon effect.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of that?

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.740
[Amit Varma]: No.

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.260
[Amit Varma]: So, a guy called Garrison Keillor wrote a book, wrote a novel called Lake Wobegon Days,

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.420
[Amit Varma]: which was about a town called Lake Wobegon, where everybody was above average.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:52.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, you might, of course, ask with your mathematical mind, how can everybody be above average because

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.540
[Amit Varma]: the average is on average, they'll be average.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:00.260
[Amit Varma]: And that has led to this thing called the Lake Wobegon effect on the compensation of

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:06.260
[Amit Varma]: CEOs, where what happens is that every time a company wants to hire a CEO, whoever they

01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:12.980
[Amit Varma]: want to hire, will demand a higher compensation than the market under the logic and the previous

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.660
[Amit Varma]: guy under the logic that look, you're hiring somebody better, that's why you're hiring

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:21.820
[Amit Varma]: somebody otherwise, why you know, and what happens because of this is that CEO salaries

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:28.300
[Amit Varma]: tend to rise and rise with reference to previous CEO salaries, and to the average of the market,

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:33.340
[Amit Varma]: because they have to get more than average, until a point where they rise beyond any,

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, rational reasoning, all based on supply and demand, of course, because the

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.580
[Amit Varma]: companies also have no choice.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.100
[Guest]: And that just so that's known as sort of the Lake Wobegon effect.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.660
[Guest]: So just to add to it, no, I mean, I just remembered that, I think up until the early 90s, the

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:55.140
[Guest]: Securities and Exchange Commission in the US did not ask companies to compulsorily disclose

01:18:55.140 --> 01:19:02.540
[Guest]: CEO salaries, then they thought that, you know, it would be better, more transparency

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.540
[Guest]: and all that.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:08.260
[Guest]: So, so they said, Okay, now, you know, all companies have to compulsorily declare CEO

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.260
[Amit Varma]: salaries.

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:14.740
[Guest]: Yeah, what did what this did was that up until then, the CEOs did not know the salaries of

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:18.820
[Guest]: other CEOs, now, they knew the salaries of other CEOs.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:24.020
[Guest]: So when they were negotiating, obviously, they wanted higher salaries, and the net net

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:29.220
[Guest]: effect was that, you know, CEO salaries instead of, you know, so the idea was that once you

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.540
[Guest]: sort of declare CEO salaries and put them in public domain, then you know, the shareholders

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.540
[Guest]: would take over.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:38.460
[Guest]: And if they felt that the CEO is sort of getting more than he should, I mean, then there would

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:39.460
[Guest]: be some activism.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.020
[Guest]: And so all that never happened.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:46.180
[Guest]: But what happened was that the the benchmark of CEO salaries was set very, very clearly

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:50.820
[Guest]: and salaries instead of, you know, moderating, they actually inevitably, another example

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:54.860
[Amit Varma]: of a similar in a very different context, but a similar effect and similar unintended

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.780
[Amit Varma]: consequences is the anti defection law in India.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:01.180
[Amit Varma]: The anti defection law in India, I had an episode on this with Varun Mitra very old

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:06.240
[Amit Varma]: episode came about in about I think 1986, or around that time mid 80s.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And the idea was very good.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.820
[Amit Varma]: The idea was that look, you know, MPs keep defecting to other parties for money, let's

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:14.140
[Amit Varma]: have a law by which they cannot defect.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.820
[Amit Varma]: And they have to vote with their party in parliament, there is no option, they just

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: have to.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.980
[Amit Varma]: And the result of that the unintended consequences of that is that all parliamentary debate in

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:28.900
[Amit Varma]: India has completely stopped earlier, especially around the time of independence, you had a

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:34.020
[Amit Varma]: tradition of lively erudite debates in parliaments on all kinds of issues.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:39.220
[Amit Varma]: Today, you have no debates at all, except for, you know, performatives, performatively

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.780
[Amit Varma]: speaking to your own side, but you have effectively have no parliamentary debate anymore, because

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.180
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't matter, you have to vote with your party.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And you could effectively run parliament from an Excel sheet.

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.820
[Amit Varma]: I don't even understand why the members have to be physically present, because the anti

01:20:53.820 --> 01:21:00.820
[Amit Varma]: defection law renders them completely impotent in terms of actual decision making or affecting

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:08.100
[Amit Varma]: the course of parliament, but that is a digression, let us get back to smaller frauds, Ponzi frauds.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.140
[Guest]: Oh, even bigger ones, actually.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.340
[Amit Varma]: So, speaking of something bigger, you had mentioned to me while we were having breakfast

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:20.380
[Amit Varma]: Vivek that Ponzi schemes are not just you know, private frauds run by companies or even

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:25.660
[Amit Varma]: governmental ones within a country, but they can take on a geopolitical scale and impact

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.020
[Amit Varma]: the entire financial system of the world.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.540
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:33.900
[Guest]: So this is, you know, more we're talking more in terms of structure, rather than, you know,

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.980
[Guest]: there's no fraud element here.

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:45.220
[Guest]: So I mean, if you look at the US dollar, now, the way the global financial system evolved

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:50.300
[Guest]: post 1945, the dollar came to be at the heart of it.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.540
[Guest]: And you know, this obviously started at the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire

01:21:54.540 --> 01:22:00.100
[Guest]: in July 1944, where it was decided that, you know, the dollar would be one currency which

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.060
[Guest]: would continue to be convertible into gold.

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:09.980
[Guest]: Now, because of this, what happened was that countries started having their reserves, their

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.460
[Guest]: international reserves in dollars, because dollar was the only currency convertible into

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.460
[Guest]: gold.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.980
[Guest]: Before that, they used to have, you know, their reserves in the British pound because

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:25.740
[Guest]: pound was also convertible into gold, but post the Second World War, because America

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:30.980
[Guest]: had most of the monetary gold in the world, it sort of became came at the heart of the

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.340
[Guest]: global financial system.

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:37.540
[Guest]: Now, what has happened is because the you know, of this over the years, the much of

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:43.540
[Guest]: the international trade has also moved to dollars, before that it was sort of split

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.900
[Guest]: between you know, pound and dollar and so on, and so on and so forth.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:55.180
[Guest]: Now, now let's take the case of when I'm talking very simple terms here, let's take the case

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.420
[Guest]: of United States and China.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:03.820
[Guest]: Now, the US is a net importer from China, it buys a lot of goods produced in China.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.300
[Guest]: Now, China obviously gets paid in dollars.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:13.940
[Guest]: Now, when a Chinese exporter gets these dollars back into China, he has to convert them into

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.060
[Guest]: Yuan.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:20.260
[Guest]: And when he converts them into, he has to convert them into Yuan, because his expenses,

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.380
[Guest]: his reporting everything is in Yuan.

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:28.140
[Guest]: So these dollars then land up at as foreign exchange reserves at the People's Bank of

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.420
[Guest]: China, which is the Chinese Central Bank.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:35.900
[Guest]: Now, these dollars can, you know, either continue remaining in the remaining with the People's

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:39.460
[Guest]: Bank of China, or they can be invested somewhere.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.820
[Guest]: So then they are invested, the dollars are invested in American government securities.

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:52.180
[Guest]: Now, because China earns, you know, so many, you know, a lot of dollars, a lot of dollars,

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:56.580
[Guest]: more than a trillion dollars have been invested in American government securities.

01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:02.220
[Guest]: The same is the case with Japan, Japan has also invested more than a trillion dollars.

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:09.440
[Guest]: So because so much foreign money comes into US government securities, the interest rates

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:15.820
[Guest]: that the US government needs to offer on those securities becomes very low, because you know,

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.260
[Guest]: the demand is huge.

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:24.940
[Guest]: Now, when the interest rate that the US government is paying on its bonds is low, that becomes

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:31.820
[Guest]: a benchmark for the overall interest rate scenario in the US, which is also low.

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:37.900
[Guest]: So at lower interest rates, you know, people can borrow and buy stuff.

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:42.740
[Guest]: And a lot of this stuff that gets bought is made in China.

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:49.460
[Guest]: And because of this, you know, dollars which come back into the US in and get invested

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:56.540
[Guest]: in US government treasuries ensure that interest rates are low, and consumer demand is high.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.780
[Guest]: And because of this Chinese companies benefit and more dollars go into China.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:08.300
[Guest]: And then these dollars are converted into Yuan, and then find their way back into the

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:13.780
[Guest]: US government treasury securities, and again, ensure that interest rates continue to remain

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780
[Guest]: low.

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.300
[Guest]: So there is a there is a cycle, there is a structure to it, where money goes from the

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:24.980
[Guest]: US to China and comes back to the US and in the process ensures lower interest rates.

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:30.820
[Guest]: It also ensures that the world continues the world trading system, so to say continues

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.380
[Guest]: to be on the US dollar, right?

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.660
[Guest]: I mean, it gives us an exorbitant privilege where in every country in the world needs

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:43.540
[Guest]: to earn these dollars, the US can simply print it.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:50.420
[Guest]: Now, Donald Trump has this thing in his head that in order to make America great again,

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:56.180
[Guest]: he has, you know, American imports have to come down, and exports have to go up.

01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:01.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, we've had a couple of episodes on the trade deficit and, you know, as a point

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.660
[Amit Varma]: that we repeatedly keep making on different fora is that there's nothing wrong with the

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660
[Amit Varma]: trade deficit.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, ultimately, all trade happens to mutual benefit.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:13.380
[Amit Varma]: You know, I have a trade deficit with my domestic health, for example, you know, I pay her every

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.860
[Amit Varma]: month she never pays, she buys anything from me.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.580
[Amit Varma]: And that's fine, because we're both benefiting, it's at mutually agreed terms and trade happens

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.540
[Amit Varma]: between the individuals of both countries.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.820
[Amit Varma]: But Trump, for some reason, sees the world in zero sum ways, and therefore he thinks

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:32.580
[Amit Varma]: that this trade deficit is a problem that if they are making more dollars, and we must

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:33.580
[Amit Varma]: be losing something.

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:34.580
[Guest]: Right.

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:38.460
[Guest]: So basically, you know, the entire the trade system as it has evolved with, you know, money

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:43.700
[Guest]: finding its way, trade and financial system, with money, all these dollars from all these

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:50.020
[Guest]: countries, you know, China is just with one example, but Japan, Saudi Arabia, even India,

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.820
[Guest]: I mean, all these dollars find not all but a lot of these dollars find their way back

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.820
[Guest]: into the US.

01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:59.180
[Guest]: And this essentially ensures that the interest rates in US continue to remain low.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:06.580
[Guest]: Now, there is a global trade war on currently with and Trump is making it more and more

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:11.060
[Guest]: difficult for Americans to import goods from China.

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060
[Guest]: Okay.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:18.500
[Guest]: Now, if America doesn't import goods from China, then China doesn't earn those dollars,

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.500
[Guest]: right.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.500
[Guest]: So one impact of that is that those dollars then again, don't find their way back into

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.660
[Guest]: America.

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.460
[Guest]: The other impact is that if China doesn't own on those dollars, it also doesn't earn

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.980
[Guest]: money to buy stuff from other countries.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:38.580
[Guest]: So if it had earned that money, and it had bought stuff from other countries, those dollars

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:42.900
[Guest]: would also eventually find its way back into America and ensure lower interest rates.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.780
[Guest]: So Trump is essentially attacking his own people, his own people in and he's attacking

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:53.940
[Guest]: a system which has helped the US and which has helped the dollar continue to be at the

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:57.100
[Guest]: heart of the global financial system.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.620
[Guest]: So so and in a way, you know, he's he's essentially trying to break the Ponzi structure.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:06.660
[Guest]: But you know, if and when and if it if he is successful at doing it, it will eventually

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:13.060
[Guest]: end up hurting Americans because all these dollars will not come back to America, interest

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.300
[Guest]: rates can go up.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:18.740
[Guest]: And if interest rates go up the entire, you know, the consumption culture on which essentially,

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:24.020
[Guest]: you know, which is the great big American dream, will will sort of virtuous cycle becomes

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.020
[Guest]: a vicious cycle.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:30.500
[Guest]: So this is another, you know, the, I mean, this in this case, the irony is that the the

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:38.580
[Guest]: Ponzi structure, as it has evolved, is essentially benefiting the US and what I mean, this is

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:43.500
[Guest]: one positive application of the positive application of a Ponzi because you know, we and this is

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:48.020
[Guest]: especially for all those people on the social media who want us to, you know, talk about

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.140
[Guest]: good things in life.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.660
[Guest]: So what is social media?

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:52.580
[Amit Varma]: Are you on any social media site?

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.580
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:29:00.540
[Guest]: Actually, we are I mean, see, Facebook is dead, okay, Twitter is on its way out.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:04.500
[Guest]: And we haven't figured out Instagram, you're not there on Instagram, and I am like barely

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.100
[Amit Varma]: So see, Instagram is almost yesterday's platform and we are too old for Instagram.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.900
[Unknown]: So just imagine our condition.

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.500
[Amit Varma]: This reminds me that there was a gentleman who suggested we do an episode on Ponzi, which

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.340
[Amit Varma]: was a proximate trigger for doing this episode.

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:21.260
[Amit Varma]: And even though I'd asked you months ago, let's do an episode on Ponzi, but we should

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:25.180
[Amit Varma]: give a shout out to this gentleman.

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:30.260
[Amit Varma]: I am now on Twitter, I will find him and I will find where he lives and we will go to

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.260
[Amit Varma]: his house and we will thank him personally.

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:35.860
[Amit Varma]: Okay, we don't I'm scrolling through my notifications.

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:41.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is a gentleman who calls himself No Chill Bro, and his Twitter handle is at

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.900
[Amit Varma]: lalitbhanot1.

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.340
[Guest]: Okay, so obviously, there is a name.

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.820
[Amit Varma]: So ek shout out banta hai bhai, he says I am not your bhai, but we are giving you a

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:53.660
[Amit Varma]: shout out at lalitbhanot1, No Chill Bro.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:59.420
[Amit Varma]: And we will also personally send you merchandise if you can send us your birth certificate

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:03.740
[Amit Varma]: and prove that your actual name given to you by your parents is No Chill Bro.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:09.140
[Guest]: Aadhaar number of No Chill Bro, I mean, maybe it's never mind, everyone's asking for Aadhaar,

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140
[Guest]: we should also.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.380
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, we should also ask for Aadhaar.

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.940
[Amit Varma]: In fact, any tweets in future directed to us kindly enclose your Aadhaar number, you

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.140
[Amit Varma]: might end up getting some, there should actually be a notification filter, no, any, any tweet

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:24.860
[Amit Varma]: without an Aadhaar number, you don't get the notification.

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.100
[Amit Varma]: That's coming up next.

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:30.860
[Amit Varma]: Moving on from this, you know, so we've discussed different kinds of Ponzi schemes, whether

01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:36.340
[Amit Varma]: private or public, we've discussed these Ponzi structures, which are overlaid over certain

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:43.020
[Amit Varma]: systems, whether within the financial world or in geopolitics or whatever, what sort of

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:48.740
[Amit Varma]: also intrigues me is that, listen, we are the only species with Ponzi schemes, partly

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:55.380
[Amit Varma]: because we are the only species which trades in narratives, we make stories about the world

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:59.360
[Amit Varma]: and they explain the world to us and they are how we navigate the world, which makes

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:08.020
[Amit Varma]: us extremely susceptible to believing in these Ponzi schemes and get-rich schemes.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.980
[Amit Varma]: What are sort of the different, and I know you've written about this in your paper, and

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:14.620
[Amit Varma]: of course, both you and I for many, many years have been writing about cognitive biases and

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.780
[Amit Varma]: logical fallacies and all of them apply here.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.380
[Amit Varma]: What are some of the main ones you would say have something to do with it?

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:25.500
[Guest]: So I mean, obviously, as fundamental as this may sound, I guess the main factor that sort

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.140
[Guest]: of encourages Ponzi schemes is the herd mentality.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:35.220
[Guest]: So there's a beautiful quote in Robert Schiller's book, Irrational Exuberance, and this is how

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.220
[Guest]: it goes.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.180
[Guest]: A fundamental observation about human society is that people who communicate regularly with

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.860
[Guest]: one another think similarly.

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:49.300
[Guest]: There is at any place and in any time a zeitgeist, a spirit of times.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:55.780
[Guest]: So what happens is if a person wants to invest, the chances are that he will look around to

01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.020
[Guest]: see what his friends, family, etc., etc., are doing with their money.

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:04.700
[Guest]: And when they see that the friends, etc., are investing in a particular scheme where

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:10.300
[Guest]: they have made money, so they automatically sort of end up investing there because the

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:16.660
[Guest]: assumption is that, okay, this guy I know and he's made his money, so it should generally

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:17.660
[Guest]: be safe.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.420
[Guest]: People don't go inquiring about it.

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:24.300
[Guest]: And this is true about not just Ponzi schemes, it's true about, I mean, look at why people

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:30.060
[Guest]: buy LIC policies, I mean, they buy LIC policies because, you know, the guy selling them the

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.260
[Guest]: policy is known to them, he's a relative, or they've seen people all around them buy

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.260
[Guest]: LIC policies.

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:39.980
[Amit Varma]: LIC agents are sort of a downmarket version of the Amway agent, in a sense.

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.500
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing, I mean, it's largely the same thing.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.860
[Amit Varma]: You don't recommend buying LIC schemes, right?

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.860
[Guest]: Not at all.

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:50.580
[Guest]: In fact, now, not even, you know, earlier one would have even thought.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:55.420
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps we will have another episode on that someday, like a fractal emerging out of this

01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:56.420
[Guest]: episode.

01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:03.820
[Guest]: So, you know, the interesting example here is what, so, you know, Sarada is a great example.

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:09.340
[Guest]: Now, they managed to assure investors that their investments would be safe.

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:14.740
[Guest]: What they did was they employed the agents of Peerless General Finance and Investment

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.740
[Guest]: Company.

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:20.180
[Guest]: Now, Peerless was a very popular investment company in parts of Eastern India.

01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:24.940
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, I remember very, very clearly, because, I mean, I grew up in Eastern India.

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:30.140
[Guest]: Now, it had, it was, you know, it was formed in 1932, and had pioneered the collection

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.260
[Guest]: of small savings in Eastern India, primarily in West Bengal.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:42.140
[Guest]: Now, what had happened was that RBI had forced Peerless to stop taking deposits in 2005-2006.

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:47.620
[Guest]: And this led to a growth of unregulated deposit taking companies in West Bengal and other

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.940
[Guest]: Eastern states.

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:56.300
[Guest]: So agents of Peerless, who had always been trusted, because Peerless always repaid, became

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.420
[Guest]: agents of Sarada, okay.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:04.260
[Guest]: And so basically, the the good brand name of, you know, Peerless, which sort of had

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:11.580
[Guest]: been built over almost, almost seven decades, more than seven decades, rubbed on to, rubbed

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:12.580
[Amit Varma]: on to Sarada.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:16.500
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, it's the same kind of thing we say home trade did by getting celebrity endorsements

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:20.460
[Guest]: from Sachin and Shah Rukh and whatever that rubs off on to you.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.660
[Guest]: But in this case, what I'm talking about is the actual salesman.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:31.140
[Guest]: And how the, the herd mentality, sort of, how the trust factor came into the herd mentality,

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.140
[Guest]: if that is.

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:37.220
[Amit Varma]: No, and also, I guess, there's that natural tendency that once you have invested, you

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:41.740
[Amit Varma]: will immediately rationalize your investment to yourself, you will double down on it, perhaps

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.340
[Amit Varma]: even by investing more.

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:48.900
[Amit Varma]: The endowment effect kicks in, where if you own, you know, one of these shares from one

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.980
[Amit Varma]: of these companies, it immediately feels more valuable to you than it did when you did not

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:54.340
[Amit Varma]: possess it.

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.340
[Amit Varma]: And so on.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:02.100
[Guest]: So I just like to, you know, read out a small paragraph from the paper that I wrote many

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.100
[Guest]: years back.

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:08.540
[Guest]: Now, you know, it's essentially, obviously, you know, you're looking at what people you

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.440
[Guest]: know, are doing.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:15.780
[Guest]: So this is something that we've written, and it's like the desire to conform to the behavior

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:21.860
[Guest]: and opinions of others is a fundamental human trait, an accepted principle of psychology.

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:26.980
[Guest]: If the people around the potential investor invest in a certain way, they might be a tendency

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:33.100
[Guest]: for him to follow them, much like the circular mill of ants, okay, the mill is created when

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:37.540
[Guest]: an army of ants find themselves separated from the colony.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:42.980
[Guest]: Once they're lost, they obey a simple rule, follow an ant in front of you.

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:48.740
[Guest]: So decisions of investors, much like the circular mills of ants, are not made at the same time,

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.140
[Guest]: but in a sequence.

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:54.700
[Guest]: So people who invest in a Ponzi scheme assume that the scheme is a good bet, simply because

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:58.280
[Guest]: some of the people they know have already invested in it.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.900
[Guest]: So everyone ends up making the wrong decisions, because the initial investors get into the

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.340
[Guest]: scheme by chance, right?

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.740
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of something EO Wilson once said, have you heard of the biologist

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:10.740
[Amit Varma]: Edmundo Wilson?

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:16.620
[Amit Varma]: No, there's a great quote by him about communism, where he says, quote, great idea, full stop

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.820
[Amit Varma]: wrong species, stop quote.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:22.820
[Amit Varma]: And his idea was that low communism is a great idea for ants, which is specifically what

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:29.140
[Amit Varma]: he meant ants and bees, because they are people who are wired to follow central planning commands

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:35.580
[Amit Varma]: from on top and they all act as one body, but human nature being what it is, it cannot,

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.540
[Amit Varma]: it simply cannot work.

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:41.660
[Amit Varma]: So in that case, of course, drawing a distinction between ants and humans.

01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.540
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I made that whole point about no other species having Ponzi schemes, which

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:48.420
[Amit Varma]: is of course, a glib and frivolous point.

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:54.380
[Amit Varma]: But it is also true that as a species, because of our tendency to explain the world to ourselves,

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:59.980
[Amit Varma]: because of narratives, all of these cognitive biases and these fallacies we tend to commit

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:03.220
[Amit Varma]: are sort of hardwired into humans and no other species.

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And all of them are useful in different contexts.

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:11.220
[Amit Varma]: But when they go wrong, they sort of go wrong in these sort of ways.

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:15.780
[Amit Varma]: In your paper, you've pointed out, you know, the recency effect, the anchoring effect and

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:16.780
[Guest]: so on.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.340
[Guest]: The other interesting, you know, if we were to talk in millennial terms, there is also

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:27.980
[Guest]: FOMO involved, you know, the fear of missing out on a good investment, the FOMO effect,

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:28.980
[Amit Varma]: FOMO effect.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.980
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:34.060
[Amit Varma]: The FOMO effect should now get into the language coined for the first time on the scene and

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060
[Guest]: the unseen.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.060
[Guest]: No, it's already there.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060
[Amit Varma]: It's already there.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060
[Guest]: FOMO is there.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:42.700
[Amit Varma]: But the FOMO effect to explain the FOMO effect to explain a proper noun should totally be

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.700
[Amit Varma]: credited.

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:44.700
[Amit Varma]: It is.

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:45.700
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:46.700
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.700
[Guest]: So we are behavioral economists.

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:48.700
[Amit Varma]: Now we have coined.

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:49.700
[Amit Varma]: Who knows?

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.540
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps one day we'll do an episode of economic funders on storytelling just about the FOMO

01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.540
[Amit Varma]: effect.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.540
[Guest]: It could happen.

01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:01.220
[Guest]: But then obviously, you know, there is first, as I said, is the herd mentality and then

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:08.580
[Guest]: there is greed because, you know, you see that you compare the rate of returns on other

01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:10.500
[Guest]: investment which is available.

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:15.180
[Guest]: And in this case, as I said, the returns available, returns which are offered on Ponzi schemes

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:23.460
[Guest]: are generally significantly higher than the other schemes available in the market.

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:29.100
[Guest]: So let me just give you a few schemes and then the kind of returns that they offered.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:34.660
[Guest]: So there was a Rose Valley Ponzi scheme in West Bengal a few years back that offered

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:39.060
[Guest]: anywhere between 11.2 percent to 17.7 percent.

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.380
[Guest]: PSCL offered 12.5 to 14 percent.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:47.700
[Guest]: Sarda reportedly offered returns on 17.5 to 22 percent.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:55.220
[Guest]: So and I mean, we've already seen the returns on offer in case of Speak Asia and MMM, you

01:38:55.220 --> 01:39:02.340
[Guest]: know, where a 5000 rupee investment was supposed to sort of become 3.4 crore at the end of

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.340
[Guest]: the year.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:09.940
[Guest]: So basically, you know, with good advertising and stories of previous investors, as I said,

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:14.020
[Guest]: you know, who made a killing by investing in the scheme, investors get caught in the

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:20.740
[Guest]: euphoria that is generated and hand over their hard-earned money, much against going against

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:21.740
[Guest]: common sense.

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:27.340
[Guest]: And, you know, I'd like to quote this economic historian called Charles Kindleberger here.

01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:33.260
[Guest]: And this is what he said, there is nothing so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:36.380
[Guest]: as to see a friend get rich.

01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:44.580
[Guest]: So again, I mean, it's basically boils down to herd mentality and the fear of missing

01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:45.580
[Guest]: out.

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:50.300
[Guest]: And overconfidence and over-optimism also have a role to play.

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:55.780
[Guest]: As you said that, you know, once you are invested into something, you tend to rationalize that

01:39:55.780 --> 01:40:03.500
[Guest]: because I'm already in it, this is going to work out right, which may or may not.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.020
[Guest]: Then there is the contrast effect, wherein you compare with all the other available options

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.860
[Guest]: and see that this is the best option going around.

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.260
[Guest]: Mental accounting also plays a role.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:20.780
[Guest]: Now, mental accounting as you know, if regular listeners, have you discussed mental accounting?

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:22.020
[Guest]: I'm sure you would have it in some way.

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:26.700
[Amit Varma]: I haven't discussed mental accounting per se, but it's a subject of episode two of economic

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.060
[Amit Varma]: funders now on Storytel.

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:34.900
[Guest]: Once it is released today, I'm going to take every opportunity to plug it.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.380
[Amit Varma]: I'm not plugging a Ponzi scheme.

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:44.220
[Amit Varma]: Free trial on Storytel, sign up at Storytel.com slash funders to just search for Amit Verma

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.300
[Amit Varma]: or Vivek Kaul or economic funders.

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.020
[Amit Varma]: Okay, we didn't plan this.

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.180
[Amit Varma]: This wasn't a planned plug.

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:57.540
[Guest]: So essentially, you know, what mental accounting was a term coined by Richard Thiller, as we

01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540
[Guest]: as we know.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:04.620
[Guest]: And he defined it as the inclination to categorize and treat money differently, depending on

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.020
[Guest]: where it comes from, and where it is kept and how it is spent.

01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:13.420
[Guest]: So basically, you know, gamblers who lose their winnings, for example, typically feel

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.020
[Guest]: that they haven't lost anything.

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:19.820
[Guest]: And though they would have been richer had they stopped while they were ahead, right?

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:23.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, the classic illustration of that is, let's say I sit down at a poker table

01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:28.500
[Amit Varma]: with a lakh, and I've turned it into two lakh, you know, so at the last hand of the day,

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:33.340
[Amit Varma]: if I feel like gambling it up, I'll say, okay, I'll gamble with my one lakh winnings.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:37.380
[Amit Varma]: While the truth is, had I sat down right there with two lakhs, I would not have gambled with

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.420
[Amit Varma]: an amount as big as a lakh.

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:44.340
[Amit Varma]: But because I have, you know, created separate mental accounts for what I came with and what

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:48.500
[Amit Varma]: I have won, you know, I am treating them differently.

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:53.740
[Guest]: So similarly, in a Ponzi scheme, once investors have got a certain return on their investment,

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:57.660
[Guest]: they do not hesitate to plow their returns back into the thing.

01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:03.100
[Guest]: So which is where mental accounting sort of comes into play.

01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:11.020
[Guest]: And obviously, I mean, the greater fool theory as we as we talked about, you know, in many

01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.660
[Guest]: cases, investors understand that it's a Ponzi scheme.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.980
[Amit Varma]: There's also sort of the Dunning-Kroger effect, which is a tendency of incompetent people

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.700
[Amit Varma]: to think that they're better than they really are.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:24.340
[Amit Varma]: And that I think plays out, especially when it comes to the stock market, because people

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:28.300
[Amit Varma]: will, for example, get a little half-baked knowledge, and then they will jharod that

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.820
[Amit Varma]: wisdom to everyone.

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:32.340
[Amit Varma]: And they will imagine them to be greater experts.

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:36.700
[Amit Varma]: And they actually are on the basis of that half-baked knowledge, which helps them rationalize

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.260
[Amit Varma]: the foolish investments they're making.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.180
[Guest]: And sometimes they're lucky they find it.

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:46.500
[Amit Varma]: And in an environment if all stocks are going up, yeah, so they end up, you know, because

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.980
[Amit Varma]: but I think most of the people who invest in a rising market tell themselves are making

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:50.980
[Amit Varma]: good investments.

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:55.420
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, they don't think about it as you know, it is I know this investment is stupid in

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:59.860
[Amit Varma]: terms of fundamental value, but it is rational because the likelihood of a greater fool is

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.860
[Amit Varma]: very high.

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:03.780
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I could respect an investor like that.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.340
[Amit Varma]: But I don't think most investors think like that way.

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:12.380
[Guest]: So yeah, so obviously, the greater fool theory is also at play, wherein, you know, some of

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:16.860
[Guest]: the investors and I have, you know, over the years met a lot of these investors who know

01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.980
[Guest]: that they're dealing with a Ponzi scheme, but they still go ahead because the entire

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.980
[Guest]: the feeling is that, you know, they will be able to get out the music playing you have

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:29.140
[Guest]: to dance before before the scheme collapses.

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:37.460
[Guest]: So these are some of the behavioral so called aspects which play a huge role, which sort

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:42.940
[Guest]: of, I mean, gets people to invest in a Ponzi scheme over and over again.

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.380
[Guest]: And I think the what also happens is, I mean, this has got nothing to do with behavioral

01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:48.380
[Guest]: aspects.

01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:54.300
[Guest]: I mean, as we discussed a little earlier, you know, in most cases, we don't come to

01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:58.620
[Guest]: know as to even you know, even when these frauds are caught, we don't know as to what

01:43:58.620 --> 01:43:59.620
[Guest]: happens to them.

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.140
[Guest]: I mean, take a case like speak Asia, right?

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.340
[Guest]: The scheme collapsed.

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.180
[Guest]: And you know, what happened to the guys who were running the scheme?

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:09.540
[Guest]: I mean, did the people get their money back?

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:15.900
[Guest]: So it's very important that this information also comes back to us.

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:20.820
[Guest]: Because, you know, if the people who are running these frauds are not getting punished, I mean,

01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:27.220
[Guest]: what stops people from, you know, running more of these frauds over and over again,

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:31.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if any editors of financial papers are listening, maybe that's a whole new feature.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.580
[Amit Varma]: You could do one of these weekends about what happened to fraudsters of the past.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:39.940
[Guest]: I mean, everyone from like, I mean, we do sort of, you know, people do get to know what

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.780
[Guest]: a, you know, Ketan Parekh is up to.

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:48.420
[Guest]: But Ketan Parekh was like this one big guy who, you know, who ran a scam and essentially

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:54.500
[Guest]: borrowed money from Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Bank and diverted it into the stock market

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:58.700
[Guest]: and pushed up what were then called the K10 stocks.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:01.180
[Guest]: Obviously, you know, his game ran out.

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:04.780
[Guest]: But I mean, but then there are so many of these small Ponzi schemes which are around

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:10.020
[Guest]: and a lot of them are MLM Ponzi schemes where money is lost.

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:15.300
[Guest]: But one really never comes to know as to what happens to the guys who, you know, ran these

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.300
[Guest]: schemes.

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:23.260
[Guest]: So, so a lot of the guys who run these Ponzi schemes, you know, have a halo effect around

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260
[Guest]: them.

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.220
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they have this infectious optimism, wealth creators, you know, we're going to

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:32.540
[Guest]: do this and we're going to get this right and, and, and obviously, you know, the media

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:39.580
[Guest]: loves, the media loves heroes, I mean, they make heroes only to sort of pull them down

01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.580
[Guest]: later.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:47.220
[Guest]: So, I remember of this, this, this quote, by this gentleman called C. Natesan, who ran

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.700
[Guest]: the Anubhav Plantation scheme.

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:56.940
[Guest]: So Natesan basically, you know, said that, I mean, so he sort of tried selling himself

01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:04.060
[Guest]: and his companies as someone who always was interested in planting trees and had now turned

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:07.060
[Guest]: it into a business.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.700
[Guest]: So I always wanted to plant trees.

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:13.420
[Guest]: As a child, I used to feel sad seeing trees burned down in my village in Tirunelveli.

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:19.180
[Guest]: Now, again, I mean, and then, I mean, we all remember Harshad Mehta, right?

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.900
[Guest]: So Harshad Mehta's scam was also like a Ponzi scheme, wherein he was siphoning off money

01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:28.700
[Guest]: from banks and, you know, then diverting it into the stock market and siphoning off more

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:32.740
[Guest]: money from banks and, you know, diverting it again into the stock market and, you know,

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.580
[Guest]: then, you know, he kept driving up the prices.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:41.340
[Guest]: So he apparently remarked once, in an interview, wherein he said that I thought I'd be like

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:47.980
[Guest]: Pied Piper, I thought I can sell dreams, that asset creation is not a crime, that if you

01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.540
[Guest]: want to be Harshad Mehta, come to the stock market.

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:57.060
[Guest]: Now, I mean, you know, this is such a, you know, optimistic thing to say, inspirational

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.060
[Amit Varma]: quote.

01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.140
[Amit Varma]: Hero of the common people.

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:05.100
[Guest]: And which is why I mean, this, this sort of, you know, gets us back to the social media.

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:08.900
[Guest]: And I don't know if it happens to you, it happens to me all the time where this random

01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:13.960
[Guest]: guy will come in and say, you know, if this, you know, why do you keep saying these negative

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.820
[Guest]: things and spoil the environment?

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:20.180
[Guest]: And why don't you talk about positive things and, you know, all this.

01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:24.580
[Amit Varma]: And the job of journalists anyway, is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.

01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:25.580
[Guest]: So you know,

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.860
[Guest]: And more than that, I mean, it's not my job to, you know, make you happy in life.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.140
[Amit Varma]: But we have a remarkable episode 12 dream reforms.

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:33.140
[Guest]: Yes, we did that.

01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.420
[Guest]: I mean, if people didn't, yeah.

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.660
[Guest]: So we give solutions also.

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:44.260
[Amit Varma]: But I think it's more of a job to sort of talk about all the things that are going wrong.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.900
[Amit Varma]: So people know about them, because acknowledging the problem is at least a first step to a

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.900
[Amit Varma]: solution.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.980
[Guest]: My aforementioned question, sorry, how do you sort of before you cut in my aforementioned

01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:59.860
[Amit Varma]: question to which I think is a legit question, which is that listen, yeah, most people do

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:04.580
[Amit Varma]: not have the cognitive bandwidth in terms of the time I mean, they're busy doing their

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.580
[Amit Varma]: everyday things.

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.700
[Amit Varma]: They don't have the cognitive bandwidth to take decisions on complex subjects like where

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.860
[Amit Varma]: should they invest their money and so on.

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:16.020
[Amit Varma]: My advice to people, for example, about the stock market always is and I think you'd agree

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.500
[Amit Varma]: with me is that unless you have studied it in great depth, don't invest in the stock

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.500
[Amit Varma]: market at all.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.660
[Amit Varma]: Because otherwise, you're one of the suckers like in poker, they say if you don't know

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.140
[Amit Varma]: who's the sucker at the table, it's you.

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:31.660
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, most people now don't have the time to get that kind of detailed knowledge.

01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:35.660
[Amit Varma]: They rely on all of these instincts, which you earlier mentioned, look around you what

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:40.380
[Amit Varma]: are successful people apparently doing, there is, you know, the FOMO effect comes into play

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.820
[Amit Varma]: So now if someone is to ask you that, listen, yeah, Vivek, I have a, I spend all my time

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:53.180
[Amit Varma]: and all my mental energy on making a living at whatever I do now, when I look to invest

01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:58.100
[Amit Varma]: or when these kinds of opportunities come up, what are the heuristics, which I should

01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:01.940
[Amit Varma]: apply to make sure that I am not being fooled?

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:04.580
[Amit Varma]: You know, what are the kinds of heuristics which I can look at?

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.980
[Amit Varma]: And I'll take a short at, you know, two quick answers which come to my mind, and then you

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.460
[Amit Varma]: can elaborate and give more of your own.

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is, there is no such thing as a free lunch.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.780
[Amit Varma]: If someone is offering you, for example, far greater rate of returns and everybody else

01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:23.420
[Amit Varma]: in the market, they must, you know, it fails a smell test, ask yourself, why that would

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.820
[Amit Varma]: be.

01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:29.900
[Amit Varma]: And the other heuristic I'd offer is that, again, it's a cliche, if it feels too good

01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:35.580
[Amit Varma]: to be true, it probably is, you know, these are my two heuristics that I would offer what

01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:36.580
[Guest]: are yours?

01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:37.580
[Guest]: Okay.

01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:45.420
[Guest]: I agree with you 100% on that, I mean, so anyone, so I would sort of put it in a slightly

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.500
[Guest]: more technical term.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:55.220
[Guest]: So the moment anyone other than a bank, okay, guarantees you a rate of return, you know

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.220
[Guest]: you're being fooled.

01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:59.480
[Guest]: I mean, it's very, very clear there.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.200
[Guest]: So you have to be careful about that.

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:07.740
[Guest]: The second thing is also, you know, you look at the fact that if, let's say banks are offering

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:13.020
[Guest]: a rate of interest of 7%, 6% or whatever, as they are right now.

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:23.020
[Guest]: So in that market, if someone's offering you a return of, let's say, 15% or 20%, you know

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:28.820
[Guest]: that there is something wrong there.

01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:32.940
[Guest]: Other than that, you know, so other than I think more than heuristics, you know, I have

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:43.020
[Guest]: these 10 points, which I think are useful for anyone who wants to generally plan their

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:44.020
[Guest]: personal finance.

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.060
[Guest]: And so, if you're okay with that, I can…

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.460
[Amit Varma]: Please, please give us all 10 points.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:57.580
[Guest]: So okay, now, I mean, before I get into the 10, I'll first give you some of the most basic

01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.580
[Guest]: points.

01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:05.660
[Guest]: So the most basic point in investing is never have all your eggs in one basket.

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:13.940
[Guest]: And this is, when I say this, I mean this within investments and across investments.

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:18.060
[Guest]: So what it basically means is that if, okay, you don't want to do anything in the world,

01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:22.580
[Guest]: you want to just deposit money in a bank, please don't go and deposit all your money

01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:23.580
[Guest]: in one bank.

01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:27.060
[Guest]: I mean, that is by far the most stupid thing you can do.

01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:31.140
[Guest]: I mean, after that, you can't claim that you know, you are financially illiterate and you're

01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.140
[Guest]: not very sophisticated.

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:37.420
[Guest]: And I mean, I find it, I mean, if you're educated enough to open a bank account, then you need

01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:40.700
[Guest]: to be educated enough to not have all your money in one bank.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.940
[Amit Varma]: At this point, Vivek has a slight smile on his face.

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:47.260
[Amit Varma]: At this point, I will inform my listeners very sheepishly that time and again, Vivek

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:51.740
[Amit Varma]: has berated me, because I have only one bank account, which is an HDFC bank, and I keep

01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.820
[Amit Varma]: telling him it won't shut down.

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:57.820
[Amit Varma]: But even if people take the money in that there is so little of it that who cares, buy

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.420
[Guest]: something nice, buy some vada pavs, kindly continue with other points.

01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.140
[Guest]: So that's the, you know, the most basic point.

01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:10.340
[Guest]: And I mean, if I mean, look at what has been happening with the PMC bank, and some of the

01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:14.780
[Guest]: videos floating around and people you know, there are people saying I had only 25 lakhs

01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.580
[Guest]: and all of it was in the in this bank.

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:22.980
[Guest]: Now, I mean, if you had 25 lakhs, and if you had the ability to earn those 25 lakhs, why

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.900
[Guest]: did you have all of it in one bank account?

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:30.140
[Guest]: I mean, I find it a little, you know, when people sort of, and especially in an era where

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:36.140
[Guest]: people spend so much time and energy in planning a holiday and but the moment they have to

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:40.540
[Guest]: plan their money, you know, all their faculties go for a toss.

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:44.660
[Guest]: I mean, I know so many people who spend weeks planning a holiday.

01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:48.580
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, you can spend one day planning your finances as well.

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:49.940
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's not going to hurt you in any way.

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:54.060
[Guest]: I just bought a new phone, and I spent so much time researching that I could have like,

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:57.740
[Guest]: so one of the things that I do in life, you know, when I need to buy a phone, I don't

01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.740
[Guest]: do any research, I have a price point.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:05.620
[Guest]: And I see as to you know, who's within that price point, which are the largest selling

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:08.420
[Guest]: phones, and I go and buy that phone.

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:12.380
[Guest]: Because if so many people are already making that mistake, you know, I can as well.

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:17.140
[Amit Varma]: And since our listeners are getting a bonanza of free funders from us during the show, I

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:21.780
[Amit Varma]: will offer another nugget Have you heard of this term called satisficing?

01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:26.660
[Amit Varma]: So satisficing is a portmanteau term, which is like, it's a combination of two existing

01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:29.740
[Amit Varma]: words, satisfying, and sufficing.

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:35.780
[Amit Varma]: And the concept comes from the fact that decisions tire us out, every decision takes a certain

01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:40.420
[Amit Varma]: amount of energy, leaving less energy for other decisions and indeed other work.

01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:45.220
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of people fight this what is known as decision fatigue, by satisficing when it

01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.220
[Amit Varma]: comes to purchases.

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.260
[Amit Varma]: So if you're doing a major purchase, like you're buying a house, obviously, you spend

01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.740
[Amit Varma]: the time to research that.

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:55.100
[Amit Varma]: But if you're buying a phone, or if you're buying a book, or if you're buying, you know,

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:59.940
[Amit Varma]: any electronic implement, then you know, you know that all the brands and all the categories

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:00.940
[Amit Varma]: are more or less okay.

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:07.440
[Amit Varma]: So you satisfy, you satisfy yourself with the first one that appears to suffice.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.860
[Amit Varma]: And it's called satisficing.

01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:15.140
[Amit Varma]: And and in fact, decision fatigue is also a reason, for example, why people like Steve

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.500
[Amit Varma]: Jobs, and now Mark Zuckerberg, they dress the same way every day, it feels like a uniform

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:22.060
[Guest]: like for Steve Jobs, it was a black belt.

01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:25.100
[Guest]: That was something that you don't have to take a decision, there was something that

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.140
[Amit Varma]: Albert Einstein started, Einstein started, there you go, it comes from the finest minds

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:32.780
[Guest]: that he wanted to save his mental energy.

01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:34.940
[Guest]: I think he had seven suits of the same kind.

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.940
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:39.220
[Guest]: Because he didn't want to spend time figuring out what to wear.

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:44.020
[Guest]: So in fact, I do that in my own little way, I have three shirts of the same kind.

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:50.500
[Amit Varma]: Ditto, I mean, I in fact, if you notice, last year, during my keto diet, I just cycled between

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.980
[Amit Varma]: black t shirts and jeans.

01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:54.780
[Guest]: So it just keeps the life.

01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:58.860
[Guest]: I mean, for jeans, I have just two pairs of jeans, and I just keep changing it to I have

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:04.260
[Amit Varma]: more, but I use just to figure out what to wear.

01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:08.620
[Guest]: Okay, so now, also, neither of us can afford more given the times we live.

01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:10.300
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, yeah, we are.

01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:13.100
[Guest]: I think we should start asking for donations also.

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.220
[Amit Varma]: Speaking of bubbles, I should ask you about the online journalism bubble at some point,

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:17.220
[Amit Varma]: but let that pass.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220
[Guest]: Let's continue.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.220
[Guest]: What's your second point?

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.220
[Guest]: No.

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.220
[Guest]: So these are, these are the 10 main points.

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:26.140
[Guest]: I mean, other than, you know, I didn't put I didn't want to put the diversification point

01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:28.260
[Guest]: into this, because it's just very, very basic.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.260
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:32.300
[Guest]: So if you can't even do that, then I mean, God help you.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:37.380
[Guest]: So if your family is dependent on you, buy a term insurance policy.

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:42.100
[Guest]: If no one is dependent on you, you don't need insurance, okay?

01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:46.980
[Guest]: Stay away from investment plans, which pretend to be insurance, endowment, money back, you

01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:49.340
[Guest]: lips, life will be very simple.

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:53.420
[Guest]: Buy a house if you're planning to live in it.

01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:56.740
[Guest]: Stay away from under construction properties as far as possible.

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.960
[Guest]: Further, try to buy an apartment in a society where people are already living.

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.060
[Guest]: So that if there is some, you know, bureaucratic or administrative problem, you're not the

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.140
[Guest]: only one running around, when there are other people involved.

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:14.820
[Guest]: And in India, it is very, very important because, you know, all societies have some lafda at

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.940
[Guest]: the end of the day.

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:20.380
[Guest]: Have a health insurance policy for your entire family.

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:25.820
[Guest]: To meet emergencies, have some money in a bank account, which could meet expenses of

01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:28.780
[Guest]: three to six months, I mean, at the very basic.

01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:34.660
[Guest]: If you want the ability to make decisions that you feel are correct, at any point of

01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:39.180
[Guest]: time in your life, you need at least two years of expenses in the bank account.

01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:46.580
[Guest]: I mean, then you can, you know, ask your boss to fuck off and do what the right thing is,

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.000
[Guest]: what you feel the right thing is.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.740
[Guest]: But without that, you can't.

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:57.060
[Guest]: Have an SIP running on a few good equity mutual funds, review the performance once a year.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:00.460
[Guest]: Don't go looking at the returns every week, a lot of people do that.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:05.860
[Guest]: If not every week, at least they have a tendency to look at every month.

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:09.660
[Guest]: There is good research that shows that people who look at their returns regularly tend to

01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:13.980
[Guest]: invest in equity for shorter terms than people who don't, and which basically means then

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.540
[Guest]: you lose out on returns.

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.260
[Guest]: After a certain age, make a will.

01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:23.620
[Guest]: Also make sure that when it comes to all your investments, nominations are in place.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:27.540
[Guest]: Because I mean, I have seen a few issues of where, you know, the husband has died and

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:33.520
[Guest]: the wife has no idea where he had invested and, and it's too late to sort of start again

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.820
[Guest]: from scratch.

01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:39.740
[Guest]: Make your tax saving investments at the beginning of the year, if you're investing in things

01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:43.180
[Guest]: like public provident fund, or do them through the year.

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:47.460
[Guest]: If you're investing in things like let's say a tax saving mutual fund, don't wake up in

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:51.420
[Guest]: the last week of the year to make your tax saving investment when you're more likely

01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:56.340
[Guest]: to be taken for a ride because you'll end up investing in anything, you know, anyone

01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:01.580
[Guest]: who basically comes to your house and just gets you to sign whatever paper they want

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.180
[Guest]: to.

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:07.260
[Guest]: Also be careful when you go to a bank for anything, because these days, they you know,

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.920
[Guest]: the moment you enter a bank, they want to sell you things that you don't need.

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.320
[Guest]: Make sure that you end up doing what you had gone there for, okay.

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.440
[Guest]: So I mean, the example like I like to give here is that someone sold a pension plan to

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:26.020
[Guest]: my father a few weeks before he was retiring, okay, so thankfully, I found out and you know,

01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:31.500
[Guest]: so all insurance policies, again, remember this all so called insurance policies have

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.900
[Guest]: a 15 day look in period.

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:38.420
[Guest]: So if you want, don't feel comfortable with it, you can go ahead and return it and get

01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:39.740
[Guest]: your money back.

01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:46.800
[Guest]: Also, finally, and you know, no one ever made money out of investing by watching TV channels.

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:52.260
[Guest]: So you have to, you know, stay as far away from the CNBCs of the world if you really

01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.420
[Guest]: want to make any money in life.

01:58:55.420 --> 01:59:01.340
[Guest]: So these are I think, the 10 basic things, they're not very difficult, there is no rocket

01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:03.180
[Guest]: science involved here.

01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:06.340
[Guest]: And all of this can be easily executed.

01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:07.340
[Amit Varma]: Very wise words.

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:12.060
[Amit Varma]: And I think many of our listeners should certainly listen to this part again and take notes.

01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:15.020
[Amit Varma]: I really don't have much funds to invest.

01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:17.180
[Amit Varma]: So it's not very useful to me.

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.300
[Amit Varma]: Someday you should tell me about you know, how can I actually make some money that I

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.300
[Amit Varma]: can later invest?

01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:23.100
[Guest]: Do you have any schemes in mind?

01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:26.740
[Guest]: Let's start a Ponzi scheme, Amit.

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.740
[Guest]: Let's start a Ponzi scheme.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:32.060
[Guest]: And what we'll do is, we'll have the podcast as the business model.

01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.060
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:34.660
[Amit Varma]: All these listeners built up for what?

01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:39.620
[Guest]: We'll obviously and we'll say that, you know, if you invest in these podcasts, let's say

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:45.500
[Guest]: 10,000 rupees, we'll give you 15,000 at the end of the year 50% return is pretty amazing.

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:47.820
[Amit Varma]: And they'll trust me because I always deliver.

01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:54.020
[Guest]: And the model will be that we'll have ads in the podcast and those ads will give us

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.020
[Guest]: the returns.

01:59:55.020 --> 02:00:01.620
[Guest]: And before one year, we'll just take the money and possibly go to Antigua, where you can

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:04.020
[Amit Varma]: buy citizenship for as low as $100,000.

02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.020
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going there, bro.

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:07.020
[Amit Varma]: They don't like cows, Antigua.

02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:08.020
[Amit Varma]: Let's...

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:14.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, we shall inflict neither bad jokes nor any such scheme on you.

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.380
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you get our awesome content for free.

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.380
