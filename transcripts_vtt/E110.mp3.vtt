00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
[Amit Varma]: The Economist magazine coined this phrase in 1977 in the context of the Netherlands,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: which had a stroke of good fortune when natural gas was discovered in Groningen in 1959.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Or was it really good fortune?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Because of this natural resource, foreign exchange flooded into the country and their own currency became stronger.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: This meant imports became cheaper and people could now afford the best goods from across the world.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Amit Varma]: As a result of this, the local manufacturing sector went into decline.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: What initially seemed like good luck, later appeared to be not quite so lucky after all.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: A classic modern case of the Dutch disease is Venezuela.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Large reserves of oil were discovered there more than a century ago in 1914,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: and a relatively poor country, suddenly sitting on humongous oil reserves, became quite rich as the years went by.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: But what this also did was that it lowered the incentives for the governments that ran the country

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Amit Varma]: to learn the good habits that take a nation towards prosperity.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
[Amit Varma]: There was so much oil wealth that governments quickly developed patterns of patronage and cronyism.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Bad governance and poor economic policies did not have the cost they should have

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[Amit Varma]: because there was always so much oil wealth floating around.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
[Amit Varma]: In a situation like this, sooner or later, something always has to give.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Venezuela is now going through an enormous humanitarian crisis,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: caused by bad economics but enabled by the bonanza of oil.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll explore some of that in this episode, but before I do, here's a thought.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Does the same process by which too much of a good thing can be bad for countries,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: can it also be bad for individuals?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to the Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: The 19th century Venezuelan hero Simon Bolivar once said,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: to understand revolutions and their participants, we must observe them at close range

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and judge them at great distance.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Alexandra Ulmer, who spent a few years studying Venezuela at close range,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: as an oil correspondent for Reuters based in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: but is now based in Bombay, at some distance from Venezuela.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I asked her to join me on the show to chat not just about Venezuela,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
[Amit Varma]: but also the craft of news reporting, as the title of this episode, Reporting Venezuela, indicates.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: But before we begin our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
[Amit Varma]: including fridge magnets with some stunning motifs,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vasvo X Vasvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip Sharma,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Shruti Nelson and Pradeep Mishra.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and even if you want to buy just for yourself or a friend,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Amit Varma]: head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[Amit Varma]: That's colors with an O-U.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you want a 20% discount, apply the code IVM20.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
[Amit Varma]: That's I-V-M for IVM Podcast.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
[Amit Varma]: IVM20 for a 20% discount at IndianColors.com.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in The Unseen, Alexandra.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit. Such a treat to be here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about how you became a journalist.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
[Amit Varma]: What drew you towards journalism?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Guest]: I had always had two twin passions, one of them was current affairs,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
[Guest]: and the other one was writing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
[Guest]: And for some strange reason, I never really thought to put them together

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
[Guest]: until I was at university and I started working on this school paper.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
[Guest]: And I remember not being able to sleep the night before my first article,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Guest]: which was something very mundane and uninteresting, came out.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Guest]: And that's when I knew I was hooked.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So where did you go from there?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: I started as an intern with Reuters in Buenos Aires.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: I was fascinated with Latin America and wanted to get going there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
[Guest]: Then went on to be a stringer for Reuters again in Chile,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
[Guest]: just on the other side of the Andes,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Guest]: where I did a lot of reporting on economics and mining

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
[Guest]: and learned a lot more about how the world goes around,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Guest]: but was frankly a little bored as a journalist.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Guest]: And then Venezuela came to the fore, and about four years ago I moved to Caracas.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And what's a food chain of journalism like?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Like you begin as an intern, then you're a stringer,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
[Amit Varma]: then you're a full-fledged reporter.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
[Amit Varma]: How does the job description change?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Amit Varma]: What are the kind of things that you did on the job?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Guest]: So as an intern in Buenos Aires, I had the best of all worlds.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
[Guest]: I was able to cover fun but also fundamental events

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[Guest]: like the legalization of gay marriage in Argentina,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: and I wrote soft features on being a vegetarian in Buenos Aires,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Guest]: the meat capital of the world.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
[Amit Varma]: You're a vegetarian?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I am.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: Horror.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: I've never been as happy as I am in India.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to Mumbai!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Yes, thank you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: It's very refreshing after the barbecues of Latin America.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[Amit Varma]: I'd trade places with you any day.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: Yeah, well, then if you're a meat lover, Argentina is the place.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Guest]: And, you know, as you go up the food chain as a stringer,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
[Guest]: I had a lot of responsibilities for somewhat mindless tasks

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
[Unknown]: like at the time covering the local stock market,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: running out to press conferences, learning the ropes,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
[Guest]: which is essential and is what you build on to become a better journalist.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And what are the sort of values that you picked up in,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: which you pick up in any good news organization,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, like Reuters obviously is,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the kind of journalism you do?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Amit Varma]: What's the rigor that you have to follow?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
[Guest]: It's incredibly rigorous.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
[Guest]: It's a fantastic school of journalism.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
[Guest]: It's daunting because you're learning on the spot,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest]: and journalism in that sense is much more of a craft

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: than something you learn within an established school or institution.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
[Guest]: So you learn to be rigorous with your facts.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
[Guest]: You learn to check with sources.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
[Guest]: You learn to question everything.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
[Guest]: You learn to be fair.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
[Guest]: Of course, all these issues are deeply philosophical,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
[Guest]: and we can debate them at great length because there's no perfect recipe for it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
[Guest]: But especially, I think, as a foreign news outlet in countries

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
[Guest]: where sometimes the local media is coward

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
[Guest]: or doesn't have the resources to cover something as well as it would have otherwise,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
[Guest]: you become a frame of reference.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Guest]: So there's great responsibility on having smart, articulate, fair coverage.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the very clear demarcations in foreign media

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is the line between news and opinion,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Amit Varma]: which sometimes gets muddy in India.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And you were, of course, a reporter all along.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, how do you sort of get to that level of objectivity

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
[Amit Varma]: where you sort of keep your feelings about what you're reporting

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
[Amit Varma]: out of your reportage itself?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, do you have to make a special effort to do that?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you go too far?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
[Guest]: I think you always have to be careful.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: I think in some ways it's easier when you're not reporting on your own country

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
[Guest]: because you're more detached from the situation.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: But, you know, being fair also entails portraying the situation accurately.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: Like one of the old adages in journalism is

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: if one person says it's raining outside,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
[Guest]: the other person says it's, you know, a beautiful, glorious day

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
[Guest]: and you should go to the beach, your job isn't to portray both sides.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: Your job is to open the curtains and tell readers what's going on.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
[Guest]: Now, that's a clean-cut example.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
[Guest]: In the real world, it can get muddier than that.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
[Guest]: But I think trying to find the sweet spot between being fair

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
[Guest]: to the different sides and ideas involved,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: but also, you know, not just being a robot who's throwing out the facts

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
[Guest]: coming from different sides and actually assessing how the situation is evolved,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
[Guest]: how politicians or whoever's claims stake up to what they've actually done

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: is in essence an essential part of our job.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, like you said, the example you gave is clear-cut.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
[Amit Varma]: When it comes to something like covering a country like Venezuela, for example,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
[Amit Varma]: where the economics is very complicated,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Amit Varma]: the politics is very complicated, society is complicated,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
[Amit Varma]: then does it involve a case of just having to learn a lot of things

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Amit Varma]: before you can even begin to report?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: I think so.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
[Guest]: But I think in a place like Venezuela, which essentially has become devoid of fact,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest]: it's very difficult to do that.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Guest]: I'll give you an example.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Guest]: Venezuela has rampant corruption.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: We know that is one of the fundamental reasons this government has been so inept

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
[Guest]: and has basically left Venezuela penniless.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Guest]: For a long time, it was very difficult for us to say that.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
[Guest]: We knew money was disappearing, but if you don't have the proof,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
[Guest]: you don't write it if you're a rigorous journalist.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
[Guest]: Of course, now there are multiple cases across the United States and in Europe

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
[Guest]: where, you know, a single businessman has been accused

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Guest]: and has pleaded guilty to embezzling, say, a billion dollars.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
[Guest]: That gives you an idea of the scale of graft we're talking about.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Guest]: But for a long time, it can be frustrating because to be a rigorous reporter,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: you can't just throw around baseless claims,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: but that also means you're missing a fundamental part of the story

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: that you're struggling to tell the readers,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
[Guest]: and I think that's the deepest frustration there can be.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because there must be times when you absolutely know something,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
[Amit Varma]: but you cannot say it, and you have to kind of get there from other places.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So before you went to Venezuela, did you want to go to Venezuela,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
[Amit Varma]: or was it something that Reuters offered you the opportunity,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and then you looked into it and said, huh, that's interesting?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: No, I had been fascinated by Venezuela, mesmerized for a long time.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: I had gotten a student grant when I was at university

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
[Guest]: to do a project on political street art there,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
[Guest]: as one does when one is a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed university student.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
[Guest]: And I had spent two weeks in the country

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Guest]: and had been reading obsessively ever since,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: but I was very deterred by the security situation there

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
[Guest]: and never thought I could actually live there

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Amit Varma]: because it was too dangerous and scared me.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Which year was this?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I went there as a student in 2011.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Guest]: And moved there in 2014 after going for a brief stint

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
[Guest]: and seeing that I could live there, you know, despite the crime concerns.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
[Amit Varma]: So when you started reporting in Venezuela, how easy was access?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
[Guest]: Well, access on the street to people was wonderfully easy.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest]: I mean, Venezuelans are expansive, fun, Caribbean people who love to chat.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Guest]: So after Chile, which is a much kind of more dour, closed society,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest]: it was a treat for me to just go out

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[Guest]: and be able to interview people in the supermarket lines

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Guest]: and have them genuinely tell me about their lives and their sufferings.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Guest]: Because they wanted to, they wanted to be heard,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
[Guest]: and that's the way they are.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Guest]: Conversely, the government is fairly shut off.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[Guest]: At the time, we still had the occasional press conference.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: Sometimes they would answer questions,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
[Guest]: but it was the kind of situation where GDP, inflation, crime data,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
[Guest]: emigration data, none of that was being published anymore.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: As you mentioned at the start of the podcast, I covered oil,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
[Guest]: and that meant covering the big, omnipresent state oil company.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
[Guest]: I spent four years in Venezuela,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
[Guest]: and I genuinely don't think they ever answered one of my questions.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
[Guest]: You know, when you're writing a story,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[Guest]: you send in a request for comment by phone or by email

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Guest]: to give the person concerned a chance to respond,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: and I never got a single answer to my emails.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[Guest]: I mean, it's that kind of black hole situation you're talking about.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: So it forces you to be a kind of creative, enterprising reporter

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
[Guest]: to get to the stories,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
[Guest]: which always means you're missing a significant chunk of data

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Guest]: and the government side.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[Guest]: At the end of the day, it's self-defeating for the government

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
[Guest]: because they don't speak out, right?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Right, and of course, distrust towards the media is an attitude

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Amit Varma]: that really came out much earlier from the time Chávez took over

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Amit Varma]: because like a lot of populists,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
[Amit Varma]: he kind of looked at the media as part of the elites

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
[Amit Varma]: who were antagonistic to him,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and he tried to sort of control communications and all of that,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: parallels of which we see in many other countries.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how Venezuela got here,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, starting from before Maduro,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
[Amit Varma]: like when Maduro was president,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
[Amit Varma]: starting from maybe even before Chávez,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
[Amit Varma]: like a lot of people lay the blame quite correctly

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Amit Varma]: for what's going on to the bad economic policies in Chávez's time,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
[Amit Varma]: which have continued with Maduro.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But Venezuela was both oil rich and in deep trouble a lot before that.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Guest]: It's been a turbulent history. Tell me a little bit about that.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
[Guest]: Absolutely. I mean, it's been a cycle of booms and busts

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: basically due to the oil barrel.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: So Venezuela was, by some metrics,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: one of the richest countries in Latin America

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
[Guest]: where this elite, this filthy rich would travel to Miami

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Guest]: and famously say, give me two of everything, it's so cheap.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Guest]: Of course, that fueled a lot of inequality and discontent

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Guest]: and a sense that the political establishment,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
[Guest]: which was basically two political parties that would rotate power

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: through democratic elections,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Guest]: but rotate power amongst themselves, wasn't representative.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Guest]: And there had been sporadic violence and turbulence

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Guest]: in the country for a long time.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
[Guest]: And Chávez, who came from a poor family from the Savannah lowlands,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: really spoke to the people who felt marginalized by the system.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Guest]: And because Venezuela is an oil rich country,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Guest]: there's this idea that we are a rich country.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: We should not be poor. This something has gone wrong

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
[Guest]: and someone is to blame for it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
[Guest]: And Chávez diagnosed that problem brilliantly, as many populists do,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Guest]: and was elected in 1998.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
[Guest]: There was immediate virulent opposition to him

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: from the elite in media and politics, etc.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Guest]: And that culminated in a series of marches in 2002

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Guest]: that led to a brief coup against him,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Guest]: where he was deposed for three days.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[Guest]: It remains a very complex, fiercely argued about episode

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: about exactly what happened to him.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
[Guest]: Ultimately, he was reinstated by military loyalists.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
[Guest]: And after that, some would say,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: he became much more paranoid about any attempts against him

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: and clamped down much more on institutions,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
[Guest]: the press, and any opposition he could see.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there are memorable reports that during the coup,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
[Amit Varma]: he chatted with a hero of his, Fidel Castro, on the phone.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And Castro told him that, you know, whatever you do,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
[Amit Varma]: don't surrender.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting to me how, you know, obviously,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
[Amit Varma]: from 1958 to 1998, you had this sort of kleptocracy,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
[Amit Varma]: this oligarchy of these two parties,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Amit Varma]: which kind of controlled the economy in the system of patronage,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
[Amit Varma]: where the oil wealth was sort of,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and which was also incredibly corrupt.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And Chávez detected that correctly and got to power.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But what I always find kind of interesting is that

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
[Amit Varma]: for the first five or six years of his time,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
[Amit Varma]: he professed himself to be non-ideological,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
[Amit Varma]: where he said, I'm not a communist, I'm not a capitalist,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Amit Varma]: even though, I mean, he had communist influences.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
[Amit Varma]: He was a big fan of Marx and various other communist thinkers

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
[Amit Varma]: right from his student days.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: But, you know, he said, I believe in the third way,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
[Amit Varma]: which was, you know, perhaps a reference to Tony Blair's third way.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
[Amit Varma]: But after 2002 and then 2004,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
[Amit Varma]: what seemed to happen is that he hardened enormously

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and spoke about 21st century socialism

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and went in all the directions that he went in.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So do you think that sort of change in direction

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
[Amit Varma]: came from political imperatives?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest]: It's a very interesting question.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: I undoubtedly think that he felt very vulnerable

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
[Guest]: after the coup and after being reinstated.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
[Guest]: And his instinct was to try to therefore control whatever he could.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: And the influence of Fidel Castro and other politicians

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
[Guest]: led to him pushing for much more control over the economy, especially.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: And he enacted a series of policies

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
[Guest]: that would really be the downfall of Venezuela ultimately,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: namely imposing currency controls in 2003,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: which is what led to the mind-boggling distortions

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: we see today in Venezuela

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Guest]: that are to blame for much of the current crisis.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
[Guest]: And yes, I think he's a dominating personality

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
[Guest]: and he was a dominating politician.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: He was a dominating president.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
[Guest]: His instinct was to control. Yes.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of became worse, A, because he's got Castro advising him

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Amit Varma]: on one side and on the other side.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the reason I sort of thought of that

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Amit Varma]: was when I was kind of reading through all of this,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
[Amit Varma]: one parallel that came to mind was our own earlier Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
[Amit Varma]: who, you know, took over the Congress party in the mid-60s,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
[Amit Varma]: but she was fighting against the established order in her own party.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And to distinguish herself from them,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
[Amit Varma]: she took this populist socialist line and did a lot of things

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Amit Varma]: which were economically disastrous,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
[Amit Varma]: but which if you understand the political imperatives

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and a need to create a brand for herself

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and distinguish herself from them kind of made sense.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the other part of, I mean,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot about Chavez reminds me of Narendra Modi as well.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other part of his rise to power

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and what happened when he got there was just kind of like

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Amit Varma]: a dog chasing a car and catching the car and not knowing what to do

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
[Amit Varma]: because he was incredibly good at campaigning.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Guest]: He had no idea whatsoever of how to govern.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
[Guest]: Interesting analogy.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, Chavez at heart was a showman, right?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
[Guest]: And he had the whole country or much of the country behind him.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: The masses loved him.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Guest]: It was like religious fervor going to his rallies.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
[Guest]: It was unlike anything anyone had seen before.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
[Guest]: And when you had that kind of unquestioning love,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
[Guest]: his worst instincts were unleashed, right?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
[Guest]: And Venezuela was a democracy,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
[Guest]: but it didn't have entirely solid institutions.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
[Guest]: And when Chavez was in power from 1999 to 2013,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
[Guest]: he had plenty of time to dig away at them.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: But I think, yes, his instinct was always to campaign.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: And he would always boast,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: we've had more elections than anywhere else in the world.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
[Guest]: How can you criticize us for not being a democracy?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: But that's what he reveled in, right?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: And that's what he loved, not the day-to-day nitty gritty.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: And that tendency was exacerbated by the fact that

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
[Guest]: during 10 years of his governance, you had an oil bonanza.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Guest]: You didn't have to worry about the nitty gritty.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Amit Varma]: The oil money was just gushing in.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And this happened because 9-11 happened,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore the oil spigot slowed down in the Middle East,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and Venezuela was certainly much in demand.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And also he kind of revived the OPEC at this time, right?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
[Guest]: Yes, yes, he was instrumental in that.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
[Guest]: And I think the fact that the oil prices shot up was a saving grace.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Guest]: I mean, politics is also about luck,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Guest]: and Chávez was an incredibly lucky politician.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: You know, I obviously don't want to be morbid,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
[Guest]: but for instance, he also happened to die

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
[Guest]: right before the economy took a turn for the worst.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: So even his exit was perfectly timed in terms of his legacy

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: in the eyes of his supporters, right?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, just looking through his career,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are various parts where he got so lucky.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, he almost didn't get through into the army

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Amit Varma]: because he failed his chemistry exam, right?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Amit Varma]: And had that not happened,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Amit Varma]: the subsequent events wouldn't have worked out the way they did.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Amit Varma]: That while in the army for years,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Amit Varma]: he wanted to overthrow the government,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
[Amit Varma]: not because he had anything against the government

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
[Amit Varma]: or any particular precedent, but he just wanted to get to power.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And he was planning a coup as administrations changed one by one.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
[Amit Varma]: He's single-mindedly planning a coup for the sake of power itself.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, even when he, you know,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
[Amit Varma]: he attempted a coup in 1992 and he failed,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and he would have disappeared into oblivion and into prison.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
[Amit Varma]: He had the powers that be not decided to put him on television.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
[Amit Varma]: So he could tell his co-conspirators to surrender.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And he suddenly became a media star after that.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: I mean, he capitalized on those few minutes on television and said,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Guest]: we failed for ahora, for now,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
[Guest]: which became the slogan that everyone repeated.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
[Guest]: And then he was pardoned, of course,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
[Guest]: and got out and became a political figure in his own right.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Guest]: So yes, from the chemistry exam to being pardoned,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Amit Varma]: the stars aligned for him.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting how, you know,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Amit Varma]: people close to him talk about how his personality changed so suddenly

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Amit Varma]: at two different parts of his life.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
[Amit Varma]: One is once he comes on television and he becomes a superstar,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and he literally becomes a sex symbol.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Women everywhere are dying to have his baby, so to say,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Amit Varma]: as one biographer put it.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other when he actually comes to power,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, when he comes to power and he, you know,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
[Amit Varma]: enters Miraflores, I think the presidential palace,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
[Amit Varma]: he just becomes a completely different person and his allies from the period

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
[Amit Varma]: before that eventually all get disillusioned one by one and move on.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Guest]: And he ends up surrounding himself with yes-men.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And he ends up surrounding himself with yes-men.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if you look at Maduro today,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Amit Varma]: just reading the biographies of Chavez,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
[Amit Varma]: the one thing that kind of struck me is that the only extraordinary thing

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Amit Varma]: about Maduro is that he never said no to Chavez,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
[Amit Varma]: that he was almost like, you know,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
[Amit Varma]: like again Indira Gandhi said about a former president of ours,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Gyani Zayal Singh, before he became president,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Amit Varma]: that if I ask him to clean my toilets, he will.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And you get the same kind of sense about sort of Chavez and Maduro.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's really the reason Maduro kind of got to power to begin with.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: Yes. I mean, he describes himself as the son of Chavez.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: He stakes his entire legacy on Chavez.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Right. So again, extraordinary luck for Maduro as well.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about the confluence of oil and politics

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
[Amit Varma]: through the decades in Venezuela.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, obviously, they discover oil, they're very lucky.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Then they come to these deals where, for example,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
[Amit Varma]: these foreign companies first come and they start taking the oil.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And then they have these 50-50 arrangements where they get,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
[Amit Varma]: share 50% of the profits with the state.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And then that tilts further to the state.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And then it's Venezuela, which actually forms OPEC.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Amit Varma]: So all the power goes to the sort of –

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
[Amit Varma]: that actually pushes for the formation of OPEC.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Amit Varma]: So all the power goes to the states rather than the companies.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And then gradually that in the mid-'70s leads to the formation

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
[Amit Varma]: of the state oil company PVDSA.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the role oil played in politics

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
[Amit Varma]: through the decades.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: Yes. Well, oil is indistinguishable from Venezuela.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
[Guest]: And the Venezuelan economy has always been hugely dependent on oil.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
[Guest]: You mentioned the Dutch disease, and that impeded Venezuela

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
[Guest]: from having enough efficient industry and agriculture,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Guest]: although it did have those sectors in the 70s and 80s.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: But Chávez's big criticism was that the foreign companies

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: were getting too sweet a deal in Venezuela under the former governments.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: And so very quickly, when he comes to power,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
[Guest]: he understands that PVDSA, the state oil company,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: will be crucial to his fortunes.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
[Guest]: And, in fact, the lead-up to the coup, there's a strike

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
[Guest]: by PVDSA workers and engineers against Chávez.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: So they bring the oil industry to a standstill,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Guest]: which again shocks the oil market and completely attacks

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
[Guest]: the Venezuelan economy.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest]: And ultimately, as we know, Chávez prevails,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
[Guest]: and he absolutely purges the state oil company.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: And so all these engineers who supported the opposition

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: and walked off their jobs are fired.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: There's huge turnover.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Guest]: A lot of these people incidentally ended up immigrating

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: to Colombia or Canada and helping basically create

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Guest]: the Colombian oil industry, so benefiting other countries.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Guest]: And gradually, over time, PVDSA becomes a fiefdom for Chavismo.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Guest]: For a long time, it maintains operational capacity,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Guest]: even though it's highly indebted, inefficient, and corrupt,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Guest]: but it still kind of has the veneer of a functional company.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
[Guest]: But throughout my time there, you just saw it close off.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Guest]: And in the last year, Maduro put a general in charge

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
[Guest]: of the state oil company because the military is absolutely

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Guest]: the other kind of crucial part to understanding Venezuela.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
[Guest]: And generals have been sweetened by all these deals

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: that Maduro's offered them, you know, mining stakes,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Guest]: control over imports, and the oil industry,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Guest]: which is the crown jewel, as a way of rewarding them

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
[Guest]: for their loyalty and ensuring that they continue

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Guest]: to be loyal to him.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[Guest]: And it's led to an exodus of your low-level workers

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
[Guest]: who are already unable to eat three square meals a day

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Guest]: because they're just earning a handful of dollars a month.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
[Guest]: Of course, you know, any engineer or chemist has fled

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
[Guest]: because they're not earning anything more.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
[Guest]: They're often working in dangerous refineries

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Guest]: that haven't had proper maintenance work in years

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[Guest]: and are a big threat.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Guest]: And it's also actually very dangerous out in the oil fields

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: because large parts of Venezuela are essentially lawless.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
[Guest]: And you're very exposed to theft and gangs looking

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: to rob copper or rob you in the oil installations.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
[Guest]: So the whole industry is completely unraveled,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
[Guest]: which is a huge threat for Maduro given that more than 90%

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: of the income, the country, comes from oil now

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Guest]: because all the other industries have fallen by the wayside.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: And now, with the new sanctions from the Trump administration,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
[Guest]: it's getting even harder for him to export oil.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
[Guest]: So yet again, oil will be one of the big deciding factors

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
[Amit Varma]: in what happens in Venezuela.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And this process was, like, it's common to all populists, really,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
[Amit Varma]: that they attack the institutions in their countries

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
[Amit Varma]: which are supposed to act as checks and balances.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And again, one of the things that Chávez did when he came to power

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
[Amit Varma]: is that he put military officers everywhere.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, this whole trend of...

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
[Amit Varma]: So even in the PDVSA, after the strike happened

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and he laid off all the employees or whatever,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
[Amit Varma]: he then put military officers in charge

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and completely changed the way the institution worked

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of sort of doing what people call petro-diplomacy,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Amit Varma]: where he would, you know, offer sweet deals to neighboring countries

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Amit Varma]: which had communist leaders he was friendly with to get them on his side.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And a large chunk of petrodollars, therefore,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
[Amit Varma]: started going into this kind of diplomacy

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and doing special favors to people and so on and so forth.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Guest]: Exactly. Cuba has been one of the big recipients of this petro-diplomacy.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
[Guest]: You know, Venezuela still sends oil to Cuba

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
[Guest]: and Cuba, quote-unquote, repays Venezuela

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: by sending doctors and other security personnel to the country

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: in what Maduro's critics say is a grossly unfair trade-off.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Guest]: And especially because it's fairly well-known in Cuba,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[Guest]: then Cuba then resells a lot of the oil it receives from Venezuela for profit.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is a marvelously capitalistic thing for Cuba to do.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And let's talk about what happened to the currency, for example.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, one of the books you recommended I read

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Amit Varma]: before we do this podcast was Crude Nation by Raúl Gallegos

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and that starts off with this fascinating chapter

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Amit Varma]: on how there are four currency rates,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
[Amit Varma]: like three different official currency rates for the dollars

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and then there's another one which is black market

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and the top rate is like you pay a handful of bolivars for a dollar

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and then you increasingly pay more and more bolivars

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and obviously your cronies and people you favor get them at the cheapest rate

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's a whole industry where you're sort of, you know,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Amit Varma]: buying dollars in the cheap and selling dollars in the black market

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Amit Varma]: for far more money.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
[Amit Varma]: When you landed up there, how was it? How did you manage?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
[Guest]: Well, it's an extraordinary system that you end up being very agile in

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Guest]: because you're always jumping between different currency systems.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
[Guest]: But when I arrived, first of all, your bank card doesn't work.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: No foreign cards work.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
[Guest]: You could take money out but at an extraordinarily unfavorable rate

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: so you'd be getting a dollar out,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
[Guest]: effectively getting what's worth a dollar on the black market

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest]: but spending maybe $50 for it in your bank account.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
[Guest]: So what someone like me or others get is a middleman, right,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest]: who you wire money to from your bank account abroad to his bank account abroad

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: and then he wires bolivares from his account to your account in Venezuela

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
[Guest]: and that allows you to navigate the system.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Guest]: But it creates an enormous amount of distortions.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
[Guest]: So, for instance, for a long time, foreign airlines priced their airfare

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: in local currency but at the pegged official rate.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest]: So that meant people could fly literally from Caracas to London

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: for the equivalent of $40 if they were buying their currency

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
[Guest]: on the black market, right?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: So it was a free-for-all.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Guest]: It was this bizarre distorted party that people were taking care of.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
[Guest]: Of course, someone has to pick up the bill

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Guest]: and foreign airlines are now owed a total of about $4 billion

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Guest]: because the Venezuelan government never then reimbursed them as promised.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Guest]: So that's the kind of distorted magical realism side of it.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: The real-world impact of it is that nothing worked, right,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: because what you're supposed to trust, which is money,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: which has a certain value and creates trust and creates your chain,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
[Guest]: was completely distorted.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
[Guest]: So things just didn't function.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
[Guest]: Importers wouldn't import because they wouldn't have access

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: to the official currency because that was reserved for cronies

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: and so had to go to the black market rate if they could afford it

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: and then pass that cost on to customers.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Guest]: If not, they folded shop.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
[Guest]: So that was really the deathblow to the Venezuelan economy,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: the incredible distortions in the currency.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And then this differing access to the dollar

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[Amit Varma]: then creates different classes of people, right?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
[Guest]: I mean, the Venezuelans have a lot of vernacular

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
[Guest]: for what has happened in the last 10 years

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: and there's an expression which is boliburgues.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: So it's a play on burguesia, so the bourgeoisie,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: and boli being bolivariano,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: which is this kind of following that Chávez created

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: based on Simón Bolívar.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: So basically, these are the new rich,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: those who benefited from the government's largesse.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: The other term for them is enchufados,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: so those who are plugged in.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Guest]: That's essentially what they are.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Guest]: They're plugged into the system,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest]: so they get dollars at a preferential rate.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: Their companies can be signed into the system to import food

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest]: and get the juicy government contracts, etc., etc.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And on that note of juicy government contracts,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll take a quick commercial break,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Amit Varma]: which I promise you will be filled by a private party.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
[Unknown]: Hello, hello, hello everybody.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000

[Unknown]: and we will send them an IBM Podcast mug.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
[Unknown]: So, this week on Cyrus Says,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Unknown]: Cyrus' guest is Yash Banerjee,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
[Unknown]: co-founder of Bombay Canteen and O'Pedro.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Unknown]: He talks about the intricacies of the F&B industry in India

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
[Unknown]: and the origins of his ventures.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
[Unknown]: talk about Netflix's latest series, Russian Doll,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Unknown]: and why you should finish watching it right away.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Unknown]: On Ganatantra, the hosts unpack how political violence works in India

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Unknown]: and why the absence of large-scale communal riots

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
[Unknown]: does not necessarily indicate social harmony.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Unknown]: On Dalle Harate, the hosts are joined by Ramaprasad,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
[Unknown]: who translated the Amaru Shataka,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
[Unknown]: a collection of love poems from Sanskrit to Kannada.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
[Unknown]: He talks about the immortal nature of this work.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
[Unknown]: On Football Twaddle, the hosts discuss the Kepa and Sari incidents

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Unknown]: along with everything that happened in the Premier League.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Unknown]: On The Habit Coach podcast, Ashton guides you through

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
[Unknown]: starting a sugar-less life

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
[Unknown]: and the importance of substituting sugar with stevia.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
[Unknown]: In the season finale of our Hindi show, Cinemaya,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
[Unknown]: Swati Bakshi is in conversation with Alankrita Srivastav,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Unknown]: who discusses her journey from journalism to filmmaking and everything in between.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue with your show.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Alexandra Ulmer about Venezuela.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the other thing everybody sort of notices about Venezuela

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Amit Varma]: is the mad inflation.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, now it's at crazy levels,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
[Amit Varma]: but even under Chavez, it was at like 60% a year,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and it would balloon.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that I realized was,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
[Amit Varma]: one, that inflation has been a common part of Venezuela

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
[Amit Varma]: for decades, not just a Chavez issue.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And two, there's a quality which people often consider

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Amit Varma]: a cultural quality, but which really seemed to me

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
[Amit Varma]: to come out of economic imperatives,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that people often say that

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Amit Varma]: so-and-so kind of people or so-and-so culture,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Unknown]: they are good savers, they like to save,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Amit Varma]: as if that's a cultural value.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Amit Varma]: But what inflation did to Venezuela was,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
[Amit Varma]: because inflation was so high,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Amit Varma]: it just made no rational sense to save.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And Venezuelans would, I mean, taking debt makes,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just to give an illustration of this,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you could buy a house today at regular EMIs,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and a year later, your EMIs would really be

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Amit Varma]: as much as you are paying to buy a loaf of bread.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
[Amit Varma]: So it makes, so the moment, whatever debt you can get,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Amit Varma]: people would take it, you know,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Amit Varma]: so even the poorest people would take debt

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and buy flat-screen TVs and whatever

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Amit Varma]: and spend it on consumer goods.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's not because of materialism gone mad

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Amit Varma]: or consumerism or anything like that,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
[Amit Varma]: it's just that those are the economic incentives.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's like culture being driven by economics.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
[Guest]: And Latin Americans, historically,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
[Guest]: have not been considered good savers,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: but that's because they've, almost every country

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Guest]: has had some kind of spate of inflation.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: Venezuela has pushed it to a whole other level, right?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: We're looking at 2 million percent,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
[Guest]: even though, as I mentioned,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
[Guest]: we don't have official government data.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
[Guest]: It's wild, and it's really the only thing

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: people talk about because it is such a disorienting

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: and life-destroying phenomenon.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
[Guest]: It destroys your salary.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Guest]: It's as if you walked into a supermarket tomorrow

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
[Guest]: and a sack of rice was priced at 18,000 rupees.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: How can you talk about anything else?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Guest]: It's your livelihood.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Guest]: It's everything you thought was stable

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: that is being cut out from under you.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Guest]: And what's particularly fascinating

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: about this spate of hyperinflation

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Guest]: is that it seems to be the first one of the digital age.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: So Venezuelan government can't even print

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
[Guest]: enough physical money to keep up with the money

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
[Guest]: it's creating in general.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
[Guest]: So there's a perennial shortage of bills.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: So prices are going up all the time,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
[Guest]: but no one has any physical money,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: which is insane because it's not the kind of

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: wheelbarrow image you have of hyperinflation, right?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: So what does that mean?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: That means every ATM you walk in front of

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: has tens of people queuing up at any given time

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: hoping to get a few bills out,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: even though the maximum is about $2

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: that you can take out of the ATM.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Which you can't buy anything with.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: You can't buy anything with that,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: especially when prices are changing every day.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Guest]: So you use your bank card.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
[Guest]: Wait, there's a catch there too.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: Venezuela hasn't invested in its telecom system

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: and has fixed prices for years,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: so they're completely oversaturated

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: and so point of sales collapse all the time.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: They're also rolling blackouts

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: because ditto, no investment, no maintenance.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
[Guest]: So the power grid is incredibly shaky.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
[Guest]: Your phones, same issue.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Guest]: So there literally were times

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
[Guest]: where I could not pay for something.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
[Guest]: I obviously had the money in my account.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Guest]: I wanted to pay for it, but nothing worked.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
[Guest]: I had no bills.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: The power system was down.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: The point of sale didn't work.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: And there's just no way to conduct

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Guest]: a very basic economic transaction.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And just for my listeners' benefit,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Amit Varma]: to talk about the monetary basis of inflation,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
[Amit Varma]: what inflation is typically caused by

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Amit Varma]: is when the money supply goes up

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Amit Varma]: relative to the goods and services available.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Amit Varma]: So what happens is when a government decides

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
[Amit Varma]: that it needs to up its spending

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Amit Varma]: or pay back its debts or whatever

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and it starts printing money,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
[Amit Varma]: the amount of money relative to goods and services

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Amit Varma]: just goes up and therefore you have

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Amit Varma]: more money chasing the same number of goods.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: So obviously supply and demand,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: the goods and services out there become more expensive.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you just keep indiscriminately

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Amit Varma]: printing money,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
[Amit Varma]: this just gets worse and worse

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
[Amit Varma]: till it spirals to, you know,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
[Amit Varma]: unmanageable proportions till, you know,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
[Amit Varma]: what you used to buy a house with.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
[Amit Varma]: One year later you buy a loaf of bread with that

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and the poor are most

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Amit Varma]: hurt by it. But what kind of surprises me is that

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
[Amit Varma]: despite a lot of this happening for

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Amit Varma]: even the early, since the start of

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavez's regime in a sense,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
[Amit Varma]: he had popular support for

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
[Amit Varma]: a much longer time than you would have.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, is that because people

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Amit Varma]: disconnect what is happening to them from

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Amit Varma]: the economic policies

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[Amit Varma]: that a government carries out?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Guest]: I think what Chavez did masterfully

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
[Guest]: was control the narrative.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[Guest]: That's what he was the most successful

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: politician to do. So he said

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
[Guest]: that all the economic woes were to do with

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Guest]: an economic war being waged

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Guest]: against him and Maduro's

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: government, right? So the evil

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[Guest]: businessmen are stockpiling

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: goods, the evil businessmen

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Guest]: are upping prices in

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: a speculative manner to ruin your life,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: etc. And, you know,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: hyperinflation is an abstract

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: concept and it's not that easy to understand.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: And if the government dominates the airwaves

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
[Guest]: and you don't have a background in economics,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
[Guest]: or perhaps not a background

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: in anything because you weren't able to pursue your

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
[Guest]: education, it's actually much

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: easier to blame a speculator.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: And once the situation became

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: really difficult in Venezuela and we had

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: those hundreds of people

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
[Guest]: banging on supermarket doors,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: demanding food,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: which happened all the time,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: you had the creation of these

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: men called bachakeros,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest]: which is actually a name that derives from

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: ants that can carry a lot on its back,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
[Guest]: which is lovely poetry,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: but in practice was terrible, right?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Guest]: So these men who queue up,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
[Guest]: buy up products that they then resell

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: at a heightened price, right? Because not everyone

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: can stand in line all day

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: waiting for food. They have to get

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Guest]: to work and some of them do have disposable

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Guest]: income to pay more. So

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
[Guest]: it's a lot easier if you're

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: poor, stuck in line for hours,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Guest]: waiting to buy a pack of pasta,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: and you see these

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Guest]: bachakeros slip in line in front of you,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest]: threaten you, buy up the products,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
[Guest]: and then you see those same products on your street corner

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: the next day for five times the price. Well, who's to blame?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: The bachakeros, right?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
[Guest]: Of course, bachakeros

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Guest]: don't exist in countries where you have

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: enough supply and you don't have controls,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Guest]: but that's harder to remember when

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
[Guest]: you're in the thick of it and you want to survive.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: I'm speaking more about

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: Maduro's time in this essence,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Guest]: but I think in Chavez it was similar. He dominated

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
[Guest]: the narrative and there was an incredibly polarized country,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Guest]: right? Where it was us against them.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and also one thing all these guys fell

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Amit Varma]: prey to, not just Maduro and Chavez,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
[Amit Varma]: but even before that, is the temptation

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Amit Varma]: of price controls. Like you referred to magical realism

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Amit Varma]: earlier, and price controls really are

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
[Amit Varma]: magical thinking. If you fix the price of something

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
[Amit Varma]: that's where it'll stay. But as we

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Amit Varma]: know, price controls lead to shortages.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And then when you have shortages,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously the black market

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Amit Varma]: gets involved, as

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned. And a lot of the problem in

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Venezuela was, the way

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Amit Varma]: I understood it, was driven not just by the rampant

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Amit Varma]: inflation, but also then because

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Amit Varma]: inflation put the prices of

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Amit Varma]: goods out of reach of many people.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavez and then Maduro reacted

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
[Amit Varma]: by imposing price controls,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
[Amit Varma]: which completely changed the incentives

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
[Amit Varma]: for manufacturers who wouldn't manufacture

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
[Amit Varma]: anymore, and the domestic manufacturing industry

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Amit Varma]: died anyway. And

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
[Amit Varma]: therefore goods became

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: extremely scarce. Exactly.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: It created a negative food bag loop,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
[Guest]: where inflation would be up, the government would

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Guest]: panic and decide to take

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Guest]: corrective measures. So Maduro would

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: come on TV, as he does almost every day,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
[Guest]: because that's how he governs, through the television,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: and announce a 35%

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Guest]: wage increase to

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Guest]: tackle hyperinflation, for instance, which

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
[Guest]: meant that in turn, everyone had to increase the

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Guest]: prices of the goods or services they were offering.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Because the wage increase came from basically

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
[Guest]: printing money. Exactly. And then the

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
[Guest]: shop owners have to pay their employees more, right?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
[Guest]: And so then, they even had

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: this, they still do, have a

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
[Guest]: superintendence of fair prices.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
[Guest]: They have inspectors that are sent out,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
[Guest]: often with a state TV camera trailing behind

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: them, and they inspect the evil

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
[Guest]: businessmen and, you know,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
[Guest]: fine them, arrest them, or whatever, if

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
[Guest]: they feel like they're price gouging.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
[Guest]: And so, of course, you know,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
[Guest]: how does your business survive

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[Amit Varma]: in those conditions? And you have

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
[Amit Varma]: to raise prices, and yet at the same time,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know, another trend that I noticed, which again

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Amit Varma]: became much worse under Chavez,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
[Amit Varma]: was expropriations, where the government would just

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
[Amit Varma]: say, okay, these private businesses

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, cannibals, and we're

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Amit Varma]: just going to take them over. And, you know,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: there's, one of this even happened live on television,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
[Amit Varma]: where he went to the square in

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Caracas, and he asked the mayor

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
[Amit Varma]: of that area with him that,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, what is that shop? And he points

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
[Amit Varma]: to one building, and those are the jewellery stores,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and he says, expropriate them.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And before the show is over, the guy has

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
[Amit Varma]: bought the papers, and he signed them.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And then in the middle of the night, the store owners come

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
[Amit Varma]: to take the jewellery in cardboard boxes.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, then

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Amit Varma]: the reporter who wrote about this says that a year

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
[Amit Varma]: later, there was absolutely, I think this was Rory

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
[Unknown]: Gallagher in his book, Comandante, that

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
[Amit Varma]: a year later, the building is just empty, and there's

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
[Amit Varma]: absolutely nothing there, and it's all gone to waste.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
[Guest]: Right. So I think you're hitting on a

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
[Guest]: very important point there, because, yes,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
[Guest]: there were flawed policies in the Maduro

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
[Guest]: government, in the Chavez government, and yes, there

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
[Guest]: was a lot of corruption. But one of the main

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
[Guest]: characteristics of their governance was just incompetence.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
[Guest]: Right? Because there are ways

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
[Guest]: of nationalising, compensating

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
[Guest]: whoever was nationalised,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
[Guest]: and putting together a structure to keep

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
[Guest]: that going. But

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: this was just Chavez on TV saying

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
[Guest]: expropriado. And there

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
[Guest]: was no follow-up, and there was no

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
[Guest]: attempt to really create a structure. So this happened

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
[Guest]: in factories, in

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
[Guest]: farms, jewellery stores, just

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
[Guest]: deserted, abandoned,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
[Guest]: and it's just so wasteful

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and heartbreaking. So you're saying

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
[Amit Varma]: is it then the case, just thinking

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
[Amit Varma]: aloud, that it's not even happening for

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
[Amit Varma]: ideological reasons, which would be bad enough,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
[Amit Varma]: but just out of Chavez's showmanship,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, to create those kind of optics, and

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
[Amit Varma]: to feed into his narrative, that, you know, private guy

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Amit Varma]: bad, and I'm your saviour, and I'm going to save you all.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
[Guest]: You know, I had the distinct

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
[Guest]: impression that everything at

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: a certain point in Venezuela was just

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
[Guest]: being governed, it was governance through

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
[Guest]: television. That's not only because I had the

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
[Guest]: unfortunate luck of being a journalist there, meaning I had to

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
[Guest]: watch state TV day in, day out, which

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Guest]: killed my neurons. But Maduro

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
[Guest]: comes on television every day to speak,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Guest]: just like Chavez did, and that

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
[Guest]: becomes, you know, a proxy

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
[Guest]: for governance, you know, a flawed one, of

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
[Guest]: course, that becomes the be-all, end-all,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
[Amit Varma]: controlling the narrative.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And how did kind of, like Chavez

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
[Amit Varma]: seems to me, like you pointed out, he

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of died, treated by doctors

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
[Amit Varma]: in Cuba. He died before

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
[Amit Varma]: the oil prices fell, and

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, but Maduro effectively

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
[Amit Varma]: was following out exactly the same kind of

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
[Amit Varma]: policies, and what has happened to Maduro, I imagine

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
[Amit Varma]: would have happened to Chavez,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
[Amit Varma]: but what was the kind of change that, I mean, and

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
[Amit Varma]: those are the years where you

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
[Amit Varma]: enter the story, and you know, 2014

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
[Amit Varma]: onwards you've been there, and

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
[Amit Varma]: so what really happened?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Take me through these last five years.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
[Guest]: Sure. So

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: Maduro is very narrowly elected

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
[Guest]: in a very controversial vote

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
[Guest]: where the opposition still maintains

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
[Guest]: it actually won.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: We're talking about the actual numbers

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
[Amit Varma]: around the whole vote, of course.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
[Guest]: As in they're talking about the elections were rigged, basically.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Guest]: They were tweaked. That's what the opposition claims.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
[Guest]: Undeniably,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
[Guest]: the government used the state to its

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
[Guest]: advantage, so busing people in, changing voting

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
[Guest]: centers, all sorts of dirty tricks, but there's

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
[Guest]: still a question as to whether the actual numbers were tweaked.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
[Guest]: So

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
[Guest]: he gets elected with, you know, very slim

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
[Guest]: majority and little

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
[Guest]: credibility. As you said,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
[Guest]: he was a yes man to Chavez, a former

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
[Guest]: bus driver and union leader

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
[Guest]: who, you know, didn't have any

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
[Guest]: grand vision of his own, was at the time seen

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
[Guest]: as quite a conciliatory

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Guest]: figure, was able to negotiate

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
[Guest]: and had been a fairly decent

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
[Guest]: foreign minister in terms of his approach

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Guest]: to other heads of states.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
[Guest]: But, you know, not cut out to be a president.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
[Guest]: So he takes on the approach

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
[Guest]: of, Chavez was loved.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
[Guest]: I was designated to be his successor.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
[Guest]: Therefore, I shall not tweak any of

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
[Guest]: his policies.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
[Guest]: And he stands firm,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
[Guest]: you know, backing these increasingly

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
[Guest]: ludicrous and destructive

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
[Guest]: policies as Venezuela's economy

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
[Guest]: utterly unravels.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
[Guest]: And there starts to be increasing pressure for, look,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
[Guest]: you have to devalue, you have to let private

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
[Guest]: investment in, you have to start to lift the

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
[Guest]: currency controls, you have to

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
[Guest]: increase gasoline prices, and Venezuela

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
[Guest]: has the cheapest gasoline prices in the world.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
[Guest]: It's essentially free. Another one of the

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
[Guest]: wild distortions of this magical

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
[Guest]: realist place. But Maduro does

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: not do any of that. So progressively

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
[Guest]: the situation just spirals entirely

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
[Guest]: out of control. When I arrived

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
[Guest]: in 2014,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: there were odd shortages, right?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
[Guest]: I'd go to the supermarket and I'd ask

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: for coffee and they'd say, oh no, we don't have any.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
[Guest]: And I remember one security guard said, well, come back

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
[Guest]: tomorrow, I think we're going to get a shipment tomorrow, you know,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: in kind of a conspiratorial whisper.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
[Guest]: Okay, so I came back the next day and I got my coffee, right?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: But over time, it became

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
[Guest]: far more critical.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
[Guest]: And that's when you really started having people

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: getting malnourished, people dying

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: of preventable diseases,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
[Guest]: you know, like diphtheria returned

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
[Guest]: because there was a shortage of vaccines

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: and the whole health system disintegrated.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
[Guest]: Cancer patients

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[Guest]: couldn't find their oncological medicine anymore.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
[Guest]: Even people who

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
[Guest]: had successfully overcome things, like

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Guest]: gotten a transplant for a failed organ

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: and were living and happy

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
[Guest]: suddenly couldn't find the medicine

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
[Guest]: they needed to help stop their organ from being rejected.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
[Guest]: So just the

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
[Guest]: humanitarian crisis balloons.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
[Guest]: And Maduro and his acolytes

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
[Guest]: just dig in, essentially

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
[Guest]: ignore reality.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
[Guest]: They both ignore it and blame it

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
[Guest]: on the opposition without ever

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: kind of acknowledging how dramatic

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
[Guest]: it's gotten.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
[Guest]: They undeniably live in a bubble.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Guest]: They limit their outside interaction

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
[Guest]: with the people. Everything is very choreographed

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
[Guest]: and stage managed.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
[Guest]: And, you know, it's gotten to a point

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
[Guest]: of no return where it's so difficult

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
[Guest]: to reform the economy now unless you have a major bailout.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
[Guest]: Because anything you would

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
[Guest]: touch could be dynamite, right?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
[Guest]: If you lift currency controls

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
[Guest]: now or something, it could just completely destabilize

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
[Guest]: and wreck the country in the short term.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
[Guest]: And they don't have the economic know-how

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
[Guest]: or the wherewithal to do that.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
[Guest]: So he's just dug himself into a complete hole.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And I believe

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
[Amit Varma]: there's a refugee crisis out of Venezuela

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
[Amit Varma]: which people have compared to Syria

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and said it's actually worse and anyone

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
[Amit Varma]: who can get out somehow, anyhow, is getting

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
[Amit Varma]: out because it's just not feasible anymore.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
[Guest]: Oh yes. I mean, the initial

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
[Guest]: wave happened during the Chavez era

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
[Guest]: when wealthy people, especially businessmen

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest]: said, this is not smelling right,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
[Guest]: I'm getting out. But they left, you know,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
[Guest]: they took a plane, they had their money,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
[Guest]: they settled in Miami and Madrid

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
[Guest]: and continued being doctors or engineers.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
[Guest]: It was sad, of course, but their life went on

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
[Guest]: and they're doing well.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
[Guest]: But what happened under the Maduro government

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
[Guest]: is the poor people suffered the worst.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
[Guest]: The poor and the middle class that got

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
[Guest]: thrown into poverty because of hyperinflation

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
[Guest]: and the general economic situation.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
[Guest]: And initially a lot of them left

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
[Guest]: by bus or short-haul flight

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
[Guest]: to the rest of Latin America.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: But increasingly what we're seeing is dirt poor people

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: just walking across

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
[Guest]: Latin America to as far as they can,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
[Amit Varma]: as far as their money will carry them.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And how does the international community

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
[Amit Varma]: deal with this? Because

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
[Amit Varma]: there's also a wariness over time

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of interfering with other countries' private

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
[Amit Varma]: matters. And this is also

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
[Amit Varma]: a complicated area for someone

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
[Amit Varma]: like the US to sort of

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
[Amit Varma]: do something about because there is also

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
[Amit Varma]: this narrative about how

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavez and Maduro after him are these

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
[Amit Varma]: great saviors of communism

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
[Unknown]: and these neoliberals are

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
[Unknown]: constantly interfering and they

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[Unknown]: are to blame. A narrative

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
[Amit Varma]: pushed to a large extent by Chavez himself and

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
[Amit Varma]: quite masterfully pushed but obviously

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
[Amit Varma]: utterly untrue. So how does

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
[Amit Varma]: the international community then deal

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
[Amit Varma]: with that? They have to be wary of responding

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
[Amit Varma]: but at the same time when there is such a massive

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
[Amit Varma]: humanitarian crisis going on

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
[Amit Varma]: it's hard to also say we'll

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
[Guest]: do nothing. Yes, I think that was a big

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: quandary especially for Latin America where sensitivities

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
[Guest]: to US involvement are so high.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
[Guest]: And for most of Chavez's

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
[Guest]: governance, much of

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
[Guest]: the rest of South America was also

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
[Guest]: ruled by the left wing. It was very cozy with

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
[Guest]: Chavez and in some instances

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
[Guest]: possibly benefited from his oil largesse

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
[Guest]: or just private funds for campaigns.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
[Guest]: So there's very muted criticism of him.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
[Guest]: Over time that

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
[Guest]: pink tide, as it was called, has

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
[Guest]: ebbed over Latin America with the commodities price

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
[Guest]: crash. So now actually you have a

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
[Guest]: string of right wing governments.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
[Guest]: Still there was wariness about confronting him

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
[Guest]: directly but the fact that

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
[Guest]: so many migrants and refugees were spilling into

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
[Guest]: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
[Guest]: and because the situation

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest]: has deteriorated in terms of human rights

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
[Guest]: and democracy so much in Venezuela

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
[Guest]: those countries have spoken out.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
[Guest]: But there is still this unease

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
[Guest]: with having the US lead

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
[Guest]: the charge. And for a long time

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
[Guest]: at least under Obama, the US

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
[Guest]: administration was pushing Mexico or Brazil

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: regional powerhouses

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
[Guest]: to lead, to avoid having the US

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
[Guest]: be at the forefront because the US

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
[Guest]: has had a track record of supporting

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
[Guest]: dictators or even coups in Latin America

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
[Guest]: during the Cold War and there's a huge

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
[Guest]: amount of resentment against the United States

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
[Guest]: for that and that helps explain

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
[Guest]: the rise of people like Chavez.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
[Guest]: I think now

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
[Guest]: because Latin America is dominated

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
[Guest]: by the right and because

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
[Guest]: there's so much sense of such urgency

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
[Amit Varma]: they're all behind Trump.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of the resentment

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
[Amit Varma]: of course is justified and it takes me back to

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
[Amit Varma]: the old story about when

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavez comes to power, shortly after he comes to power

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
[Amit Varma]: there's a massive earthquake

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
[Amit Varma]: where millions get affected

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and the US

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
[Amit Varma]: offers to send aid

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Venezuela agrees the aid

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
[Amit Varma]: is on its way and then in the middle of the night

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavez calls the minister concerned and he says tell them to go back

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and the minister says no, no

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
[Amit Varma]: but they're already on their way and we need the help

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
[Amit Varma]: we can't do anything about it and he says no, no

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't want the Americans here because

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and he gets paranoid about, you know, they'll snoop on us

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah and he gets them to go back

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and there is speculation that maybe he spoke to Castro

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
[Amit Varma]: overnight and Castro told him to do that

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
[Amit Varma]: but whatever the case may be

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
[Amit Varma]: but the interesting thing through the Chavez years was

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
[Amit Varma]: that although he kept ranting about

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
[Amit Varma]: George W. Bush in very funny

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and amusing ways, I'm not going to quote

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
[Amit Varma]: any of that but some great quotes

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Google it, although he kept

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
[Amit Varma]: ranting about the imperialists

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
[Amit Varma]: and the neoliberals and the Americans and so on

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
[Amit Varma]: when it came to oil, it was business

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
[Amit Varma]: as usual. Venezuela was super

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
[Amit Varma]: efficient in supplying oil

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
[Amit Varma]: to the US which was the biggest buyer

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and everything there went smoothly

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
[Guest]: Yes

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
[Guest]: and bilateral relationship had ebbs

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
[Guest]: and flows and

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest]: Chavez would kick out the US

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
[Guest]: ambassador and vice versa

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
[Guest]: and Maduro likewise but the oil kept

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
[Guest]: flowing and the US was

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
[Guest]: depending on what metric he used

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
[Guest]: as the biggest cash paying consumer

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
[Guest]: because over time

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
[Guest]: Venezuela ended up mortgaging its oil to

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
[Guest]: Russia and China to pay back

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: loans that they were receiving

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
[Guest]: so the US was of crucial importance

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
[Guest]: those flows are not changing

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
[Guest]: because of sanctions and India

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
[Guest]: actually is I think

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
[Guest]: becoming or has become the number one

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
[Guest]: cash buyer of Venezuelan oil

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Ouch, is this something we should

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
[Guest]: feel bad about?

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
[Guest]: India's private companies

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
[Unknown]: are reporting, right?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
[Guest]: It's a different calculation and

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
[Guest]: everything leads to believe that Venezuela

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
[Amit Varma]: is offering nice discounts

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Money is fungible

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Amit Varma]: What's the politics in Venezuela like

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
[Amit Varma]: right now?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
[Amit Varma]: One interesting sort of

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
[Amit Varma]: turning point in Venezuelan politics

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
[Amit Varma]: which is easy to identify and you mentioned

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
[Amit Varma]: it in our conversation before the podcast

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
[Amit Varma]: was obviously the 2005 elections

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
[Amit Varma]: when there was

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
[Amit Varma]: this where somebody reported

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
[Amit Varma]: that voting is no longer anonymous

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you can find out who's kind of

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
[Amit Varma]: voted and because of this

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
[Amit Varma]: the entire opposition decided to

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
[Amit Varma]: boycott the elections

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and Chavez basically

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
[Amit Varma]: swept the assembly seats obviously because

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
[Amit Varma]: his party was the only

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
[Amit Varma]: contender there. Did that

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
[Amit Varma]: have a long term impact? Did the

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
[Amit Varma]: opposition recover from that

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
[Guest]: and come back strongly and what's the situation

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
[Guest]: today?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
[Guest]: The Venezuelan opposition

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
[Guest]: has long been elitist, very

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
[Guest]: quarrelsome, dominated by a smattering

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
[Guest]: of parties that no one's ever heard of abroad but

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
[Guest]: who love to fight amongst themselves

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
[Guest]: and their boycott of the 2005

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
[Guest]: vote essentially annulled

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
[Guest]: them from the political scene and gave

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
[Guest]: Chavez a complete

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
[Guest]: blank check to do whatever he wanted because his

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
[Guest]: party controlled the National Assembly

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
[Guest]: It also fit into this

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
[Guest]: the opposition would repeatedly

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
[Guest]: cry wolf before

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
[Guest]: when it wasn't necessary, right?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
[Guest]: Chavez was clearly

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
[Guest]: problematic for institutions from the start but the

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
[Guest]: opposition would be wildly

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
[Guest]: exaggerating what was happening and lose credibility

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
[Guest]: in the process so by boycotting the elections

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
[Guest]: and saying this wasn't a

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
[Guest]: democracy and Chavez is the dictator

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
[Guest]: when I think a lot of political scientists would say

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
[Guest]: he wasn't, he had autocratic tendency but it wasn't

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
[Guest]: a dictatorship. They actually facilitated

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
[Guest]: his road to creating a

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
[Guest]: much more authoritarian government

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
[Guest]: Over time the opposition

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
[Guest]: has done some soul searching

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
[Guest]: and Enrique Capriles who was a

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
[Guest]: two time presidential candidate for the opposition

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
[Guest]: actually said no

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
[Guest]: we cannot demonize Chavistas

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
[Guest]: Chavez supporters

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
[Guest]: we must talk to them, understand

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
[Guest]: why they voted Chavez and show them

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
[Guest]: why we're the path forward

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
[Guest]: so he actually did crisscross the country

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
[Guest]: go into the slums and the poor villages

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
[Guest]: and talk to people and won over a lot of them

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
[Guest]: not enough to win the election

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
[Amit Varma]: again we don't know exactly what happened

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
[Guest]: Maybe he won it

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
[Guest]: but he changed the narrative

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
[Guest]: and kind of shook up what used to be

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
[Guest]: kind of a bastion of the

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
[Guest]: wealthy Caracas old families

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
[Guest]: but in the last few

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
[Guest]: years the government crackdown on the opposition

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
[Guest]: has been much more ferocious

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
[Guest]: so you know you have

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
[Guest]: exiled politicians in Washington and Colombia

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
[Guest]: in Europe, others who are

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
[Guest]: in jail or under house arrest

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
[Guest]: or even one who's

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
[Guest]: holed up in the Chilean embassy and has been holed up there

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
[Guest]: for months if not a year by now

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
[Guest]: so they've completely

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
[Guest]: chopped up the opposition

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
[Guest]: annulled political parties, annulled any

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
[Guest]: kind of political movement they tried to create

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
[Guest]: to unseat Maduro

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
[Guest]: and so it's very hard for them to articulate themselves now

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So where do things stand now

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
[Guest]: as of today?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
[Guest]: It's been a whirlwind since January

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
[Guest]: so Maduro was sworn in for his second term

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
[Guest]: in January after a very

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
[Guest]: again a decried election where all the

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
[Guest]: Western powers said this was a fraudulent

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
[Guest]: vote and everyone kind of

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
[Guest]: expected it to be game over

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
[Guest]: after that but then

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
[Guest]: this new kind of fresh-faced

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
[Guest]: opposition leader, Juan Guaido

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
[Guest]: who had just become the

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
[Guest]: head of the Venezuelan congress

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
[Guest]: which is still led by the opposition

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
[Guest]: and incidentally he became head of

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
[Guest]: the congress because most of the people

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
[Guest]: or many of the leaders in his party are either in exile

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
[Guest]: in prison or holed up in the

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
[Guest]: embassy so he was kind of the last person

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
[Guest]: standing and no one expected him

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
[Guest]: to become the face of

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
[Guest]: the rejuvenated opposition

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
[Guest]: so Juan Guaido was 35

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
[Guest]: swore himself in

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
[Guest]: citing the constitution, his constitutional right

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
[Guest]: to do that and declared himself president

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
[Guest]: and that just set

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
[Guest]: in motion a whole chain of events

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
[Guest]: the US supported him, other European

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
[Guest]: countries and Latin American countries also recognized

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
[Guest]: him, it sparked

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
[Guest]: a huge wave of protests

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
[Guest]: and we thought the Venezuelan

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
[Guest]: people were kind of broken, right? Immigration

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
[Guest]: was the way out, everyone has just

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
[Guest]: lost hope that anything could ever change and

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
[Guest]: almost overnight it seems that people took to the street

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
[Guest]: with renewed hope

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
[Guest]: there was hope

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
[Guest]: in the US and amongst the

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
[Guest]: opposition that the military would

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
[Guest]: immediately defect and support Guaido

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
[Guest]: that did not happen

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
[Guest]: the military in Venezuela is essentially an

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
[Guest]: extension of the government, it has control

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
[Guest]: over whatever lucrative business is left

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
[Guest]: in the country. Plan B was

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
[Guest]: to try to force in humanitarian aid

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
[Guest]: so we had a standoff at the

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
[Guest]: Venezuelan border

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
[Guest]: a few days ago

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
[Guest]: where the

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
[Guest]: opposition tried to drive in these trucks

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
[Guest]: full with food and

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
[Guest]: the Venezuelan soldiers blocked them and there were

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
[Guest]: confrontations, tear gas and Molotov cocktails

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
[Guest]: etc, but it failed

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
[Guest]: there was a number of defections, an

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
[Guest]: increasing number of defections from rank

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
[Guest]: and file soldiers, I think we're at about over 500

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
[Guest]: now, which is interesting and it's increasing

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
[Guest]: every day, it's not a groundswell

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
[Guest]: and we're not talking about the big fish, but it's

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
[Guest]: something to monitor.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
[Guest]: Guaido left Venezuela

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
[Guest]: to see the aid through from Colombia

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
[Guest]: and is now in Brazil, meeting

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
[Guest]: the president there. He's vowed

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
[Guest]: to come back to Venezuela

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
[Guest]: but Maduro has said

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
[Guest]: there was a travel ban on you, if you return

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
[Guest]: you shall be detained. So

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
[Guest]: there's a big question there and possibly

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
[Amit Varma]: a looming confrontation.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
[Amit Varma]: It seems like the political scientist

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
[Amit Varma]: A.O. Hirschman once said that if you're

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
[Amit Varma]: dissatisfied with the government you have three options

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
[Amit Varma]: which are you comply, you complain

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
[Amit Varma]: or you leave. And when I first

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
[Amit Varma]: heard that quote, I thought okay, no one's going to leave, who can

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
[Amit Varma]: leave, you know, but now what's happening is that

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
[Amit Varma]: there are people who have simply no option

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
[Amit Varma]: they cannot comply because they do not

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
[Amit Varma]: have food and there's no point complaining

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
[Amit Varma]: so they're leaving and

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
[Amit Varma]: it's just, and this is again like you

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
[Amit Varma]: said, it's the poorest of the poor, so it's

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
[Amit Varma]: a kind of a

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
[Amit Varma]: ludicrous situation

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
[Amit Varma]: going forward for Venezuela

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
[Amit Varma]: then, given the state of the politics

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
[Amit Varma]: and the state of the economy, what's a

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
[Amit Varma]: best case scenario and what's a worst case

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
[Guest]: scenario in your view?

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
[Guest]: It's

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
[Guest]: kind of difficult for me to pine as a journalist

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
[Guest]: but I would say that

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
[Guest]: because a majority of people

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
[Guest]: seem to want elections and there are

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
[Guest]: significant doubts about the previous election

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
[Guest]: the ideal scenario

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
[Guest]: for many people would probably

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
[Guest]: be to hold fair

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
[Guest]: and just elections where the people can actually

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
[Guest]: express their desire

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
[Guest]: and that is highly

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
[Guest]: unlikely to happen

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
[Guest]: there are many worst case scenarios

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
[Guest]: it's hard to say which is worst

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
[Guest]: Venezuela is constantly defied to expectations

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
[Guest]: of how bad it can get and

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
[Guest]: unfortunately I have no

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
[Guest]: I know

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
[Guest]: it can get worse, I think what's most

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
[Guest]: worried me is how lawless it can become

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
[Guest]: in many ways of course the government

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
[Guest]: is autocratic but it also doesn't

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
[Guest]: have control over many of the factions

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
[Guest]: that rule the country, the gangs

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
[Guest]: the crime rings

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
[Guest]: and then just the kind of isolated

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
[Guest]: rural areas where there's no state

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
[Guest]: there's no infrastructure

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
[Guest]: there are no services and

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
[Guest]: nothing works, nothing works

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
[Guest]: you can't make a phone call, you can't buy food

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
[Guest]: you can't transfer money, you can't get on the internet

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
[Guest]: you can't wash your clothes

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
[Guest]: there's no water, you can't turn on the light switch

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
[Guest]: I mean we're just talking about a complete

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
[Guest]: collapse in every single way

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Sounds like Afghanistan

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
[Amit Varma]: at its worst with the exception that this is

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
[Amit Varma]: a country that has enough oil to

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
[Amit Varma]: last it for more than 300 years

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
[Amit Varma]: this country should be insanely rich

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
[Guest]: Absolutely

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
[Guest]: and it's also a tropical country

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
[Guest]: the vegetation is somewhat similar to

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
[Guest]: to Mumbai actually

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
[Guest]: so it's so incongruent to see

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
[Guest]: people who are famished who show you their

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
[Guest]: ID cards and you can't recognize them because they were

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
[Guest]: so plump four years ago and now

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
[Guest]: are just a shadow of themselves

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
[Guest]: and they're climbing up trees trying to get mangoes

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
[Guest]: because this is a bountiful country

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
[Guest]: and thank God because otherwise people would have

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
[Guest]: been in even more dire

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
[Guest]: straits and I'm not excusing

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
[Guest]: hunger in deserts

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
[Guest]: or in Siberia or what have you but it's

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
[Guest]: just so shocking to see that in a

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
[Guest]: country that is actually very fertile

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
[Guest]: and where bananas and mangoes and coconuts

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
[Guest]: are growing wildly on every corner

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Blessed by nature and cursed by humans

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Yes

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
[Amit Varma]: So this has been a very illuminating episode

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
[Amit Varma]: but I'm going to end it by asking

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
[Amit Varma]: a question that kind of takes a step back

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
[Amit Varma]: in the current times that we live in there

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously is an upsurge of

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
[Amit Varma]: populism all across the world in fact

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
[Amit Varma]: you know just reading the biographies

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
[Amit Varma]: of Chavez it struck me

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
[Amit Varma]: in how many ways he's common

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
[Amit Varma]: to the likes of Modi, Erdogan, Orban

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean there are so many commonalities

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and one phrase I came across again and again

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
[Unknown]: which I thought was a lovely phrase was Chavismo

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavismo and tell me a little bit about

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Chavismo not just in a Venezuelan

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
[Amit Varma]: context but Chavismo

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
[Amit Varma]: in a global context and do you think

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
[Amit Varma]: you know why do you think it's

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
[Amit Varma]: there and what can be

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
[Amit Varma]: done about it by people who are concerned

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
[Guest]: about it?

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
[Guest]: To be fair I think Chavismo at its

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
[Guest]: best and in its heart was

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
[Guest]: a dream of a people

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
[Guest]: to have justice, to reap

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
[Guest]: the rewards of this

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
[Guest]: bountiful country and to

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
[Amit Varma]: right past wrongs

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
[Guest]: But that's a rhetorical thing

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
[Guest]: Yes but people really

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
[Guest]: fervently believe that and as

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
[Guest]: I mentioned they kind of believe it

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
[Guest]: as a religion. So I remember speaking to a

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
[Guest]: social worker who says how can I

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
[Guest]: un-teach my children this is what I believe

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
[Guest]: it's like a religion for me

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
[Guest]: it's so deeply ingrained

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
[Guest]: that it's almost like severing part of

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
[Guest]: yourself to stop believing or to

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
[Guest]: finally face the writing on the wall

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
[Guest]: What it turned out to be

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
[Guest]: is an obscene

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
[Guest]: level of patronage, cronyism

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
[Guest]: and perhaps

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
[Guest]: a massive money laundering

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and drug trading operation

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Like all religions are false religions

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
[Amit Varma]: I think yes

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Sorry that's my view

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
[Guest]: I mean it strayed so dramatically

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
[Guest]: from the rhetoric of Chavez in the

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
[Guest]: early days that it's

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
[Guest]: absolutely shocking

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
[Guest]: I've wrestled for a long time with what the global

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
[Guest]: implications are for this because

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
[Guest]: Venezuela is such a one-off it seems

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
[Guest]: in many ways of course it's a cautionary tale

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
[Guest]: in terms of squandering

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
[Guest]: oil wealth or following

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
[Guest]: for populist sellers

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
[Guest]: of dreams but it's also

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
[Guest]: pushed things to such an

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
[Guest]: extreme that it's sometimes

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
[Guest]: hard to extrapolate

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
[Guest]: but yes I think certain

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
[Guest]: certain themes

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
[Guest]: certain boring but fundamental themes

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
[Guest]: like fiscal responsibility and

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
[Guest]: the importance of institutions come to mind

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
[Guest]: as trite as that

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
[Guest]: is you never realize their

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
[Guest]: value more than when all of that is crumbling

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Alexander thank you so much for coming on the show

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
[Guest]: I really enjoyed talking to you

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
[Guest]: Thank you so much

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to the show

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: do follow Alexander on Twitter

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
[Amit Varma]: at Alexander Ulmer
