00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
[Amit Varma]: Before we move on with this episode of the Scene in the Unseen, do check out another

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.280
[Amit Varma]: awesome podcast from IVM Podcast, Cyrus Says, hosted by my old buddy, Cyrus Brochia.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.200
[Amit Varma]: When it comes to economics, one of my complaints is that people think in zero sum ways. They

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.920
[Amit Varma]: assume that if someone wins something, someone else must lose. The rich can get rich only

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.280
[Amit Varma]: if the poor get poorer, and industrialists can only make money if poor workers down the

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.200
[Amit Varma]: line get exploited. This is why they feel, as Jawaharlal Nehru once said, that profit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.600
[Amit Varma]: is a dirty word. The only solution to poverty, they think, is to redistribute from the poor

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.560
[Amit Varma]: to the rich. But the thing is, economies grow and societies prosper because the world works

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: in a positive some way. Every voluntary transaction makes both parties better off. The writer

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.360
[Amit Varma]: John Stossel once called this the double thank you moment. When you buy a cup of coffee at

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.720
[Amit Varma]: a cafe, the guy at the counter says thank you when you hand over your money, and you

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.440
[Amit Varma]: say thank you when you receive the coffee. Both of you benefited, neither of you exploited

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
[Amit Varma]: the other.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.320
[Amit Varma]: It strikes me that there is another field besides economics in which zero sum thinking

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.520
[Amit Varma]: is a mistake, and that is geopolitics. Except that in geopolitics there are both positive

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.360
[Amit Varma]: sum games and negative sum games. A negative sum game is one in which both parties lose.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.280
[Amit Varma]: And a particularly bad kind of negative sum game is one in which both parties get trapped

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.440
[Amit Varma]: in a spiral where every action makes both parties worse off, but each is forced to stay

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.720
[Amit Varma]: in the game. There is no way out.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Is the conflict between India and Pakistan like this? It's clear to me that there's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.160
[Amit Varma]: no easy way out of this conflict. It's also clear to me that most ways out will make the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.720
[Amit Varma]: situation worse, not better, for both parties. But doing nothing is also not an option. How

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.440
[Amit Varma]: did we get here? What can we do to get out of here? Is there anything we can do to get

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.720
[Amit Varma]: out of here?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. Today's subject is the conflict between India and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.400
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan and my guest is a historian and analyst, Srinath Raghavan. Srinath is both a historian

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.480
[Amit Varma]: and a foreign policy analyst. He's been on the show before and his books are linked on

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.520
[Amit Varma]: the episode page. Before I begin my conversation with him though, let's take a quick commercial

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.200
[Amit Varma]: break.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.520
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Srinath, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Good to be here. We are recording this on

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.360
[Amit Varma]: March 8, which is a Friday and this episode releases on March 11, which is a Monday. So

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.880
[Amit Varma]: if anything happens on the weekend, we are not to blame for it. So Srinath, what do you

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.640
[Guest]: make of the situation right now? Well, at this point of time, it does seem

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.160
[Guest]: like the situation has calmed down. The immediate crisis at hand because of the fallout of the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.480
[Guest]: Pulwama attacks, at least the military dimension of it in terms of active operations, etc.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.040
[Guest]: has been curtailed. The Indian government has stated quite explicitly that, you know,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.680
[Guest]: operations are sort of at an end and that diplomatic action will continue. But this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.200
[Guest]: is very much an evolving situation in a sense that the next crisis is only as far away as

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.960
[Guest]: the next terrorist attack is. And I say this with more than a hint of trepidation in my

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.720
[Guest]: voice, because the next time around, I think it can be a lot more dangerous as a result

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.840
[Amit Varma]: of what has happened this time around. In case any listener is binging on the show

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400
[Amit Varma]: in the year 2023 and just wants a little perspective on what's happened so far, there was an attack

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.920
[Amit Varma]: in Pulwama, where around 40 people died. And after that, India responded with a surgical

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.520
[Amit Varma]: airstrike, the results of which are debated, but there definitely was a surgical airstrike.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And after which there was an air skirmish the next day where India claimed that we had

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.440
[Amit Varma]: downed an F-16, but there's no evidence of that yet at the time of speaking. And they

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.440
[Amit Varma]: captured one of our pilots who was then released. And that kind of seemed to give both sides

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.880
[Amit Varma]: a way out of the situation where Pakistan could say, look, we want peace and we're releasing

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.240
[Amit Varma]: the guy and India could say that, look, they gave the guy back because we are so strong

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.360
[Amit Varma]: and we've done the surgical strike and we don't need to do any more. Is that how you

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
[Amit Varma]: look at it?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.600
[Guest]: Well, yes, I think at this point of time, both sides have enough to claim victory. And

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.960
[Guest]: in as much as that allows them to sort of back off from a further spiral of escalation

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.200
[Guest]: and another round of military action. I think that's a good thing. And of course, a lot

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.120
[Guest]: depends on how domestic audiences in both countries will receive the sort of, you know,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.180
[Guest]: established narratives of what has happened in this context. And in as much as diplomatic

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.320
[Guest]: action is now going to be foregrounded and there are going to be things like listing

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.680
[Guest]: of Masood Azhar in the sort of United Nations list of terrorists and so on. There will be

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.760
[Guest]: other kinds of diplomatic pressure that will be built up on Pakistan, the financial action

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.840
[Guest]: task force and other avenues. So the sort of India's struggle against terrorism continues.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.160
[Guest]: But I think it's safe to say that for the time being, the military dimension of it takes

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.600
[Guest]: a bit of a backseat, but it remains latent. I mean, and that provides the background context

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.840
[Guest]: against which many further diplomatic and other options will be exercised.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, I want to come back to the current situation at the end of this episode, because what I

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.960
[Amit Varma]: was hoping our conversation would do and which is why I invited you is, I wanted to get a

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.520
[Amit Varma]: better sense of the history of the conflict and also kind of sharpen the lens through

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.800
[Amit Varma]: which to view it. What are the strategic imperatives? What are the political imperatives? What,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, how does one really view it? What are the options open to both parties and so

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.560
[Amit Varma]: on? Where do we start? I mean, obviously, we can just go a long way back to forever.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.920
[Amit Varma]: But if we talk about specifically cross-border terrorism supported by Pakistan, you know,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.560
[Amit Varma]: where should we start when we think about it?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.360
[Guest]: I think a good starting point would be the late 1980s. Because that's the time when obviously

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.200
[Guest]: the insurgency in Kashmir really kicks off. And that insurgency then gives Pakistan and

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.200
[Guest]: its inter-services intelligence an opportunity to really find another way of inflicting further

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.320
[Guest]: pain on India, challenge its control and hold over Jammu and Kashmir. But we should remember

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.440
[Guest]: that 1980s was also an important point of time in the sort of nuclear history of the

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.520
[Guest]: subcontinent. That is the time at which the Indian government more or less came to some

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.400
[Guest]: firm conclusions that the Pakistani nuclear program, which was a covert one, had actually

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest]: sort of developed considerably by that point of time. Again, it's worth recalling that,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.960
[Guest]: you know, in the early 1980s, when Pakistan was very actively supporting the sort of,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.840
[Guest]: you know, operations against the Red Army in Afghanistan by through the Mujahideen and

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.380
[Guest]: so on. That was also the period when the United States, the Reagan administration turned a

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.680
[Guest]: blind eye to many bits and pieces of evidence that were emerging about Pakistan's pursuit

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.040
[Guest]: of a covert nuclear program. In fact, we have evidence about how the Reagan administration

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.160
[Guest]: willingly turned a blind eye to many very strong irrefutable pieces of evidence that

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.960
[Guest]: Pakistan was actually pursuing a covert nuclear option and that it was being supported by

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.600
[Guest]: China in different ways, perhaps to the extent of carrying out a test for Pakistan on a Chinese

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.760
[Guest]: site. So by the late 1980s, the Indians are pretty sure that the Pakistani nuclear program

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.120
[Guest]: is pretty well advanced. It is in that context that India also decides then to start thinking

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.480
[Guest]: about weaponization of its own program. We had demonstrated capability as far back as

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.240
[Guest]: 1974, but had desisted from any move towards weaponization in the next, you know, decade

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.880
[Guest]: and a half and that begins to change. So the late 1980s, therefore, seems to me to be the

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.280
[Guest]: right starting point because that's the time when this kind of combination of insurgency

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.760
[Guest]: and terrorism as a tool being used by Pakistan, along with unrest in Kashmir and Pakistan's

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.920
[Guest]: possession of some kind of, you know, strong nuclear capability actually comes together.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.880
[Guest]: And it is the fusion of these that allows Pakistan to continue to build up its support

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.720
[Guest]: for insurgency because now it believes that it has a nuclear shield, which will deter

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.740
[Guest]: India from carrying out any major conventional operations. I mean, just to give you an example,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.060
[Guest]: if you go back to the 1965 war, that was a war which also began because of Pakistani

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.840
[Guest]: support for insurgents or attempt to infiltrate people into Kashmir and so on. But what was

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.040
[Guest]: the Indian response? It was very quickly to strike across the line of control. When the

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.200
[Guest]: Pakistanis responded by carrying out a conventional military attack on Akhnur, India responded

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.280
[Guest]: by opening up the Punjab front, right? So you could escalate and demonstrate your conventional

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.400
[Guest]: superiority because you are the more powerful country in a conventional sense. But once

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.960
[Guest]: the Pakistanis possessed some kind of nuclear capability, even if it was shadowy, even if

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.920
[Guest]: it was not demonstrated, but more importantly, once India knew that Pakistan had that capability

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.200
[Guest]: and Pakistan knew that India knew, then the Pakistani strategy is to say that India's

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.120
[Guest]: conventional superiority is now going to be negated by this nuclear shield that we have

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.480
[Guest]: acquired. So that then allows them to believe that they can continue to use subconventional

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:40.120
[Guest]: means like insurgency and terrorism to impose costs on India without having to fear a retaliatory

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.000
[Guest]: response by the Indians. And that really is the dilemma with which we are still grappling.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.520
[Guest]: So in that sense, the late 1980s may be a useful starting point.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a step back to a period you're very familiar with. In fact, the Bangladesh

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.320
[Amit Varma]: war, which ends in 71 and we recorded an episode about this last week, but it airs two weeks

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.160
[Amit Varma]: later on March 25th. But regardless of that, so it's after 1971 when Pakistan lose and

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.520
[Amit Varma]: they're humiliated because, you know, the country is basically torn into two. I mean,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.840
[Amit Varma]: they lose East Pakistan as it were, which is when they make the turn towards nuclear.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.840
[Amit Varma]: So you know, my question there is, what does Pakistan want? What are its long term aims

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.400
[Amit Varma]: against India? How does it look at South Asia? How does it look at itself?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.120
[Guest]: Well, at one level, Pakistan's long term aim has been to sort of challenge India's control

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.000
[Guest]: over Jammu and Kashmir, which it believes as a Muslim majority province should have

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.420
[Guest]: rightly sort of joined Pakistan at the time of partition and independence. And because

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.720
[Guest]: it did not, they have, you know, successively at various points of time, attempted to use

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.240
[Guest]: force in order to wrest control of Kashmir from India. You saw that happening in October

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.120
[Guest]: 1947. In fact, even before Kashmir had formally joined India, you saw that happening in 1965.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.560
[Guest]: We've, you know, seen that happening through the course of the insurgency, which began

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.280
[Guest]: in the late 1980s. So Pakistan's aims have been consistent. It is a territorially revisionist

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.600
[Guest]: power, which wants a piece of territory which is disputed between India and Pakistan to

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.080
[Amit Varma]: be entirely under its control.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.600
[Amit Varma]: But is it also the case that, I mean, the military is dominant then, is it also the

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.920
[Amit Varma]: case that the incentives of the army are such that they want to keep Kashmir on the boil

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.720
[Amit Varma]: and they want to keep this conflict going. So that is where they get their power from.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.480
[Amit Varma]: And it could therefore be said that their actions and their focus on Kashmir is a consequence

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.200
[Amit Varma]: of this. And they don't necessarily care about Kashmir per se, like in the same way that

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.600
[Amit Varma]: within India, for example, a lot of people who make noises about cow slaughter don't

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.880
[Amit Varma]: really care about cows. It's a proxy for the bigotry. So in that sense, is Kashmir a proxy

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.880
[Amit Varma]: for the military's need to keep the conflict bubbling over?

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.060
[Guest]: Well, yes, in the sense that you could make an argument that Kashmir comes very handy

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.280
[Guest]: to the Pakistan army to sort of talk about this, you know, threat from India to the existence

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.800
[Guest]: of Pakistan and the need to recuperate Pakistan's sort of national territory, which they believe

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.720
[Guest]: encompasses Kashmir, at least the Kashmir Valley and so on. And that then gives the

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.100
[Guest]: Pakistan army a stronger handle with which to fight out various kinds of institutional

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.480
[Guest]: battles and cement its own position within the Pakistani state and society at large.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.760
[Guest]: But at the same time, it's worth remembering that the Kashmir dispute in some ways predates

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.080
[Guest]: the rise to prominence of the, so historically, it's not accurate to say that this was a dispute

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: which was invented by the Pakistan army. In fact, the decision to send the first round

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.640
[Guest]: of irregulars in October 1947, was taken at the time when Jinnah was the governor general.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.600
[Guest]: And he knew quite well, and this is well established in historical records, that he knew that this

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.320
[Guest]: operation was being prepared and that the Pakistani state was supporting it. So in a

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.400
[Guest]: sense, there is a longer term sort of question about Pakistan's, you know, sense of nationalism,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.640
[Guest]: its rivalry with India, which is crystallized in the Kashmir conflict. And the Pakistan

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.800
[Guest]: army, of course, sees Kashmir as a raison d'etre for its own existence, and which allows

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.800
[Guest]: it to continually accrue power within their system.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So it kind of works both ways. So coming on to the 80s, so what's really happened is that

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.800
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan makes a determined move to become a nuclear power post 71. And India also sort

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.480
[Amit Varma]: of flirts with it. And already there is sort of a dynamic developing where Pakistan looks

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.400
[Amit Varma]: at the nuclear option as a military necessity, where India seems to look at the nuclear option

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.240
[Amit Varma]: more as a strategic necessity, you know, for deterrence and so on, and isn't actually thinking

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.520
[Amit Varma]: of using it on the battlefield. Is that correct?

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.120
[Guest]: Well, yes, which is why, you know, from the time that Indians do the first nuclear test

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.640
[Guest]: 1974, which incidentally is built, you know, it is euphemistically called a peaceful nuclear

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.640
[Guest]: explosion. Now, let's remember that there was a category of nuclear explosions, which

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.040
[Guest]: were called PNEs back in the day, and India invoked that category. So it's not like we

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.080
[Guest]: sort of conjured it up out of thin air. It was an available sort of way of describing

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.680
[Guest]: these activities. And we chose to do that. But what is also interesting, and this is

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.720
[Guest]: now reasonably well established in the sort of work which has been done on the nuclear

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.680
[Guest]: history of India, is that India did not really think actively of weaponization of the nuclear

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.720
[Guest]: thing. Because I think, as you're suggesting, the assumption always was that, you know,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.160
[Guest]: we needed nuclear weapons or the kind of capability to sort of acquire nuclear weapons, primarily

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.600
[Guest]: as a way of demonstrating our political sort of resolve against any attempts at coercion

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.840
[Guest]: in the nuclear domain. So right, so you had important adversaries like China, which had

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.280
[Guest]: acquired nuclear weapons, you knew that Pakistan was acquiring, in the 1971 context, you had

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.600
[Guest]: the United States sending in the Seventh Fleet, which had nuclear weapons on board, to the

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.560
[Guest]: Bay of Bengal, and so on. So in a sense, nuclear weapons and demonstrating that capability

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.960
[Guest]: was seen basically as a way of telling others that India would not back down in the face

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.280
[Guest]: of any kind of overt or covert threat of nuclear coercion, right. So it's that really. So in

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.600
[Guest]: that sense, it is more at a strategic political level that India was thinking about it. Whereas

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.640
[Guest]: for Pakistan, you know, the capability, and then even the moment at which they chose to

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.680
[Guest]: sort of start developing that capability, really reflected their lopsided conventional

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.240
[Guest]: military balance with India, right. The Bangladesh war really brings it to the fore. Not only

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.080
[Guest]: do you lose half of the country, and in some ways, the more populous half, but you have

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:35.240
[Guest]: 93,000 Pakistani soldiers in Indian custody. It is a very starkly humiliating sort of moment,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.960
[Guest]: which exposes Pakistan's conventional military inferiority vis-a-vis India. And in that sense,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.920
[Guest]: they always see nuclear weapons as a way of compensating for that conventional imbalance

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.680
[Amit Varma]: of power with India.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And would you say the quality of your nuclear capabilities to some extent, driven by these

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.640
[Amit Varma]: imperatives, like Pakistan's imperative is to actually have nuclear weapons they can

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.360
[Amit Varma]: use in a variety of different situations, tactically on the battlefield or otherwise,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.320
[Amit Varma]: and so on. While for India, what is important is to have nuclear weapons, so as to be able

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.960
[Amit Varma]: to signal credibly that they are nuclear power. And does that then impact the intensity with

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.480
[Amit Varma]: which you pursue building an actual nuclear arsenal?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.640
[Guest]: Well, yes, but even in the case of Pakistan, these are things which happen only over a

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.280
[Guest]: period of time, right? Because till such time you have covert capabilities, or you do not

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.160
[Guest]: declare yourself and what nuclear weapons state, it becomes difficult to then, you know,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.640
[Guest]: try out a range of other things without others picking up on what your actions are. So in

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:41.080
[Guest]: that sense, it's only in the post 1998 phase that Pakistan also starts thinking about how

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.200
[Guest]: to make these nuclear weapons kind of more integrated with conventional sort of, you

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.640
[Guest]: know, military power, not necessarily in terms of deploying them for, you know, for actual

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.080
[Guest]: military use. But how do you use that in ways that will negate India's conventional superiority,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.080
[Guest]: right?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.640
[Guest]: So that design is there in the mind, but it's only in the post 1998 phase that the Pakistanis

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.560
[Guest]: really start seeing it. But what is interesting is that even before Pakistan overtly sort

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.920
[Guest]: of does its nuclear tests in 1998, they are already aware of the fact that Indians are

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:18.400
[Guest]: aware of this, and then use that to push in more insurgency, terrorism in the context

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.120
[Guest]: of Jammu and Kashmir, but also in other parts of India in that period. Of course, it is

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.160
[Guest]: a context in Jammu and Kashmir, which kind of allows them to sort of do it. But the fact

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.120
[Guest]: that they are able to leverage that context is in some ways unthinkable without the presence

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.240
[Guest]: of some kind of even covert nuclear capability in that early stage.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we go on to discuss nuclear deterrence in detail and how it evolved and

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:49.200
[Amit Varma]: so on, tell me a little bit about deterrence per se. What are the different kinds of deterrence?

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:57.520
[Guest]: Well, the word deterrence comes from the verb deter, which means to sort of stop someone

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:04.400
[Guest]: from doing something that someone wants to do, right. So the way we think about deterrence

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.760
[Guest]: is typically that you think about it in terms of deterrence by way of threatening prospective

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.240
[Guest]: punishment, right. I mean, think about any day to day circumstance, you know, I have

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.200
[Guest]: young kids, right. So how do I tell my kids not to do something is by saying, if you do

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.040
[Guest]: that, then this is the punishment that you will get, you know, you will be sort of grounded

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.680
[Guest]: for a week or something to that effect, right. I mean, in back in the day, parents used to

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.280
[Guest]: actually give it to you. I hope they are listening to this. Do they listen to my podcast?

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.880
[Guest]: Yeah. So, so, you know, back in the day, when I was growing up, parents had stronger ways

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.560
[Guest]: of deterring you by giving you a, you know, a few tight whacks. I suppose we are, you

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.320
[Guest]: know, at a level of civilization where those things are at least not to be talked about

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.520
[Guest]: on podcasts. So, but that is a standard way of thinking about, right. So you, you, you,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.360
[Guest]: you change someone's behavior or by telling them not to do something by threatening prospective

00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.280
[Guest]: punishment. Now, there is another way of thinking about it, which is not just about punishment,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.080
[Guest]: but which is what you call deterrence by denial, right. Let me give you another example, which

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.560
[Guest]: will sort of crystallize this. Now, how do you think about preventing a thief from entering

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.800
[Guest]: your house? So one way of doing it is to say that, listen, we have law, which says anyone

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.240
[Guest]: who tries to break into someone else's house, if he's caught, will be sort of punished for

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.640
[Guest]: so many years, right. So that is a classic case of deterrence by punishment. You have

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.280
[Guest]: law on the statute books, you have courts, you have the police, then whole enforcement

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.240
[Guest]: machinery precisely to deter people. The idea is not so much to punish someone who's been

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.000
[Guest]: caught. The idea is to deter those who may be thinking of such actions in the future.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.880
[Guest]: That is what deterrence by punishment is a classic example. But another way of thinking

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: about the same problem, how to prevent the thief from entering your house, is to say,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.920
[Guest]: I am going to construct a 15 to 20 feet wall all around my house. I'm going to put an electricity

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.200
[Guest]: sort of driven fence all around it. So every thief will know that it's actually next to

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.120
[Guest]: impossible to break into this house. That changes his decision calculus about whether

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.440
[Guest]: he should even try it or not. That is called deterrence by denial, right. So another way

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.080
[Guest]: of thinking about this distinction is to say that, you know, all forms of deterrence aim

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.920
[Guest]: to influence the cost benefit calculations of whoever is your target, right, whose behavior

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.240
[Guest]: you want to change. Now, deterrence by punishment goes after the cost side of the equation because

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.760
[Guest]: you're telling him or her that if you do this, then you're going to incur costs by way of

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.680
[Guest]: my punishment. Yeah. But another way of thinking about it is to say that you go after the benefit

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.920
[Guest]: sides of the equation by telling the other person that you won't, in the first instance,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.720
[Guest]: be able to pocket the benefits of whatever it is that you want to do, right. So that

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.960
[Guest]: is called deterrence by denial, right. So deterrence works by punishment and by denial.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.640
[Guest]: These are not mutually exclusive, but there is one salient distinction. Deterrence by

00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.240
[Guest]: punishment is typically easier and less costly to execute, whereas deterrence by denial is

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.880
[Guest]: more expensive. Just go back to the example of the thief, right? If I rely on the law

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.560
[Guest]: and, you know, the threat of prospective punishment, do I need to do very much? Not. But if I want

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.120
[Guest]: to build a fence and you want to put up walls, I've got to fork out money, right? So deterrence

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.200
[Guest]: by denial is the stronger form of deterrence, but it's also the one which is more costly

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.800
[Amit Varma]: for you to implement. So in the context of your kids, if you don't want them to watch

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.720
[Amit Varma]: too much TV, deterrence by punishment would be to tell them that, listen, you know, no

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:34.400
[Amit Varma]: dinner for you or too tight wax if you watch like TV beyond 9pm. And deterrence by denial

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.000
[Amit Varma]: would be not having a television set at home, which is very costly for you because you yourself

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: like television, right?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.720
[Guest]: And which is my preferred way of deterring them from watching television. I've not had

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.920
[Guest]: the privilege of having a television set at home for maybe eight years now.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.960
[Amit Varma]: There you go. And I don't watch news television either. But what does one do about football?

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, you could argue there is Hotstar. Right. So we'll come back to deterrence by denial

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.360
[Amit Varma]: later. But just talking about deterrence by punishment, once Pakistan kind of goes nuclear

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:08.040
[Amit Varma]: and once India goes in that direction as well, through the 80s and up to 98, it's basically

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.160
[Amit Varma]: deterrence by punishment. And it's basically nuclear deterrence where you are either you're

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.280
[Amit Varma]: threatening to go nuclear or anything else you threaten isn't effective because the other

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.240
[Amit Varma]: side can go nuclear and therefore there's not much you can do at all. And you pointed

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.160
[Amit Varma]: me to this excellent paper by Vipin Narang, which is linked on my episode page, which

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.840
[Amit Varma]: kind of talks about the different levels of deterrence and especially why Pakistan is

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.800
[Amit Varma]: able to deter India, but India is not able to deter Pakistan. And what I learned from

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.760
[Amit Varma]: that was what Narang calls the posture, the nuclear posture of each country of Pakistan

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:51.120
[Amit Varma]: rather changed from 86 to 98. Tell me a little bit more about the different kinds of deterrence

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.760
[Guest]: and how 98 changed the dynamic. Well, I think it's important in the first instance to point

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.600
[Guest]: out quite clearly what is it that India wants to deter and what is it that Pakistan wants

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.560
[Guest]: to deter. Right. Because those are kind of two different things, even though the issues

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.680
[Guest]: and what are the instruments in play are somewhat similar. Right. From the Indian perspective,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.720
[Guest]: the first instance you want to deter the use of any nuclear weapons by a state like Pakistan

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.080
[Guest]: or any other state against India in any context. So there you have a posture of sort of declared

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.120
[Guest]: nuclear policy of massive retaliation. You say that, listen, if you are going to use

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.120
[Guest]: force against us, we are going to hit you so hard and punish you so much that it's not

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.160
[Guest]: even going to be worthwhile for you to have initiated this action in the first place.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.760
[Guest]: Right. So, so that is a very clear strategy of deterrence by punishment, but which is

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.680
[Guest]: aimed at the nuclear use. But there is another level at which you want deterrence to operate,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.080
[Guest]: which is to say that you want to deter Pakistan or the terrorist groups which are striking

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:58.160
[Guest]: you from carrying out these terrorist strikes against you. Now, if you want to deter that,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.800
[Guest]: then frankly, the nuclear deterrence angle does not really come into play because what

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.680
[Guest]: you have to have the capability there is in the first instance to either punish Pakistan

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.760
[Guest]: and the terrorist organizations which are striking against you, or to be able to create

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.920
[Guest]: systems which will deny them the opportunity to be able to carry out those attacks in the

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:24.120
[Guest]: first place. Right. So there you need either denial or punishment. And, and that's a different

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.520
[Guest]: kind of a level at which you are looking to do deterrence. Now, how does it work from

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.000
[Guest]: Pakistani side? Right. From Pakistan's point of view, they know that India, because of

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.040
[Guest]: its conventional superiority is unlikely to be using nuclear weapons in the first instance.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.240
[Guest]: So their nuclear weapons really are aimed against deterring India from bringing to bear

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.360
[Guest]: its conventional superiority against Pakistan in any context. Now, that context could be

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.760
[Guest]: that of terrorism, right? So you have a major terrorist attack. India sort of cannot respond

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.160
[Guest]: with a major use of its conventional force, say in the way that it did in 1965, hypothetically,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.800
[Guest]: because it should then fear that this conflict will escalate to the nuclear level. It could

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.400
[Guest]: invoke, it could sort of push Pakistan to use its nuclear weapons in order to deter

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.480
[Guest]: a conventional use of force by India. Right. So for the Pakistani nuclear weapons, therefore,

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.380
[Guest]: are basically a way of negating India's conventional superiority, and then allowing them to continue

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:24.600
[Guest]: to impose costs on India by subconventional means, by which we mean insurgency and terrorism.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.280
[Guest]: But putting India in this bind of saying, listen, you have to absorb these costs, but

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.720
[Guest]: you cannot punish us in any significant way, because that punishment then carries the risk

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.000
[Guest]: of escalating to a nuclear conflict of some kind. And that is the way in which the Pakistani

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.520
[Guest]: strategy of deterrence really operates. Right. And what Narang tries to tell in his paper

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.400
[Guest]: is really about how the Pakistani posture has kind of evolved in the period after the

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.300
[Guest]: Pakistani sort of nuclear tests of 1998, and also in response to various kinds of actions

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.960
[Guest]: that India has taken. Right. So in that sense, I think the key thing for us to remember is

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:04.360
[Guest]: that, you know, nuclear deterrence or normal deterrence is like any strategic situation.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:10.280
[Guest]: Yeah, strategy, the essence of strategy really is interdependent decision making. The decisions

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.360
[Guest]: that you want to make depends on the decision that the other side is going to make and vice

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.360
[Guest]: versa. Right. So in that sense, it's a constantly evolving iterative game that continues over

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.040
[Guest]: a period of time, which is why game theory provides a very good basic template within

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.840
[Amit Varma]: which to think about strategic situations. And are we disadvantaged by the fact that

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:35.240
[Amit Varma]: because of our rational posturing, and I know first use doctrine and so on, that our actions,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.120
[Amit Varma]: our reactions have so far been relatively predictable, while the Pakistanis have been

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.680
[Amit Varma]: relatively unpredictable in the sense we don't really know how they will respond. And therefore,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.000
[Amit Varma]: whenever we respond to a provocation from them, we tend to play it as safe as we can,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.760
[Amit Varma]: because hey, what if they go nuclear, while in their case, they can do a lot of things

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.200
[Amit Varma]: with impunity, because you know, they know there's a no first news here, they know that,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, we are also at some level wary of that kind of escalation, does that matter?

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.800
[Guest]: Well, the first thing is to point out the reasons for India's adoption of the no first

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.800
[Guest]: use policy, right. So the NFU posture was adopted or announced by the Vajpayee government

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.040
[Guest]: soon after the nuclear tests. And the reason that, you know, sort of we kind of adopted

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.400
[Guest]: that posture over a period of time, and then it was kind of, you know, codified in a doctrine

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:30.440
[Guest]: and so on, was primarily to demonstrate that India is not looking to use nuclear weapons

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.680
[Guest]: in any kind of military, you know, operational context at all, but that we are primarily

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.400
[Guest]: looking at it as a device to prevent the use of nuclear weapons as tools of coercion by

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.940
[Guest]: anyone else. So from that perspective, we saw it simply as a deterrent to against the

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.600
[Guest]: use of nuclear weapons by any other state. Right now, there has been a lot of criticism

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.200
[Guest]: over the years saying that India is, you know, unnecessarily tying its hands because the

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.720
[Guest]: NFU posture then allows Pakistan to sort of do a range of things without India being able

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.960
[Guest]: to invoke its nuclear weapons. But there is a flip side to it. And I think that argument

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.160
[Guest]: is kind of worth taking on board, which is to say that if India abandons its no first

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.600
[Guest]: use policy, or let's say it never had a no first use policy, if it had a policy saying,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.200
[Guest]: we reserve the right to use whatever capabilities that we have, depending on our assessment

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.160
[Guest]: of what the nature of the threat to India is, then you have to understand that as the

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:31.920
[Guest]: smaller of the two states, Pakistan will be concerned that India may actually use its

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.920
[Guest]: nuclear weapons in a first use mode, a first strike, really to take out Pakistani nuclear

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:42.600
[Guest]: capability, because that then neutralizes Pakistan's nuclear capability, and allows

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.440
[Guest]: India to bring its conventional superiority to bear. Right. So that is the way if you

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.360
[Guest]: are a rational actor, you would imagine that the way India would be thinking about it is

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.760
[Guest]: to say that, hey, we have nuclear weapons, let's use these to take out the Pakistani

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.880
[Guest]: nukes. Once the Pakistani nukes are gone, we are back to the pre nuclear age, where

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.720
[Guest]: it's just the conventional superiority of India, which will kick in. And from Pakistan's

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.480
[Guest]: perspective, that then brings about what, you know, nuclear deterrence or scholars of

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:14.160
[Guest]: nuclear weapons call a use it or lose it dilemma. So the fear of a first strike could then actually

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.720
[Guest]: catalyze them to sort of think about using it very early on in any crisis, rather than

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.600
[Guest]: having a restraint, right. So in a sense, India's NFU posture actually allows these

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.840
[Guest]: crises not from escalating very quickly. So I think that is a very important part of what

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.240
[Guest]: the NFU brings to the table. And I think it's worth remembering that, because at the end

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.040
[Guest]: of the day, the problem that India has been confronting for the last 30 years from Pakistan,

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:45.520
[Guest]: fundamentally, is at the level of subconventional threats. And whether nuclear first use against

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.160
[Guest]: Pakistan is the proportionate response to that, it's inconceivable that India or any

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.400
[Guest]: decision makers sitting in New Delhi will actually assume that nuking Pakistan is the

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.280
[Guest]: response to their support for terrorism of whatever scale or magnitude, right.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.280
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, our abandoning the first use doctrine would make first use more likely

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.160
[Guest]: by them. Exactly. I think it will make for much greater

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.280
[Guest]: degrees of instability. And it can be a very worrying proposition. We have already seen

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.720
[Guest]: that Pakistan has kind of developed, you know, sort of these tactical nuclear weapons, which

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.280
[Guest]: they have sort of devolved down the chain of command, primarily because they believe

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.440
[Guest]: India is trying to develop other forms of, you know, conventional capabilities, which

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.440
[Guest]: you can bring to bear very quickly, what used to be called the cold start doctrine, and

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.320
[Guest]: so on, which the Pakistanis believe have to be deterred, right. And in that sense, if

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.600
[Guest]: we say that, listen, we are going to bring about a degree of ambiguity in this domain,

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.720
[Guest]: I think that will have consequences of instability. In fact, there is a new paper, which is an

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.120
[Guest]: even more interesting paper by Vipin Narang and Chris Clary, which has just come out even

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.920
[Guest]: literally in the last couple of weeks, where they make an interesting argument saying,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.120
[Guest]: why is it that India constantly talks about saying that we need to abandon this NFU? You

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.680
[Guest]: know, is India really moving towards a counterforce kind of strategy, which is saying we are developing

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.800
[Guest]: a nuclear strategy, which aims at taking out Pakistani nuclear weapons? Now, if that is

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:12.160
[Guest]: indeed true, then that could introduce very dangerous dynamics very early on in any crisis

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.720
[Amit Varma]: between India and Pakistan.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.320
[Amit Varma]: And just to summarise sort of Narang's thesis on how Pakistan's approach changed because

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.320
[Amit Varma]: of India going nuclear in 98 was, he talks about three kinds of nuclear postures that

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.800
[Amit Varma]: you can have the catalytic, the assured retaliation, and asymmetric escalation. Assured retaliation

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.720
[Amit Varma]: is basically what India and China do, which is the no first use doctrine. Catalytic is

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.000
[Amit Varma]: what according to him, Pakistan did between 86 and 98, which is basically, you know, you

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.320
[Amit Varma]: are trying to catalyse a third party into intervening. For example, what Israel did

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.840
[Amit Varma]: during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 was exactly this, where they showed that they were mobilising

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.760
[Amit Varma]: nuclear weapons so that the US would intervene, and not necessarily to use the weapons per

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.800
[Amit Varma]: se. And in both the brass tacks crisis of 1986, and then the Kashmir crisis of 1990,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan postured in a catalytic way about its nuclear weaponry so that the US would

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.480
[Amit Varma]: intervene at a diplomatic level, which they succeeded in doing. But otherwise, Narang

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.720
[Amit Varma]: says India was not actually going to be deterred. And therefore, it wasn't effective. And what

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:25.240
[Amit Varma]: changed with 98 was that because India had gone nuclear to counter that they shifted

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.000
[Amit Varma]: from catalytic to asymmetric escalation, which is basically you are saying that we will use

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.880
[Amit Varma]: it at any point in time, we'll use it on the battlefield, we'll use it as a tactical thing,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:42.440
[Amit Varma]: we are unpredictable. And the term he used about that strategy was deterrent optimal,

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.320
[Amit Varma]: which is that, you know, because Pakistan is doing asymmetric escalation, and you know,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.600
[Amit Varma]: posturing that we will use it at any point in time, and India is saying we won't be the

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.800
[Amit Varma]: first to use it, it automatically gives them an advantage over us in the sense that they

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.760
[Amit Varma]: can continue doing subconventional, or, you know, supporting cross border terrorism, basically,

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:07.240
[Amit Varma]: with impunity, knowing that any escalation that we carry out has a threat of nuclear

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.360
[Amit Varma]: escalation. So I think it's in response to this that some people often say that, hey,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.360
[Amit Varma]: we should leave the no first use doctrine.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.060
[Guest]: Yeah, as I said, I mean, the leaving out the no first use will introduce more dangerous

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: dynamics in any India Pakistan crisis, in ways that may not necessarily be beneficial

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.840
[Guest]: to India, there is no reason for India to adopt a crisis posture, which will somehow

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.200
[Guest]: give incentives for the Pakistanis to think that the best thing is for them to use nuclear

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.920
[Guest]: weapons early on, why would we do it? It's suicidal to think that that's in any way a

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.480
[Guest]: strategically wise move. So to that extent, I don't think that's there. But there are

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.080
[Guest]: other options that India has been sort of exploring. And in some ways, you know, you

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.280
[Guest]: could think about the evolution of Indian strategy towards Pakistan, as primarily a

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.040
[Guest]: search for usable options between the sort of conventional and nuclear realm, in order

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.760
[Guest]: to deter Pakistan's subconventional activities, right, which is to say that, listen, the Pakistanis

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.920
[Guest]: keep saying that we have these red lines that, you know, we can sort of go asymmetric very

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.320
[Guest]: soon. But actually speaking, if they are a rational actor, they cannot want a nuclear

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.640
[Guest]: exchange with India either. Because, you know, India will survive, but Pakistan cannot survive

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.520
[Guest]: a massive retaliation by India, right. That is the premise of India's nuclear deterrent.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.160
[Guest]: So when the Pakistanis are suggesting that, you know, the nuclear threshold is actually

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.560
[Guest]: here, it is not there. And the challenge for Indian strategy, therefore, is to explore

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.520
[Guest]: what is the space between conventional and nuclear, where force can be brought to bear

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:42.200
[Guest]: effectively to deter Pakistan's support of subconventional options, right. And so if

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:47.000
[Guest]: you think about, you know, when the 1998 nuclear test happened, India was the first one to

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.840
[Guest]: test. Then Indian Home Minister LK Advani said, I believe in Parliament, that, you know,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.500
[Guest]: now India will start pursuing options like hot pursuit of terrorists across the line

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.640
[Guest]: of control. Because he believed that now that India had gone overtly nuclear, you know,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.040
[Guest]: it had the sort of ability to, you know, put Pakistan on the mat. But once Pakistanis got

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.560
[Guest]: their own nuclear tests in a reciprocal way, then Indian decision makers had to become

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.920
[Guest]: a lot more cautious. So, a year down the line, or almost a year down the line, when you had

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.120
[Guest]: the sort of Kargil conflict happening, which was basically an attempt by Pakistanis to

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.120
[Guest]: grab territory on the Indian side of the line of control in the Kargil area, the government

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:39.080
[Guest]: of India responded by significant use of force, but ensured that that use of force was contained

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.840
[Guest]: to evicting Pakistanis who had come on the Indian side of the line of control. Even the

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.560
[Guest]: use of air power at that point of time was restricted to striking on Pakistanis who were

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.840
[Guest]: on the Indian side of the line of control. We did not want to say strike Pakistani logistical

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.960
[Guest]: lines or supply lines on the other side. And, you know, in fact, in his memoir on the Kargil

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.660
[Guest]: war, the then Army Chief General VP Malik says that the air chief at that point of time

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:07.320
[Guest]: pointed out that if we are going to use air power, then it can lead to escalation. And

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.440
[Guest]: the political leadership of the time, which is Prime Minister Vajpayee, took a conscious

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.560
[Guest]: decision that India should not cross the line of control, and that operations have to be

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.440
[Guest]: carried out on the Pakistanis on this side of the line of control. And again, the reason

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.840
[Guest]: for that was precisely because you wanted to use force in order to evict the Pakistanis,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.160
[Guest]: but you did not want to use force in ways that would lead to further escalation towards

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.480
[Guest]: the sort of nuclear realm. So, in a sense, you are finding that space.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.840
[Guest]: In fact, after the Kargil war, then Defence Minister George Fernandes gave a speech, where

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:47.280
[Guest]: he sort of pointedly said that the Kargil war has demonstrated that there is space between

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.140
[Guest]: the conventional and the nuclear realm, where India can use force in order to bring things

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.960
[Guest]: to bear. But of course, you know, using force on the scale of things of Kargil with the

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.480
[Guest]: degree of restraint was only possible because of the peculiar sort of nature of that conflict,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.440
[Guest]: which was about Pakistanis doing a land grab on the Indian side of the line of control,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.860
[Guest]: right. But the problem of terrorism still proved quite difficult to crack. So, for instance,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.700
[Guest]: in the period after the nuclear tests and the Kargil conflict, you had a fairly sort

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.960
[Guest]: of intense period where India was using various kinds of conventional means to deter Pakistani

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.440
[Guest]: support for infiltration of terrorism across the line of control, right. So, you sort of

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.540
[Guest]: hit them very hard with artillery weapons, constant small arms firing, even actions across

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:36.120
[Guest]: the line of control, right, by what were sort of informally called, you know, BATs. So,

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: you know, you would sort of go across, hit them, punish them, and tell them that listen,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.720
[Guest]: supporting infiltration from this sector is not a cost free option for you, right. So,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.360
[Guest]: that was one way of doing it. But when you had a significant terrorist strike, like what

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.280
[Guest]: happened in by way of the attack on Parliament in India in December 2001, then the government

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: felt that, you know, you had to respond much more strongly. But once again, you felt that

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.040
[Guest]: air power was not possibly the best way of doing it. And then you mobilise the all your

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: armed forces, threaten Pakistan with a serious strike. But once the Pakistanis counter mobilised,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.840
[Guest]: and once the rest of the international community got into the action, you very quickly realised

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.960
[Guest]: that carrying out major conventional operations against Pakistan would be very risky.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Musharraf explicitly said that our response to escalation may not be conventional

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840
[Guest]: alone.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840
[Guest]: Explicitly threatened.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.480
[Guest]: So, for Pakistan, it makes sense for them to sort of try and negate India's conventional

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.760
[Guest]: superiority, right. So, so the search for the space between the conventional and the

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.920
[Guest]: nuclear realm, where India could effectively use force to deter terrorism, continues after

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.640
[Guest]: the 2001 crisis. That is when you come up with this whole concept of something called

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.520
[Guest]: Cold Start, which has never been formally sort of accepted by the Indian government.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.760
[Guest]: But broadly speaking, the idea was that one of the major problems in the 2001-2002 crisis

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.800
[Guest]: was that it took about three weeks before your entire armed forces could be mobilised,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.640
[Guest]: particularly a strike course, which are capable of carrying out, you know, serious offensive

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.280
[Guest]: operations and imposing costs on Pakistan.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.640
[Guest]: So, you came up with this idea that it would be good to have, you know, formations which

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.400
[Guest]: are capable of hitting across, maybe capturing some territory, imposing costs on the Pakistan

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.840
[Guest]: army, but which did not require this kind of long gestation period of mobilisation and

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.800
[Guest]: so on. So, it would be a cold, a standing start or a cold start was the way that you

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.320
[Guest]: were thinking. But the Pakistani response to that was to then say that, you know, we

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.320
[Guest]: are going to then lower the sort of nuclear threshold by a developing nuclear weapons,

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.680
[Guest]: which can be used in more sort of practical ways, i.e. in an operational battlefield kind

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.360
[Guest]: of context, and by devolving some of these sort of weapons further down the chain of

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.360
[Guest]: command, right. So, you increase the risks of nuclear escalation for India.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.540
[Guest]: So, if India is going to think about saying that, listen, okay, we are going to send our

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.960
[Guest]: armoured formation or whatever cold start kind of operation across. And when we are

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.840
[Guest]: on their side of the international boundary or line of control, the Pakistanis use a tactical

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.640
[Guest]: nuclear weapon, what are you going to do? Because they have used nuclear weapons in

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.040
[Guest]: response to a conventional operation by you on their own territory, right. That then puts

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.720
[Guest]: you in a great dilemma of saying, are you going to respond now really by that massive

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.600
[Guest]: retaliation strike that you promised?

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.600
[Guest]: Because there's an issue of proportionality.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.760
[Guest]: Proportionality and, you know, whether the issue merits that kind of a response. So,

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.720
[Amit Varma]: that search for that space, therefore, continues, right.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And the problem, another problem with the cold start also would be that it's hard for

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.520
[Amit Varma]: us to predict what action they will consider sufficiently escalatory to go nuclear. So,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.960
[Amit Varma]: we might think, for example, that we will go as far as point X and then we will come

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.320
[Amit Varma]: back, but they don't know that. So, you know, for example, you know, if we go into POK,

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.560
[Amit Varma]: that's one thing, and it might not even be sufficient provocation. But if we go anywhere

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.840
[Amit Varma]: in Punjab or Sindh, you know, Lahore is 25 kilometers from the border. We go 10 kilometers

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.400
[Amit Varma]: in, it's an existential threat for them. They could just go nuclear. So, since we don't

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.000
[Amit Varma]: know that, then as a matter of precaution, we don't go anywhere.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.860
[Guest]: Well, I mean, so that's the problem, right? Which is that nobody really knows where those

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.720
[Guest]: red lines are. The Pakistani army and, you know, the head of the strategic plans division

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.440
[Guest]: back in the day had enunciated some red lines and so on. But there is every incentive for

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:25.280
[Guest]: Pakistan to keep those as hazy as possible, because you want to introduce uncertainty

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.360
[Guest]: in the minds of the Indian decision maker, right? You know, Thomas Schelling used to

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.920
[Guest]: say that, you know, there is a threat that leaves something to chance. That is exactly

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.360
[Guest]: the kind of posture that the Pakistanis will want to adopt, which is to say that, listen,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.360
[Guest]: you don't know. And actually, frankly, even we don't know, because we will only know it

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.400
[Guest]: when we are in that crisis. And at that point of time, if you are going to use this particular

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.560
[Guest]: sort of option, then, you know, we genuinely don't know how we're going to do it. And again,

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.160
[Guest]: you know, Tom Schelling, who wrote some of the most classic pieces of work on thinking

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.520
[Guest]: through some of these dynamics of nuclear strategy, has this fantastic sort of, you

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.760
[Guest]: know, an image or a metaphor, example of how this works.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:11.280
[Guest]: He says, think of two men in a boat, right? Both of whom are trying to say that one wants

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.200
[Guest]: the boat to go in the direction of one bank, and the other one wants to push it in the

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.880
[Guest]: other, right? So what's the best way of sort of convincing the other person is to start

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.640
[Guest]: rocking the boat. Because when you rock the boat, what you're threatening is not that,

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.280
[Guest]: you know, the other person will incur costs, but you're saying that both of them are going

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.480
[Guest]: to incur costs, and we just don't know what point the boat is going to tip over, right?

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.360
[Guest]: So those are threats that leave something to chance. And for Pakistan, it makes absolute

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.080
[Guest]: rational sense to adopt that kind of a posture, rather than allowing India to say that, listen,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.800
[Guest]: we can be very sure of what is it that is going to trigger a nuclear use with Pakistan.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.200
[Guest]: Now, Indian decision makers may well believe that, no, Pakistanis are bluffing that actually

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.520
[Guest]: their nuclear threshold is much higher, it is much further interior and so on. But can

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.440
[Guest]: you be sure?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.040
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, is it like, you know, what game theorists would call the game of chicken

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.800
[Amit Varma]: where the more irrational party has a distinct advantage? And in this case, Pakistan can

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.320
[Amit Varma]: portray themselves as irrational, and you don't know what they're up to. But Indians,

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:17.160
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately, stick to a very sort of rational playbook. And that ship has probably sailed,

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:21.680
[Amit Varma]: we can't really portray ourselves as too irrational right now. But in that game of chicken, we

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.280
[Amit Varma]: are, we are losing, we are behind.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:28.080
[Guest]: Well, I mean, I think the sort of, you know, the example of chicken might exaggerate the

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.240
[Guest]: elements of irrationality, which say a country like Pakistan has to demonstrate in this case,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:38.600
[Guest]: Pakistan is a conventionally weaker, geographically smaller. And for them, it's, it's perfectly

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:44.120
[Guest]: rational to say that, listen, as the much smaller and weaker of the two sides, if we

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:51.120
[Guest]: believe we are under threat, then we may use whatever is at hand. We don't know. We just

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.280
[Guest]: cannot be sure. It's not about you cannot be sure, even we cannot be sure where those

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.000
[Amit Varma]: red lines are. That's the only way to play this game.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but in the game of chicken, it's always rational to portray yourself as a more irrational

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.280
[Guest]: like Kim does in North Korea, for example.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.680
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly. So, in this context, I mean, I think the Pakistanis have, you know, you

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:12.360
[Guest]: know, precisely all the incentives to act in ways that suggest that these things will

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.400
[Guest]: go out of control. And again, you know, this is not a hypothetical. If you, we'll come

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:23.880
[Guest]: to the latest sort of crisis. But if you recall, when Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.700
[Guest]: gave a televised press speech, and this was even before the Indian airstrike happened,

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:35.280
[Guest]: he said, that, listen, you know, if India uses force, it's not like we will think of

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.280
[Guest]: using force, we will actually have to retaliate. And thereafter, you know, nobody knows all

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.600
[Guest]: bets are off. And that is exactly the rational approach to take for Pakistan by telling India

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.760
[Guest]: that listen, it's not just that you can guess or not guess where our red lines are, even

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760
[Amit Varma]: we don't know.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.360
[Amit Varma]: Right. We'll take a quick commercial break and come back on the other side of the break.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.480
[Unknown]: Hello, everybody. Welcome to another awesome week on the IVM podcast network. If you are

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.000
[Unknown]: following us on social media, please make sure that you are. We are IVM podcast on Twitter,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.440
[Unknown]: Facebook and Instagram. If you are following us on social media, I'm sure you know that

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.520
[Unknown]: it's our fourth anniversary this month. Yeah, IVM is four years old. We've done 3500 plus

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.280
[Unknown]: episodes of content and it's been an amazing ride with a lot of fun guests, a lot of fun

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.880
[Unknown]: content and a lot of great hosts. We'd like to thank all of our hosts because without

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.080
[Unknown]: them we wouldn't really be doing all that much. Also, I mentioned over the last couple

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.880
[Unknown]: of weeks that we're running a survey right now, a listener survey. It's on IVM podcast

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.400
[Unknown]: dot com slash survey. If you have not filled that out, please do fill it up. It'll help

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.400
[Unknown]: us figure out what is working for you, what's not working, and will give us some information

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.080
[Unknown]: that we can use to get some advertising on the show. On Cyrus Says, Cyrus is joined by

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.000
[Unknown]: comedian Nivedita Prakasam. They talk about Nivedita's experience on a TV reality show

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.320
[Unknown]: and how dating and growing up is different in small town India. We're launching a new

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.040
[Unknown]: show called States of Anarchy about global affairs hosted by foreign policy enthusiast

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:56.040
[Unknown]: Hamsini Hariharan. On IVM Lies, Janam, Abbas, Karthik, and Alika celebrate IVM's 4th anniversary

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.320
[Unknown]: by recommending some standout episodes and recollecting their favorite moments and experiences.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.080
[Unknown]: On Dating is Garbage, the hosts are joined by guest Sharanya Subramaniam to discuss dating

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.440
[Unknown]: red flags. On Paisa Vaisa, Anupam is joined by Jai Toshnival, CEO of Toshnival Equities,

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.040
[Unknown]: who explains how you can create wealth with equities. On the Habit Coach podcast, Ashton

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.360
[Unknown]: talks about the importance of checking food labels before buying to avoid hidden sugar,

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.640
[Unknown]: salt, and fat content. On the Svanch podcast, Ambhi Parmeswaran sheds light on the significance

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.720
[Unknown]: of reducing body copy of print ads and making the headlines stand out. And with that, let's

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.720
[Amit Varma]: continue with your show.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Srinath Raghavan about the India

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.880
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan conflicts and the many things that the different options that India can reasonably

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:40.360
[Amit Varma]: contemplate or the different options that India explored after the dynamic of 98 with

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.720
[Amit Varma]: deterrence in where they're trying to explore what kind of space of retaliation is possible

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.080
[Amit Varma]: between the sub conventional and the nuclear. What can they do that doesn't provoke a nuclear

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:58.520
[Amit Varma]: response from Pakistan, and at the same time satisfies the need for revenge or the need

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.000
[Amit Varma]: to appear strong or the bloodlust of a domestic audience. So one of the options which you

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.360
[Amit Varma]: just pointed out is a cold start doctrine, which is the army goes in and it occupies

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:13.520
[Amit Varma]: territory but is impractical because we simply don't know at what you know what will be enough

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.800
[Amit Varma]: of a trigger for them to actually go nuclear. The other option which we've actually seen

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:24.160
[Amit Varma]: in recent times are these limited air strikes, where you sort of, you know, do what is what

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.480
[Amit Varma]: is called a surgical strike and you don't actually so far until recently go into Pakistani

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.560
[Amit Varma]: territory you're just striking at alleged terrorist scams across the line of control

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:41.520
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan occupied Kashmir and you know, how effective are they and are they something

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.920
[Amit Varma]: that is now effective more in an optical sense than a military sense?

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.600
[Guest]: So the first thing we need to sort of parse out is what are the various kinds of objectives

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:57.080
[Guest]: that we have when we are trying to say use air power as we did in a context like this.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:03.360
[Guest]: So in the first instance, I would say that, you know, revenge is not a strategic objective.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.700
[Guest]: A strategic objective is the use of some means in order to achieve certain kinds of ends.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.360
[Amit Varma]: But it's sort of a political objective for the domestic audience.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.240
[Guest]: So every strategic action has an outward dimension, as well as an inward dimension, right?

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:24.000
[Guest]: So the inward dimension of the use of, say, air strikes or surgical strikes as in 2016

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.300
[Guest]: could be very much to signal to domestic audiences that here is a government which takes these

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.420
[Guest]: things strongly, you know, it gives confidence to the people that these things will not.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.120
[Guest]: And of course, you can exploit it for political objectives, you know, various domestic political

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.520
[Guest]: sort of purposes and so on. Now, but I don't think that's per se illegitimate.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.800
[Guest]: In fact, all kinds of strategic action will have this inward dynamic.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.680
[Guest]: The only question is whether you allow all strategic choices to be dictated by those

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.900
[Guest]: or not.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.040
[Guest]: Even for terrorist organizations, it is there, right?

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.880
[Guest]: I mean, they have to demonstrate to their supporters, their funders, their cadre that

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880
[Guest]: they are in action.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.120
[Guest]: So they have to carry out certain kinds of things.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120
[Guest]: So that's the first thing, right?

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.320
[Guest]: So you have a sort of inward dimension, which is about signaling to domestic audiences about

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.480
[Guest]: what you want to do.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:10.560
[Guest]: But the more important and central sort of strategic concern has to be to say, what do

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.720
[Guest]: you want to use force for?

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.920
[Guest]: So as I see it, I mean, there are at least two different kind of objectives there which

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.340
[Guest]: are related, but not exactly the same.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:25.300
[Guest]: So one is to say that we want to signal to the terrorist organizations themselves that

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.360
[Guest]: they will directly incur costs if they carry out attacks on India, and that those attacks

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.320
[Guest]: in sense also degrade their capacity to carry out future attacks, right?

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.800
[Guest]: So in a sense, strikes are there targeted at the terrorist organization.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.560
[Guest]: The other thing is to say that, you know, we actually want to deter Pakistan from continuing

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.920
[Guest]: to support or allowing these groups to operate out of its territory.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.040
[Guest]: The two things are not necessarily the same.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.560
[Guest]: They are somewhat related, but they are distinct objectives for us to pursue as well.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.160
[Guest]: Now, if we are thinking about saying, do we want to degrade the capacity of terrorist

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.600
[Guest]: organizations to carry out some attacks?

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:06.200
[Guest]: Yes, airstrikes, if effectively carried out, can enable that objective.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.200
[Guest]: Yes, they will take hits.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.320
[Guest]: It will take them a while to repair and get back into the game and so on.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:17.240
[Guest]: If we are thinking about saying, will airstrikes actually allow or change Pakistan's behavior,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.840
[Guest]: its stance towards the way that it thinks about using these groups, frankly, then the

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.440
[Guest]: quantum of force which is being used there is unlikely to be sufficient to be able to

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.080
[Guest]: change Pakistan's decision calculus in any significant way.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.480
[Guest]: Because let us remember at the end of the day, these jihadi tanzims and various terrorist

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.640
[Guest]: organizations are effectively embedded with elements of the Pakistani state.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.960
[Guest]: That is the way in which historically that state has developed.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.920
[Guest]: It is very difficult to change the nature of that state.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.800
[Guest]: You know, if you think of historical examples, you know, if you want to sort of change the

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.200
[Guest]: nature of certain kinds of states, you know, Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, it took massive

00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:01.520
[Guest]: defeats in world wars, occupation, rewriting of constitutions, prolonged periods of political

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.280
[Guest]: re-education, but even then only sort of, you know, success to varying degrees.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.960
[Guest]: What are the odds that an airstrike or even a series of airstrikes by India is going to

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.800
[Guest]: change the nature of the Pakistani state?

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.200
[Guest]: I think the odds are frankly limited.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.760
[Guest]: So we have to be clear about what is it that we want.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:22.640
[Guest]: If we want to say deter the Pakistanis from, you know, by saying that, listen, they should

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.320
[Guest]: tell their tanzims that listen, there is a certain quantum beyond which you don't want

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.320
[Guest]: to provoke India.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320
[Guest]: That's fine.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.360
[Guest]: You've achieved some degree of objective by telling them that, listen, don't site your

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.360
[Guest]: camps here and there, actually relocate them, push them further back outside of the range

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.480
[Guest]: of the Indian military's ability to hit you.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480
[Guest]: Fine.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480
[Guest]: Some objective has been achieved.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:44.280
[Guest]: But if the assumption is that the use of these kinds of strikes is going to change Pakistan's

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:49.520
[Guest]: fundamental calculus about how it thinks of using it, then it is unlikely to achieve that

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.520
[Guest]: objective, right?

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:56.000
[Guest]: There is space between the conventional and the nuclear realm where India can use force.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.720
[Guest]: But the question is whether that use of force is going to advance the objectives that you

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720
[Guest]: want.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:06.120
[Amit Varma]: So on one hand, you don't actually change the fundamental calculus that the Pakistani

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.720
[Amit Varma]: state is going to continue supporting these groups.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.120
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, while you may make it operationally harder for them to strike

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.640
[Amit Varma]: because you've destroyed a camp and they'll take time to reboot and maybe they need to

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.680
[Amit Varma]: have their future camps further out, it could also work the other way because any jihadi

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:29.200
[Amit Varma]: deaths that you actually cause could motivate new jihadis and future jihadis into coming

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.200
[Amit Varma]: into battle.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Plus, any civilian casualties that you cause will essentially be creating new terrorists

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680
[Guest]: out of nothing.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.960
[Guest]: Well, one is simply about that kind of dynamic of revenge and so on, right?

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:46.560
[Guest]: Another very plausible dynamic is to say that it may actually give the sort of jihadi organizations

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.840
[Guest]: incentives to carry out even larger attacks on India, right?

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.160
[Guest]: Because if you are a terrorist organization, one of the major objectives that you really

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:59.360
[Guest]: want is to sort of get India into some kind of a serious confrontation with Pakistan.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.520
[Guest]: And if their reading is that, listen, every time there's a major attack, India is going

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.240
[Guest]: to respond with ever stronger strikes, then it makes sense to sort of keep provoking India

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.240
[Amit Varma]: further and further.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.240
[Amit Varma]: But why is that?

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, their support for all these jihadi groups, doesn't it come out of Zia

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.080
[Amit Varma]: ul Haq's stated doctrine of leading India by a thousand carts and therefore they want

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.880
[Amit Varma]: to keep leading India with small carts and not actually have it escalate too far.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.840
[Guest]: No, I'm saying that is the incentive for the jihadi organizations themselves.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.560
[Guest]: I mean, so that's why I'm saying that, you know, it's not as if the jihadi organizations

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:34.040
[Guest]: and the Pakistani state have exactly the same set of incentives, they don't.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.240
[Guest]: They neither have exactly the same set of incentives, nor do they have exactly the same

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.360
[Guest]: degrees of means and capabilities, right?

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.420
[Guest]: They are different sets, which is why I'm saying that in dealing with this problem, in thinking

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:50.000
[Guest]: about whether air power or any other say missile strikes or some kind of the future can actually

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.840
[Guest]: help you deal with the problem of terrorism, we have to understand that, yes, that will

00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:00.360
[Guest]: constitute deterrence by punishment of a certain variety.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:06.180
[Guest]: But deterrence by punishment, even of the variety that you are able to impose is unlikely

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.320
[Guest]: to be able to solve the problem for you.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.920
[Guest]: For the simple reason that that problem is kind of endemic to the Pakistani state.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.680
[Guest]: And if you really want to change the behavior of the state, then you're talking about something

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.920
[Guest]: orders of magnitude, higher levels of use of force, which the nuclear conflict context

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.760
[Guest]: really precludes you from doing.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.760
[Guest]: Right.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.240
[Guest]: So therefore, I think there are limits to what you can achieve by adopting a strategy

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.360
[Guest]: of deterrence by punishment.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.420
[Guest]: Deterrence by punishment works better for your domestic audiences, because you are seen

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.520
[Guest]: as hitting back.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.360
[Guest]: If you look at the response to these strikes in India, you know, why is there such a great

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.000
[Guest]: sort of, you know, whole degree of chest thumping going on saying we have now shown it to them?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.200
[Guest]: Because you just feel like you are helpless in some ways.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.880
[Guest]: It is not that the Indian state was doing nothing about these things.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:54.920
[Guest]: Yeah, we do have our own sort of sets of intelligence, covert capabilities, various other kinds of

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.200
[Guest]: ways of imposing costs on these groups.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.560
[Guest]: But those are not things that can be put out in the public domain day in and day out.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.120
[Guest]: Whereas a strike like this sends out a signal that listen, we are really sort of going to

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.760
[Guest]: take the game to them.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.760
[Guest]: But the problem is that it also sets expectations that somehow doing more of this is the solution

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.640
[Guest]: to the problem, which I don't think is true.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.120
[Guest]: Deterrence by punishment will only have limited effects within the context of the India Pakistan

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.800
[Amit Varma]: story.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And also that there's a law of diminishing returns in the sense that the more surgical

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:30.900
[Amit Varma]: strikes we do, the more effective each one will be even in mobilizing domestic opinion.

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:38.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the first one, the Uri one might satisfy that domestic bloodlust to some extent,

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.120
[Amit Varma]: this one to a lesser extent and so on till it kind of becomes obvious that this is just

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.000
[Amit Varma]: optics and Pakistan isn't stopping.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.960
[Guest]: Well, the other thing, of course, and you know, which is what the current sort of crisis

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:56.040
[Guest]: brought about is that the Pakistanis will respond in kind to a significant degree.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest]: They do have the capabilities to do that.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.440
[Guest]: See if you think about the difference between the Pakistani response after Uri and the Pakistani

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.880
[Guest]: response here, the salient difference, it seems to me, is that in that context, Pakistan

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.400
[Guest]: had some kind of what you might think as a face saving solution.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.400
[Guest]: India carried out these strikes quietly, you came and then made an announcement and the

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.480
[Guest]: Pakistanis could just turn around and say, hey, nothing happened.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:27.560
[Guest]: But in this case, when the Pulwama attacks happened, your political leadership made clear

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.040
[Guest]: speeches saying that Pakistan will have to pay the price for this.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.120
[Guest]: So the threat was sent out explicitly.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.240
[Guest]: And after that, when you actually carried through on the threat, it becomes almost impossible

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.880
[Guest]: for Pakistan not to be able to respond in the same way.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:48.560
[Guest]: The second thing is that the use of air power in this context, in some ways, moves beyond

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.440
[Guest]: the tacitly agreed threshold between the two sides.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.000
[Guest]: Once again, to go back to my sort of favorite thinker, Tom Schelling, in this context, Schelling

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.160
[Guest]: has this idea of what he thinks of as thresholds, right.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:05.080
[Guest]: He says thresholds, when you're thinking about limited wars in a nuclear context, both sides

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:12.640
[Guest]: will use force to extents and in ways that are limited to certain clearly identifiable

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.640
[Guest]: thresholds.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.520
[Guest]: Those thresholds could be geographic context, they could be lines on the map, they could

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.360
[Guest]: be use of certain kinds of weapon systems, right.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.880
[Guest]: Now what Schelling says is that even if both sides are not talking to each other and agreeing

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.760
[Guest]: saying that we are only going to fight till the line of control or that we are only going

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.320
[Guest]: to sort of use ground power, we are not going to use air power, there is a tacit understanding

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320
[Guest]: which comes.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.320
[Guest]: That's a tacit bargain.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:40.400
[Guest]: So a threshold is a result of a tacit bargain to restrict the use of force to certain domains.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:46.800
[Guest]: Now, I think it's fair to say that at least in the period from the late 1990s till about,

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:53.240
[Guest]: you know, early this year, the threshold was very much seen as use of force on either side

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.240
[Guest]: of the line of control.

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.120
[Guest]: The Pakistanis could sort of carry out terrorist attacks, you would strike them across the

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.120
[Guest]: line of control.

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.280
[Guest]: Sometimes you would do it to greater or lesser extents.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.960
[Guest]: In the Uri context, we saw a very concerted kind of operation which took place, which

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.280
[Guest]: was called surgical strikes at that point of time.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.880
[Guest]: Now, but still that did not cross the previously laid down threshold.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.960
[Guest]: Whereas with the use of air power, you opened up the threshold.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:21.200
[Guest]: And for the Pakistanis to restore a tacit balance meant that they had to respond to

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.040
[Guest]: you by the use of air power.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.920
[Guest]: You know, it's very interesting, the air chief in a recent press conference said that, you

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.680
[Guest]: know, people are asking us if Indian airstrikes were effective or not.

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.560
[Guest]: If they were not effective, why did the Pakistanis respond by the use of air power?

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.120
[Guest]: With all due respect, I think that's exactly the wrong way to think about the problem.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.120
[Amit Varma]: That depends on how you define effective, right?

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120
[Guest]: I mean,

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.120
[Guest]: No, it's not even about effectiveness.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:47.240
[Guest]: The sheer fact that you breached the threshold meant that for Pakistan to restore deterrence,

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:53.120
[Guest]: they had to demonstrate their ability to do the same thing to you in the same sort of

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.120
[Guest]: plane.

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:58.760
[Guest]: So now, the use of air power has become the new threshold at which India-Pakistan conflicts

00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.760
[Guest]: are going to be limited.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.060
[Guest]: Now, if Pakistan had not done that, then it would have given signal that India can continue

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.720
[Guest]: to keep breaking thresholds.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720
[Guest]: And it's a one sided story.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.640
[Guest]: But as I said, every strategic action is about what the other side does as well.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.960
[Guest]: You know, this inability to sort of understand some of these dynamics, I think, has been

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.840
[Guest]: at the heart of some of the mistakes that we've made, at least in terms of setting popular

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.880
[Guest]: expectations about various things, right?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.040
[Guest]: Now, there is a very influential strand of argument which has been made by many air power

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.000
[Guest]: thinkers in this country, including former air force officers, who've been advocating

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.680
[Guest]: for a long time saying that the use of air power is not escalatory, right?

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.200
[Guest]: That if we choose very clearly defined targets, and we use air power, air power is actually

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.840
[Guest]: a relatively cost free, but highly precise way of delivering these effects.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.240
[Guest]: Fair enough.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.360
[Guest]: But escalation depends on what the other side decides to do.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.960
[Guest]: It is not just about what you want to do.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.600
[Guest]: In fact, you know, Clausewitz has this fantastic image with which the book begins.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:00.480
[Guest]: He says war, think of war as two wrestlers, each of whom is trying to use force to pin

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.600
[Guest]: the other one down.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.600
[Guest]: If one person decides to use a certain amount of force, there is automatically an incentive

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.960
[Guest]: for the other one to use more force, and vice versa.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.000
[Guest]: And this reciprocal interaction is what we call escalation, right?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.600
[Guest]: So this idea that listen, we can use air power, and it's not going to escalate is premised

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.880
[Guest]: on the notion that Pakistan cannot use air power.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.360
[Guest]: And what they have shown to you is that yes, they can.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.240
[Guest]: They are militarily weaker than us, but they do have the capabilities to do this.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.480
[Guest]: So I think it's important to understand some of these dynamics.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:36.360
[Guest]: So the Pakistanis had to respond in the air to show that they could match you.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.880
[Guest]: But also to suggest that listen, if we continue in this vein, there will be further escalation.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.680
[Guest]: So I don't think, Amit, therefore, that it is wise for us to assume that we can continue

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.720
[Guest]: to do these things ad infinitum going forward, because every incentive is aligned for Pakistan

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.040
[Guest]: to suggest that escalation will happen much more quickly, that we cannot take for granted

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.920
[Guest]: that this space is kind of open ended, and that we can continue to do unilateral strikes.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: So what could we do wrong and what could we do right the next time there is a strike?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, forget long term strategy for the moment.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.360
[Amit Varma]: Let's say a month later, there's another strike and the elections are closer.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360
[Amit Varma]: What can we do wrong?

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360
[Amit Varma]: What can we do right?

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.840
[Guest]: Well, for one thing, I would say that if God forbid, there are any further strikes within

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.480
[Guest]: a very short period of time, I honestly do not see how politically it will be possible

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.680
[Guest]: for any government not to at a minimum, do more air strikes, raise the threshold even

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.360
[Guest]: further, or at least do what you've done, maybe introduce, break other kinds of thresholds,

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.800
[Guest]: maybe do missile strikes, maybe carry out some kind of action in the sort of naval domain,

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800
[Guest]: right.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800
[Guest]: And they are forced to respond.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.800
[Unknown]: They will be forced to respond.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.960
[Guest]: So I actually think that and that is again, because of this kind of, you know, fact that

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.760
[Guest]: all strategic actors have to think about their domestic constituencies as well.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.500
[Guest]: I don't see that as somehow a vitiating factor.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.080
[Guest]: That is the nature of the structure of the game.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.400
[Guest]: Those audiences have to be responded to.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.960
[Guest]: And I think now that they, you know, threshold of air power has been breached.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.880
[Guest]: In fact, in some ways, the funny thing is that the onus is going to be on every future

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.480
[Guest]: government if it does not resort to air strikes to somehow make the case saying why you did

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
[Guest]: not do it.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.160
[Guest]: Yeah, because your political opponents and others will constantly come back to you and

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.400
[Guest]: say, Hey, aren't you weaker than those guys who actually used it?

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just therefore it would seem to me that it's not just for each side to

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.960
[Amit Varma]: consider its own domestic imperatives, but also for say Pakistan to consider our imperatives.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.440
[Amit Varma]: So now it would be their interest not to have escalation as well because they want to continue

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.480
[Amit Varma]: bleeding us by a thousand cuts.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.520
[Amit Varma]: And they would know that if they do carry out another terrorist attack before the elections

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.640
[Amit Varma]: is probably going to escalate and you don't know where it will stop.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.280
[Amit Varma]: So it is at this moment in time in their interest as well to put this to a stop for a while.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.720
[Guest]: Well, the Pakistanis have shown that degree of rationality quite a few times in the past

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720
[Guest]: as well.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
[Guest]: Right.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.240
[Guest]: I mean, if you think about what happened in the 2008 crisis, right after the Mumbai attacks,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.720
[Guest]: again, you know, we know, we know from, you know, reporting this time around that some

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.240
[Guest]: of the options that were exercised now were already sort of being developed at that point

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240
[Guest]: of time.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.360
[Guest]: And we were in place before the political leadership.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.440
[Guest]: But at that point of time, the political leadership had other considerations, you know, you were

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.640
[Guest]: coming off the back of a major global financial crisis.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.480
[Guest]: India wanted to be seen as a responsible power.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.480
[Guest]: You wanted to sort of, you know, focus on various other kinds of things.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.180
[Guest]: So you bought a lot of diplomatic pressure to bear on Pakistan.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.960
[Guest]: But then that did make sure that you do not have attacks of a significant scale on urban

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.720
[Guest]: India for at least a while.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720
[Guest]: Right.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.000
[Guest]: So it is not the case that the Pakistanis are totally irrational or that the Tanzims

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.680
[Guest]: are entirely sort of independent actors.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.160
[Guest]: So yes, your actions can, you know, impose a degree of caution.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.900
[Guest]: And it is very much my hope that, you know, at least this set of actions that we've carried

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.080
[Guest]: out buys us some amount of time.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.800
[Amit Varma]: So before we move on to the third option, after the Cold Start Doctrine and after surgical

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.200
[Amit Varma]: airstrikes, before we move on to the third option, just thinking aloud, would it then

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.320
[Amit Varma]: be the case that the two previous crises we've had in the last 20 years, which is basically

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.800
[Amit Varma]: like after Kargil, basically, in the 2001 attacks and Operation Parakram that went on,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.840
[Amit Varma]: what happened was there was this vast military mobilization by India, and we couldn't really

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840
[Amit Varma]: do anything after that.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840
[Amit Varma]: The cost was immense.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, 800 people died, I think, just during the mobilization, somewhere 800 soldiers.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.520
[Guest]: Yeah, that's primarily because you lost people to various accidents, you know, they were

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.360
[Guest]: demining operations and so on.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360
[Guest]: Not in active combat.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and yeah, obviously, because there was no active combat, but the costs were huge

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800
[Amit Varma]: for us.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.760
[Amit Varma]: And Pakistan managed to get us to back down.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.240
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, they were the winners there.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And in 2008, because of the diplomatic pressure that we brought to bear, and, you know, it

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.520
[Amit Varma]: could be said and India standing in the world went up because of the restraint we showed

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.800
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.360
[Amit Varma]: It could be said that India came out slightly on top over there.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360
[Amit Varma]: Would that be a fair assessment?

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:49.400
[Guest]: Well, again, I think, you know, the way we read the 2001 crisis, obviously, you know,

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.280
[Guest]: I think our interpretation changes as time passes, right.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.360
[Guest]: So if you look at the 2001 crisis, one way of judging India's attempt at coercing Pakistan

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.760
[Guest]: is to say that it was a failure.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.640
[Guest]: It failed, because India actually laid down some clear demands.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.880
[Guest]: It gave a list of some 20 terrorists who had to be handed over by Pakistan to India, and

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.480
[Guest]: the Pakistanis never did that.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:17.120
[Guest]: So you can say that, listen, you mobilized the threat of force, but that did not work.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.680
[Guest]: And ultimately, you know, you didn't get so it is a failure.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.040
[Guest]: But I think that would be a mistaken way of thinking about what happened in 2001.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:30.400
[Guest]: What happened in 2001, in a sense, was, you know, to use Vipin Narang's sort of phrase,

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.800
[Guest]: India's action was also catalytic in some ways, because India's action catalyzed a lot

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.800
[Guest]: of diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.040
[Guest]: And Parvez Musharraf was forced not just to ban organizations like the Lashkar and the

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:48.200
[Guest]: Jaish, but to give sort of assurances in public that Pakistani territory would not be used

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.560
[Guest]: for this thing.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:56.040
[Guest]: The end of the crisis in some ways paved way for a resumption of meetings between Musharraf

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.880
[Guest]: and Prime Minister Bajpai.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:03.560
[Guest]: And that is what then led in 2004 to the unilateral declaration of a ceasefire by Pakistan.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:09.800
[Guest]: And let's not forget that in the period between 2004 to 2009, you did have a significant level

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.920
[Guest]: of drop of insurgency infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.280
[Guest]: Because of a combination of factors, Pakistan did not want to be in the doghouse post 9-11.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.160
[Guest]: You know, the threat of war had also sort of catalyzed action.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.760
[Guest]: They understood that it was better to talk to India.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:29.160
[Guest]: There was a serious dialogue going on in the back channels between Manmohan Singh and Musharraf.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.600
[Guest]: All of that created a context for the Pakistanis actually sort of gave it.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.920
[Guest]: Would we have had this context without the 2001 crisis happening?

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.040
[Guest]: I think that counterfactual somehow seems not very persuasive to me.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.900
[Guest]: So I think there were second order effects, which were quite important.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.920
[Guest]: You know, part of the problem for people who study, you know, strategic interactions in

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.080
[Guest]: a social sciences way is that you want to code outcomes as either one or zero.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.960
[Guest]: Either you got what you wanted or you did not.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.480
[Guest]: Whereas I think political actors are always willing to live with considerably higher levels

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.520
[Guest]: of ambiguity of outcomes.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.040
[Guest]: And to say that, listen, if we are in a better situation than what we were earlier, we would

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.000
[Guest]: still think of that as having accomplished something.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.200
[Guest]: Whether the costs were proportionate or not is something we can discuss.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.400
[Guest]: Yeah, it's something that people should debate.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.400
[Guest]: But I think to say that, you know, the 2001 crisis got us nowhere, I think is incorrect.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:22.000
[Guest]: It actually sort of paved the way for a period when Pakistan exercised considerable degree

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
[Guest]: of restraint.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.440
[Guest]: It was not the only reason that happened.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.240
[Guest]: There was an international context.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.360
[Guest]: There was a bilateral context which shifted, which enabled that to happen.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360
[Guest]: But that was important.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in the 2008 crisis.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.480
[Amit Varma]: So speaking of ambiguity of outcomes, that kind of takes us to a third option after cold

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.680
[Amit Varma]: start and surgical air strikes us.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.120
[Amit Varma]: Also, the school of thought that says that we should counter them if we don't already

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.040
[Amit Varma]: to a very small extent, and perhaps we did more than we do now, but we should counter

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.040
[Amit Varma]: them in the subconventional domain where people argued that, okay, if they are fomenting insurgencies

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.880
[Amit Varma]: in Kashmir, we should foment insurgencies in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan and so

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880
[Amit Varma]: on.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.880
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel about that line of thought?

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.320
[Guest]: Well, in the first instance, I think covert operations are very much the part of every

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.760
[Guest]: country's toolkit for countering terrorism.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.200
[Guest]: And I would be very surprised if India is not, you know, using or has not used.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.480
[Guest]: We know for a fact that, you know, some things have happened.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.240
[Guest]: But should we think of covert actions simply as the sort of retaliatory support for various

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.760
[Guest]: kinds of terrorist actions or insurgencies in Pakistan?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.480
[Guest]: I think that would be a very impoverished way of thinking about the range of things

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.680
[Guest]: that constitutes what covert action can do, right?

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:38.680
[Guest]: Covert action can mean non-military, but intelligence-led ways of degrading the capacities of these

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.880
[Guest]: things, of targeting their leadership.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.080
[Guest]: You know, people tend to forget after the 2008 crisis, some of the key actors on the

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.720
[Guest]: Pakistani side on the Lashkar who were sort of, you know, technical handlers, people who

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.040
[Guest]: enabled that operation to be, were captured from all kinds of places.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.960
[Guest]: They were picked up from Spain, they were picked up from Sri Lanka by the government

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960
[Guest]: of India.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.960
[Guest]: Oh, really?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960
[Guest]: Okay.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.000
[Guest]: I'm not revealing any state secrets out here, not that I'm privy to any.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.080
[Guest]: And these are very much examples of what you would think of as, you know, various kinds

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.400
[Guest]: of covert and overt operations.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.720
[Guest]: So I think therefore to, you know, think in somewhat crude ways that, oh, the only way

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.680
[Guest]: to sort of pay them back in the covert coin is by doing a Balochistan for a Kashmir, is

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.220
[Guest]: I think, it just doesn't make any sense.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.040
[Guest]: And there are reputational costs for a country like India of going down the route, which

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.520
[Guest]: I'd imagine Indian decision makers will take on board because, you know, you have to have

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.400
[Guest]: plausible deniability.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.680
[Guest]: Already in Pakistan, there is this clamour saying every terrorist like that is happening

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.920
[Guest]: in Pakistan and somehow being covertly funded and supported by India and so on.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.480
[Guest]: So I think covert operation actually has a very important role to play in countering

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.760
[Guest]: terrorism.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.960
[Guest]: And India is, has sort of used those capabilities and they do present one more way of imposing

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.960
[Guest]: costs on Pakistan.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.240
[Guest]: So if you're thinking about deterrence by punishment, it is not just sort of, you know,

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.720
[Guest]: use of land forces across the line of control or the, you know, cold start kind of doctrines,

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.920
[Guest]: nor is it just the use of sort of, you know, air strikes or missile strikes and so on.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.240
[Guest]: But you also have to think about these kinds of ways of bringing to bear costs directly

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.360
[Guest]: on the, you know, jihadi tanzims and others.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, on the pros side of the issue, if you're looking at pros and cons, I guess a

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.440
[Amit Varma]: couple of the pros would be that one, it acts as some kind of deterrence by punishment.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Two, it can be a bargaining chip on the table that look, if you stop doing covert operations

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.200
[Amit Varma]: here, we'll go easy there, otherwise we'll keep retaliating whenever you do something

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
[Amit Varma]: here.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.480
[Amit Varma]: But on the con side of it, we lose the higher moral ground when it comes to the diplomatic

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.760
[Amit Varma]: stage where we can no longer portray ourselves credibly as victims of terrorism.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.380
[Amit Varma]: If we do that and be it becomes very difficult to sort of dial back from there for either

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.480
[Amit Varma]: side to actually unilaterally, you know, bring their level of support down when the other

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.660
[Amit Varma]: side is still doing it.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.280
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that kind of strikes me is that even if covert action and are doing

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.040
[Amit Varma]: subconventional things was to pay off in the long run, maybe not to the extent of, you

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.000
[Amit Varma]: know, actually fomenting terrorism in Balochistan or whatever, but just sort of strengthening

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.200
[Amit Varma]: internal intelligence and doing disruptive things.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Even if it was to pay off in the long run, there's no advantage for it politically.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.920
[Amit Varma]: A politician would rather be seen doing something.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.880
[Amit Varma]: And in the case of covert actions is covert, he doesn't get any political benefit from

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.420
[Amit Varma]: it, even if it's effective and it takes years to play out and you don't know counterfactuals.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:25.760
[Amit Varma]: So that reduces the incentive slightly for politicians to go for that, right?

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.040
[Guest]: Well, you're absolutely right.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.600
[Guest]: I think the entire range of sort of considerations that you laid out will come into play in the

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.300
[Guest]: way that you think about sort of covert action and so on.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.720
[Guest]: But ultimately, you know, covert actions like any other overt form of use of military force

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.320
[Guest]: for punishment, you know, will have to be judged by the kind of results that it gives

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320
[Guest]: you.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.400
[Guest]: As I said, deterrence by punishment on its own, even including all of these menu of options

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.080
[Guest]: that you have, is unlikely to be able to suffice either to bring down the scale of attacks

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.040
[Guest]: on you, let alone changing the political behavior of the Pakistani state.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.920
[Amit Varma]: But would you view it as a net positive or something we should not do?

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:12.320
[Guest]: Well, I think it is a net positive in that, as I said, there are a range of things that

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.360
[Guest]: you can do with covert action, which are not necessarily the same as sort of supporting

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.860
[Guest]: terrorists who are striking Pakistan.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.840
[Guest]: Because today, if you look at it, I mean, what is the major advantage that India has?

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.960
[Guest]: It is that whether we like it or not, in the year 2019, it is very difficult for any state

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.240
[Guest]: to say that, listen, we are supporting terrorism because these are not terrorists, they are

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240
[Guest]: freedom fighters.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.200
[Guest]: That entire argument, you know, which used to be the sort of standard line brought it

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.800
[Guest]: out in favor of various kinds of national liberation movements, which resorted to violence,

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.840
[Guest]: has been discredited.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.000
[Guest]: In a sense, the argument that we are supporting terrorists because they are fighting for a

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.720
[Guest]: good cause does not have any traction internationally anymore.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:58.440
[Guest]: And I think that is a huge advantage for India to put Pakistan in the dock, rather than assume

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.600
[Guest]: that we should sort of therefore be caught in the same sort of or whatever, even to the

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.400
[Guest]: extent that, you know, because at the end of the day, these are not things which can

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.600
[Guest]: be sort of, you know, shoved under the carpet forever, and even minor slip ups can sort

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600
[Guest]: of cost us.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.800
[Guest]: And again, our own history suggests that there are potential downside costs to doing those

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800
[Guest]: kinds of things.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.520
[Guest]: Think of the support that we gave to the LTT in the early stages of the sort of Sri Lankan

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:30.120
[Guest]: problem, right, in the early 1980s, the LTT was effectively being supported, being trained

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.300
[Guest]: in the R&DW camps is all very well known now.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.680
[Guest]: And ultimately, the LTT proved to be an instrument which was not amenable to your control.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.360
[Guest]: You had to fight them and incur huge amounts of costs and then finally pull out.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Which is a common theme with a lot of covert operations in a sense, even a lot of what

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.240
[Unknown]: the US is doing.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.760
[Guest]: So unless and until you are willing to sort of embed them into your state and security

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.160
[Guest]: structures and architectures in a way that Pakistan has done, it is possibly not that.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.400
[Guest]: But even from Pakistan's point of view, right?

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400
[Guest]: Think about it.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.080
[Guest]: Imagine when Imran Khan comes on television and says that 70,000 Pakistanis have died

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080
[Guest]: due to terrorism.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.840
[Guest]: You know, I don't, I can't vote for that figure.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.680
[Guest]: But it is definitely the case that there have been many terrorist attacks in Pakistan.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.200
[Guest]: But that is the kind of blowback that you would expect if you are harboring such significant

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.600
[Guest]: levels of non-state actors capable of inflicting violence in your own state.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.620
[Guest]: I mean, in a sense, that is inescapable condition of developing those kinds of institutions

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.000
[Guest]: in the first place.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.640
[Guest]: So even for Pakistan, if they were to look at it rationally, the pursuit of terrorism

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.160
[Guest]: really has not given anything.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:41.240
[Guest]: But the reality is that the Pakistani state has defined its own self-image as one which

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.320
[Guest]: is directly counterposed to that of India.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.840
[Guest]: And it is that rivalry and the desire for parity, you know, Farzana Sheikh, the great

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.520
[Guest]: Pakistani historian, you know, puts this very, very neatly, which is say that, you know,

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.560
[Guest]: from the very beginning, from the demand for Pakistan made in the Lahore sort of Congress

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.540
[Guest]: of the Muslim League, Lahore sort of, you know, session of the Muslim League in 1940.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.540
[Guest]: What has been the argument?

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.240
[Guest]: Argument has always been that we have to be equal to India, right?

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.420
[Guest]: That pursuit of parity with India at all costs has come at an enormous sort of this thing.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.640
[Guest]: But it is kind of hardwired into their system.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.960
[Guest]: And frankly, it is for the Pakistani people now to sort of force their state to change,

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.200
[Guest]: to dial back, or for some great external, you know, sort of cataclysm to happen.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.960
[Guest]: But in the context of nuclear weapons, frankly, thinking that, you know, we can use force

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:31.440
[Guest]: in order to bring about that degree of change in the Pakistani state architecture is, I

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.560
[Guest]: think, frankly, it's not on the cards.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.560
[Guest]: Right.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.480
[Amit Varma]: So, the fourth option, you know, is on the table and is constantly being used to differing

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.600
[Amit Varma]: degrees is diplomacy.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.440
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a little bit about how the great nations have traditionally viewed this conflict,

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.040
[Amit Varma]: and especially post the Cold War, you know, what is the US's stake on it?

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.160
[Amit Varma]: What is China's stake on it?

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.880
[Amit Varma]: They have their own imperatives.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.480
[Amit Varma]: They both need Pakistan for different reasons and support Pakistan in different ways.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:05.400
[Amit Varma]: How does that sort of play out and how well has India maneuvered the diplomatic minefield

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400
[Amit Varma]: so to say?

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.240
[Guest]: Well, it's worth pointing out in the first place, that historically, the emergence of

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:20.000
[Guest]: these kinds of armed non-state actors in total cahoots with the Pakistani state was enabled

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.200
[Guest]: precisely by a international context of the latest stages of the Cold War, right?

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:31.600
[Guest]: In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, it is the United States of America,

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.800
[Guest]: along with Saudi Arabia, which bankrolled the sort of, you know, arming of these various

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.760
[Guest]: kinds of Mujahideen groups, many of whom were at that point of time feted as sort of freedom

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.120
[Guest]: fighters, you know, you can even see photographs and videos of them sort of coming to the White

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.960
[Guest]: House lawns and so on during the Reagan administration time.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.140
[Guest]: And let's also not forget that China at that point of time was also actively supporting

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.640
[Guest]: Pakistan in supporting these groups.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.920
[Guest]: In fact, one of the very interesting and less known facts of international history of the

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.240
[Guest]: early 1980s is that that was a period when the Chinese were actually selling a lot of

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.040
[Guest]: weapons to the United States of America.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040
[Guest]: Oh.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.200
[Guest]: They were selling Soviet built weapons, which could then be transferred to the Mujahideen,

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.760
[Guest]: which could then be difficult for the Soviets to say that this is actually Red Army sort

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.360
[Guest]: of equipment, right, which the Chinese held in their stocks.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.200
[Guest]: So you know, the arms trade was actually running the other way around in that period.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.720
[Guest]: So this was a constellation of international forces which enabled the creation of this

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.720
[Guest]: infrastructure.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.920
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think, you know, there is a lot of sort of responsibility or blame

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.640
[Guest]: or whichever way you want to put it to go around.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.160
[Guest]: And you know, it was that context which enabled Pakistan and the ISI, which was not such a

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.400
[Guest]: powerful organization up until that point of time.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.040
[Guest]: But Zia and, you know, the Pakistan army drove a tough bargain.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.640
[Guest]: In fact, at one point of time when the Carter administration announced that they would give

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.680
[Guest]: this much support, Zia refused it.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680
[Guest]: He said, this is peanuts.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.080
[Guest]: You know, imagine a poor country like Pakistan actually telling that to the United States

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.960
[Guest]: because they knew that they could drive a harder bargain, which is exactly what they

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960
[Guest]: did.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.040
[Guest]: And that then continued, right.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.640
[Guest]: And in the sort of 90s, initially, when this was a problem, which was seen as primarily

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.360
[Guest]: a manifestation of the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir, rather than it being seen one

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.200
[Guest]: of sort of terrorism and violence against sort of civilians and so on.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.880
[Guest]: You still were able to try and turn a blind eye or bring in some kind of false equations

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.860
[Guest]: by saying, oh, India is also carrying out human rights violations and so on.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:32.040
[Guest]: It is only from after 9-11 really, that the issue of terrorism has come to be seen in

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.140
[Guest]: the frame in which we today look at it.

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.660
[Guest]: But even then, as you're saying, both the Chinese, the Pakistanis, the Saudis and everyone

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:45.080
[Guest]: else have their own sort of interests in play, and there is very limited reason for India

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.600
[Guest]: to assume that those interests will automatically map on to what we believe or there should

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600
[Guest]: be.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.680
[Guest]: But at the same time, there is every incentive for India to use diplomacy to suggest that

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.460
[Guest]: if Pakistani support for terrorism is not reined in, it will potentially result in significantly

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.600
[Guest]: higher levels of risks of what is going to happen in this part of the world.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.400
[Guest]: And I think that's a very important part to convey to the international community that

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.440
[Guest]: they just cannot absolve themselves of any responsibility.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.360
[Guest]: That you know, if you believe that you want to keep Pakistan warm because you want a certain

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.420
[Guest]: outcome in Afghanistan, you believe you want to keep Pakistan warm because you're building

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:28.520
[Guest]: this extraordinary infrastructure across the sort of, you know, CPEC projects and so on,

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.800
[Guest]: you better also learn to tell the Pakistanis that there will be significant costs for their

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800
[Guest]: continuation of this.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.920
[Guest]: And in that sense, I think the airstrikes have actually given us an opportunity to catalyze

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.380
[Guest]: diplomacy in a much stronger way than even in the past, because in the past we were counting

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.380
[Guest]: on our restraint.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:47.720
[Guest]: Now, we are showing that the bounds of those restraints have been broken.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.680
[Guest]: But in and going forward, unless and until the international community actually takes

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.400
[Guest]: this seriously, these things can go out of hand.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:00.800
[Guest]: At the end of the day, India is seen by the United States, by China as an emerging sort

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.480
[Guest]: of power of a significant kind in the Asian context.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.920
[Guest]: And it is in nobody's interest to allow terrorism from Pakistan to provoke India into carrying

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.520
[Guest]: out attacks, which will then result in significantly higher levels of punishment for Pakistan.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:21.760
[Amit Varma]: So after 9-11, you know, people in Pakistan used to refer to Al-Qaeda as Al-Faida because

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.560
[Amit Varma]: of all the foreign aid that flooded in and obviously the US needed them for the conflict

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.640
[Amit Varma]: in Afghanistan and so on.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And it could still be argued that the US still needs them.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.880
[Amit Varma]: And Pakistan does hold that bargaining chip where beyond a point, they don't have to listen

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
[Amit Varma]: to the US no matter what.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, is that still the case or have things changed substantially?

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Does the US wield more leverage or are they still dependent on Pakistan for the Afghanistan

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.640
[Guest]: situation?

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.640
[Guest]: Well, on the one hand, the US does not wield that kind of leverage, because the United

01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.120
[Guest]: States has steadily sort of, especially over the last 3-4 years, taken a tougher line on

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.880
[Guest]: Pakistan's support for terrorism.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.440
[Guest]: Because let us not forget that the terrorism that affects the United States directly is

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.200
[Guest]: the support that Pakistan gives to various kinds of Taliban groups or to, you know, other

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.240
[Guest]: kinds of organizations which are attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan, right?

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.320
[Guest]: Or making the stability of Afghanistan in which the United States has invested so much

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.040
[Guest]: of time and treasure as basically not being a viable threat.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.760
[Guest]: But that's different from like Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Jaisalmer.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.240
[Guest]: But that is a different kind of a story.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.400
[Guest]: But nevertheless, you have the Haqqani and others who are, so the Pakistanis, the Americans

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.540
[Guest]: have been trying to put the Pakistanis on the mat.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.000
[Guest]: And the Trump administration has taken a reasonably tough line on some of that.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.280
[Guest]: But that has also meant that the relationship between the United States and Pakistan, especially

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.120
[Guest]: under the Trump administration, is kind of frayed, right?

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.560
[Guest]: I mean, it's not where it was earlier.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:53.080
[Guest]: But on the other hand, as Trump and, you know, the United States looks to find some way out

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.640
[Guest]: and there are, there is every indication that they are doing it, you know, they have the

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.600
[Guest]: Special Envoy who's kind of reaching out to the Taliban, various other people.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:05.760
[Guest]: You're looking to sort of create the state for some kind of a dignified exit out of Afghanistan.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.320
[Guest]: The Americans also will need Pakistani cooperation to get to some kind of an end state, right?

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.920
[Guest]: So there is a degree of dependence, but I think their leverage is kind of limited.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:20.280
[Guest]: In the current crisis, the United States actually expressed significant levels of support for

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280
[Guest]: India.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:27.280
[Guest]: The National Security Advisor Bolton even called his Indian counterpart, Mr. Doval,

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.720
[Guest]: and told him that the United States accepts India's right to self-defense in these kinds

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.960
[Guest]: of situations, which is an important sort of expression of support for India.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.000
[Guest]: And on the other hand, they put a lot of pressure on Pakistan not to retaliate or then subsequently

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.080
[Guest]: to release the pilot and so on.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.360
[Guest]: So in a sense, the United States has kind of done what it could in the current context,

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.640
[Guest]: but its leverage on Pakistan is going to be limited and its dependence is going to be

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.640
[Guest]: higher.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.640
[Guest]: So that is one aspect.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:24:00.320
[Guest]: As far as China is concerned, it's undoubtedly emerging as the external player who has the

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.680
[Guest]: going forward, likely the more important clout on Pakistan, the nature of Pakistan's own

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:10.040
[Guest]: economic dependence on China, the relationship between China and Pakistan on military security

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.200
[Guest]: affairs, even on terrorism, right?

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.960
[Guest]: I mean, the kind of sort of, you know, Pakistan, the Chinese sort of, you know, technical hold

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.120
[Guest]: on nominating Masood Azhar or putting him on that list, etc.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.160
[Guest]: All of that has been kind of important, at least in a symbolic sense.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.800
[Guest]: So the Chinese will sort of continue to support Pakistan.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.700
[Guest]: But I think at the same time, the Chinese are very rational actors as well.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:36.200
[Guest]: If China wants to emerge as an important Asian power, if it sees itself playing in the same

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.680
[Guest]: league as the United States of America, then it should learn how to restrain its allies.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.640
[Guest]: If it is not able to do that, if it is not able to deliver on places like China or North

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:52.360
[Guest]: Korea or any other context, then I think its ability to sort of position itself as a responsible,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.840
[Guest]: you know, G2 kind of a player, which in its self-imagination it is, is going to be hollow

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.080
[Amit Varma]: and it's going to sort of prove more difficult.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.860
[Amit Varma]: And would it be fair to say that the growing friendship between China and Pakistan is actually

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:11.800
[Amit Varma]: something we should welcome, because it increases China's incentives, given their economic interests

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.800
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan, to put pressure on Pakistan to clamp down on the terrorism?

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.560
[Guest]: I have a slightly different reading of the China-Pakistan relationship.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.360
[Guest]: You know, the Sino-Pakistani relationship goes, started really flourishing after the

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.920
[Guest]: India-China war of 1962, right?

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.000
[Guest]: It's from about 1963-64, when they signed a boundary accord and other things that the

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.140
[Guest]: relationship really starts flourishing.

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:42.280
[Guest]: But there was an important moment of inflection around the mid-1990s, particularly you can

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.920
[Guest]: think of 1996, when then Chinese President Jiang Zemin actually went to Pakistan.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.000
[Guest]: And there he made a statement saying that, you know, Kashmir is a bilateral dispute between

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.160
[Guest]: India and Pakistan and that they should solve it, which is, funnily enough, India's line,

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.160
[Guest]: right?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.920
[Guest]: It's not the Pakistani line.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:03.240
[Guest]: And thereafter, during Kargil and various other crises, the Chinese were more or less

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.640
[Guest]: somewhat even-handed in their treatment, not to say, obviously, the relationship with Pakistan

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.760
[Guest]: is much stronger, but they did not tilt heavily in the side of Pakistan.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.280
[Guest]: But what we have seen, particularly after about 2008, and I think there the US-India

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.880
[Guest]: nuclear deal was an important trigger, the Chinese have started tilting a lot more towards

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.260
[Guest]: Pakistan politically.

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.560
[Guest]: Their military and security relationship with Pakistan has deepened considerably in ways

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.760
[Guest]: that was not true earlier.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.360
[Guest]: And now their economic relationship with Pakistan because of the Belt and Road Initiative and

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.600
[Guest]: the CPEC corridor is kind of also strengthened, right?

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:42.000
[Guest]: So in a sense, I think one of the major challenges for Indian diplomacy is going to be to convince

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.160
[Guest]: China to adopt a slightly more even-handed position vis-a-vis India when it comes to

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.280
[Guest]: India-Pakistan issues.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.600
[Guest]: I think that's an area where we can work on.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600
[Guest]: I think this is a good moment.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.480
[Guest]: We have demonstrated our willingness to sort of use power if necessary.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.680
[Guest]: And this is also a time when we are apparently having an upswing in our relations with China.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.400
[Guest]: The Prime Minister went to Wuhan last year, met President Xi Jinping.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.080
[Guest]: You know, we are supposedly sort of recalibrating our relationship.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.400
[Guest]: And I think we should definitely make one of the objectives of this recalibration a

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.240
[Guest]: certain degree of restoration of balance by China when it comes to India-Pakistan relations.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.280
[Guest]: I think that is a much more useful way of thinking about it rather than obsessing about

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.520
[Guest]: things like saying, you know, should China have blocked Masood Azhar?

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.920
[Guest]: I mean, frankly, you can put anyone on any UN list that's not going to stop terrorism

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920
[Guest]: against India.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.920
[Guest]: You know, all the rhetoric that happened in India after Pulwama saying, oh, the Chinese

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920
[Guest]: should bear blame for what is happening, etc.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.000
[Guest]: It's just, it's rhetoric, frankly.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.800
[Guest]: That is not the kind of stuff that is going to advance hard national interests.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.040
[Guest]: Those can only be advanced if we take a very hard-headed view of what we want out of our

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.880
[Guest]: relationship with China and what it is the Chinese can give.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.240
[Guest]: And I think this is the moment for us to exercise all those options.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.880
[Amit Varma]: So before we move on to talking about deterrence by denial, let me kind of try to sum up what

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.480
[Amit Varma]: we've spoken about deterrence by punishment so far.

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Tell me if this is accurate, basically because of the deterrence dominance, so to say, of

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan in the sense that they deter us with the nuclear weapons, but you know, they continue

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.280
[Amit Varma]: doing at a subconventional level, whatever they do.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Among the options we have, therefore, explored in the last 20 years include the Cold Star

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Doctrine, which for various reasons, which we discussed doesn't really work.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.640
[Amit Varma]: The surgical airstrikes, which has a limited value in actually changing the Pakistani state's

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.960
[Amit Varma]: behavior or the basic calculus there, and even the political payback in India might

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.160
[Amit Varma]: diminish as they go on.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.800
[Amit Varma]: The third option is, of course, subconventional, which is covert and therefore, you know, even

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.000
[Amit Varma]: if our leaders choose to ramp it up, they'll only see the benefits after a long time and

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.400
[Amit Varma]: we don't really know what's going on there.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:03.280
[Amit Varma]: And the fourth is diplomacy where you've pointed out the various sort of forces at play.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.840
[Amit Varma]: So it seems that as far as deterrence by punishment is concerned, yes, we've kind of raised the

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:14.280
[Amit Varma]: threshold with the recent airstrikes, but there is still a limit to what it can achieve.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.360
[Amit Varma]: And your case would be that we can actually achieve much more through deterrence by denial.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.200
[Guest]: Well, that's not just my case.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.560
[Guest]: But I think a lot of the actual research on terrorism in various contexts actually shows

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:32.800
[Guest]: that terrorism is much better tackled by methods of denial rather than by methods of punishment.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.520
[Guest]: In fact, methods of punishment pretty much haven't worked anywhere, right?

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.560
[Guest]: In most contexts, in a sense that say, even if you take the one case with which a lot

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.800
[Guest]: of people in India obsess, right, how the Israelis deal with it, you know, the Israelis

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.440
[Guest]: never claim that, you know, punishment strikes are ever going to stop the problem.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.440
[Guest]: It hasn't stopped.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.280
[Guest]: If you look at it objectively, the problem hasn't gone away for them.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.520
[Guest]: What it has helped them to do is to sort of keep it under control.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:01.200
[Guest]: But the Israeli context is totally incomparable to the Indian one, because Israel has conventional

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.080
[Guest]: capacities of a kind, it has a core nuclear capability, it has intelligence, you know,

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.360
[Guest]: apparatus of a kind, which far outstrips that of any of its other neighbors.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Much easier to defend.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.360
[Guest]: They have the wall.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.360
[Guest]: Smaller territory.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.360
[Guest]: Smaller territory.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.800
[Guest]: So, you know, in a sense, it's that that is frankly, to my mind, a meaningless comparison

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
[Guest]: when it comes to India.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.200
[Guest]: I mean, it only gives us some sense that, oh, they have a certain kind of machismo that

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.760
[Guest]: we don't, which I think is completely the wrong way of thinking about these problems.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.560
[Guest]: But denial based strategies are the best ones.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.160
[Guest]: I mean, if you think of most other contexts, in fact, you will automatically come to the

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.600
[Guest]: conclusion that denial based strategies are the best way, right?

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.820
[Guest]: Because see, punishment based strategies assume that you can target the particular entity

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:45.800
[Guest]: which is carrying out the undesirable action and impose punishment on it.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800
[Guest]: Right.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.360
[Guest]: But for most terrorist organizations, there is no return postcode in a way that there

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.060
[Guest]: is with conventional states.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:55.720
[Guest]: In this case, because of the embeddedness of these groups with the Pakistani state,

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720
[Guest]: you can think about that.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.720
[Guest]: Right.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.780
[Guest]: So, punishment based options, in most cases, will only degrade capacity to a certain extent.

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:03.800
[Guest]: You have to look at denial based options.

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:10.560
[Guest]: You have to look at ways of making it much, much more difficult and costly for any terrorist

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.680
[Guest]: organization to be able to carry out any significant attack of scale against you.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.160
[Guest]: And the idea is that over a period of time, that diminishes incentives for them to think

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.600
[Guest]: about targeting India in quite that way.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.160
[Guest]: I think that is the more important way of thinking about what exactly a strategy of

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160
[Guest]: terrorism is.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.060
[Guest]: And that is also a strategy which uses force.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.280
[Guest]: That is not a strategy which is not using force.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.360
[Guest]: But you use force in different ways.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So elaborate on that a bit.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.320
[Amit Varma]: What are the kind of different ways to deter by denying?

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.320
[Guest]: Well, deterrence by denial, again, you have an entire set of things starting from intelligence,

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.480
[Guest]: your ability to sort of, you know, understand that attacks are happening, which are the

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.520
[Guest]: groups that are likely to carry out, neutralize them, prevent them, thwart various kinds of

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520
[Amit Varma]: plans.

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.600
[Amit Varma]: So the drama actually reflects a failure of the state in terms of intelligence and state

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.160
[Guest]: capacity and so on, isn't it?

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.960
[Guest]: So the one thing I will say is that, you know, obviously, simply because of the nature of

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:10.720
[Guest]: the game, successes of deterrence by denial are unlikely to go sort of recognized, right?

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.400
[Guest]: When someone does not do something, you don't know whether he's done it.

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.120
[Guest]: You don't celebrate what did not happen.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.120
[Guest]: So it's very much that kind of a problem.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:24.440
[Guest]: And conversely, to suggest that every terrorist strike in some ways is a failure of denial

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.880
[Guest]: or the failure of intelligence would also be incorrect.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.040
[Guest]: Because you have to know, you know, what percentile, what percentage of the overall number of attacks

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:36.240
[Guest]: does this constitute, for which frankly, we sitting out do not have.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.640
[Guest]: But the reason I should take Pulwama seriously is simply because of the scale of what was

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.240
[Guest]: accomplished there, right?

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:47.680
[Guest]: It was in the first instance, the first major suicide bombing that we've seen in Kashmir.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:52.400
[Guest]: It required a truck to be filled with what some 150 kilograms of explosive, early reports

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.000
[Guest]: at 300, I think now we're talking about 150.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.360
[Guest]: I mean, I may still be wrong, but I think we're talking about numbers like that of RDX.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.600
[Guest]: You're talking about such a vehicle being prepared, an attack like this being carried

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.880
[Guest]: out in the National Highway.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:09.460
[Guest]: You know, the amount of effort that the Indian Army puts into securing the National Highway

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:14.000
[Guest]: between Jammu and Srinagar every single day of the year is phenomenal.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.560
[Guest]: You know, it's incredible the kind of effort that goes into securing the National Highway.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.320
[Guest]: And if despite that, an attack of this magnitude and this type, a very different kind of an

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.440
[Guest]: attack has happened against security forces, then I think it does tell us about certain

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:37.240
[Guest]: salient weaknesses in our sort of denial based apparatus in deterring terrorism.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.720
[Guest]: And in that context, I think, you know, Pulwama needs to be looked into.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.720
[Guest]: I understand, you know, we are in an election season, the government will not want to concede

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.400
[Guest]: mistakes and so on.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.080
[Guest]: But unless we are willing to learn from our mistakes, believe me, I mean, you know, we

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.760
[Guest]: are not going to be able to strengthen this apparatus, you know, deterrence by denial

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.960
[Guest]: only is an incrementally improving game.

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.960
[Guest]: You know, again, think of it in the context of Kargil, you know, just when, you know,

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.960
[Guest]: the war happened, you know, we had the Kargil Review Committee, which looked into it, they

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.000
[Guest]: even published their report with some redactations and so on.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.800
[Guest]: So I think at a minimum, the government should undertake a serious internal investigation

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.440
[Guest]: and draw the right lessons instead of getting into this bravado that we sorted everything

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.640
[Guest]: out by carrying out airstrikes, sorry, airstrikes as punishment, that still does not take away

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.520
[Guest]: the problem of a failure of deterrence by denial in this first case.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And when we talk of deterrence by denial, would you, would it be fair to say that part

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:35.080
[Amit Varma]: of that denial is denying those kind of bad actors a fertile ground which to exploit?

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:40.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you pointed out that, you know, between 2000 and 2010, you know, the Kashmir situation

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.960
[Amit Varma]: was much better.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Now it's much worse.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that what we have done in the last few years is that we've let the

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:55.760
[Amit Varma]: Kashmir situation go completely out of whack, partly because, you know, when you think about

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:59.920
[Amit Varma]: the good ways to fight an insurgency, David Galula's classic book or the learnings of

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:06.120
[Amit Varma]: people like Petraeus and so on after the Iraq disaster, you know, one of the standard learnings

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:11.760
[Amit Varma]: of counter-inturgency always is that you bring the local population to your side.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And in Kashmir, we've, it's just been the other way around, like a very striking image

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.960
[Amit Varma]: that strikes me was that, you know, last week after there was this video that was floating

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:26.360
[Amit Varma]: around on Twitter of the Pakistani army taking the captured Abhinandan to their army base

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.720
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, and people throwing flowers at the army.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.480
[Amit Varma]: And there was someone who made a snarky tweet about, you know, on this side of the Kashmir

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.320
[Amit Varma]: border, they throw flowers at the army, on the other side, they throw stones.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.800
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to me to be very telling that if we cannot have the local population on

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.040
[Amit Varma]: our side, our tasks become that much harder.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And part of the exercise of denial that we must do, if it's a deterrence of denial, is

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.520
[Amit Varma]: bring the local population to our side, let's win the peace before we can fight the war.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.960
[Guest]: So let me first say that, you know, I don't quite accept that equivalence, which that

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.440
[Guest]: tweet is meant to establish.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:03.440
[Amit Varma]: Sure, it's glib.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:09.280
[Guest]: It's very glib in as much as, you know, patriotic sentiment in favor of the army is, I mean,

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.800
[Guest]: equivalent spades in our country as well.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800
[Guest]: I mean, you only need to…

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.960
[Guest]: But not so much in Kashmir.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.960
[Guest]: Not in Kashmir.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.960
[Unknown]: Right.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.960
[Guest]: And that's also, that's why I'm saying the equivalence does not hold.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.480
[Guest]: But I think the point which you're making is an important one, which is to say that

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:25.960
[Guest]: to the extent that there is ferment in Kashmir, there is unrest, there are young people or

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.360
[Guest]: older people who are willing to sort of lose their lives rather than continue with the

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.960
[Guest]: status quo.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.640
[Guest]: It does create a fertile territory for the insurgency.

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.480
[Guest]: Let's remember that the Kashmir insurgency is a historical phenomenon.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.160
[Guest]: It's not existed since the Kashmir problem existed.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.080
[Guest]: It is primarily in its large scale manifestation only existed from the late 1980s.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.460
[Guest]: We know that very well.

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:50.800
[Guest]: We know that that allowed the Pakistanis to then take control of the insurgency, marginalize

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:57.320
[Guest]: the more sort of, you know, local Kashmiri groups from Kashmir, and then push in their

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.040
[Guest]: own sort of groups like Lashkar and, you know, others, which have then changed the character

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.500
[Guest]: of the insurgency.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:07.880
[Guest]: And today, it is very clear that if a group like Jayesh is able to sort of carry out an

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.400
[Guest]: attack like this, and is able to sort of, you know, actually have a suicide bomber who's

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.260
[Guest]: from Kashmir, you know, that that clearly suggests that, you know, we are losing the

01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:19.720
[Guest]: plot in terms of the alienation of the people.

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.400
[Guest]: And I think there is hardly any way in which anyone can deny that that is a story that

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.480
[Guest]: has gone out of control over the last couple of years, particularly.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:34.560
[Guest]: And I think unless and until we take steps to sort of restore a degree of sort of political

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.640
[Guest]: normality, and I'm choosing my words carefully, political normality, right, not a settlement

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.280
[Guest]: or something, because all of those are very long term things.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.400
[Guest]: I'm saying that, you know, we have to bring politics back.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.600
[Guest]: Currently, there is no elected government there.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.160
[Guest]: The last elected government was, at least for the people of Kashmir, something of a

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.200
[Guest]: disaster, because, you know, it kind of was a coalition which represented very disparate

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200
[Guest]: interests.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.400
[Guest]: On the one hand, you had the BJP, which is calling for abolition of Article 370.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:05.560
[Guest]: On the other hand, you had, you know, Mahbuba Mufti, who's supposedly, you know, at least

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.160
[Guest]: branded by some sections of the Indian, this thing as a soft separatist, right.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.240
[Guest]: So in a sense, someone wants autonomy for Kashmir.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:16.000
[Guest]: So how that sort of a coalition of opposites could have worked out is something that we've

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
[Guest]: now seen, right.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's led to more further alienation.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:24.040
[Guest]: And I think the first step towards stemming that alienation is to create conditions for

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.760
[Guest]: politics to presume, for elections to be held, for people to believe that at a minimum, they

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.360
[Guest]: have an opportunity to take control of their destinies.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:36.760
[Guest]: And even for the Indian security forces and others to sort of recalibrate the way that

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.320
[Guest]: they're thinking about the operations, was not just about sort of terrorist strikes,

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.320
[Guest]: right.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.760
[Guest]: I mean, you think about people coming on to sites where, you know, military encounters

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.720
[Guest]: are happening, pelting stones at the armed forces or preventing, you know, making human

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.200
[Guest]: shields and so on.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.640
[Guest]: All of which suggests a degree of desperation, which cannot be good news for India at all.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So coming back to the current crisis, you know, this is where we are, there was a terrorist

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.480
[Amit Varma]: attack, and we've raised the threshold, we've done these airstrikes, at least domestically,

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.480
[Amit Varma]: we've shown that we are strong, we can do anything, and we've sent that message out

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.260
[Amit Varma]: that we are willing to escalate and they have responded in kind.

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:17.600
[Amit Varma]: What are the lessons that we can learn from this whole episode, assuming it's over?

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.040
[Guest]: I'm speaking of it as if it's in the past tense.

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:24.720
[Guest]: So in the first place, I think, you know, instead of me offering any lessons for anyone,

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.000
[Guest]: because we're all living through this, and I think everyone's opinion is quite as good.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.560
[Guest]: I think it may be more useful to ask ourselves what lessons might decision makers on the

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.240
[Guest]: Indian and the Pakistani side actually draw from this.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.240
[Guest]: That's pretty much what I mean.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.720
[Guest]: Because what I think is important about a crisis like this is that it is not an isolated

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.720
[Guest]: moment, right?

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.400
[Guest]: I mean, I'm sure future students of nuclear strategy, etc. will study this as an independent

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.560
[Guest]: case study of some kind.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:56.200
[Guest]: But as a historian, I always find that it's important to remember that these are instances

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.800
[Guest]: in time.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:04.860
[Guest]: The outcomes and learnings that people take away from one crisis sets the background conditions

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.960
[Guest]: for the next.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.800
[Guest]: So you know, if we are going to sort of stumble into another crisis at some point, and my

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:18.240
[Guest]: own judgment is that the problem of terrorism is not going to go away in a hurry, then it

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.920
[Guest]: is important to understand what is it that both sides are likely to take away.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.440
[Guest]: Now at this point of time, just going purely by the sort of statements that have been given,

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.220
[Guest]: for instance, the Prime Minister is on record as having stated that this was simply a pilot

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.080
[Guest]: project and that, you know, we are going to sort of scale it up going forward.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.520
[Guest]: Now, that may well be for the consumption of a domestic audience.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:44.280
[Guest]: But at the same time, it was a similar sort of expectation from Uri 2016 that led to the

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.200
[Guest]: use of air power in this first place.

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.960
[Guest]: Because last time you concluded that listen, we can do this and the Pakistanis didn't really

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.840
[Guest]: sort of have the gumption to respond.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.080
[Guest]: So this time you raise the stakes, right?

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.320
[Guest]: And now if you're really you assumption is that what the crisis shows is that we can

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.040
[Guest]: continue to do these things.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.640
[Guest]: And that the most important thing is that we've sort of breached the threshold and shown

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:09.580
[Guest]: our ability to do this, then I think you are setting yourself up for more significant crises

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.840
[Guest]: in the event of a major attack in the future.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:18.120
[Guest]: Because then the background expectations both strategically and politically will be that

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.680
[Guest]: the best course is to respond and hit back even more strongly if necessary.

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And this is then the minimum you can do, you can only go beyond it.

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640
[Guest]: Precisely, right?

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:31.120
[Guest]: Which is why, you know, the airstrikes seemed to be the natural sort of response because,

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.400
[Guest]: you know, when it came to Uri, you carried out an action, then you sort of, you know,

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.640
[Guest]: went to town in terms of publicizing it, there was a movie which was made, you know, so much

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.600
[Guest]: of expectation had been set.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.200
[Guest]: So the next time something is done, you needed to do something which was dramatically at

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.440
[Guest]: least commensurate to what had been done.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.840
[Guest]: And of course, this was a more serious attack, right?

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.400
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think the lessons that we draw from this draw a certain baseline

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.000
[Guest]: of expectation.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.240
[Guest]: On the contrary, if we draw the lesson that listen, yes, we've used airstrikes, we've

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.920
[Guest]: shown Pakistan that even terrorist camps deep inside their territory are not immune to punishment

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.800
[Guest]: from the Indian side.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.960
[Guest]: But the Pakistanis have also sort of responded in certain ways.

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.520
[Guest]: So now the important thing for us is to say that, listen, how do we use the demonstration

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.720
[Guest]: of our ability to use force and willingness to use force in order to catalyze a series

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.480
[Guest]: of other kinds of things, whether on the diplomatic front, whether on the covert front and so

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480
[Guest]: on.

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.080
[Guest]: Then I think we may be thinking in a more sort of constructive way about what we can

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.080
[Guest]: get away from this.

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.280
[Guest]: Now, if you are Pakistan, what is the kind of lesson that you're going to learn?

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.960
[Guest]: I think the lesson that they are learning in some ways is not exactly symmetrical to

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.600
[Guest]: the lesson that you're learning, because for instance, you believe that, oh, when the Pakistanis

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:44.480
[Guest]: attempted to respond, we actually struck down an F-16.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:48.720
[Guest]: Now if an F-15 was really struck down, then the Pakistanis should draw the right lessons.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.120
[Guest]: But looking at everything that they have been saying, which is the only way to judge things

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:55.840
[Guest]: at this point, it very much seems that they are cock-a-whoop.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.120
[Guest]: They believe that, you know, India struck and they struck back and showed the Indians

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.960
[Guest]: that they could go toe to toe when it comes to these kinds of things.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.200
[Guest]: And that they have actually now made it absolutely clear that if India wants to escalate, the

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.560
[Guest]: Pakistanis will escalate more.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.360
[Guest]: And I think there's something to be said about that.

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:18.300
[Guest]: And again, because, you know, discussions of these issues tend to sort of get entangled

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:22.200
[Guest]: so much in our sort of national passions, you know, where you say that, listen, we got

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.400
[Guest]: the better of them.

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.700
[Guest]: But just pause for a second.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:28.280
[Guest]: Think about how the Pakistanis responded.

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.280
[Guest]: They respond, you know, we carried out an airstrike after giving a warning some 12 days

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.000
[Guest]: after the event happened.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.060
[Guest]: They warned and carried out the airstrike less than 24 hours later.

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.840
[Guest]: They carried out their airstrikes in broad daylight.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.560
[Guest]: You carried out airstrikes at 3.30am.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:49.600
[Guest]: That shows a willingness to take risks or at least to demonstrate a willingness to take

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.180
[Guest]: risks, which is significantly higher.

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.200
[Guest]: And that is the message that they wanted to convey to you.

01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:00.080
[Guest]: And whether we accept the message or not, they believe that that has paid off.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.460
[Guest]: So in a sense, they have shown that they may be weaker, but they have greater propensity

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:05.080
[Guest]: for risk taking.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.400
[Guest]: And if that is the lesson the Pakistanis are going to take, then if India believes that

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.200
[Guest]: the response to the next major attack has to be an even stronger response, then the

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.600
[Guest]: Pakistanis will run even greater risks.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.820
[Guest]: And that means that we are then going to be setting ourselves up for more deeper crisis

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.960
[Guest]: going forward.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.360
[Guest]: So I think the right lessons for the Pakistanis to draw, just like the Indians, would be that,

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.840
[Guest]: listen, on this occasion, we actually got lucky.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.900
[Guest]: We got lucky because that Indian pilot was down.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:36.040
[Guest]: And that gave us a relatively cost-free option to sort of de-escalate the crisis.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.640
[Guest]: Next time around, you may not have a pilot to exercise those options.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it seems to me that we almost had a perfect storm of events in the sense that

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.740
[Amit Varma]: both sides got a face-saving way out that they could say that they could take the high

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:52.040
[Amit Varma]: moral ground and they could once say that we responded airstrike to airstrike, and then

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.760
[Amit Varma]: they could take the high moral ground and say, we returned your pilot.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And we could, on the other hand, claim that, look, we are so strong, they returned our

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.520
[Amit Varma]: pilot and hey, we did the airstrike.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.440
[Amit Varma]: So both sides come out looking good.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.640
[Amit Varma]: But as a historian, I don't know if you like counterfactuals, but how's this?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, there was a video where the pilot was almost, was basically being lynched.

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And then the Pakistani army came and saved him.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:19.280
[Amit Varma]: Now assume that a pilot falls and the Pakistani army doesn't get there in time and he's actually

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.280
[Amit Varma]: lynched to death.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.280
[Amit Varma]: And that video comes out in India.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.280
[Amit Varma]: What happens?

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Because then your prime minister has no option politically, but to escalate further in a

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.960
[Amit Varma]: much harsher way.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And then Pakistan also has to respond to that.

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.560
[Guest]: Can that spiral out of control?

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560
[Guest]: That would have been a major provocation.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:40.560
[Guest]: In fact, I think in even slightly more plausible sort of counterfactual, which is that let's

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.160
[Guest]: assume the pilot had died by bailing out.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:47.640
[Guest]: If an Indian pilot had been killed in action, in this action, instead of the event actually

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.520
[Guest]: fortuitously for us playing out that way, I think that could have still created much

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.680
[Guest]: stronger sort of pressures on India to respond at least in kind.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Well, the same day there was some kind of helicopter crash and six people died.

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200
[Amit Varma]: Unrelated.

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.200
[Guest]: Unrelated.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:03.200
[Guest]: Even the Pakistanis admitted that it was unrelated.

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.880
[Guest]: Given that the Pakistanis were claiming credit for just about everything that was happening

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.680
[Guest]: in those 24 hours, I think it was significant that that was a totally unrelated issue.

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.880
[Amit Varma]: So it could have spiraled even if the pilot just died in action.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.120
[Guest]: I think it would have created a lot more pressures to at least respond, bring down some Pakistani

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.240
[Guest]: plane, you know, do something which would have then shown that, listen, we are not going

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.080
[Guest]: to sort of allow this to pass.

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.080
[Guest]: Right?

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:29.320
[Guest]: Because I mean, again, you know, there is an article written just yesterday by one of

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.960
[Guest]: our sort of, you know, most sober and finest sort of military thinkers, General H.S.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.640
[Guest]: Panag, where he says that, you know, the event was a draw, but as a stronger power for India

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.760
[Guest]: to settle with a draw is not such a good thing.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:46.920
[Guest]: Now, you know, I respect General Panag enormously, but I think that kind of lessons, if they

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.880
[Guest]: are drawn, then will set us up for continuing sort of use of force, which may not have been

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:53.600
[Guest]: the best way to respond to this crisis.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:47:00.160
[Guest]: I think India and Pakistan did the right thing by trying to sort of pull out at a time when

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.520
[Guest]: they could both declare victory and exit.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.920
[Guest]: But I think it would be very wrong if both sides believe that future crises will give

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.920
[Amit Varma]: those kinds of options.

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And to go back to what I glibly said in my introduction to this episode, maybe it was

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.040
[Amit Varma]: a draw, but it was a negative sum draw, where both sides lost a little bit in the sense

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.200
[Amit Varma]: that there is greater likelihood of costly escalation whenever the next event happens.

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.760
[Amit Varma]: So when the, you know, just going forward, like looking at, say, a five-year, even a

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.640
[Amit Varma]: five-year period, what is the worst case scenario and what is the best case scenario in terms

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:36.640
[Amit Varma]: of this India-Pakistan conflict with reference to the cross-border terrorism that they promote?

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.360
[Guest]: So the best case scenario is that the Pakistanis recalibrate.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.160
[Guest]: They agree that, you know, it is kind of not very wise for them to be able to carry on

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.900
[Guest]: this kind of overt support of terrorism.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:55.080
[Guest]: They think about how to sort of, you know, recalibrate their relationship with the Tanzims

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.840
[Guest]: themselves.

01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.600
[Guest]: In the best case scenario, I would imagine that India manages to restore a degree of

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:06.720
[Guest]: political normality in Jammu and Kashmir that allows us to deal with the disaffection of

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.500
[Guest]: some parts of the population in a political way rather than sort of using militarily.

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.720
[Guest]: And that, you know, that kind of creates an equilibrium, which is kind of more livable

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.760
[Guest]: for all concerned.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.920
[Guest]: The worst case scenario could be, you know, another major terrorist attack, then leading

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.720
[Guest]: us to another kind of crisis.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:29.920
[Guest]: But I think the bottom line point, which I would suggest, at least for me, is worth sort

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.520
[Guest]: of remembering as we come out of this crisis and are looking forward, you know, with some

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.160
[Guest]: degree of pessimism about the future, is to say that, listen, terrorism is an important

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160
[Guest]: problem.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:46.800
[Guest]: But it is not a problem that is amenable to being solved, quote unquote, in any straightforward

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.680
[Guest]: sense of the word.

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.280
[Guest]: Because it is a problem that, as far as India is concerned, is entrenched in the state structures

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.920
[Guest]: of another state.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:01.400
[Guest]: And there are only that many levers that either India or anyone else has to bring about a

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.120
[Guest]: complete transformation of that story.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.880
[Guest]: So the important thing, therefore, for us is either to be able to endure the problem

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.280
[Guest]: or to be able to manage it to a lesser or a greater extent.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:17.400
[Guest]: And I think the best thing we can hope for is that we manage it better going forward

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:21.120
[Guest]: by using this entire range of things that we've discussed today, ways of punishment,

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.080
[Guest]: ways of denial, diplomacy, all other kinds of things.

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:30.800
[Guest]: At the same time, I think it's also useful to bear in perspective that terrorism is not,

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.040
[Guest]: you know, the most significant challenge for India's national security in the medium-term

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.360
[Guest]: horizon.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.320
[Guest]: You know, if you were to ask yourself the same question about, you know, in the mid-2000s,

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.000
[Guest]: what is the most significant national security challenge?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
[Guest]: I think at that point of time, the consensus was that it's left-wing extremism.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.200
[Guest]: It's the Naxalite violence, which had reared its head at that point of time.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.920
[Guest]: And that was a time when the insurgency in JNK was kind of on a downswing, right?

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.320
[Guest]: So these kinds of things do happen.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.040
[Guest]: But our challenge is to sort of prepare ourselves strategically for other kinds of competitions,

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.040
[Guest]: right?

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.760
[Guest]: Asia is seeing a resurgence of great power competition.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.520
[Guest]: There is the spectacular rise of China, you know, there are new kinds of things coming

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.520
[Guest]: into place.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.080
[Guest]: There are new technologies.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:16.920
[Guest]: In that context, I mean, assuming that terrorism somehow is the most important challenge for

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.200
[Guest]: our security establishment and allowing ourselves to be sucked into that direction, I think

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.760
[Guest]: will counter something of a strategic distraction when we look back at this episode.

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Very wise words.

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Final question before we sign off from the episode.

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:37.760
[Amit Varma]: If my listeners want to learn more about both this particular conflict and about strategy

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.880
[Amit Varma]: in general or game theory and so on, what are the resources or books that you'd recommend

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880
[Amit Varma]: they check out?

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.040
[Guest]: Well, I mean, you know, there are many important things which have been sort of written on

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.720
[Guest]: terrorism per se, right, in a sense of various kinds of books and so on.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:02.360
[Guest]: But I think the one kind of important resource that I would suggest is actually a movie called

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.560
[Guest]: The Battle of Algiers, which is an iconic movie on terrorism and gives you a sense of

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.400
[Guest]: how terrorist organizations think and function and what kinds of constraints that they come

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.400
[Guest]: about.

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.200
[Guest]: It is actually set in Algeria and it's in the context of this sort of FLN, you know,

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.760
[Guest]: sort of insurgency and terrorism against the French sort of occupation of Algeria.

01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.760
[Guest]: It's a fantastic movie.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.680
[Guest]: It's actually one of the most, you know, scarily realistic movies that you can read about,

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.680
[Guest]: watch about terrorism.

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:34.920
[Guest]: So, I'd say that, yeah, that's a good place to start with.

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.720
[Guest]: My own favorite book on terrorism is actually a book called Images of Terror by an American

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.160
[Guest]: historian called Philip Jenkins.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:49.720
[Guest]: Because what Jenkins tells you is that terrorism, like many other social phenomena, is actually

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.720
[Guest]: a socially constructed problem in a sense that what we make of terrorism depends on

01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.480
[Guest]: the common understandings and acceptances that we have.

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.440
[Guest]: So for instance, you know, why are certain kinds of activities not thought of as terrorist

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.440
[Guest]: activities?

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:10.280
[Guest]: You know, bombings of abortion clinic in the American South never get counted as terrorism

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.280
[Guest]: by the FBI.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.720
[Guest]: Why is that the case?

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.200
[Guest]: I think Jenkins's book is phenomenal because it raises precisely those kinds of deeper

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.160
[Guest]: questions which go beyond thinking about it.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.160
[Guest]: If you're thinking for a good place to start on strategy, I would say Lawrence Friedman's

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.200
[Guest]: sort of big tomb, Strategy of History.

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.280
[Guest]: I know it's a very big book, but you can dip into it.

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:31.760
[Guest]: It's wonderfully readable.

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:39.480
[Guest]: And by one of the most sort of smartest, sensible and most sort of sane, wise observers of strategic

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:43.320
[Guest]: behavior in the 20th century, I'd say that's a great place to start thinking about these

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320
[Guest]: things.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.680
