00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
[Unknown]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.640
[Amit Varma]: I had an interesting dream the other night.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.400
[Amit Varma]: At least it started off well.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.280
[Amit Varma]: I died and went to heaven.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.240
[Amit Varma]: That's a good start because I could have died and found myself in a traffic jam on the Western Express Highway on a Friday evening,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.600
[Amit Varma]: which I suppose is one idea of hell.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, so I died and went to heaven and I didn't even need an Aadhaar card to get in.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: They took one look at me and said,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Come on in, Mr. Verma.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.800
[Amit Varma]: You've been a good man.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.640
[Amit Varma]: You fought the good fight against the evil tentacles of the devil's spawn, also known as government.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to heaven.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.480
[Amit Varma]: I walked in and it was beautiful.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.720
[Amit Varma]: The air smelt of jasmine, a flower particularly close to my heart.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And the grass was green, the air was fresh.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.640
[Amit Varma]: And all around me were picnic baskets with seafood platters in them.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.240
[Amit Varma]: Oh, the prawns.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.640
[Amit Varma]: I ate six prawns from one of those platters, though I should have stopped at two.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And then I noticed that all the buildings around me look the same.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, they were all cinema halls.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.520
[Amit Varma]: I went to the nearest such amphitheater, where the attendant told me that people in heaven did nothing but watch movies all the time and eat seafood platters.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.360
[Amit Varma]: This really is heaven, I thought to myself.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.360
[Amit Varma]: I walked up to the movie schedule.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840
[Amit Varma]: All my favorite filmmakers were listed.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.160
[Amit Varma]: There was Kieslowski, there was Fellini, there was Scorsese, there was Shatrujit Rai.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.240
[Amit Varma]: But then I noticed one problem.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: All these films were dubbed in Kannada.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't know Kannada.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Maybe this was a Kannada amphitheater.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.600
[Amit Varma]: I asked the attendant about this, who told me that every single theater in heaven showed only Kannada films.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.800
[Amit Varma]: All non-Kannada films had to be dubbed into Kannada before they were allowed to release.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.800
[Amit Varma]: But why? I asked.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Why this rule? Why only Kannada?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.760
[Amit Varma]: At this moment, I realized that the attendant looked just like my friend, Bhawan Srinath.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he was my friend, Bhawan Srinath.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.440
[Amit Varma]: Bhawan looked at me, grinned widely and said,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: This is payback!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.840
[Amit Varma]: where I begin by trying to entertain you, but in the end, hope to enlighten you.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.920
[Amit Varma]: My guest today, as you no doubt know by now, is Bhawan Srinath, my colleague at the magazine Pragati

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.680
[Amit Varma]: and a fellow at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the show, Bhawan.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for having me.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Bhawan, have you seen Lord of the Rings in Kannada?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
[Guest]: Unfortunately, no. Only in English.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.320
[Guest]: Why?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.960
[Guest]: Because it cannot be seen in Kannada.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.560
[Guest]: You can see it in Tamil, perhaps, or in Hindi, but not in Kannada.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.360
[Amit Varma]: Explain this to me. That seems like a shocking loss for Kannada speakers. Why not?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.440
[Guest]: So, Karnataka and the Kannada film industry have this weird history of having banned

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.880
[Guest]: dubbing of any movies or even TV content into the language from anywhere else.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.120
[Guest]: This is so bizarre. Why?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.480
[Guest]: So, this is obviously unconstitutional and illegal.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.440
[Guest]: But what happened was, the state, by the way, was born out of a new political movement in independent India, right?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.880
[Guest]: Around 1956.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.200
[Guest]: And around that time, the Kannada film industry was also trying to find its feet.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.960
[Guest]: People who are thought of as stalwarts today, you know, people like Rajkumar in Karnataka,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.760
[Guest]: they were up and coming back then, and the South Indian film industry was dominated

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.200
[Guest]: and run out of Chennai.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.040
[Guest]: So, movies were coming into Bangalore and Mysore and other regions of Karnataka,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.440
[Guest]: but they were all dubbed from Tamil into Kannada.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.040
[Guest]: So, this started as a little protectionist movement to say that,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.200
[Guest]: hey, no dubbing allowed into Kannada.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400
[Guest]: We will just have our own movies for our own public.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.720
[Guest]: And what started from that sort of a protectionist move just became the norm for close to 50 audience.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.840
[Amit Varma]: Wow. So, I'm guessing the impetus behind the move would have been people in the local Kannada film industry

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.200
[Amit Varma]: who would therefore have been influential within the Kannada elites,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.160
[Amit Varma]: who kind of just wanted to be protected from competition, and therefore the rule came about.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.840
[Guest]: For what it's worth, I think many of them genuinely believed that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.800
[Guest]: without having some form of protectionism, they cannot take on higher capital

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.680
[Guest]: and higher resources of the Tamil Nadu film industry.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.960
[Guest]: They were starting from scratch.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.000
[Guest]: So, I don't particularly want to judge them too harshly.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.760
[Guest]: They did what they could.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.400
[Guest]: And remember that this was also a time where the politics around the language was very important.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.080
[Guest]: So, they drew strength saying that by defending the Kannada film industry and protecting its interests,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.320
[Guest]: they can protect the interests of Kannada as a language and Kannadiga as a set of language speakers.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I'm not doubting their motives.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.320
[Amit Varma]: We will all after all act in our own self-interest.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's, you know, for multiple reasons, the smartest thing for them to do.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, the scene effect of this obviously is that for decades,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.840
[Amit Varma]: you did not have any other content dubbed into Kannada.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.360
[Guest]: What are the unseen effects?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.240
[Guest]: So, the scene effect, I want to elaborate the way people see it is that Kannada movies,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.160
[Guest]: Kannada entertainment was given a unique platform in its own state, right?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.680
[Guest]: So, the idea is there is no other state government in the country which can bestow patronage upon this language.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.080
[Guest]: So, here is this one state government and in this one state where it's sort of protected and allowed to flourish, right?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.240
[Unknown]: So, that's the scene effect as they see it.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.680
[Guest]: The unseen effect is a complete lack of competition to Kannada films for over 50 years.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:55.440
[Guest]: So, what's happened is, while 50 years ago, people in say Mysore and Belgaum and various parts of Karnataka would go watch movies in Kannada,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.160
[Guest]: they slowly started shifting to watching movies in Malayalam, watching movies in Telugu, in Tamil and so on,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.520
[Guest]: many of them which have very, very dynamic film industry.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:14.640
[Guest]: So, what happened was the market for Kannada movies itself started shrinking and the quality of Kannada movies also started deteriorating.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.800
[Guest]: So, one of the things if you see, the Kannada film industry today is about 2% of the South Indian film industries combined.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.280
[Guest]: Population wise, we are like a fourth, if not more, but the film industry is that much smaller.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.600
[Guest]: There are no corporate houses which are investing into Kannada films the way they are with Telugu and Tamil films.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:44.480
[Guest]: Why? Because it's now a very bad market with this ban on dubbing just being one of the many protectionist moves by the film industry.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.120
[Amit Varma]: So, essentially what you're saying is that people who would have liked watching movies in Kannada,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.360
[Amit Varma]: because they simply didn't have so many movies available to watch in Kannada,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.680
[Amit Varma]: developed the habit of instead watching those movies in Telugu or Tamil or whatever,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.520
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, as a reason, their desire to consume Kannada content shrank and the market shrank.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.120
[Amit Varma]: And as the market shrank, incentives grew smaller for people to come in and make quality films for that market.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And it became a sort of a vicious circle, which is why the film industry is at such a pathetic…

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.200
[Guest]: Absolutely. And along with that, the options and the quality of entertainment options for Kannada speakers have reduced.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.200
[Guest]: Because those people who can understand other languages a little bit are watching that.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.480
[Guest]: But a lot of people don't understand any language other than Kannada.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.440
[Guest]: And so, they are completely robbed of entertainment options.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.040
[Guest]: They are robbed of television programming as well.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: I mean, so, though this ban started with the film industry, today, as of a couple of years ago,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.400
[Guest]: you couldn't have an English cartoon channel in Kannada, you couldn't have the history channel,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.240
[Guest]: National Geographic, Discovery Channel, none of these could be dubbed into Kannada.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.800
[Guest]: And this is the age where they started getting dubbed into almost every other Indian language,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.840
[Guest]: enabling access to quality science and history and, you know, kiddy entertainment content

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.600
[Guest]: that would have otherwise been impossible for us to create locally.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, a lot of state interventions tend to help certain special interest groups.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.760
[Amit Varma]: At the expense of the people at large.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.600
[Amit Varma]: But here, while the people at large have suffered a loss because of this,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.640
[Amit Varma]: who are the beneficiaries? Because the Kannada film industry itself is in bad shape.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.360
[Guest]: They're in bad shape, but they're happy sort of staying in that status quo.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest]: Big fish in a small pond.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.760
[Guest]: Yeah. So, what they have done is they've co-opted the machineries of the state government to giving, you know,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:45.440
[Guest]: subsidies of various sorts, little, little things, little promotions, differential pricing for Kannada films versus other films.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.680
[Guest]: A differential entertainment tax.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.920
[Guest]: So, all those things that are, well, a little par for the course in the country.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.040
[Guest]: But what's like the, the layer of cream on this horrible cake?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.520
[Guest]: Is this completely illegal, completely unconstitutional ban on competition to your films?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.800
[Amit Varma]: So, has it never, if it's unconstitutional, has it never been challenged in court?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.480
[Amit Varma]: What's the sort of history of that?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.960
[Guest]: So, what happened was, with this informal ban coming in place in the 60s,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.360
[Guest]: till the 2000s or so, even the narrative that this is a bad thing was not there.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.760
[Guest]: You know, it had complete narrative dominance that this is good for Kannadigas, this is good for the industry and everyone.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:33.520
[Guest]: Around then, you had a lot more Kannadigas who became more prosperous,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.760
[Guest]: who entered the tech industry in Bangalore, who entered other things,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.800
[Guest]: who had also seen the world a little and started writing about,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.520
[Guest]: hey, you know, our film industry is terrible.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.760
[Guest]: In fact, there was a whole period and there's a whole type of films in the Kannada film industry called the machu long films,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.160
[Guest]: talking about the machetes and the long machetes.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.880
[Guest]: Because that's what the films were about.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.280
[Guest]: They were about people hacking and slashing each other.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is all film should be about.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.040
[Amit Varma]: But with a lot of taste and exquisite.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you want a katana and not a machete.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.280
[Amit Varma]: A lot of the rings in Kannada, again.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.160
[Guest]: So, in the 2000s, the narrative started getting contested, you know,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.400
[Guest]: people then formed little language groups and also a consumers forum to say that

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.480
[Guest]: we want more entertainment content in Kannada.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.040
[Guest]: For the first time, there was this growing public awareness that the film industry's

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.200
[Guest]: interests are not the same as the languages interests.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.200
[Guest]: And it's amazing to look at the motivations of those who went on this.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.400
[Guest]: It was not just that people who were, you know, liberal, fighting for liberty, fighting for economic freedom.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.160
[Guest]: But basically, the argument was that if you have, say, Discovery Channel getting dubbed into Kannada,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.480
[Guest]: then you will have more Kannada words that get created and that get used.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.720
[Guest]: I mean, right now, for example, the internet is called Antar Jala,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.760
[Guest]: Antar Jala, right, which is a literal translation of inter and web.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.080
[Guest]: And, you know, the moment you have more dubbing happening of, you know, music, entertainment,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.200
[Guest]: science, history, you will just have more words that are coming into Kannada,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.320
[Guest]: more the language gets modernized as a result of it.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.120
[Guest]: So, from a deep rooted language development and activism angle,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.240
[Guest]: they sort of came in and said, hey, let's have more competition in the film industry.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.440
[Amit Varma]: I find this to be an absolutely mind blowing argument because normally,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, a lot of the protectionism is driven by sort of language chauvinism.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.840
[Amit Varma]: We need to protect our language.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is speaking on behalf of the language and saying that instead of protecting the

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.240
[Amit Varma]: language, quote unquote, by shutting access, we need to make it richer by opening access,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.680
[Amit Varma]: which is such a fantastic argument that it's not, like you said,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.600
[Amit Varma]: this is not an argument made on grounds of liberalism or individual freedom or what have you.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.720
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, it's a conservative argument in a sense.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.920
[Guest]: Yeah. I mean, if you want more people to be attracted to Kannada as a language, make great

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.800
[Guest]: art. Right. I think that recognition has dawned slowly because I think people have seen great

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.000
[Guest]: art being made in neighboring states. I mean, the Tamil film industry has come out with some

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.920
[Guest]: absolute gems. For a while, it was sort of leading the Bollywood

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.880
[Amit Varma]: industry as well in terms of what kind of movies were made.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm not familiar with the Tamil industry, but I'm familiar with Bollywood and that doesn't

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.040
[Amit Varma]: surprise me.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.840
[Guest]: So, this is what has happened. Now, as a result of this, a few years ago, the Consumers Association

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.360
[Guest]: got together and filed a case with the Competition Commission saying that the film industry is

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.520
[Guest]: acting as a cartel and it's abusing market power and doing a lot of illegal things,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.880
[Guest]: including sort of brute force thuggery, you know, threatening people if they wanted to go

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.320
[Guest]: against the consensus. And the Competition Commission took its time and then finally

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.400
[Guest]: said, look, they are illegal. I mean, the practices are illegal and even slapped some

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.240
[Guest]: fines on to the film industry association and related bodies.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest]: So, does the law still exist?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.400
[Guest]: There's never been a law which bans dubbing. So, this is a mob rule in action. This is

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:21.040
[Guest]: the state not enforcing the rule of law. So, what has happened as a result is stakeholders,

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.680
[Guest]: market players have become risk averse. They just don't want to take the risk to do something

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.480
[Guest]: like this. No one wants to be the first one to dub a movie, you know, when the returns

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.280
[Guest]: are very uncertain. So, what the Competition Commission judgment and other things have

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.760
[Guest]: done is they've signaled saying, look, this is all right. You should go ahead. You sort

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest]: of have the blessing of the state. And after the decision a couple of years ago, you've

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.640
[Guest]: had about three movies getting dubbed into Kannada. They're small movies. They're not

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.880
[Guest]: things that you would actually want to go to watch in a theater, but they're something.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.320
[Guest]: And now the campaign is on to get a big Indian movie or a big foreign movie dubbed into Kannada

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.040
[Guest]: because that would be the watershed moment. Because once it is done and once it somehow

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.280
[Guest]: runs successfully, even in Bangalore, where the mob power is the most, then the flood

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.520
[Amit Varma]: gates are completely open. But, you know, even though you talk of mob power, where does

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.840
[Amit Varma]: the mob get its sustenance from? After all, every Kannada speaker would benefit from films

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.360
[Guest]: being dubbed in Kannada. No, but this conflation of Kannada interest, because film stars in

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.520
[Guest]: India are demigods. I mean, they, some have become very, very successful popular politicians,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.360
[Guest]: including in South Indian states. Karnataka, by the way, is the one state in which the

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.840
[Guest]: biggest actors stayed away from politics. Because your industry is so small.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.440
[Guest]: But Raj Kumar was a big, very, very big figure within that small industry. And, you know,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.240
[Guest]: he had played past kings from the Kannada history. So, you know, you have all that symbolism

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.320
[Guest]: around him. So, when the film industry is seen as a champion of the language and the

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.360
[Guest]: history and the culture of that state, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance in people's

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.800
[Guest]: heads that these guys are the ones who are responsible for keeping our language where

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.120
[Guest]: they are. And to have fought that successfully over a decade, and this is a shout out to

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.680
[Guest]: one of my friends, Vasan Shetty, very active in the Consumers Forum. They've done a mammoth

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.280
[Guest]: job to marshal all kinds of arguments and persuade large numbers of people over a decade

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.440
[Guest]: that this is the wrong thing. And then they followed it up with constitutional methods,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.360
[Guest]: went to the competition commission. And now we have to wait for the larger public and

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.520
[Amit Varma]: the markets to decide what happens. I have to say this is very heartening that at least

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.680
[Amit Varma]: in one aspect, India is moving in the right direction. So, before I end this episode,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.320
[Amit Varma]: I have one request for you. I want you to translate one line into Kannada for me.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.240
[Guest]: All right. One ring to rule them all.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.360
[Guest]: That's mind-blowing. Pavan, thanks for coming on the show.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.840
