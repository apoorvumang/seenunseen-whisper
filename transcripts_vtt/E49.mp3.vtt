00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Amit Varma]: The internet is amazing, isn't it?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: When I first began to explore the internet,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: more than 20 years ago,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I was blown away by the possibilities.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I thought, wow, this is going to do so much

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[Amit Varma]: to help people express themselves

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and to help people communicate with each other.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
[Amit Varma]: The internet put the tools of publishing

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: into the hands of every individual.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyone, with a little effort,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
[Amit Varma]: could start a webpage of her own.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: With even less effort, one could start a blog.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And as time went by, with almost no effort at all,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: we could write posts about our lives

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: that all our friends could read.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: We could broadcast our thoughts to the world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: 140 characters at a time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: We could post pictures and videos

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and comment on the pictures and videos of others

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and discover ourselves and the world around us

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: as distinctions of geography

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and race and class

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and even language would cease to matter.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: At the least, because of the internet,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[Amit Varma]: human beings would talk to each other

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Amit Varma]: much more than they ever did before.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: That's what I thought then.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But, alas, it hasn't quite

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: worked out that way.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the big lessons of our modern age is this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: We may all talk a lot

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: at the same time,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: but no one really listens anymore.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[Unknown]: politics, and behavioral science.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: This is episode 49 of this weekly podcast,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and the first one in which I will have no guest.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll be on my own.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Just for this one episode,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: my intention was to try and go solo

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and sort of freewheel my way through it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Just me and my thoughts.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I figured that as this releases

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and goes on,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll talk about the year

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: that just passed by.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But having started this episode

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: by talking about how we don't listen

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: to each other anymore,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: about that and what it's done to our political discourse.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And I guess it's kind of ironic

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: then that I don't have a guest on this episode

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: because that makes it the first episode

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: where I won't be listening at all.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Three weeks ago,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: in episode 46 of The Seen and the Unseen,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I spoke to my good friend Prem Panikkar

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[Amit Varma]: about the state of the media.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: What I was trying

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: to wrap my head around was this.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Back in the 80s and 90s when I grew up,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: before the internet was ubiquitous,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: we got all our news and information

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
[Amit Varma]: from certain mainstream media sources.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: We'd get one or more newspapers at home.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: In my case, I've been a captive audience

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: of The Times of India, among others.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: We'd have a handful of TV stations to choose from.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And just by dint of inertia,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
[Amit Varma]: we were a captive audience for them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: We were passive consumers

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: of information.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And most of us, when we had things to say,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
[Amit Varma]: would communicate that to individuals

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: or at best small groups of people.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
[Amit Varma]: The internet changed all that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And thank goodness for that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: The internet put the tools of publishing

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: in the hands of individuals

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and reduced the cost dramatically.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: You no longer had a gatekeeper, like a newspaper editor,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: who would look at your thoughts

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
[Amit Varma]: before they were published.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
[Amit Varma]: You were not tied down to the news cycle.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
[Amit Varma]: You weren't tied down to standard formats of content

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
[Amit Varma]: like the 800-word op-ed, for example.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
[Amit Varma]: When I started my blog

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: in 2003, India Uncut,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I found it liberating

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Amit Varma]: that I could post three thoughts when I wanted to.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Amit Varma]: A post could be one sentence

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: if I felt like it, or a 7000-word essay.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And I didn't have to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Amit Varma]: worry about what anyone other than me

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
[Amit Varma]: thought of it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So many people I knew started writing blogs,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and blogs tended to find their own audiences.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: There was a greater diversity

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Amit Varma]: of voices out there now.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And more diversity is always, always a good thing.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I was already a journalist,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
[Amit Varma]: but the success of India Uncut

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
[Amit Varma]: got me invitations to write columns for newspapers

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and many other bloggers also made similar transitions.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But of course, that's history now,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: as blogs are more or less dead.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Social media democratised

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Amit Varma]: this process even further.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Blogs were an outlet for those who liked to write.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Social media gave an outlet

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Amit Varma]: to everybody.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Anybody could post a Facebook update about what they did that day,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[Amit Varma]: or how they were feeling.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: They could post their vacation pictures,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: they could see the vacation pictures of others.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
[Amit Varma]: On Twitter, they could reach out to like-minded people,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Amit Varma]: or expand their own world views

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
[Amit Varma]: by engaging with people from outside

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
[Amit Varma]: their narrow geographical circles.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Technology enabled this,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
[Amit Varma]: and smartphones allowed us to do so much more,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
[Amit Varma]: including make feature films if we wanted to.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: This was the empowerment

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
[Amit Varma]: of the individual,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
[Amit Varma]: the great libertarian dream.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's not all that happened.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Let me take a detour for a moment

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Amit Varma]: to a social science experiment

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
[Amit Varma]: carried out in 2005

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
[Amit Varma]: by Cass Sunstein,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Amit Varma]: David Shcade, and Reid Hastie.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I read about this in an excellent short book

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Amit Varma]: by Sunstein called

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
[Amit Varma]: On Rumours.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Amit Varma]: The study itself is titled

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: What Happened on Deliberation Day?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: You can find it on Google if you search for it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So in this study, Sunstein and his colleagues

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
[Amit Varma]: gathered together 60 people

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and divided them into 10 groups

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Amit Varma]: of 6 people each.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Amit Varma]: This grouping was not random.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
[Amit Varma]: It was done so that each group was

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: more or less homogenous, and all 6 members

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: in it fit the same kind of

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: profile in terms of political

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
[Amit Varma]: ideology. And broadly speaking,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Amit Varma]: half of these groups were liberal

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Amit Varma]: in the American sense, and half were conservative.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Amit Varma]: At the start of the experiment,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
[Amit Varma]: each participant was asked

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
[Amit Varma]: a series of hot-button questions.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Their anonymous answers were noted down.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Then they went into a room

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Amit Varma]: with their group of like-minded people

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and discussed those issues.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
[Amit Varma]: 15 minutes after the group discussion ended,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
[Amit Varma]: they were again asked the same

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Amit Varma]: set of questions, anonymously

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and one by one. Here's how

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Sunstein summarized the results.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Start quote. In almost

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Amit Varma]: every other group, members ended up

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Amit Varma]: holding more extreme positions after

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
[Amit Varma]: they spoke with one another.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Aside from increasing extremism,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
[Amit Varma]: the experiment had an independent

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
[Amit Varma]: effect. It made both liberal

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and conservative groups significantly

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Amit Varma]: more homogenous and thus

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
[Amit Varma]: squelched diversity.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Moreover, the rift between liberals

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and conservatives widened

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Amit Varma]: as a result of discussing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[Amit Varma]: End quote. Sunstein

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
[Amit Varma]: called this effect group polarization.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
[Amit Varma]: He defined it thus.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Start quote. When like-minded people

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Amit Varma]: deliberate, they typically end

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
[Amit Varma]: up adopting a more extreme

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
[Amit Varma]: position in line with their

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
[Amit Varma]: pre-deliberation inclinations.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: End quote.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You can see where I'm going with this.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Amit Varma]: This is pretty much how discourse on the

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Amit Varma]: internet proceeds.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
[Amit Varma]: First, we find like-minded people.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Amit Varma]: This is not always easy in the real world,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Amit Varma]: where our social circles are small, but

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Amit Varma]: online, no matter what our beliefs

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Amit Varma]: are, the earth is flat, ancient

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Indians invented plastic surgery, Barack

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Obama is a Muslim, no matter what we believe,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
[Amit Varma]: we will find others who believe the same

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Amit Varma]: thing. Feeling validated

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and thus empowered, we will

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[Amit Varma]: then form an echo chamber with these new

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Amit Varma]: members of ours. And mind you, we could be

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Amit Varma]: part of multiple echo chambers at the same time,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Amit Varma]: encompassing different beliefs.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
[Amit Varma]: We would find comfort in belonging to this

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Amit Varma]: group, and our beliefs would be strengthened

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and thus grow more extreme.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Amit Varma]: What Sunstein called group

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Amit Varma]: polarization. We would then become

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[Amit Varma]: impervious to facts. We would ignore

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Amit Varma]: all facts that did not fit our

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
[Amit Varma]: beliefs, and accept only

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Amit Varma]: those that did.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Behavioral economists call this the confirmation

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: bias. And this

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Amit Varma]: is exactly why our political discourse

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[Amit Varma]: today is so polarized.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Amit Varma]: On the internet, most arguments

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Amit Varma]: consist not of people talking to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Amit Varma]: each other, but talking past each

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Amit Varma]: other. This affects not just

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Amit Varma]: content, but also tone. We have

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Amit Varma]: become so shrill and contemptuous

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Amit Varma]: of each other. I had written a

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Amit Varma]: column a few months ago titled

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Amit Varma]: What We Talk About When We Talk About

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Politics. A sly nod to Raymond Carver

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously. My lament in that

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Amit Varma]: piece is that there is no

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Amit Varma]: argument in our political discourse anymore.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Whenever someone says something

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Amit Varma]: that we disagree with, we shift

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Amit Varma]: the focus from the argument to the person.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Amit Varma]: We attack the person making the argument.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Amit Varma]: We have no appetite for discussion

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
[Amit Varma]: because we have already made up our minds,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and opposing views are a threat to us.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is why we react so

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Amit Varma]: viscerally. So instead

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
[Amit Varma]: of refuting the argument, we

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: attack the person. There are

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Amit Varma]: a number of ways in which this happens.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Let me lay out the common ones, and I'm

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Amit Varma]: sure you'll find them all familiar.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Amit Varma]: The number one way of personalizing an

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Amit Varma]: argument is whataboutery. For example,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Amit Varma]: if you mention the Gujarat riots of

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[Amit Varma]: 2002, a Narendra Modi fan

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
[Amit Varma]: might well ask, but what about the anti-Sikh

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Amit Varma]: riots of 1984? Why don't you speak

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Amit Varma]: about that? Whataboutery

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Amit Varma]: is basically two things. One, it

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
[Amit Varma]: is an attack on the person who made the original

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
[Amit Varma]: statement. So if I say the 2002

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Amit Varma]: riots were bad, by asking me

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
[Amit Varma]: what about 1984, you are

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Amit Varma]: implying that I am a hypocrite, and I

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Amit Varma]: don't really care about human life at all.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And two, besides being a personal

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
[Amit Varma]: attack, it is implicitly

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Amit Varma]: an admission of guilt.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Amit Varma]: All whataboutery basically says,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Amit Varma]: yeah, guilty as charged. But what

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Amit Varma]: about those other guys? They're also guilty.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Whataboutery poisons

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Amit Varma]: the discourse by shifting the focus from the

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
[Amit Varma]: argument to the person. And

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Amit Varma]: it's pointless to engage with the whatabouter.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Often when I speak out for free speech,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Amit Varma]: when some fringe Hindutva group does something

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Amit Varma]: or the other, I'll get asked, but what about

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Amit Varma]: the Charlie Hebdo murders? What about the Danish cartoonists?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Why were you silent about that?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, the truth is I wasn't silent then.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I wrote columns arguing in support of

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Amit Varma]: the Danish cartoonists and the murdered employees

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
[Amit Varma]: of Charlie Hebdo, and I am a free speech

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: absolutist regardless of context.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's a waste of time

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Amit Varma]: to point this out, because your attacker

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Amit Varma]: will then just move on to method number

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: two of personalizing an argument.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Before I get to that though, let

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Amit Varma]: me point out that whataboutery is not something

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Amit Varma]: that just trolls on Twitter do.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Politicians do it all the time.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, when Arvind Kejriwal was asked about

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Amit Varma]: the tens of crores of taxpayers' money,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
[Amit Varma]: our money, coerced from us,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
[Amit Varma]: that he spent on running ads for his

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Amit Varma]: government, he asked the reporter,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Amit Varma]: why are you asking me? What about Modi?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Amit Varma]: The BJP spends much more on advertising.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Amit Varma]: End quote. That's a classic

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Amit Varma]: admission of guilt, but no one sees it that way.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay, on to method number

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Amit Varma]: two. The second way of

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Amit Varma]: personalizing an argument is to question

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
[Amit Varma]: your intent. So if I

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Amit Varma]: criticize something that you agree with, you could, for example,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
[Amit Varma]: call me a prostitute. Now,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Amit Varma]: the label baffles me, because I don't view

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Amit Varma]: prostitute as a pejorative at all.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Sex workers are no different morally

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
[Amit Varma]: from workers of any kind. Even I sell my labor

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Amit Varma]: for money. Nothing wrong with that.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
[Amit Varma]: But the implication behind calling someone a prostitute

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: is that he or she is getting

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Amit Varma]: money for criticizing. They have an

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Amit Varma]: agenda. And therefore, the focus

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
[Amit Varma]: conveniently shifts from the argument

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
[Amit Varma]: to the person.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[Amit Varma]: A prostitute is just one version. You could be

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[Amit Varma]: a CIA agent. You could be acting

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Amit Varma]: on behalf of China. You could be

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
[Amit Varma]: funded by a Christian or Jihadi group that

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Amit Varma]: wants to spread their religion. And so on.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Amit Varma]: So if someone is cooking biryani

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
[Amit Varma]: for a party, and you enter the kitchen

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and see that they're putting rotting dog meat

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Amit Varma]: in the biryani, and you point that out,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Amit Varma]: imagine them saying, oh, of course

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[Amit Varma]: you would say that. You're from the mutton

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Amit Varma]: lobby. And then everyone at the party

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Amit Varma]: surrounds you and they chant, mutton lobby, mutton

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Amit Varma]: lobby, mutton lobby. And then

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
[Amit Varma]: they all eat the biryani and die. Which is

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
[Amit Varma]: probably what's going to happen to our democracy.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
[Amit Varma]: You get my point?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[Amit Varma]: On now to method number three.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Method number three is identity politics.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Your argument is ignored

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
[Amit Varma]: because of who you are.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you're Muslim

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[Amit Varma]: or Christian and argue with the BJP,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: your argument is irrelevant.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
[Amit Varma]: They will invoke your identity and that's the end of that.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And it isn't just the right wing that

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
[Amit Varma]: does this. The left also does this.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Especially woke millennials who like to talk

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
[Amit Varma]: about privilege. Now,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
[Amit Varma]: privilege exists. It's an excellent

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: analytical tool and we should all

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Amit Varma]: introspect about the different kinds of privilege

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Amit Varma]: we have benefited from.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
[Amit Varma]: But invoking it an argument

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
[Amit Varma]: is toxic for our discourse.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[Amit Varma]: If someone makes an argument about,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Amit Varma]: say, reservations, saying that

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
[Amit Varma]: reservations don't work as intended,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
[Amit Varma]: shutting him down just because he is

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Amit Varma]: savarna kills a discourse

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[Amit Varma]: right there. If a man makes a comment

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Amit Varma]: about feminism, to say that he

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Amit Varma]: needs to check his privilege and therefore

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Amit Varma]: his argument should be ignored just because

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
[Amit Varma]: he is a man, is like poison

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Amit Varma]: to the free and open expression that

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Amit Varma]: a democracy needs. Now,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Amit Varma]: don't get me wrong. Someone may make a poor argument

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[Amit Varma]: because of their privilege.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[Amit Varma]: But the thing to do there is to point out

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
[Amit Varma]: the flaw in their argument

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Amit Varma]: rather than to invoke their identity.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: To refuse to engage

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
[Amit Varma]: with someone's argument just because of

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Amit Varma]: a person's identity, usually

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
[Amit Varma]: something they have no control over.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
[Amit Varma]: It's just toxic. Again, thinking

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
[Amit Varma]: about privilege is useful

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of analysis of how

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
[Amit Varma]: opinions get formed and so on.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
[Amit Varma]: But invoking it in conversation

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Amit Varma]: just ends the conversation right there.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
[Amit Varma]: What's the point of this?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Method number 4 is actually

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Amit Varma]: an extension of method number 3,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Amit Varma]: labelling. So someone makes an

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: argument and you call them a libtard or a

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Amit Varma]: bhakt or an aaptard or a pinko

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
[Amit Varma]: or a commie and then refuse to engage.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Amit Varma]: The label is meant as a pejorative

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and you use it not only to dismiss a person

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: but by extension

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Amit Varma]: to also dismiss their argument.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: There are many ways of ending

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
[Amit Varma]: an argument other than personalising

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Amit Varma]: it which are also intellectually dishonest.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Arthur Schopenhauer had once written

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Amit Varma]: a great essay called

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Amit Varma]: 38 ways to end an argument.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I reposted this on India Uncut so if you

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Amit Varma]: head there you can search for it over there.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: These include time-honoured methods like

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
[Amit Varma]: shifting goalposts, attacking

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
[Amit Varma]: strawmen and so on. Schopenhauer

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Amit Varma]: intended his piece to be cautionary

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Amit Varma]: but I'm sure it's used

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
[Amit Varma]: as an instruction manual by some people.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, some of you might say

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
[Amit Varma]: given how things are,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
[Amit Varma]: why even bother to engage with people

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
[Amit Varma]: on social media? On Twitter for example

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
[Amit Varma]: the main rhetorical tool

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Amit Varma]: employed is snark.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
[Amit Varma]: It's much easier to make fun of someone

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
[Amit Varma]: thereby feeling superior yourself

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Amit Varma]: than to actually engage with humility.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
[Amit Varma]: If you can do this in a clever way

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Amit Varma]: you will get many RTs and

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Amit Varma]: talis from others in your echo chamber.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Isn't that gratifying?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, most conversation

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Amit Varma]: at least most political conversation

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter is equal parts preaching

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Amit Varma]: to the choir and being gratuitously

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Amit Varma]: derogatory to opponents.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, if someone disagrees with you

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
[Amit Varma]: you stick a label on them. Hypocrite,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[Amit Varma]: prostitute, fool, whatever and dismiss them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And too much of what I see on

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Twitter also is virtue signalling.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
[Amit Varma]: People saying, look, I am

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
[Amit Varma]: so noble or compassionate

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Amit Varma]: or woke and so on.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, I suggest that before we

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
[Amit Varma]: post anything on Twitter, we should ask

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Amit Varma]: ourselves two questions.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'll call this the Amit Verma test for

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
[Amit Varma]: social media posting.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Question number one, am I being derogatory

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: about someone?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Question number two, am I trying to show

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Amit Varma]: myself in a good light?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
[Amit Varma]: If the answer to either of these questions is yes,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Amit Varma]: don't make that post.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Just watch a cat video on YouTube or something.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Amit Varma]: There are better ways to waste your time.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll end this episode here.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for listening so far.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
[Amit Varma]: If you have any feedback, either negative or positive

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
[Amit Varma]: about this first attempt of mine to record

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
[Amit Varma]: a solo episode, do let me know

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter or elsewhere.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
