00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
[Amit Varma]: Regular listeners of the scene and the unseen would have heard me complain about the predatory

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560
[Amit Varma]: parasitic Indian state.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.440
[Amit Varma]: But this is a bit of a simplification.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Yes, the Indian state is a parasite, but it is not just one thing.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.380
[Amit Varma]: It is a vast complex machine with many moving parts, and the whole is worse than the sum

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.380
[Amit Varma]: of its parts.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.040
[Amit Varma]: There are outstanding bureaucrats and well-meaning politicians within the system, but there are

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.240
[Amit Varma]: also bad incentives, which lead to bad outcomes.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.520
[Amit Varma]: Also, the Indian state is a multi-headed monster, and some of those heads are often at war with

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.520
[Amit Varma]: each other.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.280
[Amit Varma]: Consider, for example, the constant tussle between the government and the central bank.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.980
[Amit Varma]: Our imagination feasts on conflict and battle and winners and losers, but it must be said

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.320
[Amit Varma]: that no one is making a Netflix series anytime soon on the life of a central banker.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they should.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.200
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.520
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Viral Acharya, who was deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India between

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.760
[Amit Varma]: 2017 and 2019.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Widely respected among economists, Viral quit the RBI six months before his term ended reportedly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.160
[Amit Varma]: because he wasn't happy with the way the government was preventing the RBI from carrying out its

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160
[Amit Varma]: duty.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, he wasn't happy.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.340
[Amit Varma]: Viral has just released an excellent book called Quest for Restoring Financial Stability

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.920
[Amit Varma]: in India, in which he lays out in great detail why we are in the middle of a crisis.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.160
[Amit Varma]: At the core of it is a concept called fiscal dominance.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.880
[Amit Varma]: If I had to sum that up, I'd do it thus.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Fiscal dominance is a means by which a state thrives at the expense of society using the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.320
[Amit Varma]: central bank as its tool.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.120
[Amit Varma]: If you think this is going to be a boring episode about finance, let me assure you,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.320
[Amit Varma]: Viral is anything but a boring, funny, nutty technocrat.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
[Amit Varma]: He loves cricket.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.520
[Amit Varma]: He's written and composed a music album called Yadav Ke Silsile and can make economics and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.080
[Amit Varma]: finance quite as lovely and interesting as both cricket and music.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin our conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.600
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.880
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.920
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.520
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.840
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.840
[Amit Varma]: to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.360
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.740
[Amit Varma]: So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going and that involves you.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.280
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.600
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.400
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.480
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.520
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.120
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going, sceneunseen.in slash support.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.440
[Amit Varma]: Viral, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.560
[Guest]: I'm delighted to be part of your podcast and I look forward to the interaction.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we start talking about your book and in a broader sense about India's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.560
[Amit Varma]: system of governance and our financial system and all of that, tell me a little bit about

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.300
[Amit Varma]: your sort of personal journey, where did you study, what did you do, what were your sort

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.720
[Amit Varma]: of intellectual influences that shaped you along the way?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.600
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, I studied at, we used to live in South Bombay, in Chira Bazar in a street

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.440
[Guest]: called Ghazdar Street.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.360
[Guest]: I grew up frankly, like any other street boy, I used to play a lot of gully cricket and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.360
[Guest]: dance all the way with Ganpati from our street to the Chowpatty for Ganpati Visarjan and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
[Guest]: all that.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.200
[Guest]: I was in a school, in a Gujarati school, which also had English medium called Fellowship

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: School.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.200
[Guest]: And the reason why I'm going through a little bit of my school journey is actually that

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.840
[Guest]: was probably the most important intellectual part of my journey.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.160
[Guest]: And we were in this very interesting phase of the school where a set of school teachers,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.160
[Guest]: they decided that our school should also be able to produce students who are in the merit

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.920
[Guest]: list of the state for the SSC, the 10th standard exam.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.360
[Guest]: And you know, the school was very balanced culturally, we had actually great music and

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.320
[Guest]: cultural aspect to the school, but on the academic side, I think the teachers were excellent.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.720
[Guest]: But you know, cracking exams and getting into merit list requires a slightly focused kind

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: of preparation.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.400
[Guest]: And these teachers actually, around the time maybe we were in seventh or eighth grade,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: they set this motto for all of us that, you know, this is the challenge, this is the luxury

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.560
[Guest]: that we have to achieve.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.400
[Guest]: And then, you know, it was, they were so motivated, of course, parents in India are always motivated

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.800
[Guest]: for their kids to do well.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.520
[Guest]: And then we also got a bit charged up.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.920
[Guest]: And one of the teachers, he passed away two years back, his name is Shailesh Chassar,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.840
[Guest]: as we used to call him.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.720
[Guest]: And in fact, my book, Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in India is dedicated

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.200
[Guest]: to him.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.600
[Guest]: He was the one who kind of really set me on fire, so to speak.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.200
[Guest]: He tutored me as a private coach, so to speak, you know, without charging my parents single

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.960
[Guest]: paisa for three years in a row.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.680
[Guest]: But it was his single-minded focus that in the end created that aspiration, that ambition.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.040
[Guest]: And as I said, whenever I think of him, I think of this, you know, Hrithik Roshan's

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.800
[Guest]: song from Lakshya, Lakshya ko har haal mein paana hai, you know, it was that kind of single-minded

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800
[Guest]: focus.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.920
[Guest]: And, you know, it then sort of all worked out.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.000
[Guest]: And you know, I got into Rupert Hill College, which was sort of the college to be in if

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.640
[Guest]: you had done well in SSE that time, I took Electronics.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.680
[Guest]: And then I had a friend in my street just across our building, you know, a lot of people

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.760
[Guest]: you knew in our street more because you could look into their balconies.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.040
[Guest]: And he had been at IIT Mumbai.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.120
[Guest]: And so I spoke to him, then, you know, we got into some correspondence courses, I got

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.960
[Guest]: into IIT.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.560
[Guest]: Like everyone who does well in the JEE entrance exam, I also took Computer Science without

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.880
[Guest]: thinking whether that's the right field for me or not.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.720
[Guest]: But after that ambitious phase of the school, IIT was, I would say, more of a self-discovery,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.080
[Guest]: self-exploration phase.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.760
[Guest]: I think that was the time I realized that Computer Science wasn't my calling.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.040
[Guest]: I had some aptitude for it, but I wouldn't say a great aptitude for it.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.200
[Guest]: I was still doing okay through sheer persistence and hard work.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.680
[Guest]: But I really felt that this is not the subject that I'm breathing, I'm not sleeping.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.320
[Guest]: This is not what I mean is I'm not staying awake because of the problems in Computer

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.640
[Guest]: Science.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.320
[Guest]: And I started exploring a bit and I took a course in International Finance with Professor

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320
[Guest]: Pushpa Trivedi.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.800
[Guest]: It was an elective course in the last year at IIT Bombay.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.720
[Guest]: And I would say Professor Pushpa Trivedi was like my second critical intellectual mentor

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.200
[Guest]: in this journey because her course was really the turning point.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.240
[Guest]: It made it clear to me that economics was a subject where you could really bridge the

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.720
[Guest]: macro with the micro.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:41.440
[Guest]: You know, economia is, of course, the study of the household wealth management, even though

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.880
[Guest]: most people don't realize it because we use the term economy, etc. so commonly that we

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.480
[Guest]: think it has something to do in this grand scheme of things.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.760
[Guest]: But it's really at the grassroots, it's really about the household wealth management.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.560
[Guest]: And the fact that what central banks were doing, what was happening across countries

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.000
[Guest]: on trade, etc., ultimately had its bearings in what was happening to the household demand

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.400
[Guest]: and consumption at the last mile.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.000
[Guest]: I found that very, very appealing in some ways.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.400
[Guest]: And then, you know, again, we had a family friend who had done a PhD in finance at New

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.680
[Guest]: York University Stern School of Business.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.600
[Guest]: I spoke to him.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.280
[Guest]: He said, you know, this is a very interesting subject, it can be very analytical, very mathematical

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280
[Guest]: if you want.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.320
[Guest]: It can be very applied and data oriented if you like.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.360
[Guest]: You can be an academic if you like, or you could be in industry doing trading with stocks,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.560
[Guest]: bonds, derivatives, whatever.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.440
[Guest]: And I said, you know, let's take the plunge and we will see how it goes.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.120
[Guest]: So it was too late by the time I left for my PhD in computer science.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:58.760
[Guest]: So I did a one year sort of in computer science, but then I switched my major at NYU.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.400
[Guest]: And it was a very interesting phase around 97, 98, when, you know, Southeast Asian crisis

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.440
[Guest]: happened, the Russian default happened, the largest hedge fund at that time, long term

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.720
[Guest]: capital management was about to fail.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.360
[Guest]: And that was the time I realized that financial stability is actually very, very crucial to

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.120
[Guest]: an economy, that if your banks and financial firms are not in great shape, they could become

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.080
[Guest]: a source of huge deceleration in the growth of the economy.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.640
[Guest]: And I always think of finance as the lifeblood of the economy.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.500
[Guest]: Sometimes I think of central bank almost like the heart that's regulating the pumping of

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.640
[Guest]: these liquidity through various channels into the economy.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.520
[Guest]: And if these banks, which you can sort of think about as, you know, the arteries along

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.840
[Guest]: the way, if they are clogged up, then you know, you can have problems in your organs,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.560
[Guest]: you can have problems all the way to the heart also.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.440
[Guest]: And so it dawned upon me that this is a fascinating aspect of economics and finance.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.080
[Guest]: What role do banks play?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.760
[Guest]: What role do other forms of financial sector firms play?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.920
[Guest]: What is the role of the central bank?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.800
[Guest]: Why is it that when banks and non-bank finance is not in great shape, economic outcomes thereafter

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.960
[Guest]: typically don't tend to be very good, as we have seen in India, for instance, over the

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.600
[Guest]: last decade.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.040
[Guest]: So that gave me a direction in economics on my research.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.800
[Guest]: And I've basically, I would say, stayed with that thought.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.280
[Guest]: That is one thought that keeps crossing my mind over and over and over and over again.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:48.480
[Guest]: There are so many shades to it that you can analyze, there is so much depth to that question.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.320
[Guest]: And there are so many settings all over the world, because every economy is slightly different.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.760
[Guest]: Every financial sector is slightly different.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.800
[Guest]: You get different shocks that create these disturbances in a variety of settings.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.680
[Guest]: So I did my research.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.720
[Guest]: I went to London Business School.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.680
[Guest]: I then came back to NYU.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.040
[Guest]: You know, around the time I was finishing my PhD, Dr. Raghuram Rajan had just had, I

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.480
[Guest]: would say, his sort of fairly meteoric rise in the economics profession.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.880
[Guest]: He was also studying banking and around that time also banking crises.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.320
[Guest]: He then went on to become the chief economist of the IMF, the governor of the central bank.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.480
[Guest]: But I think in a way, I would say he was probably the third important mentor, even though he

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.080
[Guest]: has never been my direct mentor, but I worked with him after my PhD, because I was at NYU,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080
[Guest]: Chicago.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.520
[Guest]: But I think he has been a mentor more through setting sort of like a role model in the sense

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:57.120
[Guest]: that you know, coming from India, coming from engineering into economics, finance, working

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.840
[Guest]: in the field of banking, etc, that you know, you can make it, you know, it gives you a

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.520
[Guest]: little bit of confidence that you can break through these barriers and, you know, have

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.680
[Guest]: your own standing, so to speak, in the field.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.960
[Guest]: And then the field is such the issue of financial stability, bank, central banking, that it's

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.280
[Guest]: a natural culmination for many people working in this area, who have a shot at a central

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.680
[Guest]: banking management position, because it allows you to apply your research, it allows you

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.360
[Guest]: a little bit to of course, learn things on the job that you can't learn in an academics

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.640
[Guest]: armchair.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.880
[Guest]: And in some small way, I think, you know, give back to society.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.600
[Guest]: And I said, you know, central bankers role is exactly what appealed me about economics

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600
[Guest]: at one level.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.040
[Guest]: Now, I always give this example, you're just turning this one interest rate dial, you know,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.080
[Guest]: by 25 basis points, like point 25%.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.720
[Guest]: And it is supposed to go and touch people in the economy.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.680
[Guest]: Now, at some level, it looks kind of almost like a surreal thought, you know, that is

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.360
[Guest]: this really even possible?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360
[Guest]: But it does.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.640
[Guest]: And sometimes it doesn't work.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.800
[Guest]: And sometimes it does.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.520
[Guest]: And I think it's very fascinating to understand what are the preconditions, so that sitting

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.160
[Guest]: in your macro offices, you can actually have some micro impact on on streets, such as the

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
[Guest]: street where I grew up.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:31.880
[Guest]: So yeah, that's been the intellectual journey, I would say, several important teachers and

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:38.420
[Guest]: mentors or role models have been important, I think, the real life experiences of witnessing

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:44.480
[Guest]: financial crisis in their sort of wolf fury, so to speak, has been also very important

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
[Guest]: learning lesson.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.680
[Guest]: And I think the stint at the Reserve Bank of India was was probably the best thing I

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.480
[Guest]: could have asked for, personally, because I spent time with my parents and lived with

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.360
[Guest]: them for two and a half years, professionally, because it is the closest I've been to executive

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.760
[Guest]: decision making in a policy role.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:13.200
[Guest]: And because India is so complex, so interesting as an economy, and it's it really challenges

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.720
[Guest]: you to think through hard about what the right frameworks are and how to go about doing things

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.080
[Guest]: in a manner that you have more intended consequences rather than unintended consequences.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we proceed with your career, there are many fascinating strands in what

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.160
[Amit Varma]: you just said, which I kind of want to tease out and or you know, one of the interesting

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.440
[Amit Varma]: things which struck me when I was, you know, reading up on you is that, you know, economics

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.160
[Amit Varma]: is considered a dismal science.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.400
[Amit Varma]: So most economists also considered fairly boring, straightforward kind of people, though

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.400
[Amit Varma]: I should tell my listeners that when Viral began this podcast, he had a baseball cap

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.760
[Amit Varma]: on with his headphone and t shirt.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.800
[Amit Varma]: But we are not shooting any video.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the things that I'm going to ask you about later is, of course, a music

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.560
[Amit Varma]: album that you wrote and composed, Yadav Ke Silsile, which I was listening to earlier

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.600
[Amit Varma]: today, and also your passion for cricket.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you've used a metaphor of cricket a lot when you've been talking about the economy

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040
[Amit Varma]: in the role of banks.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And when you were talking about Dr. Rajan, it struck me that, you know, was he such into

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600
[Amit Varma]: your dravid perhaps?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:19.800
[Guest]: Oh, that's a great question. Yeah, see, cricket is because I kind of grew up on the streets

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800
[Guest]: of Mumbai.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.440
[Guest]: You know, we used to play on this first, we used to play, of course, in our living room

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:36.920
[Guest]: and hallway, we used to play on the terrace, you know, everyone in India is everything,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:44.680
[Guest]: you do whatever the team requires, it was very creative, you know, we used to play on

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680
[Guest]: the terrace.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.800
[Guest]: And when the ball used to go down, we used to have this, the kite flying manja and firki.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.040
[Guest]: So instead of the kite, we had a bag attached to it, and we used to roll the bag down, someone

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.720
[Guest]: would put the ball back in and you know, we would get the manja to get the ball back up.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:09.960
[Guest]: Of course, we used to then play gully cricket, so you know, it will be night matches, floodlights

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
[Guest]: and all that.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:17.160
[Guest]: So, you know, Jitekarwadi, Khetwadi, SK Patiludhia, and you know, all these places we used to

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.240
[Guest]: go with our team.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240
[Guest]: It was great fun.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.520
[Guest]: I think it became sort of part of your DNA.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.960
[Guest]: And of course, you watch cricket so much, you know, when we grew up, there weren't so

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:32.720
[Guest]: many channels, Darshan probably had like maybe a little bit of Chitrahaar and then maybe

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.440
[Guest]: the Saturday Marathi movie and the Sunday Hindi movie.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.320
[Guest]: So you know, cricket, watching cricket and test matches was a very big part of the whole

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.360
[Guest]: sort of your pastime.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.880
[Guest]: So I partly like to use the cricket analogies, besides them coming naturally to me is because

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.960
[Guest]: I think that's a way to connect to the common man.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.840
[Guest]: And to me, that's very, very important.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:05.760
[Guest]: Sometimes a few of the speeches I've given are so bare bones, that people in academia

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.640
[Guest]: sometimes feel when I gave these talks that, you know, does it really have to be so basic?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Does it really?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.720
[Guest]: And my sense is, it's a question of what your audience is, and are you connecting with the

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720
[Guest]: audience or not?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:25.680
[Guest]: You can't, there is no point using jargon and fancy terms and methods and techniques

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.760
[Guest]: when you know, you have to convey something much simpler to the common man.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.880
[Guest]: But importantly, I think these being able to connect is equally important with people

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.520
[Guest]: at the top in mind.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:46.520
[Guest]: I think even those who are doing very complex policy roles, they actually prefer when things

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.600
[Guest]: are explained in a very simple and transparent manner.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.060
[Guest]: And I think that's why, you know, no analogy is perfect, but they work because when people

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.720
[Guest]: see it in a different light, when they can relate to it, they also start feeling that

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.320
[Guest]: maybe there is something like a common thread of a principle here, you know, they start

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.360
[Guest]: seeing that, oh, this is not about a very specific suggestion, maybe there is something

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.760
[Guest]: deeper that permeates across different disciplines of life.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.480
[Guest]: So that's the reason why I would say I use the cricket analogy.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.000
[Guest]: I think the Dravid analogy is one that's very close to my heart.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.520
[Guest]: It's actually linked to a question that a good friend of mine from IIT Bombay asked

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.080
[Guest]: me just before, they had given me a send off before I went to Reserve Bank of India.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.880
[Guest]: So we met at one restaurant outside our place in Manhattan called Heroes, it's a Greek food

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880
[Guest]: place.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.760
[Guest]: And I distinctly remember about 10 of them had come down and we sat together and one

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:51.520
[Guest]: of them, my very good friend, he asked me, so who would be your role model as a central

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.520
[Guest]: banker?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.080
[Guest]: Is it Ben Bernanke?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.560
[Guest]: Is it Paul Walker?

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560
[Guest]: Is it Janet Yellen?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.720
[Guest]: And I said, no, it's going to be Rahul Dravid.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.800
[Guest]: And I really genuinely mean it because I always thought he was the pillar of the Indian batting

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.200
[Guest]: order during his time, the rock bed, sheet anchor, whatever term you want to use.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.320
[Guest]: There were so many test matches I remember watching where, you know, the entire team

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.600
[Guest]: would bat around him.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.080
[Guest]: And because I think of the central bank as a little bit of this heart that is regulating

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:32.960
[Guest]: all this pushing of lifeblood to the economy, I think that that is the role that is best

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.080
[Guest]: captured, I think, in cricket by Rahul Dravid.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.080
[Guest]: In fact, and, you know, I think, as I said, financial stability is very important.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:48.560
[Guest]: I think it's most important that you need someone with that persistence, with that discipline

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:55.480
[Guest]: and with that single minded focus of holding the guard when, you know, the situation is

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480
[Guest]: looking tricky.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.320
[Guest]: You know, when some of the arteries, some of the banks are blocked, not doing very well.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.640
[Guest]: In fact, if you remember, in one of his last series in England, which we lost, I think

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640
[Guest]: 3-0.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.440
[Guest]: No, he scored three centuries because he was the only one holding up one end and giving

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.160
[Guest]: some hope that we might actually at least come out with a draw.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: So I think that's very important.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.920
[Guest]: I think, you know, and it's everything, you know, taking the stance, knowing where your

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.120
[Guest]: off stump is, leaving a lot of balls outside the off stump.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.240
[Guest]: I think this is what the central bank has to do most of the time.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.840
[Guest]: I think there's a lot of bad ideas.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.200
[Guest]: I can't tell you how bad some of the ideas are in policymaking.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.920
[Guest]: Somehow there is this one feature that because economics is so rooted everywhere in each

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.760
[Guest]: household's policymaking, and of course, the households are making sometimes the most interesting

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.760
[Guest]: decisions.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.160
[Guest]: There is also this perception, though, that we don't need to acquire any expertise in

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.840
[Guest]: this field.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.840
[Guest]: Everyone can just go walk into these policy roles and start doing things.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.320
[Guest]: Now, of course, there will be some talented people who are so smart by their training

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.480
[Guest]: on the ground that they can do it.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.560
[Guest]: But you know, however imperfect and however young as a field, you know, economics is not

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.800
[Guest]: even 100 years old in some sense as a discipline.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.640
[Guest]: So it's a relatively young field, but however young and imperfect it might be, it is still

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640
[Guest]: a field.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.440
[Guest]: And there are some principles and ideas that seem to show up in different countries in

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.120
[Guest]: different conditions on a very regular and robust basis.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.640
[Guest]: And so a big part of the central banking is just not dealing with bad ideas.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.560
[Guest]: It's these balls which are outside the off stump.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.920
[Guest]: So I think that's the sort of Rahul Dravid part of it.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I think Raghuram Rajan in some ways, I think you could, you could be, you are right.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.800
[Guest]: I think he could be Tendulkar, but my sense is he's also probably taken a fairly long

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:02.080
[Guest]: term view, I think, during his time as central banking, you know, moves such as the beginning

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:10.360
[Guest]: the steps towards inflation targeting framework in India, then, you know, creating a differentiated

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.400
[Guest]: banking system, opening up bank licenses.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.640
[Guest]: And third, you know, creating this database Krillic as a repository for information on

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
[Guest]: large corporates.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.240
[Guest]: I think all of these were fairly long term moves, actually.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.600
[Guest]: So I would say by and large, you know, to use another example, maybe he's like Rahul

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.440
[Guest]: Dravid, but he also has Virat Kohli's aggression at times.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm also a big fan of Dravid, of course, and you're absolutely right.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.840
[Amit Varma]: If you look at all of India's important test wins overseas in that particular decade, you

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.840
[Amit Varma]: know, Headingley, Adelaide, Rawalpindi, the series we won in the Western days, Dravid

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.080
[Amit Varma]: was completely at the heart of it.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.400
[Amit Varma]: I'd save the question for later.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.960
[Amit Varma]: But since you, you know, brought up that subject, I'll kind of ask it now, which is you spoke

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:00.520
[Amit Varma]: about the importance of, you know, communicating ideas and sort of keeping it simple.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.160
[Amit Varma]: And I, you know, I teach an online writing course, where sometimes students will ask

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.280
[Amit Varma]: me that, listen, you know, I do academic writing, and people in academics expect the kind of

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.000
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of jargon and a certain kind of signaling and all of that.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And my response to all of that is that in any context, clear writing is a good thing.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.760
[Amit Varma]: I can understand that sometimes there are those imperatives where people will expect

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.480
[Amit Varma]: you to use language that puts them in their comfort zone, but as clear as possible is

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480
[Amit Varma]: always a good thing.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And the imperative of, you know, writing clearly makes you think more clearly, because if you're

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.320
[Amit Varma]: stating something in simpler language, as you do throughout in your book, then you're

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.240
[Amit Varma]: forced to put that kind of thought into it.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.360
[Amit Varma]: But my broader question, which I wanted to come to was that, you know, when you wrote

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.520
[Amit Varma]: this book, one of the reasons that you said for writing this book was that you wanted

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.520
[Amit Varma]: to start a debate that you felt very deeply that these issues which you're talking about

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.600
[Amit Varma]: financial stability, fiscal dominance, they are of great importance, they should not only

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.560
[Amit Varma]: be debated by policy people, the public at large should understand them and sort of talk

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.660
[Amit Varma]: about them, which is an incredible aim.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.800
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it struck me, and this is something that, you know, people who write

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.880
[Amit Varma]: about economics have been saying forever, that, you know, a lot of the fundamental ideas

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:17.000
[Amit Varma]: of economics are deeply counterintuitive, you know, spontaneous order, positive, some

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.120
[Amit Varma]: game, how complex systems work.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you know, there is both bounded rationality, which and what public choice

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.080
[Amit Varma]: there is called rational ignorance, that for a common person to put in the effort to understand

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.920
[Amit Varma]: the economy, as it were, it's probably just too much of an effort, it's much easier to

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.360
[Amit Varma]: pick a political side, which everybody more or less has.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And then you go with whatever that side is doing, you defend what they're doing.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And if you're not with them, then you attack what they're doing, which is how most of our

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.480
[Amit Varma]: public discourse is today.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.640
[Amit Varma]: So how did you approach that challenge?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.360
[Amit Varma]: Because these are not easy ideas to sort of, you know, grasp for, you know, a lay person.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what were the thoughts that I mean, you've used cricketing analogies and

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.560
[Amit Varma]: all that, and that's worked beautifully and so on.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.560
[Amit Varma]: But is that something you consciously thought about that?

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.080
[Amit Varma]: How can I communicate this?

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.200
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:16.520
[Guest]: And see, the important thing to realize in policymaking is that, see, over certain functions,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.800
[Guest]: the central bank probably is given legislative autonomy.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.960
[Guest]: So what I mean is that, think about the inflation targeting framework, it is actually by an

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.840
[Guest]: act of law as an amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act, that the central bank through

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.640
[Guest]: this Monetary Policy Committee can set the interest rate, this is the objective function

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.520
[Guest]: and so on.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.680
[Guest]: But in many other functions of the central bank, the operational autonomy is very loosely

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680
[Guest]: defined.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.120
[Guest]: A lot of the decisions, especially in India, as I explain in the book, given the presence

00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:00.360
[Guest]: of public sector banks and other public sector financial institutions, are very often taken

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.760
[Guest]: either jointly with the government through some discussion, conversation, consensus.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.800
[Guest]: Or if the central bank has to even take certain decisions, the government has to empower the

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.080
[Guest]: central bank through some legislative changes.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.160
[Guest]: Now, why am I saying all this?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.740
[Guest]: What I'm trying to convey is that for many good policy decisions to be taken, politics

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.600
[Guest]: has to be aligned with the economics.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:36.520
[Guest]: The government has to want what makes sense in the long run for the economy as a whole.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: Now, a fundamental thesis of my work, the book, as well as the Rahul Dravid analogy

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.320
[Guest]: is that there are pressures sometimes to actually not play the long test match.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:55.580
[Guest]: There are pressures to instead play T20, you know, to go and entertain the crowds instead

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.560
[Guest]: of actually winning session by session through endurance.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.640
[Guest]: And because the political decision making can often be very geared by the short term

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:13.920
[Guest]: consideration and you put it exactly right, why is it that short term growth will actually

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.520
[Guest]: give them political gains?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:23.040
[Guest]: It's because the average person on the street may not be able to figure out that the short

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.520
[Guest]: term boost in activity, either because they are getting a lot of credit, or the government

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:35.140
[Guest]: is distributing a lot of cash through a variety of schemes, that that short term activity

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:41.240
[Guest]: is down the line, at some future point of time in three or five years time, going to

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.600
[Guest]: come back with a lot of costs because maybe the loans that were made were made without

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.120
[Guest]: due diligence, or the cash that has been distributed is going to be very hard to repay down the

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120
[Guest]: line.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.080
[Guest]: Now, so sometimes in the common man, both because of them having to work so hard on

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:09.040
[Guest]: their own economics, and perhaps because of limits to information processing and rational

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.880
[Guest]: evaluation of data and you know, I think the counterfactuals, what if that is the key question

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.160
[Guest]: that you have to ask in policymaking, what if this were to happen?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.200
[Guest]: Those things are not always very easy for the common man to perceive.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.480
[Guest]: And if they can't, in a way that creates the opportunity for the short termism to actually

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.920
[Guest]: lead to gains, that if I do this pump priming of the economy, it can actually lead to some

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.080
[Guest]: benefits during the electoral cycle.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:43.280
[Guest]: Now, if that is not in the long run interest of the economy, in my view, those who can

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: actually perceive what the impact of these short term pump priming of the economy is,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.920
[Guest]: those who are in the job, such as at a central bank, where your objectives are enshrined

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.320
[Guest]: in the law to be long term protecting depositor interest, keeping price stability, guarding

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.760
[Guest]: the value of the rupee, etc.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.640
[Guest]: All of these require sometimes making short term sacrifices, so that you know, you keep

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.920
[Guest]: the ship afloat and in good condition.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:22.820
[Guest]: So I think it is the responsibility in my view of the central banker to actually use

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:28.880
[Guest]: communication as one of the tools to advance the public discussion.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.200
[Guest]: And therefore, I think it has to go to the common man as well.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.200
[Guest]: I think it's not good enough that it reaches the circles of finance industry, bankers,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.920
[Guest]: market participants.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.420
[Guest]: You have to try and get it into mainstream media as much as possible.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:50.760
[Guest]: And I think the reason is that once you shift the public debate, once you create a demand

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:57.640
[Guest]: for the right long term reforms in people themselves, then the politics and economics,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.400
[Guest]: there's a greater chance that you will align.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.320
[Guest]: See, sometimes politics aligns with economics because, you know, there may be a situation

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.920
[Guest]: where the government has no choice, but to do the right thing for the long run, because

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.960
[Guest]: otherwise, investors will not give you money, like think of 1991 liberalization moment,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.400
[Guest]: it was a moment where structural changes to the Indian economy were thrust upon us by

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.200
[Guest]: the IMF, because we needed their support, and there was no other way out.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.840
[Guest]: So that's one way to go.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.160
[Guest]: But you know, reforms do happen all the time.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.360
[Guest]: Sometimes they happen promptly, sometimes they happen with delay.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.520
[Guest]: And why do we get these moments where the political consensus arises to undertake these

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520
[Guest]: reforms?

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.520
[Guest]: Very often, I think it's because there is a demand for reforms in the common man's mind,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.560
[Guest]: in the common man's perception, in media, on television, in print media, now in podcast,

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.280
[Guest]: Twitter, whatever it is.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:59.760
[Guest]: But you sometimes get this good ideas being planted, seeded, and then they're sort of

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.640
[Guest]: germinating and rising to the top of an agenda.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:11.160
[Guest]: And as long as there's a critical mass of discussion around the right ideas, I think

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.880
[Guest]: there's a greater chance that the politics and economics will align.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.160
[Guest]: I think we need to create more such opportunities.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.880
[Guest]: And to do that, we can't just wait and watch.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.280
[Guest]: I think we have to plant these seeds of ideas, very often, the ideas germinate, and they

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.880
[Guest]: are not even associated with you.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.320
[Guest]: And I think that's perfectly all right.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.440
[Guest]: I think you are just trying to get people to debate because very often the person who

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.720
[Guest]: comes up with the original idea and plants the seed may not have the right solution.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:46.280
[Guest]: Maybe he or she doesn't actually appreciate all the realities of the political economy.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.320
[Guest]: But once the idea is debated, maybe a better solution emerges.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.120
[Guest]: But to me, this is absolutely crucial.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.920
[Guest]: Policymakers have to communicate, they have to communicate with the common man, besides

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.240
[Guest]: the more sophisticated parts in their relevant sphere of influence.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.160
[Guest]: And I think this is the way change comes about.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.760
[Guest]: So I think to cut a long story short, I think Amit, what I'm trying to say is that while

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:18.560
[Guest]: it's true that there is bounded rationality, there is limited processing of information.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.520
[Guest]: And of course, decision making is very concentrated, but we have to build a bridge between these

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520
[Guest]: two.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:32.920
[Guest]: We have to get people to come a bit closer to the decision makers in terms of their discussions

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920
[Guest]: and debates.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.760
[Guest]: We have to get the decision makers closer to the common man by alerting them about the

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.240
[Guest]: long run consequences of some of the policies and why some things make sense and others

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.240
[Guest]: don't.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.040
[Guest]: And I think how do you bring them together?

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:54.080
[Guest]: I think your communication is one of the kind of almost, it's a negotiating tool, actually.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.840
[Guest]: You're bringing these two parties, which often seem far apart, together through public debate

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840
[Guest]: and discussion.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.320
[Guest]: I think this is a very crucial role.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.200
[Guest]: And I think I'm seeing this also in the modern day central bankers.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.400
[Guest]: I'm not on social media myself as a policy, but I can see that many central bankers are

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:21.480
[Guest]: now actually using even social media to have an outreach of their ideas.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.920
[Guest]: Many central banks are now actually, quote unquote, organizing panels and sessions at

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.240
[Guest]: industry events or academic conferences because they want actually to be part of the broader

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.240
[Guest]: discussion and debate.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.440
[Guest]: So I think over three to four decades, we seem to have moved away from a very boring,

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:46.920
[Guest]: quiet central banker to a somewhat, I wouldn't necessarily say outspoken always, but sometimes

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.040
[Guest]: even outspoken.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:55.280
[Guest]: But certainly, I would say communicative and interactive central banker who's using communication

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.720
[Guest]: as a very, very important tool, both for this negotiation function, as I mentioned, between

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.040
[Guest]: politics, common man and economics.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.600
[Guest]: And I think also to actually explain what they are doing, because that gives them a

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.600
[Guest]: democratic accountability of their actions, you know, because in many cases, central bankers

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600
[Guest]: are technocrats.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.640
[Guest]: They are taking very technical decisions.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:25.280
[Guest]: As I said, what is this changing of this dial of 25 basis points or 0.25% of interest rates.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.560
[Guest]: But if you can communicate and explain this well to the common man, that increases your

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.960
[Guest]: democratic accountability from the technocratic decisions that you are taking.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, the challenge of doing that is something that I've been, you know, discussing

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.440
[Amit Varma]: with friends for ages now, because a lot of my friends work in the policy sphere, where

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.600
[Amit Varma]: they'll work with politicians and bureaucrats and try to sell policies.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And my point to them always has been that, you know, if you think of the political marketplace,

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.720
[Amit Varma]: you have to focus on the demand and not the supply and that politicians will respond to

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.720
[Amit Varma]: incentives.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.480
[Amit Varma]: So if you can change the demand, and then you have people who demand something different,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.160
[Amit Varma]: then you're far more likely to get those sort of outcomes.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, again, Andrew Breitbart once said politics is downstream of culture, which

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.000
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, again, that whole act of changing the culture, seeding these ideas, like you

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.280
[Amit Varma]: pointed out is a decades long game.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.360
[Amit Varma]: You saw it in America with, you know, Goldwater losing in 64.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.720
[Amit Varma]: And then Reagan coming to power in 80, it takes many, many sort of years to play out.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to you know, the specifics of the Indian economy and your time in the Reserve

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.360
[Amit Varma]: Bank of India, I'd also like to just for a moment, get some more background on where

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360
[Amit Varma]: you're sort of coming from.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we are essentially the same age, I think I'm a couple of months older than you.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, this was a question that first struck me when I read about your journey,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.240
[Amit Varma]: that I kind of spent a certain part of my childhood in pre liberalization, India.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.920
[Amit Varma]: And then my adulthood is in liberalization, India.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.580
[Amit Varma]: And it so happened, my dad was in the IAS.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:54.000
[Amit Varma]: So I was, of course, steeped in the received wisdom of that Fabian socialist era, where

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.240
[Amit Varma]: your state is your my bop.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's where you look at the economy.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you're an adult and sort of the blinkers fall off one by one and you see everything

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.240
[Amit Varma]: kind of differently.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.920
[Amit Varma]: What was your sort of intellectual evolution through that period like?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.320
[Amit Varma]: What you know, did your notion of your country and what we were doing right and what we were

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.320
[Amit Varma]: doing wrong?

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.480
[Amit Varma]: Did your idea of India, as it were, you know, evolve during that period, especially for

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.040
[Amit Varma]: example, when you went abroad, it must have given you that distance where, you know, you

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.280
[Amit Varma]: can be a little more objective about it, you can contrast it with what you see around you.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Take me a bit through your sort of mindset and your idea of India as it were how it evolved

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720
[Guest]: in that period.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:45.240
[Guest]: So, I think, you know, as a child, maybe even in my school, college, perhaps even IIT days,

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.400
[Guest]: I wasn't so clear about what exactly India was relative to the rest of the world with

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
[Guest]: great clarity.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:38:02.240
[Guest]: Of course, what was very hard not to notice was the fact that it seemed very heavily controlled

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:09.360
[Guest]: and administered economy certainly until the early 90s.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.200
[Guest]: It seemed like everyone had very few career choices.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.960
[Guest]: So there clearly weren't too many thriving industries in the country.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:29.800
[Guest]: And you knew from all the, you know, the great demand for imported goods, smuggled or otherwise,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.560
[Guest]: that people in the rest of the world were producing goods that were far better than

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.240
[Guest]: were produced in India.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.600
[Guest]: And so, you kind of knew something at the back of your mind that, you know, that something

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.520
[Guest]: is not happening right, though you can't kind of put your finger on it yet, you know, that

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.520
[Guest]: why is everyone wanting everything that's produced abroad?

00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:01.360
[Guest]: And then I think when I first came to the United States, I saw the extent of variety

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:10.760
[Guest]: of produce of various types, the efficiency of customer service on the ground, the sheer

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.320
[Guest]: buzz and activity in the economy, etc.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:21.280
[Guest]: I kind of realized that this is a very different manner in which the economy is organized.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.600
[Guest]: And then you suddenly started realizing that at a deeper level, all countries are somewhere

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:34.240
[Guest]: on a continuum of, you know, sort of like pure capitalism and at the very extreme communism.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.640
[Guest]: And you know, different countries, depending upon the policies they choose at a given point

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.520
[Guest]: of time are actually shifting their position on this.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.600
[Guest]: And you know, that happens, including China, which started off at the very extreme, but

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.840
[Guest]: now has embraced certain kinds of market reforms, versus, say, United States, which used to

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:59.080
[Guest]: be a lot more capitalistic at one stage, but increasingly, people think that, for example,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:05.040
[Guest]: its entire housing market risk is socialized through the guarantee programs that it has.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:11.120
[Guest]: It thinks that it has given way to very concentrated power in certain sectors.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:17.120
[Guest]: And, you know, maybe there's some forms of crony capitalism also coming in, in some guise

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.120
[Guest]: or the other.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.160
[Guest]: So, you know, countries are always shifting their positions along the spectrum.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.240
[Guest]: And then, so that's how, so I don't, so, you know, my view of countries is that each country

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240
[Guest]: is unique.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:37.580
[Guest]: Each country has its own preconditions, which are very important in shaping the ideology

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.600
[Guest]: that the people have, as we were discussing, sometimes this ideology itself needs to be

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.480
[Guest]: shifted or change to happen.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.880
[Guest]: So the initial conditions are important, because they have left a legacy of ideologies in people's

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.880
[Guest]: minds.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.320
[Guest]: But in some ways, they are also on the spectrum.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:05.400
[Guest]: And you can actually think about them, understand them, understand the outcomes, the policy

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:12.960
[Guest]: choices by actually using economics to understand, then what kind of policies get accepted, when

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.480
[Guest]: is a country more likely to embrace capitalism, when is it more likely to regress towards

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.400
[Guest]: inward looking protectionism, combined with, you know, socialism or at the very extreme

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.580
[Guest]: sort of communist kind of policies.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:36.440
[Guest]: But the idea that really struck me the most was actually this idea of Austrian economists,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:46.520
[Guest]: you know, Hayek most, because he also was very closer to finance, but to an extent also

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:55.000
[Guest]: von Mises and others, that what too much state control of the factors of production does

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.760
[Guest]: in the end, is that it makes the individual essentially lose his or her entrepreneurial

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.560
[Guest]: spirit.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:12.920
[Guest]: Because you know, that even if you are entrepreneurial, there are so many barriers to entry, there

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:19.000
[Guest]: are so many regulations, licensing, etc, to go through.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.080
[Guest]: And at an extreme, you're not even allowed because the entire sector may be nationalized,

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.480
[Guest]: and you don't even have private entry that's allowed.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:36.240
[Guest]: And that just chokes the individualism, it chokes the entrepreneurial spirit of the individuals.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.760
[Guest]: And when I read about this, of course, Hayek, you know, in his most, one of his most famous

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.480
[Guest]: books is titled The Road to Serfdom.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.600
[Guest]: And he's basically saying, you know, you're going to be producing serfs, when you adopt

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.840
[Guest]: these kinds of centralized decision making policies.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:02.200
[Guest]: And that appealed to me a lot, that over long stretches of time, having too much control

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:09.800
[Guest]: through the center is ultimately going to kill off entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:16.720
[Guest]: And that became an idea that when you are going through a situation like the Great Depression

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:24.240
[Guest]: or the Great Recession, you need the state to play an important role to kickstart investments,

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.880
[Guest]: kickstart job creation, you know, give a softer landing to the economy, while it is good,

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.040
[Guest]: it should only be interpreted as something that you should do as a temporary stopgap

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.240
[Guest]: stimulus quick.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:44.140
[Guest]: And you know, even, even a short stimulus can go pretty bad, as we know, but at a minimum,

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.840
[Guest]: it has to be seen as a temporary arrangement.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:51.220
[Guest]: Because if that becomes the permanent style of the economy, that the government tries

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:56.680
[Guest]: to do more and more and more, then you will have less and less and less of the private

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.360
[Guest]: sector because their enterprise is actually getting killed.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.120
[Guest]: And actually, in a subtle way, while I'm not so explicit in linking it to the Austrian

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:12.720
[Guest]: economists in my book, that has always been at the back of my mind, that, you know, I

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.800
[Guest]: have these one, there's the Eddie Schroff Memorial Lecture in the book, which is on

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.040
[Guest]: the central bank's independence.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:25.040
[Guest]: And then the last speech in the book is actually on how governments crowd out and have focus

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.040
[Guest]: there on finance.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.800
[Guest]: But when an individual loses the entrepreneurial spirit, that is actually crowding out, because

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:37.840
[Guest]: that that entrepreneurial spirit has no role in the in a nationalized or very heavily centralized

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.840
[Guest]: economy.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:45.120
[Guest]: And to me, this is a key theme of our times right now, in my view, because what has happened

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:51.720
[Guest]: is the slowdown of global economic growth, especially post the global financial crisis,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:59.280
[Guest]: though many would contend this was happening even before in 90s and early 2000s.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:08.240
[Guest]: But this slowdown has created a chain of events in which more and more is being done by the

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240
[Guest]: governments.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.400
[Guest]: The government balance sheets the world over are getting bloated, they are spending a lot,

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:22.440
[Guest]: they are trying to take over significant parts of job creation, subsidies, guarantees, risk

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.760
[Guest]: taking on their balance sheets.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.040
[Guest]: In fact, many in the United States think that increasingly, most financial sector risks

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.600
[Guest]: are now socialized, whereas the gains remain privatized.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:45.440
[Guest]: And what this has done is that I think we really risk the fear, we really risk the prospect

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.560
[Guest]: of and we have to fear that prospect that we lose actually the entrepreneurial spirit

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.720
[Guest]: of the global economy.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.360
[Guest]: The idea that the best solutions cannot come in the administrative bureaucratic offices

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.280
[Guest]: of the government, where only a small part of the economy sits there, you know, the millions

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.280
[Guest]: are actually out there on the streets, in their homes, they are the ones where the brightest

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.720
[Guest]: minds are likely to be for a specific idea.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:24.280
[Guest]: And if we don't find a channel for these entrepreneurial ideas to form shape, you know, for them to

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:30.600
[Guest]: organize themselves as businesses, maybe fail, but fail fast and restart, or many of them

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.280
[Guest]: succeed to becoming the best enterprises going forward.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.520
[Guest]: I don't see how we can arrest the slide we are seeing in the global growth and productivity.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:44.200
[Guest]: So at a very deep macro level, I think this is the shift that has happened, it has become

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.360
[Guest]: more pronounced since the global financial crisis.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.840
[Guest]: My view is that India is also undergoing such a shift.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:58.120
[Guest]: We were very nationalized and centralized until the late 80s, then we liberalized, we

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.280
[Guest]: also had a big set of divestment reforms during 98 to 2003.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.720
[Guest]: But my sense is the policy responses since the global financial crisis are in line with

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.640
[Guest]: the rest of the world in the sense that we have now also moved towards greater and greater

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.380
[Guest]: centralization of the economy.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:23.760
[Guest]: What doesn't help us is that our initial conditions feature already a big presence of the state

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.080
[Guest]: in many, many sectors, even non-strategic sectors, we have a big presence of the government

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:34.400
[Guest]: in the form of public sector banks, public sector owned insurance companies and power

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.640
[Guest]: finance companies, etc.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:45.880
[Guest]: So again, on this spectrum, I see India increasingly regressing a bit towards more centrally controlled

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.780
[Guest]: economy and not relinquishing actually the control.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.800
[Guest]: And the fear I have is that this is going to crowd out the private sector.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:01.520
[Guest]: I think, in my view, the reason why private investments in India are not high, it's not

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:07.800
[Guest]: just because we had a bad loans problem, yes, we did have a very severe bad loans problem

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:13.160
[Guest]: because of the fiscal stimulus of 9 to 11, 12.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.720
[Guest]: And you know, those sectors are still not fully back up.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.720
[Guest]: But I think one big reason why private investments are low is because costs of borrowing are

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.000
[Guest]: very, very high, cost of capital is very high.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.840
[Guest]: And why is the cost of capital very high is because so much of the savings in the economy

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.560
[Guest]: are borrowed by the government itself.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:39.600
[Guest]: And so I would say both as someone who grew up during the nationalized era without any

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.600
[Guest]: clear thinking, but with a lot of questions at the back of your mind, then someone who

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.920
[Guest]: witnessed what used to be a very open capitalist society in the United States.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.400
[Guest]: And you know, I spent seven years in London between 2008.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.400
[Guest]: And that was the time I realized that everything is on a spectrum.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.160
[Guest]: Because when I observed the European economies, I realized it's all on the spectrum.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:08.760
[Guest]: But having seen this global experience, I think this is the theme that I would say has

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:14.120
[Guest]: struck me the most, which is what is the right balance between the government, the private

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.480
[Guest]: sector, the banks and the central bank?

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:26.320
[Guest]: Can you ensure that all four wheels are moving in tandem and together with no attempt to

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.840
[Guest]: drive the car entirely on just one wheel?

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.280
[Guest]: Because you know, if you do that, there is only so far that your journey will take you.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.360
[Amit Varma]: So I've just realized that we are not just united in our admiration for Dravid, it's

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.520
[Amit Varma]: also an admiration for Hayek.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.880
[Amit Varma]: But so I'll digress a bit and I want to spend a lot of time talking about your book and

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.960
[Amit Varma]: your insights in it, of course, but I'll continue digressing a bit and a thought that kind of

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:55.240
[Amit Varma]: struck me as you were, you know, going through this narrative of how your thinking changed

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.600
[Amit Varma]: and yet, how the world has moved in a certain kind of direction is that it seems to me that

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:06.040
[Amit Varma]: one of the great battles in our times is not a battle about what ideas work and what ideas

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.040
[Amit Varma]: don't work.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Instead, it is a battle about what narrative sells and what narrative doesn't sell.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.480
[Amit Varma]: For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, if you ask most people what happened, they

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.400
[Amit Varma]: will say, oh, it's a private sector is greedy bankers.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, as you've spoken about it yourself, you know, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had a

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.640
[Amit Varma]: big part to play in that the incentives that were there by the government, perhaps you

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:33.400
[Amit Varma]: can go back to 1977 and talk about the Community Reinvestment Act, a lot of it was the overbearing

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.800
[Amit Varma]: oppressive hand of government, which created those terrible incentives, and led to those

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.520
[Amit Varma]: players behaving in the ways that they did.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I've always found it dubious that, you know, when Americans say that, you

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.440
[Amit Varma]: know, losses are being socialized, profits are being privatized, absolutely right.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that should not be the case, you create a moral hazard there, you create

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
[Amit Varma]: the wrong incentives.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But the broader point is that, despite the fact that everything that's been happening

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.920
[Amit Varma]: across the world, all the economic failures, all the political failures that I see, are

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.440
[Amit Varma]: in some way or the other, linked to the role of the state and the incentives that, you

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.640
[Amit Varma]: know, they are setting.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And yet the dominant narrative is everywhere that it is greedy capitalists, and the state

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:21.000
[Amit Varma]: is a solution and the state needs to sort of clamp down and instead of Hayek, who is

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.200
[Amit Varma]: almost again, a forgotten man today, you have Keynesian ideas, again, taking center stage.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Is this something that you think about, because on the one hand, you would like to imagine

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.280
[Amit Varma]: that, look, you know, you pick the ideas that work, you go through history, you know, you

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.480
[Amit Varma]: see everything play out, you figure out what works and what doesn't, you go for what works.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.680
[Amit Varma]: And yet, it's not the idea that works, it's a narrative that sells that is on the ascendant.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.680
[Guest]: Does this worry you?

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.680
[Guest]: It worries me a lot.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.280
[Guest]: And I think, but there's also a challenge in there, as we were discussing earlier, Amit,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:01.440
[Guest]: which is that, see, why does the narrative of a Keynesian stimulus or state control during

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:07.120
[Guest]: a financial crisis or while coming out of a very deep recession work is because actually

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.760
[Guest]: even conceptually, and in theory, there is good rationale for that to be the case.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.240
[Guest]: Because you know, there is what economists call as a market failure, which is that, you

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:22.640
[Guest]: know, in a financial crisis, what happens to say one bank is going to have such a bad

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:29.440
[Guest]: influence all over the system, that or if a large number of firms fail, you know, the

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.000
[Guest]: recession or house foreclosures, they are all going to affect adversely the rest of

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
[Guest]: the economy.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.160
[Guest]: So there is a good theoretical rationale, and it works.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:43.600
[Guest]: What is not well appreciated is that, but there are conditions in which this begins

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:50.160
[Guest]: to start doing harm, because of political capture of the government presence in decision

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:56.480
[Guest]: making by, say, crony capitalists, second, they could just be outright short termism

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.600
[Guest]: on part of the governments.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:03.200
[Guest]: And third, there could be massive crowding out effects, including of the individualism

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.680
[Guest]: and entrepreneurial spirit, leave aside just higher borrowing costs for private sector

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.160
[Guest]: and so on.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:16.240
[Guest]: So I think what happens is that it's very appealing to describe these narratives as

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.240
[Guest]: one zero.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:23.760
[Guest]: So, you know, you find that individuals are either all entirely pro capitalism, or you

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.960
[Guest]: see individuals who are entirely pro socialism, and you know, everything being done by the

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960
[Guest]: government.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:37.520
[Guest]: But the reality is that what works best is if you are nimble about the state of the world,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:43.460
[Guest]: which is based on your economic conditions, how much balance you need to put between these

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.800
[Guest]: two extreme positions, because as we were discussing, clearly, in a financial crisis,

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.440
[Guest]: you need the government to actually backstop and get the system back up.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:54:00.480
[Guest]: But then there should be a graceful unwinding of the extra government imprint that got created.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:06.040
[Guest]: Now that second part is always missing whenever the governments are stepping up their positions,

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:12.720
[Guest]: you know, part of it is, you know, the fact that it's easy to sell a one zero idea than

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.800
[Guest]: to be nuanced and balanced and say, oh, we'll do this now.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.800
[Guest]: But you know, in three or five years, when things come down, we will, we will withdraw.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.240
[Guest]: Second very important constraint is that very often, the stimulus decisions are taken by

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.080
[Guest]: one government.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.960
[Guest]: And even if they were to put in place a decision to withdraw down the line, that is going to

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.440
[Guest]: have to be implemented by another government.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.200
[Guest]: Now, whatever the first government has announced may not be binding on the second government

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.440
[Guest]: for doing this.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:50.200
[Guest]: And you could also get this kind of then possibly a populist trap, which is that once one government

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.160
[Guest]: does this as a stimulus, the other governments want to keep on with it, because it allows

00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:01.240
[Guest]: them to continuously do the short term priming of the economy to show that they will look

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.240
[Guest]: good.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.720
[Guest]: So but I want to come back to the challenge.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720
[Guest]: What is the challenge?

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:11.000
[Guest]: The challenge to me is that we need to have a more balanced debate about these issues.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.240
[Guest]: Whenever the stimulus packages are announced, we need to simultaneously assess their costs.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.880
[Guest]: We need to think about their long run consequences.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:29.620
[Guest]: And we need a lot more discussion, transparency, accountability, in my view, of these packages.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:36.320
[Guest]: And conversely, sometimes, when you are too much in what looks like a capitalist society,

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:43.240
[Guest]: very often, seeds are being sown either for crony capitalism, or for banks and the financial

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:48.360
[Guest]: sectors taking on too much risk, which ultimately, the governments will have to backstop if the

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.020
[Guest]: entire system collapses, because you'll have to protect the depositors in the end.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.220
[Guest]: And so you also need to guard against that.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:00.080
[Guest]: And so it's all about, I think, striking the right balance.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:06.640
[Guest]: And you know, giving a balanced perspective is by and large not easy to gain popularity

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.960
[Guest]: with.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:13.960
[Guest]: And I think that's where I think so the challenge is that, from a political standpoint, I think

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:19.960
[Guest]: it is easy to give one zero narratives, because that creates more polarization, and might

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.800
[Guest]: give you enough median voter outcomes that are desirable for you.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:32.080
[Guest]: I think the job of the accountants, the think tanks, the economists, the policymakers, the

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.720
[Guest]: independent policymakers, the technocrats, I think their job, in my view, is to continue

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:43.320
[Guest]: to push the dialogue so that you make it clear, listen, it's not one zero, it's about striking

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.920
[Guest]: the right balance.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:50.760
[Guest]: And this balance shifts a little bit in different points of time, based on what kind of situation

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.960
[Guest]: in your banking crisis, yes, the central bank, and the government need to do more.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.480
[Guest]: But once you move away from that, the role of these two has to diminish.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.160
[Guest]: And you have to let the private sector flourish again, while recognizing that you don't want

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.080
[Guest]: sort of another full fledged financial crisis again.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:14.080
[Guest]: In some ways, actually, this is what financial stability to me is all about.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:21.000
[Guest]: It's about allowing the system to flourish privately, while safeguarding that in a stress

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.480
[Guest]: scenario, it will have the right levels of resistance.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.840
[Guest]: And so the if I could just end with an example here, which is the example I like a lot in

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:36.420
[Guest]: thinking about financial stability, and in general, this balance between market friendly

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:41.840
[Guest]: versus government centered policies is, is really about building a bridge.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:49.120
[Guest]: See, I think of financial sector as basically a bridge that carries savings from one shore

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.760
[Guest]: across to borrowers on the other side, you know, the bridge, artery, whatever you want

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.760
[Guest]: to call it.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:59.560
[Guest]: Now, how do the engineers approach the construction of the bridges?

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.800
[Guest]: So yeah, there are standards.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.880
[Guest]: And what are these standards?

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:08.760
[Guest]: The standards are that you should be able to withstand some fairly high cyclonic hurricane

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.760
[Guest]: kind of winds.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.720
[Guest]: Now, that is not the normal outcome.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:16.320
[Guest]: If you left a private constructor entirely to do this by themselves, they may not put

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.360
[Guest]: in the adequate number of trusses and extra robustness in the bridge.

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:27.720
[Guest]: But there are some protection or safety standards that ensure that when the situation is going

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:34.720
[Guest]: to be bad, and you still need the bridge to actually stand there, either to transport

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:40.040
[Guest]: that time itself or to be available right after the cyclone has gone away.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.320
[Guest]: You need that robustness investment to be made ahead of time.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.640
[Guest]: And my sense is that if we took this approach, which is that we let the system function most

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:57.160
[Guest]: of the time, with the individual's entrepreneurial spirit, but we create defenses, so that when

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.840
[Guest]: things go bad, the mop up by the governments, the central banks, etc, doesn't have to be

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:08.080
[Guest]: heavy handed, because you've already built so much robustness in the system, that it's

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.560
[Guest]: only in the very extreme wind conditions that the bridge might collapse, then of course,

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:17.160
[Guest]: you need to reconstruct, or that you will have to do minimal repairs, because actually

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.160
[Guest]: your bridge was so strong to start with.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.000
[Guest]: I think this is the shift in mindset that is required.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.080
[Guest]: It requires thinking long term.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:30.360
[Guest]: It requires entertaining stress scenarios that are not your present day challenge.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:36.240
[Guest]: And it requires making some sacrifices, you're going to have to increase the cost of production

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.240
[Guest]: of the bridge.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.480
[Guest]: It cannot be built as quickly as you thought would be built otherwise.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:48.480
[Guest]: But I very much see the role of the economists, think tanks, policy makers, analysts as so

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:54.760
[Guest]: important in the current times, when everyone is going for one zero narratives, that we

00:59:54.760 --> 01:00:00.280
[Guest]: need to bring the discussion towards it being about a better balance.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.880
[Guest]: And one that is based on the conditions and the needs of the economy at a given point

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.120
[Guest]: of time, without disregarding what will be the consequences of the policies you adopt

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120
[Guest]: now down the line.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm loving your metaphors in this episode, the heart and the arteries of bridge.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I thought, you know, when you said that, you know, you had one way of explaining

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.160
[Amit Varma]: this, I thought you're going to talk about Dravid's innings in that famous test in Headingley,

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.760
[Amit Varma]: where he saw out the new ball and made that phenomenal hundred on day one, partly with

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Sanjay Bangar and then the next day, Tendulkar and Ganguly made big hundreds.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.920
[Amit Varma]: And if you just look at the scorecard, it's like, okay, they all made hundreds, what's

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920
[Amit Varma]: a big deal.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.880
[Amit Varma]: But Dravid sort of weathered the storm and then the other guys thrived.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.880
[Amit Varma]: So with a bridge, I would say that for me, where that analogy kinds of falls apart is

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: that this particular bridge that you're talking about has so many moving parts, and all of

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.720
[Amit Varma]: them have their own incentives that it's just incredibly complex.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.280
[Amit Varma]: I guess no metaphor is perfect.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, before we, you know, get to the book and the, you know, the meat of our discussion

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.960
[Amit Varma]: today, a final digressive question, which again, comes from an aside in your book, I

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.760
[Amit Varma]: think, and also something you said a while back, where you were talking about your personal

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.920
[Amit Varma]: journey, and you pointed out how countries are sort of placed along this continuum.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And where a country is on the continuum can often shape how its people think about the

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.360
[Amit Varma]: world and their worldviews.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.240
[Amit Varma]: And one sort of, you know, thought that I've been sort of toying with for a long, long

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.040
[Amit Varma]: time is how institutions can shape a culture in very deep ways, like Jagdish Bhagwati had

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.840
[Amit Varma]: once, you know, I think in the year 2000, contrasted China and India and pointed out

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.480
[Amit Varma]: that look, China is profit seeking, India is rent seeking, there's a rent seeking mentality.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.080
[Amit Varma]: People don't think of how can I serve the other person and make some profit, they think

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.400
[Amit Varma]: about how can I exploit the person, how can I, you know, exploit the situation.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:55.580
[Amit Varma]: And my sense of why that is, and you know, it's a speculation, is that it is partly because

01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.440
[Amit Varma]: of our institutions, because of the way our government was set up over the last seven

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:06.320
[Amit Varma]: decades since independence that we are essentially a rent seeking society, the role of the state

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.480
[Amit Varma]: for much of this time has been vastly oversized.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the incentives for a person would always be that be part of the state

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.920
[Amit Varma]: be part of that entity that has a monopoly on violence and so much discretion.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's where you'll make the money.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And you know, within the book somewhere, again, I didn't mark that passage, so I don't remember

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.560
[Amit Varma]: the exact words, but you've similarly spoken about how the structures within the financial

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.880
[Amit Varma]: system can shape the culture and the attitudes of, you know, the players involved.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.760
[Guest]: What are your sort of thoughts on this?

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:44.440
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm, I'm very much a fan of this view, both parts of your question, one that it is

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:51.200
[Guest]: about institutions in the end, that the long term outcomes of the country, I'm a big, I

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:58.640
[Guest]: think I'm convinced by the research of Simoglu, Robinson, Fukuyama, and others that, you know,

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.080
[Guest]: in the end, countries that become like Denmark in their quality of living over a period of

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.360
[Guest]: time, and are able to offer that standard of living to its citizenry are countries where

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:16.240
[Guest]: institutions such as the rule of law, enforcement of contracts, sanctity of the elections, etc,

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240
[Guest]: are in good shape.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:22.360
[Guest]: In fact, in the A.D. Shroff Memorial Lecture, I, my attempt was to say that even a central

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:29.520
[Guest]: bank should actually be viewed as on the same pedestal as all these other institutions in

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.520
[Guest]: a democracy.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.960
[Guest]: It's an important part of checks and balances, just the way we would not want the Judiciary

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:43.240
[Guest]: or the Election Commission to be compromised in a democracy, we should also not want that,

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.840
[Guest]: you know, the central bank is actually compromised in its decision making just for the short

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:54.120
[Guest]: term populist gains of the ruling day government's environment, because that will keep the financial

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.760
[Guest]: sector policies anchored towards the long term stability.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:09.120
[Guest]: Now, turning that around, why is an institution of weak regulation or central banking a problem?

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.400
[Guest]: It is a problem exactly for the reasons you mentioned, because when the presence of the

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.240
[Guest]: state is large in the financial sector, so there are public sector banks, there's tremendous

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.880
[Guest]: presence in insurance, pension, non-bank finance, etc, so you know, they are all around, then

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.760
[Guest]: there is a constant tendency to lean on the central bank to make it easier for these entities

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.000
[Guest]: to survive in spite of their performance.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.800
[Guest]: There is also a constant pressure on the central bank to change the rules of the game, not

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.040
[Guest]: just central bank, I would say even other financial regulators, such as securities markets

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:51.520
[Guest]: regulator, insurance regulator, pension regulator, so that all of these public sector entities

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.320
[Guest]: in the financial sector, they are essentially all supporting the government's balance sheet

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.400
[Guest]: to be large, allowing their programs to be larger by channeling the savings that are

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:09.680
[Guest]: going from depositors, insurance premium payers, pensioners, etc, in one way or the other,

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.680
[Guest]: make it cheaper for the government to get its hands on to the savings compared to the

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680
[Guest]: private sector.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.520
[Guest]: Now, once the private sector is crowded out, they have a higher cost of borrowing, in general,

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.720
[Guest]: higher cost of capital, so they have to economize somewhere else, they can't compete that easily

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.600
[Guest]: because actually they have to generate high returns because their cost of capital is very

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600
[Guest]: high.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.800
[Guest]: So, they start looking for corners.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:40.000
[Guest]: In my view, this could be one of the reasons why the overall evasion culture builds up

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.460
[Guest]: in the country because you've actually, by state being so large, you are subjecting them

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.840
[Guest]: to such high required returns on their investments that they say, I have to figure out how to

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.960
[Guest]: optimize my taxes in a very, very massive way in order to generate some return to those

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.160
[Guest]: who are providing me capital.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
[Guest]: That's one.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.640
[Guest]: And then, they know that the state is present everywhere, not just in financial sector,

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.040
[Guest]: but even in some non-financial sector.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.820
[Guest]: Very often in countries where government is large, it is a reflection of this ideology

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.000
[Guest]: as we discussed, and they also start wanting to have to control decisions rather than making

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
[Guest]: it like a seamless processing of licensing and granting of permissions, etc.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.960
[Guest]: And then, you end up having to work with the government, so to speak, even the tech sector

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:36.200
[Guest]: firms in the country, my friends who are entrepreneurs, they tell me that they can't arrange physical

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.280
[Guest]: space for their offices without actually doing some gafla on the side with the municipalities

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.280
[Guest]: or whatever to get the land or get access to the property and so on.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:55.120
[Guest]: And then third, because you know that the state wants to be so large, you know that

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.000
[Guest]: there will be frequent interactions.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.080
[Guest]: And if you can just work with them to get a few decisions your way, maybe this could

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.760
[Guest]: be a very symbiotic relationship for that enterprise and the government, not necessarily

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.080
[Guest]: always to the benefit of the economy.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:21.000
[Guest]: And you get this sort of hyperactive consultations, lobbying, crony capitalism, etc., find a route.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.640
[Guest]: And I'm fully with Professor Bhagwati here, which is that the biggest corruption of the

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:35.200
[Guest]: society, because of the strong presence of the state, comes because it ultimately shifts

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:43.920
[Guest]: the focus away from value creation, entrepreneurship, and enterprise to rent-seeking, tax evasion

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:50.240
[Guest]: and essentially, you know, getting concessions from the government, which are out of line.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.880
[Guest]: I saw that culture when I was in India, I felt that many of our banks, financial firms

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:04.560
[Guest]: and industrialists, they are spending so much time interacting with the government offices,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:11.240
[Guest]: rather than actually focusing on their core businesses, thinking hard about their strategies,

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.180
[Guest]: etc., that it seemed like a complete waste.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:19.480
[Guest]: And this is the, going back to the Hayekian, Austrian thought of crowding out, I think

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.840
[Guest]: this is a very subtle form of crowding out of the economy's productivity.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.800
[Guest]: And this is the fear that I have.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.720
[Guest]: My fear is that as the state, we already have a large state, so to speak, in terms of its

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:39.080
[Guest]: presence in several sectors, in terms of its debt to GDP ratio, in terms of the fiscal

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.280
[Guest]: deficit amount that they have to borrow every year to meet their needs of their various

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280
[Guest]: expenditures.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280
[Guest]: It's already very large.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:53.960
[Guest]: If we don't reverse track, we really have to entertain the scenario of lost productivity,

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.720
[Guest]: crowding out of enterprise.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.120
[Guest]: And you know, this will cost us in the long run.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:08.960
[Guest]: So I think, as I was saying, without having referred to the Austrian economists very directly,

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.840
[Guest]: this is actually a deeper undercurrent of the book.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:21.400
[Guest]: And in fact, in my India book on government-sponsored enterprises in the United States, so we were

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.760
[Guest]: explaining the role played by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the mortgage debacle in the

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760
[Guest]: United States.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.920
[Guest]: I had an India version of the book, the book was called Guaranteed to Fail.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.040
[Guest]: In the India version, I had a chapter on India as to, you know, what are the lessons for

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:42.720
[Guest]: India from the failures of mortgages and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:49.600
[Guest]: And you know, there's a six-word proverb in Gujarati, you know, coming down from centuries,

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.360
[Guest]: I guess, which I think has taught me more economics than anything else.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.160
[Guest]: And it goes as, jya raja vyapari, ya praja bhikari.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:07.960
[Guest]: And you know, it's such a deep saying, whoever wrote this is, in my mind, one of the greatest

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.560
[Guest]: economists to have ever existed on the terra firma.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.480
[Guest]: And it is so deep because there are so many shades to how this becomes true.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.720
[Guest]: That when the government or the king is trying to be a trader and be in the business itself,

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.960
[Guest]: ultimately, you end up with people in poverty and being beggars.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.840
[Guest]: And there are so many channels through which this arises and it does, I have found it so

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.840
[Guest]: thought provoking.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.160
[Guest]: By the way, this was also taught to me by my teacher, Shailesh Shastri, who I mentioned,

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.280
[Guest]: he was the one who told me this.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.400
[Guest]: Of course, as a student, I had no understanding as to how deep this message is.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.280
[Guest]: You got some idea, you know, in Amar Chitra Ghata, there were these kings and, you know,

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.560
[Guest]: they were not ruling their citizens very well.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.440
[Guest]: But it was only when I started doing economics that I realized, oh, there was such a wealth

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.680
[Guest]: of wisdom and knowledge in this.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.680
[Guest]: And I think that we have to worry about this outcome.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.340
[Guest]: And in the book, I tried to explain this in the previous chapter, if I could just finish

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.720
[Guest]: with that thought, which is that, you know, I refer to this concept of fiscal dominance,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.960
[Guest]: which is that the government is becoming too overbearing in its control over financial

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960
[Guest]: sector policies.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.400
[Guest]: And it's important to understand why this is shifting over time.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.280
[Guest]: Because I think, if you don't understand these shifts over time, you will not understand

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.840
[Guest]: what are the root causes of the problem, you will not get the diagnosis right.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.720
[Guest]: I think the shift is happening because we were first a nationalized country.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.560
[Guest]: So, you know, in 70s and 80s, it didn't matter if you controlled the financial sector via

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.880
[Guest]: the government, because there was no private sector to speak of for all practical purposes.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.960
[Guest]: Then we liberalized, because we had no choice, we failed as a centralized nation, we were

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.160
[Guest]: at IMF, and you know, they required us to undergo structural packages.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.560
[Guest]: So then we, you know, there was a coincidence of politics and economics, we got the right

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.280
[Guest]: changes through.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.320
[Guest]: And for about 16-17 years, we were good with that also, the global growth was good and

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320
[Guest]: so on.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.400
[Guest]: But in this global financial crisis, global growth slowed down.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.320
[Guest]: And we had already reaped some of the low hanging fruits of the 90s reforms.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.280
[Guest]: And now we needed actually a next set.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.160
[Guest]: And I think this is where we stumbled.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.800
[Guest]: For the next 10-12 years, instead of actually moving the economy towards a more liberalized

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:48.400
[Guest]: state, more undertaking greater divestments of the governments where it had not yet divested,

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.320
[Guest]: we have adopted, I would say, a hodgepodge of policies.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.800
[Guest]: Some have tended to liberalize, but many have also regressed in terms of increasing the

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800
[Guest]: state control.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.760
[Guest]: There have been attempts to directly control the financial sector outcomes through bank

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.880
[Guest]: lending decisions, attempts to control the central bank policies, etc.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:16.360
[Guest]: And I think it is because of these growth slowdown, the demand in the narrative for

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.680
[Guest]: the government to start playing a bigger role, governments approaching it myopically, rather

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.760
[Guest]: than factoring in the long run costs of excessive state control, that we are now seeing a gradual

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.520
[Guest]: shift over 10-12 years in this direction.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:39.160
[Guest]: Part of the book is written because I want us to reconsider whether this shift that we

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:48.080
[Guest]: are experiencing, away from our liberalization divestment paradigm of 90s, back towards centralization

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.200
[Guest]: and more control of policies and regulations.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.200
[Guest]: Is this really what we want to do?

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.240
[Guest]: We want to go back to the 70s and 80s-style India?

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:05.640
[Guest]: The fear is that we end up with the same levels of rate of growth, rather than actually realizing

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:12.680
[Guest]: the 8-9% that our kind of demographics and youth aspirations command and demand.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, despite the fact that you sometimes say that there is a bird of optimism within

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.280
[Amit Varma]: you, that's a pretty sort of worrying note.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, while you were sort of speaking, I remembered an episode I'd done with a friend

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.700
[Amit Varma]: of mine on restaurant regulations, and he was a restauranteur, which perfectly illustrates

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.600
[Amit Varma]: what you said about the role of the state, where he pointed out that when he ran a restaurant

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.560
[Amit Varma]: and he used to run one in Bangalore, that he realized that there were two conflicting

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
[Amit Varma]: regulations.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.240
[Amit Varma]: The excise department, because they wanted to monitor the alcohol that was going into

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.200
[Amit Varma]: the restaurant, insisted that there be only one entry into the restaurant.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And the fire department, for safety reasons, insisted that there be multiple doors.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.280
[Amit Varma]: So the poor guy, no matter what he does, he's breaking the law.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.840
[Amit Varma]: And he's giving out at least one bribe every month, possibly two.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, other businessmen have told me that they give up to 30-40 bribes a month.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.400
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like you keep one person just for sort of dealing with bribes and doing

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.400
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.720
[Amit Varma]: And you've got a great illustration of how this kind of thinking can seep into the culture

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.800
[Amit Varma]: in your book, where, you know, you've pointed out at one point that you've spoken about

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.680
[Amit Varma]: the tech industry and the pharma industry and said, look at the entrepreneurial spirit.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's because they're relatively lightly regulated.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.160
[Amit Varma]: But you said as far as a brick and mortar industries are concerned, you used to have

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.160
[Amit Varma]: a file called, Allah ke naam pe de de baba, because they would most often be writing,

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.880
[Amit Varma]: asking for, you know, restructuring bad loans or evergreening bad loans and so on and so

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880
[Amit Varma]: forth.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And would that be an example of how the culture can shift?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Because then if there are industries which are structurally like that, then that will

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.400
[Amit Varma]: attract a certain kind of person and repel another kind of person and they're exactly

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400
[Amit Varma]: the wrong outcomes.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.200
[Guest]: In fact, at my farewell speech at the Reserve Bank of India, this is exactly what I said.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.880
[Guest]: I didn't describe our quest as necessarily one of just restoring financial stability.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:08.960
[Guest]: I described the quest as one of trying to convert the India businesses from a rent extraction

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.400
[Guest]: society towards more of a value creation society, which is, you know, we need to shift the thinking

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:21.760
[Guest]: where the way you generate value is not by gold plating and getting your loan gold plated

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.560
[Guest]: and then over borrowing and then defaulting and then siphoning of the fund somewhere.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.280
[Guest]: The way you create value is by actually genuinely designing new products, setting up thriving

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:37.520
[Guest]: enterprises for the long run, repaying the loans and the borrowings you have undertaken,

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.000
[Guest]: and yet be creating a lot of value for yourself and for the society as a whole.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.480
[Guest]: Because when you create value, you are solving some genuine economic problem on the ground

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.440
[Guest]: for the citizens.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.080
[Guest]: And I think we need a very significant shift in this culture.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:59.120
[Guest]: It is a very complex problem because it is partly because of the overarching presence

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:07.000
[Guest]: of the state, both in certain sectors as well as in the financial sector, that has prevented

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.640
[Guest]: actually laying down a set of rules through which risk taking is supported.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.560
[Guest]: But it is with the right due diligence, monitoring and collection skills, especially at our public

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.200
[Guest]: sector banks.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.960
[Guest]: And to do that, why is that?

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.320
[Guest]: Because if you want the banks to lend well, then it has to be the case that when they

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.960
[Guest]: don't lend well, there have to be consequences, because that has got to be the most important

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.960
[Guest]: disciplining factor on these banks.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.320
[Guest]: Now, what has happened with public sector banks is that neither is there any significant

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.360
[Guest]: penalty for not lending well, because there is the support of the state implicitly in

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.200
[Guest]: one form or the other.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:57.160
[Guest]: And the bank regulation has been compromised again and again and again, so that the government,

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:02.200
[Guest]: which is the ultimate principal shareholder, also doesn't have to bear immediate consequences

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.240
[Guest]: of actually chipping in capital to these banks that have not done well.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:13.240
[Guest]: Now, the sum total of all this is that public sector banks have become a quote unquote vehicle

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:19.080
[Guest]: through which the rent extraction by the brick and mortar industries has taken place in the

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080
[Guest]: country.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.680
[Guest]: Now, it need not just be at the brick and mortar industry level.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.240
[Guest]: Suppose you keep encouraging public sector banks to lend to micro, small and medium sized

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.120
[Guest]: enterprises or to make the mudra loans, but these are not made well.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.880
[Guest]: Then once again, the taxpayers as a whole are simply doing a transfer to one segment

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.000
[Guest]: of the society which is getting freebies without actually having the capacity to repay these

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
[Guest]: loans.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:55.200
[Guest]: So, I think we are in need of a very fundamental reshift of the financial sector regulation,

01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:01.480
[Guest]: so that those who bear the risks are made to pay for them.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.480
[Guest]: And only if you make them pay for these risks, will they actually make the right decision

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.280
[Guest]: to allocate capital judiciously.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:15.300
[Guest]: Once capital is being allocated judiciously, businesses will have no choice but to actually

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.880
[Guest]: go and come up with better value propositions.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.920
[Guest]: And once they have better value propositions, we will get more enterprise, more thriving

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:29.600
[Guest]: environments, more employment in these traditional sectors, which do not seem to be exactly as

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.760
[Guest]: you said, doing as well as our tech and pharma sector.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.520
[Guest]: And I think it is a great example because see, tech and pharma is not that reliant on

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.520
[Guest]: bank finance.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:47.800
[Guest]: They are very heavily reliant either on market finance or actually on just equity investments.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.480
[Guest]: And you know, a lot of it is actually in the form of foreign direct investments from abroad.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.120
[Guest]: And just look at the number of unicorns we are creating in the tech space.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.400
[Guest]: It's very, very impressive.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:03.520
[Guest]: And you can see the shift when we came out of IIT Bombay in 95, we didn't have so much

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.320
[Guest]: entrepreneurship in us, because there was nothing happening that much on the ground.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.480
[Guest]: It was still the beginning of the tech era in India.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.440
[Guest]: You go to an IIT now and you look at the entrepreneurship in the youth, they all want to set up their

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440
[Guest]: own businesses.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.440
[Guest]: Why?

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.560
[Guest]: Because they see that it can be done on ground.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:28.680
[Guest]: And you know, somehow, fortunately, at least in the tech space, we have not overregulated

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.840
[Guest]: the space.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.360
[Guest]: It's managing to do well.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:36.440
[Guest]: There is one criticism that it hasn't created as much products of its own.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.760
[Guest]: But I think now gradually through the sharing economy, maybe even that is changing a little

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.760
[Guest]: bit.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.120
[Guest]: I think maybe the newer apps which are getting developed in India, they are more to serve

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:54.720
[Guest]: the local needs of the Indians rather than just to be the outsourcing office of the rest

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.720
[Guest]: of the world.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:01.720
[Guest]: So I think that's a good contrast we observe between brick and mortar and the tech space.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:07.400
[Guest]: And I hope that we can really fix the bank lending in a significant way.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:12.880
[Guest]: And that's why Dr. Raghuram Rajan and I, we have actually just released a piece last week,

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.880
[Guest]: Indian banks, a time to reform where we are actually laying out a full blueprint of also

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.080
[Guest]: how to improve the lending decisions, the monitoring, the providing for the risks, especially

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.160
[Guest]: at the public sector banks, and how over a period of time to improve their governance

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.240
[Guest]: and change their ownership structure.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.600
[Amit Varma]: That's quite insightful and wonderful.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And once we come back to it, I promise our listeners that we'll get to the meat of the

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.760
[Amit Varma]: matter, which is, you know, firstly, Dr. Acharya's experiences in the Reserve Bank of India and

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.560
[Amit Varma]: then the whole notion of fiscal dominance, which he calls a theory of everything in India,

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.080
[Amit Varma]: which I found very convincing and couldn't agree more with.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.400
[Amit Varma]: So after a brief commercial break.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.960
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive sum games.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.960
[Amit Varma]: Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty, and you love fine art, I have a win win proposition

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960

[Amit Varma]: And if you're missing your friends in these lockdown days, worry not, you can show them

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.040
[Amit Varma]: you're thinking of them by buying gifts for them from Indiancolors.

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Veeral Acharya about his time at the RBI and about fiscal dominance,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:23.360
[Amit Varma]: which is a concept he explains in great detail and quite beautifully, you know, very often

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:29.440
[Amit Varma]: in my show, one of the sort of recurring themes in my show is sort of the shifting relationship

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.560
[Amit Varma]: between the state and society.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And I often kind of point out that, you know, if you look at the incentives of the state,

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.540
[Amit Varma]: it's not the welfare of society, it's the welfare of the state itself.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's an interesting dynamic.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.100
[Amit Varma]: But the state, of course, is not a monolithic beast.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.880
[Amit Varma]: There are many moving parts within the state, which sort of have different functions and

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.720
[Amit Varma]: their own kind of relationships with each other.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.200
[Amit Varma]: And central to the way our economy works, our financial system works, is the relationship

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.340
[Amit Varma]: between the government and the central bank.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:06.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what conceptually it should be, why it should be that, and what

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:13.360
[Amit Varma]: are the sort of forces which then create a conflict in that get in the way of that ideal

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.720
[Guest]: state of being?

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.800
[Guest]: Yes.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.760
[Guest]: So the way I see it is that, you know, the financial sector, as we discussed, is the

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:31.400
[Guest]: lifeblood of the economy, and you basically need a heart to regulate that flow.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:37.600
[Guest]: And you know, the central bank is sort of that controlling agency, it through its various

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:44.280
[Guest]: controls, essentially controls indirectly the pumping of the lifeblood to the rest of

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.280
[Guest]: the economy.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.960
[Guest]: Now, you know, to give a very simple analogy, again, you know, people say that when your

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:58.480
[Guest]: mind and heart start intermingling with each other, you get very serious problems in life.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.920
[Guest]: And this is one way that I think about the government and the central bank in my analogy,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:10.240
[Guest]: which is that in matters of heart, sometimes one has to keep the mind a little bit separate

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.040
[Guest]: and in matters of the mind, sometimes one has to keep the heart a little bit outside.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.160
[Unknown]: And why is that desirable?

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:24.480
[Guest]: It's desirable because in the blueprint of the economy, so to speak, you know, the government

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:31.980
[Guest]: is actually, interestingly, constitutes what the elected officials are, they are the ones

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:37.720
[Guest]: who should take essentially any decisions that has direct tax implications, sort of

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.940
[Guest]: what one might call as fiscal implications.

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:48.080
[Guest]: In contrast, the central bank is more of a technocratic office, and it should ideally

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:54.560
[Guest]: not take decisions which are of direct fiscal in nature, it should take more these functions

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.320
[Guest]: which are regulatory in nature.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:04.280
[Guest]: Now, clearly, however, if I'm putting the central bank on the same pedestal as the judiciary

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:10.480
[Guest]: or the Election Commission, and in my analogy, giving it the analogy of being as important

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:17.280
[Guest]: as the heart in the body, really, one has to think about, you know, how it's supposed

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.640
[Guest]: to function in the design of the economy as a whole.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:30.160
[Guest]: So, and it's very important, it's very central, and therefore, it has a lot of power.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.840
[Guest]: So Paul Tucker, one of the former central banker from Bank of England, he calls this

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.320
[Guest]: the unelected power, that the central bankers have tremendous power, but it is the unelected

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
[Guest]: power.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:49.040
[Guest]: So, how should such technocratic power work in a society?

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.920
[Guest]: And to me, the right framework is that its objectives should be spelled out.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:59.840
[Guest]: So, it should be made very clear what it is that you're supposed to try and attain.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.360
[Guest]: Its tools should be very well spelled out.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.000
[Guest]: And I'll give specific examples of each of these.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.280
[Guest]: And then there should be democratic accountability around the attainment of objectives and the

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.000
[Guest]: exercise of the tools that were given to it.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.800
[Guest]: So take a very specific example, a central bank is supposed to guard the interests of

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.160
[Guest]: the deposits in the banking system.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.560
[Guest]: What are the tools given to it?

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.480
[Guest]: The tools given to it are the supervisory and the regulatory tools.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.040
[Guest]: And then, you know, it can be held account by seeing whether the deposit insurance fund

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.800
[Guest]: is ever running out of funds or not.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:49.040
[Guest]: Is it able to ensure that the system is able to pay for the safety of the deposits that

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.120
[Guest]: it is providing?

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.280
[Guest]: The most common one where the greatest amount of transparency is there in the central bank

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.640
[Guest]: objective is actually the price stability or the inflation targeting framework.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.760
[Guest]: Here a central bank is given a very specific target, say, around the consumer price index

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.760
[Guest]: in India.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.080
[Guest]: It's to maintain it at 4 percent with a band of plus minus 2 percent.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.320
[Guest]: And while paying attention to growth being a caveat in the objective.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.200
[Guest]: The tool given is the central bank policy rate, the rate at which it lends to banks

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.560
[Guest]: in the overnight markets.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.200
[Guest]: And as democratic accountability, there is a committee that makes this decision.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.680
[Guest]: The appointments are, of course, made by the government.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:39.320
[Guest]: The committee, each member has to give transparent minutes as to why they voted to increase,

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.440
[Guest]: decrease or keep the rates where they were.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.600
[Guest]: These minutes are published, they are scrutinized, analyzed.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.720
[Guest]: And if the central bank fails to maintain inflation within the band of 2 percent to

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.680
[Guest]: 6 percent for three quarters in a row, it has to give a testimony to the parliament

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:02.000
[Guest]: as to why, what factors led to not attaining this objective.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.840
[Guest]: So, to me, this is the right way to organize the system, which is you give the central

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.160
[Guest]: bank a very clear mandate.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.560
[Guest]: You tell what are the tools.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.400
[Guest]: You can allow for discretion, but specify that discretion.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.000
[Guest]: And I think when discretion is exercised, the central bank should be required to explain

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.920
[Guest]: why it is that I had to exercise the discretion.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.880
[Guest]: What are the exceptional circumstances?

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.000
[Guest]: Is my discretion temporary or do I expect it to be there for a while?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.480
[Guest]: Because I've exercised this discretion, what are the expected outcomes and what may be

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.560
[Guest]: the unintended consequences?

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:47.160
[Guest]: Now, this, I would say, is a reasonable democratic accountability process where you give power

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:53.600
[Guest]: to unelected representatives or the technocrats, but within a certain framework.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:01.160
[Guest]: Now, of course, sometimes these frameworks change, you know, we are constantly learning.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:07.480
[Guest]: The needs of the economy are changing, the financial sectors, technology actually keeps

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:13.120
[Guest]: changing the way they are doing intermediation and credit lending keeps changing, newer forms

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:18.360
[Guest]: of financial firms keep arising, earlier it just used to be traditional banks, then you

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.480
[Guest]: had banks, which also started playing in markets.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.280
[Guest]: And now we have very large non-bank finance companies also.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:34.480
[Guest]: But the whole idea to me, and I think this is a bit of a novel nuance into the literature

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:41.200
[Guest]: on central banking itself, to me, an important function of keeping an arm's length between

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.680
[Guest]: the government and the central bank is so that the short term pressures that are there

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.960
[Guest]: on the government during electoral cycles, the world over, not just in India, but the

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:57.840
[Guest]: world over there are short term electoral pressures, that those pressures don't compromise

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.400
[Guest]: the functioning of the heart of the economy.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:08.480
[Guest]: You want to keep an arm's length, because you want the central bank to be continuously

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.400
[Guest]: focused on its long term objectives.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.120
[Guest]: You have appointed the technocrats to run this job, you have given them the tools, they

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:21.760
[Guest]: can factor in the relative importance of the short term versus the long term.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.120
[Guest]: And if they fail in their mandate, they will be held democratically accountable, if they

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.200
[Guest]: have to explain to the parliament why they failed, if they're always explaining through

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.920
[Guest]: reports why these changes were made.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:40.480
[Guest]: Now, this kind of an arrangement is important because it will prevent what is called as

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.040
[Guest]: fiscal dominance.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.520
[Guest]: And what is fiscal dominance?

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.880
[Guest]: Fiscal dominance is when for short term pressures, the governments want to pump prime the economy's

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:56.560
[Guest]: growth or because they have borrowed so much, they want the central bank to be focused on

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:02.920
[Guest]: helping the government roll over its debts at the expense of its long run objectives.

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.840
[Guest]: So fiscal dominance, the reason why it's called dominance is because you're trying to distract

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:14.400
[Guest]: the central bank from what is its otherwise understood functions, and instead focus too

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:19.800
[Guest]: closely on the government's immediate needs and objectives.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:26.360
[Guest]: And the idea is that you have to tie your hands in advance, because when governments

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:32.160
[Guest]: do too much that is in the short term interest of the economy, they leave a massive legacy

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.920
[Guest]: of problems down the line.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:39.240
[Guest]: Take the example of subprime lending in the United States.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:46.360
[Guest]: It was basically to make up for lack of adequate jobs and stimulus on the ground.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:52.200
[Guest]: And you know, the system had to witness a massive financial crisis, you know, over time,

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:57.120
[Guest]: government foray into subprime lending combined with private sectors foray into subprime lending,

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.160
[Guest]: and you know, it became a perfect storm at some point.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:06.820
[Guest]: Look at the fiscal stimulus in India of 2009 to 12, you know, we have still not cleaned

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.600
[Guest]: up the mess.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:14.080
[Guest]: Many of our defaulted borrowers from that time are still not fully resolved.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.160
[Guest]: Bank losses are still not 100% fully recognized.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:23.560
[Guest]: And you know, time doesn't wait for you, new shocks come and start hitting the economy.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:30.520
[Guest]: So the idea of keeping the central bank separate from the government is that you allow the

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:37.400
[Guest]: central bank with all this democratic accountability framework to be run by technocrats who can

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.620
[Guest]: remain at arm's length and constantly focus on the long term.

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:47.760
[Guest]: And so it's basically the government trying to do as the elected representatives of the

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.720
[Guest]: citizens what they think is the right, but you recognize ahead of time that they will

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.960
[Guest]: be subject to short term pressures, especially around the electoral cycles.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:05.260
[Guest]: And you don't want the entire engine to fail down the line, because you pay too much attention

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.720
[Guest]: to this short term pressures.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.280
[Guest]: And so you have to strike this balance in the independence or the operational autonomy

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.280
[Guest]: of the central bank.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:19.320
[Guest]: And an important point to make here is that the Reserve Bank of India is an all purpose

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.320
[Guest]: central bank.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.880
[Guest]: And this is one important point I want to convey.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.480
[Guest]: It's safeguarding deposits because it runs the deposit insurance fund.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:33.040
[Guest]: It is the debt manager for the government, so it places government's debt.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.440
[Guest]: It controls the regulations of the debt markets and the currency markets.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:44.200
[Guest]: It's supposed to manage the external sector, so safeguard against sharp volatility or depreciations

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.840
[Guest]: in the value of the rupee.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.320
[Guest]: It is in charge of the interest rate setting process, so it affects the cost of borrowing

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320
[Guest]: in the economy.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:35:00.160
[Guest]: And it also controls the liquidity framework in the sense of how much reserves are being

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.560
[Guest]: made available in the country to banks in order to help them manage transfers of liquidity

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560
[Guest]: in the system.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.360
[Guest]: Now, with all these functions concentrated, and contrast this with, say, United States,

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:20.640
[Guest]: where say the deposit insurance is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, supervision

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.960
[Guest]: is partly with the Federal Reserve, but it's partly with OCC, the Office of Comptroller

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.120
[Guest]: of Currency and so on.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:36.640
[Guest]: With so many functions in one institution, and with the simultaneous presence of public

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:43.840
[Guest]: sector banks, government controlled insurance companies, pension funds, power finance companies,

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:50.240
[Guest]: etc., the scope of fiscal dominance in India is very large.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:57.280
[Guest]: It can permeate almost all policies of the financial sector very quickly if the central

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.520
[Guest]: bank is essentially compromised.

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:06.520
[Guest]: And a part of the explanation in the preface chapter, and I'm, of course, partly exaggerating

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.120
[Guest]: when I call it a theory of everything in India, but my sense is it's only a slight exaggeration

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.620
[Guest]: as far as the financial sector is concerned, because I give the six examples one after

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:23.640
[Guest]: the other of the pressure points, of how many pressure points kept coming up as eyewitness

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:31.640
[Guest]: during my term of the center trying to influence the policies of the central bank without it

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:41.000
[Guest]: being clearly laid out through public discussion, public reports, research, facts, data, as

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.400
[Guest]: to whether this is in the long run interest of the economy.

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.440
[Guest]: And you know, it can get done through backdoor compromises.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.300
[Guest]: It can get done through what I call as phone central banking.

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:57.560
[Guest]: It can be done through choice of the specific board members who are being appointed on the

01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.000
[Guest]: board of the central bank.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.840
[Guest]: And essentially, if the central bank is not functioning with a rule based decision making

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:14.680
[Guest]: system, where any exceptions are very transparently explained through reports as to why we are

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.400
[Guest]: engaging in this exception, what is the sunset clause, when will it end?

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.920
[Guest]: What are the intended consequences, unintended consequences?

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.800
[Guest]: It becomes too easy to start these compromises.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:32.300
[Guest]: You know, no one wants to have a confrontation every other day with the government.

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:36.960
[Guest]: And so you start hoping that, oh, if you make this one or two compromises, maybe things

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.960
[Guest]: will subside.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.440
[Guest]: You know, you can call it politicking, whatever you want to call it, but at the end of the

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.240
[Guest]: day, it is an erosion of the operational autonomy and independence of the central bank.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.940
[Guest]: And what is misunderstood, in my view, by the central bankers when fiscal dominance

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:58.440
[Guest]: is very strong, because the government balance sheet is very large, it's experiencing debt

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:05.320
[Guest]: problems on a regular basis in terms of costs of borrowing in the markets, its banks, public

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.240
[Guest]: sector banks are not in great shape, etc.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:14.320
[Guest]: Is that when the dominance becomes so strong, whatever you compromise today is the beginning

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.600
[Guest]: of a new compromise tomorrow.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.960
[Guest]: It's not a ceasefire, because the underlying problem, as long as the underlying problem

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.280
[Guest]: doesn't go away, they're going to wake up with that problem every other day, and then

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.680
[Guest]: try to put pressure on the central bank to accommodate.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680
[Guest]: Why?

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.200
[Guest]: Because if the central bank accommodates, these long run objectives can be kicked down

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:40.000
[Guest]: the road, and you get like the short term adjustments that the government needs.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.240
[Guest]: Now, two points are important here.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.320
[Guest]: Sometimes it is seen that this is primarily a criticism about the government.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.860
[Guest]: And that's not what it's meant to be.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:39:00.000
[Guest]: Fiscal dominance comes about because the institutional underpinning of the central banking is weak.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.680
[Guest]: The way it goes about its decision making rules is somewhat weak.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.920
[Guest]: Now, both parties are in a way responsible for it.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:13.920
[Guest]: Of course, the letter of the law is with the government as to what institutional independence

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.240
[Guest]: is given to the central bank by the acts.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.640
[Guest]: And as Dr. Reddy explains in his masterful forward in my book, RBI has one of the weakest

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.680
[Guest]: acts governing it in terms of the operational autonomy.

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.680
[Guest]: But the second point is that there is a difference between the de jure and the de facto, what

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.820
[Guest]: is in the letter of the law and what is in effect.

01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:40.640
[Guest]: What comes about in effect is also partly a function of how central bank goes about

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.720
[Guest]: its own decision making.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.940
[Guest]: And in my view, if the central bank uses rule based decision making, pushes for rule based

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.940
[Guest]: decision making.

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:52.040
[Guest]: Inflation targeting framework didn't come about by itself.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.760
[Guest]: The central bank governors, Governor Rajan and Governor Patel had to push for it, for

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.760
[Guest]: this to happen.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:04.160
[Guest]: Of course, Governor Patel was a deputy governor at that point of time when the framework was

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.160
[Guest]: adopted.

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:10.680
[Guest]: So, they have to push for this, they have to be willing to speak truth to the power,

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.840
[Guest]: because you have to shift the debate towards the long run of the economy when electoral

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.560
[Guest]: pressures are pushing them otherwise.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.560
[Guest]: They have to be willing to say no to certain outcomes.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:29.040
[Guest]: They have to be willing to communicate and have a public engagement about these issues

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.400
[Guest]: along the line, because you have to shift the public opinion and not just the opinion

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:41.480
[Guest]: of the political system or of the system, the financial system around the central bank.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.340
[Guest]: And finally, it requires unfortunately playing the game of chicken sometimes.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:51.120
[Guest]: You have to not give in to the first compromise pressure that gets put on you.

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:58.560
[Guest]: So, I give the example of Paul Walker, the late governor of the Federal Reserve, where

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.880
[Guest]: you know, once the Reagan administration came to power, they had a very expansionary manifesto,

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:10.240
[Guest]: they wanted to cut taxes and, you know, turbocharge the economy that way.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.120
[Guest]: And Paul Walker had just arrested double digit inflation.

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.840
[Guest]: He said, I can't do this.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.500
[Guest]: I won't be able to keep the rates low simply to fund your fiscal stimulus because the long

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:25.360
[Guest]: end of the yield curve is already rising and telling you that this is going to be inflationary

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.360
[Guest]: and I have just arrested inflation.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:33.840
[Guest]: He had private meetings, backdoor compromises were sought, now he has openly disclosed that

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.240
[Guest]: and he didn't give in at all.

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:41.920
[Guest]: And you know, he won the day because President Reagan in the end didn't adopt as expansionary

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920
[Guest]: a manifesto.

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.840
[Guest]: The yield curve actually didn't get worse in terms of the long term costs of borrowing

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.760
[Guest]: for the US government and inflation was actually kept at bay.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.160
[Guest]: So, it requires a certain amount of obduracy and doggedness.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.080
[Guest]: Now, of course, at times the fiscal dominance pressures can be so high that the central

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:08.680
[Guest]: bankers may be left with no choice and, you know, then you have to see what to do about

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:09.680
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.800
[Amit Varma]: So, I have a broader sort of two part question here and they both arise from what you have

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.800
[Amit Varma]: just described this complex relationship and one part is philosophical and the other part

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800
[Amit Varma]: is practical.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, we often speak about the rules of the game, but it strikes me that what we

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.240
[Amit Varma]: have here is really two games, not one.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.800
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, you've in the past made, you know, you've used test cricket as a metaphor

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.160
[Amit Varma]: that the central bank should be like a test cricketer, you're looking at the long term

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.480
[Amit Varma]: and the way it strikes me is that the game of governance, not just central banking, the

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:44.520
[Amit Varma]: game of good governance or keeping a nation going is a long term game where policies take

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:48.360
[Amit Varma]: a long, long time to play out, you have to think of the long term, but the game of politics

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:53.200
[Amit Varma]: is like T20 cricket, it's a short term game where politicians constantly have the imperative

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.000
[Amit Varma]: of the next election upon them and, you know, even when a general election is just over,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.920
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't mean the next election is five years away, because there are state elections

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:01.920
[Amit Varma]: all the time.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.700
[Amit Varma]: So you're constantly sort of in campaigning mode.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And there is a conflict between these two.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.120
[Amit Varma]: And some could even say it's a conflict between a democracy and a republic that when we talk

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.480
[Amit Varma]: about a country being a democratic republic, is it really one thing, you know, and that's

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.680
[Amit Varma]: a fundamental conflict.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, at a philosophical level, here is where the issue is, I don't see how you square the

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.440
[Amit Varma]: circle, because the argument that politicians will often make is an argument of legitimacy,

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.920
[Amit Varma]: where they will say that, listen, we are a democracy, we've got an elect, we've got the

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.760
[Amit Varma]: popular mandate, we are legitimate, why should we listen to unelected, unaccountable elites,

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.400
[Amit Varma]: they should do what we tell them.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, that becomes, you know, one argument, whereas, you know, whatever you may say, or

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.400
[Amit Varma]: I may say, or even you may say, as somebody in the Reserve Bank, it could just be what

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.600
[Amit Varma]: is your legitimacy, you're not elected.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.840
[Amit Varma]: So I think, at a philosophical level, that is a circle that needs to be squared.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.360
[Amit Varma]: And at a practical level, it then strikes me that isn't the erosion of institutions

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:08.320
[Amit Varma]: over the long run, always inevitable, because of, you know, what we've seen the pattern

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:14.720
[Amit Varma]: of populism, not just in modern times with, you know, people like Erdogan and Modi and

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Orban and so on.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:23.200
[Amit Varma]: But the pattern of populist throughout history is to rail against unelected elites and destroy

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.200
[Amit Varma]: institutions.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.680
[Amit Varma]: And given that, even if for a long time, you might have an equilibrium, where there is

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.000
[Amit Varma]: a certain respectful relationship between a central bank and a government, you know,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:40.920
[Amit Varma]: isn't erosion inevitable on the incentives of politics, towards sort of ensuring that

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:44.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of erosion, because then you know, the less powerful the institutions get, the more

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.480
[Amit Varma]: powerful the government of the day is.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, an example of that could simply be that, look, they control the appointments.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's in me, it almost seems remarkable that, you know, people like Dr. Rajan and

01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.380
[Amit Varma]: Dr. Patel, and you happen to work in the central bank and took the stands you did.

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.560
[Amit Varma]: But I don't see why that should not be an outlier.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.280
[Amit Varma]: It's so easy for a government just to put its, I mean, I'm not making a comment on the

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.680
[Amit Varma]: current incumbent, but it's so easy for a government to just put its own people in any

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.720
[Amit Varma]: institution, not necessarily just the RBI alone.

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, degrade it.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And this is something like at a philosophical level, of course, I'm looking forward to your

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360
[Amit Varma]: answer.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.120
[Amit Varma]: But even at a practical level, you've been in the thick of things, you've actually grappled

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.120
[Amit Varma]: with it.

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your experience, you know, in that process.

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.720
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a it's a complex question with many shades.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:40.520
[Guest]: So let me try and see if I can do justice to it by breaking it up into certain parts,

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.680
[Guest]: I would say.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.400
[Guest]: So firstly, I agree that, see, at the end of the day, they control the appointment,

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.200
[Guest]: the government controls the appointments.

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.560
[Guest]: And to me, that's why I think once they have made the appointments, and then the framework

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.880
[Guest]: is in place, they have to let go at that point, because, you know, the system is already giving

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.280
[Guest]: you the rights to appoint the people.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.920
[Guest]: And so, you know, you can factor in whatever considerations you have.

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:12.200
[Guest]: And that's what I feel that when your own elected officials are resisting the pressures

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:17.200
[Guest]: being imposed on them, it's more likely that it's actually because you are trying to do

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.320
[Guest]: something that's more in the short term interests for your electoral cycle outcomes rather than

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:25.760
[Guest]: in the long run interest of the economy.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:32.280
[Guest]: Second, see, once a reasonable person has been put into these positions, such as, say,

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:39.320
[Guest]: being the governor of a central bank, they will feel a mental responsibility to stick

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:47.800
[Guest]: to the letter of the law, what is constitutionally and through the RBI acts, etc, being required

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.240
[Guest]: for them to perform as their functions.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.640
[Guest]: The system has been run very, very well by people of very, very high integrity.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:02.720
[Guest]: And I think it's in the DNA and the culture of the central bank, thankfully, that, you

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:10.520
[Guest]: know, a lot of attention is paid to what the institution is required to do as its mandate.

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:15.320
[Guest]: And that could very easily mean that even the people appointed by the same government

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:18.320
[Guest]: will actually disagree with the government.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.000
[Guest]: And I think there should be healthy space for these kinds of disagreements, because

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.240
[Guest]: the idea that only the elected officials can take the right decisions for the country without

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:35.680
[Guest]: necessarily a feedback from the rest of the system is, I think, it can't be right.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.720
[Guest]: You know, as I said, in a country of billion people, the bright ideas for individual problems

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:48.100
[Guest]: are likely to be distributed rather than just in the minds of a few individuals.

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:55.080
[Guest]: And so you need that feedback to the system of, you know, and it happens through a bit

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.560
[Guest]: of back and forth.

01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:03.960
[Guest]: Sometimes it means some resistance, some speaking of truth to the power, some no's, and playing

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.040
[Guest]: a little bit of game of chicken, as I was calling it, etc.

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:16.200
[Guest]: And the third point is that coming to very specific to the RBI itself, see, why is the

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.840
[Guest]: RBI Act in part weak, it's weak, because there is this exception called the Section 7 of

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.640
[Guest]: the RBI Act, which got a lot of attention during our term.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:31.640
[Guest]: It had never been invoked in the history of the Reserve Bank of India.

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:35.400
[Guest]: It was, what does that Section 7 clause do?

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:41.280
[Guest]: It allows the government to basically give effectively a direction to the governor of

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:46.240
[Guest]: the RBI, it says in consultation with the governor, but of course, you know, that just

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.400
[Guest]: means that there has been some back and forth, and yet they weren't able to resolve the problem.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.480
[Guest]: And it says it's in public when it's in public interest.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.960
[Guest]: Now, clearly, therefore, the RBI Act is very clear, it says if the government wants the

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.920
[Guest]: governor to do something, as an executive, they have the powers to do it.

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.800
[Guest]: But my point is that it says very clearly that it's in public interest.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:15.360
[Guest]: So if such a direction is to be given, it should be made first transparent to the public

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:21.760
[Guest]: as to what exactly are these points of disagreement, what are the government's points, what is

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.560
[Guest]: the Reserve Bank of India's points, what are the pros and cons of taking a decision as

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:33.560
[Guest]: the government wants or not taking the decision as the RBI is pushing for etc.

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.000
[Guest]: And at a simple level, that is why that is the point of the Adi Shroff memorial speech,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.680
[Guest]: we were still in office when this happened.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.840
[Guest]: But we had to give the speech because if we had to take certain decisions, we had to actually

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.160
[Guest]: we thought that given section seven clause was to be invoked in public interest, it has

01:49:53.160 --> 01:50:00.080
[Guest]: to be made transparent to the public at large as to what are some of the key points of contention,

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.960
[Guest]: what are the areas of disagreement, etc, etc.

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:09.360
[Guest]: And I think, as I say, in the chapter, there are pressure points were all through, there

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:17.320
[Guest]: were tremendous interest in getting us to open up the credit and liquidity taps in 2018,

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.200
[Guest]: just the way it was at the time of fiscal stimulus after the global financial crisis.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:30.000
[Guest]: We all know what was the year 2018, you know, there were clear short term electoral pressures

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.760
[Guest]: building up at that point of time.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:39.640
[Guest]: And you know, in a way, we had to resist those pressures, because we had just started the

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:44.560
[Guest]: process of cleaning up the financial sector a few years back, the job wasn't complete.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:51.360
[Guest]: We knew how difficult it is to clean up an excess credit cycle after it has happened

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.200
[Guest]: the way we saw it in 2009 to 12.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:00.400
[Guest]: So it all being in front of your eyes, I don't see how the central bank would have just tagged

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.960
[Guest]: along just because the government wanted it to be.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.320
[Guest]: And in fact, as I describe in the book, in the first 10 to 12 months of my term, we were

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:13.160
[Guest]: completely in sync with the government on cleaning up this process.

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.400
[Guest]: And then there was a bit of a reversal.

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:21.000
[Guest]: And I think all of this circumstantial evidence, if I could call it seems to suggest that the

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.720
[Guest]: driving forces were actually the short term political pressure, there was also a tremendous

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:33.800
[Guest]: demand to get a huge balance sheet dividend to be paid to the government out of the central

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:34.800
[Guest]: bank.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.200
[Guest]: You know, the numbers that started out were extraordinarily large, and then they came

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.800
[Guest]: down eventually.

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:49.880
[Guest]: So I think I agree with you that it is, there is a natural tug of war here all over the

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.360
[Guest]: world.

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.480
[Guest]: Governments are always wanting sometimes the central banks to do what is in their short

01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:00.640
[Guest]: term interests, keep borrowing costs low, keep a lot of liquidity high, keep bank credit

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.800
[Guest]: conditions easy, etc, etc.

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:10.000
[Guest]: But given I think our initial conditions are such where the government deficits are large,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.200
[Guest]: there's a big government presence in public sector banking.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:21.400
[Guest]: And the RBI Act is weak to start with in granting the central bank operational autonomy.

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:28.760
[Guest]: It is my experience that the fiscal dominance pressures in India now are way higher than

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.640
[Guest]: in other parts of the world.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:36.760
[Guest]: And you know, there is always a tendency in India to justify our own mediocrity and bad

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:41.000
[Guest]: decision making by appealing to the rest of the world.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.640
[Guest]: I wrote about fiscal dominance, I wrote the entire book, my manuscript was given before

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:52.320
[Guest]: the COVID outbreak had become significant, it was all finished in February, early March.

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:56.520
[Guest]: And immediately people in India said, oh, but you know, the world over now the governments

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.960
[Guest]: and the central banks are working together to come out of COVID.

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:03.840
[Guest]: My question is no, they are doing it to come out of COVID.

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:09.200
[Guest]: We started this process even before two or three years before of fiscally dominating

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.760
[Guest]: the central bank.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:17.200
[Guest]: And you can see the damage that it has done in my view, the long run test match view is

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.440
[Guest]: really playing out.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:25.560
[Guest]: See, what is the cost of dominating the central bank to roll over your debts, you know, not

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.880
[Guest]: recapitalize the public sector banks, etc.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.360
[Guest]: Is that the market discipline on the government is lost on its balance sheet.

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:40.720
[Guest]: You know, the government has effectively run a consolidated deficit of 8 to 10% of GDP

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.960
[Guest]: pre COVID, depending on how you do the consolidation.

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:47.800
[Guest]: You know, post COVID, it will go up to 14 to 15%.

01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:53.280
[Guest]: The fact that we didn't bring our fiscal deficit in check before COVID has meant that it has

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.760
[Guest]: been hard to undertake fiscal expenditures right now in the midst of COVID.

01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:03.080
[Guest]: That's a serious cost to the economy in my view that you chose to spend so much in good

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:08.760
[Guest]: times rather than saving a capacity to spend if you had a difficult situation such as the

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.760
[Guest]: pandemic.

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:14.320
[Guest]: And of course, no one knows, but that's what robustness, resilience and stress test planning

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.520
[Guest]: is you don't exhaust all your buffers in what are looking relatively calm years.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:25.320
[Guest]: Second, the public sector banks problem has not been fixed, neither in terms of capitalization

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:31.800
[Guest]: nor in terms of governance and quality of lending, underwriting, monitoring, etc., nor

01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.920
[Guest]: in terms of the government shedding stakes.

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:41.840
[Guest]: Now, the losses during COVID are likely to rise perhaps to, you know, 12.5 to 14.7% as

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:44.440
[Guest]: per RBI's financial stability report.

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:50.280
[Guest]: Now, we are going to be dealing with a further loan loss problem even before we have fixed

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.280
[Guest]: the old one.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.680
[Guest]: So, this kicking the can down the road and justifying always doing what is in short-term

01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:02.880
[Guest]: interest at the expense of positioning the economy structurally right for the long run.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:08.720
[Guest]: And we do this year after year after year with more intensity in some years such as

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.720
[Guest]: 2018 than others.

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:17.480
[Guest]: And this tendency of not positioning yourself structurally right for the long run leads

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:23.480
[Guest]: to this tendency to put dominance pressure on the central bank every year to get some

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.480
[Guest]: concessions.

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:32.600
[Guest]: And, you know, in the end, we are gradually, in my opinion, losing our potential to grow

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.160
[Guest]: our productivity, our ability to create jobs.

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.040
[Guest]: All these are steadily deteriorating.

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.760
[Guest]: And of course, there is bigger collateral damage, as you pointed out, which is the fact

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:52.680
[Guest]: that you are emaciating the decision-making processes, which in effect granted the central

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.520
[Guest]: bank a fair amount of operational autonomy even when the letter of the law was not that

01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:58.840
[Guest]: great.

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.120
[Guest]: And I think I want to stress one point here, which is quite important, I mean, again, to

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.640
[Guest]: quote Dr. Reddy from his masterful forward in my book, he says, listen, in 70s and 80s,

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.080
[Guest]: the government, the central bank and the public sector banks were a Hindu undivided family

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.540
[Guest]: where no one kept anyone's accounts.

01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.600
[Guest]: And it didn't matter that time, there was no private sector to talk of.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.920
[Guest]: And we were generating three, three and a half percent, we had never embraced the ability

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:30.040
[Guest]: and the opportunity to actually grow faster than that.

01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:31.040
[Guest]: Even that failed.

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.120
[Guest]: We could not even generate three, three and a half percent without running up imbalances

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:36.960
[Guest]: on the external sector.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.440
[Guest]: Now, the economy is different.

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:42.120
[Guest]: The economy has a presence of the private sector.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.200
[Guest]: The growth aspirations are of eight to nine percent per annum.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.520
[Guest]: They are in fact necessary given our young demographics.

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:54.960
[Guest]: And if we want to continue on the path of eradicating poverty the way we have for two

01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:02.040
[Guest]: decades, since 1991, then it's not good enough to function like a Hindu undivided family

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.800
[Guest]: anymore where no one keeps anyone's proper accounts.

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:10.560
[Guest]: Because if the government becomes very large, now the cost is not just that down the line,

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.840
[Guest]: you will have a crisis.

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:16.600
[Guest]: The cost is even now because you are crowding out the private sector, you are crowding out

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.800
[Guest]: its enterprise, you are converting businesses from value creating enterprises into rent

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.800
[Guest]: seeking enterprises.

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:30.280
[Guest]: And so I think the danger of going down this path of regression towards nationalized economy,

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:37.600
[Guest]: a centralized control of decision making and policymaking, the danger is clear and present

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600
[Guest]: right now.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:44.880
[Guest]: And therefore, I think we need deep institutional reforms on the fiscal side, on the financial

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:51.040
[Guest]: sector side, and also on the real side, to actually turbocharge the economy so that we

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:57.280
[Guest]: get all the growth we can possibly generate in the post COVID and amidst COVID recovery.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the key nuances which you pointed out in, you know, the preface

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.400
[Amit Varma]: of your book, which is just an absolutely wonderful chapter, one of the key nuances

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:10.600
[Amit Varma]: that I'd like to draw my listeners attention to is the fiscal philosophy of our state by

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.280
[Amit Varma]: which you don't mean this government or that government, but how the state has looked at

01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.880
[Amit Varma]: spending all throughout, where you point out that a significant chunk of our spending is

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.120
[Amit Varma]: revenue expenditures, like subsidies, and so on.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And a very small chunk is capital expenditure, which is things like infrastructure and so

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.120
[Amit Varma]: on, which will, you know, have positive externalities lead to growth in the long run.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:36.200
[Amit Varma]: So what's happening is that instead of building the pie, instead of doing things which will,

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:40.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, help the economy grow, we are redistributing bits of the pie.

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:45.240
[Amit Varma]: And that redistribution, that economic support, and all of that also play into those short

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:47.240
[Amit Varma]: term populist imperatives.

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:51.380
[Amit Varma]: So here again, incentives take you towards a particular kind of spending.

01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out that how, you know, when you combine the problem of the fiscal

01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:59.240
[Amit Varma]: deficit with how the current account deficit has been changing, you say, and I'll quote

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:04.320
[Amit Varma]: this bit, these twin deficits, fiscal deficit and current account deficit make India vulnerable

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.280
[Amit Varma]: to a sudden stop, in which a deterioration in the quality of government or corporate

01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:13.640
[Amit Varma]: balance sheets, rising inflation, either due to domestic stimulus or oil price shock, Federal

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Reserve rate hikes, and dollar absorption or a surge in global risk aversion can trigger

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.360
[Amit Varma]: a withdrawal by foreign investors who are financing external funding of the government

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.640
[Amit Varma]: in the corporate sector.

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:29.000
[Amit Varma]: The resulting fallout in the form of a sharply depreciating Indian rupee, a rise in oil import

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.680
[Amit Varma]: bill and inflation, further widening of the twin deficits, and the debt spiral or loss

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:39.960
[Amit Varma]: of investor confidence that ensues present a substantial risk to India's financial stability.

01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Such risk has materialized unexpectedly at least once a decade over the past 30 years

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:47.680
[Amit Varma]: with several minor hiccups in between.

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:54.520
[Amit Varma]: And you point out that the way to address this would be to make tough structural adjustments.

01:59:54.520 --> 02:00:00.200
[Amit Varma]: But instead, what we do is, to quote you again, we instead do, quote, what is more expedient,

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:06.600
[Amit Varma]: which is to economically and financially repress the economy to fund its borrowings, stop quote.

02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And this phrase was very interesting to me, you know, repress the economy.

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: So take me through some of the ways in which this happens and what the implications are.

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:19.800
[Amit Varma]: And all of this, of course, is sort of an elaboration of fiscal dominance, which is

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:21.960
[Amit Varma]: what, you know, that the chapter in the book is about.

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:28.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit of the different shades of meaning of, you know, repressing the economy

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.320
[Amit Varma]: in this case.

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.320
[Guest]: Absolutely, Amit.

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:37.280
[Guest]: So, you know, historically, the most common repression used to be that essentially the

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:44.160
[Guest]: government and the RBI sat down together and said that we will impose a very high statutory

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:49.360
[Guest]: liquidity ratio, as it was called SLR on banks.

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.720
[Guest]: At its peak, it was around 40%.

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:53.000
[Guest]: And what does that mean?

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:59.360
[Guest]: It means that when you or I deposited one rupee into a bank, 40 paisa would necessarily

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.440
[Guest]: have to be earmarked for holdings of government bonds.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.440
[Guest]: Now, what is this doing?

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:09.680
[Guest]: What this kind of repression does is that it forces an increase in the borrowing costs

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:15.080
[Guest]: for everyone else, because you can't compete with the government on a level playing field

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.120
[Guest]: for about 40% of the deposit base of the banking system.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.120
[Guest]: Now, why is the government doing this?

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.720
[Guest]: The government is doing this because it wants to keep running its populist programs, as

02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.520
[Guest]: we, as you mentioned, you know, more than 90% of centers expenditure is in subsidies

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.680
[Guest]: rather than infrastructure or health.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:41.560
[Guest]: And similarly, at state level, maybe 70 to 75% is almost subsidies and other kinds of

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:45.120
[Guest]: revenue expenditures, you know, salaries, pensions, whatever, because, you know, they're

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:50.520
[Guest]: owning so many things all over the country and employing relatively unproductive labor

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.960
[Guest]: in my view, in many cases.

02:01:52.960 --> 02:02:00.600
[Guest]: So the cost of actually supporting that employment, providing all these subsidies is the fact

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:07.600
[Guest]: that when a private sector firm wants to borrow, a micro, small, medium sized enterprise wants

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:14.840
[Guest]: to borrow or you and I want to borrow, say, in order to invest in a house or, you know,

02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:22.040
[Guest]: buy a car or fund an education loan for our child, we are actually paying a higher cost

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.880
[Guest]: because the government has to keep running its program.

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:30.000
[Guest]: So this is a form of a borrowing related repression tax.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.440
[Guest]: Now second, when now we have brought down, you know, various governors brought down this

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.960
[Guest]: statutory liquidity ratio down from 40% to below 20%.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:43.400
[Guest]: So you know, that repression has come down.

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.600
[Guest]: But now what that means is that because of lack of repression, the government has to

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.520
[Guest]: borrow in the market.

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.880
[Guest]: Now what was the idea?

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.820
[Guest]: Why should they borrow in the market?

02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:57.200
[Guest]: Because rather than forcing banks, let them borrow in the market, because then the market

02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:00.840
[Guest]: will reflect in the price of the government debt.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.480
[Guest]: What do they see as the long run prospects of the economy from the debt that you are

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.480
[Guest]: undertaking?

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.480
[Guest]: Will the inflation rise?

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:13.240
[Guest]: Are you going to generate enough growth to generate taxes to repay these debts or not?

02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.120
[Guest]: Now, when the government costs of borrowing rises again, what do they do?

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.960
[Guest]: They turn to the central bank and say, oh, now you must buy my debt, because otherwise

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.600
[Guest]: the borrowing costs are rising.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:28.440
[Guest]: Even the pressures on the central bank to quote unquote, monetize the government debt,

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.000
[Guest]: they have been there even pre-COVID.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000
[Guest]: These are in fact, I described that, you know, what is opening of the liquidity tabs mean

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:41.180
[Guest]: part of it was actually to just go and buy a lot of government debt to open market operations,

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:45.960
[Guest]: so that you would flood the banking system with more liquidity.

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.040
[Guest]: But of course, a part of that is to simply keep the government's borrowing costs low.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:58.020
[Guest]: Now, what you do when you monetize the government deficit is that one, you prevent the financial

02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:02.640
[Guest]: sector from taking on the government bond risk and earning a higher yield on it.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.820
[Guest]: Instead, you give them a very low overnight rate through the central bank.

02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.280
[Guest]: And more importantly, you also reduce the fiscal discipline on the government.

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.960
[Guest]: So the government balance sheet keeps getting larger and larger, aggravating the first crowding

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.920
[Guest]: out problem that I was discussing.

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:26.800
[Guest]: And now if the financial sector is not making much profit on its holding of government deficits

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:32.040
[Guest]: in one way or the other, because the central bank is monetizing it, then you know, you

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.080
[Guest]: sort of reduce their profitability to an extent in the process as well.

02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:45.400
[Guest]: And third, and maybe a worse form of repression is the fact that because RBI is an all purpose

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:51.160
[Guest]: central bank, the government also wants to reduce its recapitalization amounts into public

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:55.080
[Guest]: sector banks and other government owned entities.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:03.120
[Guest]: To do that, it asks RBI to relax the rules for recognition of loan losses, not require

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:08.560
[Guest]: that you provide for anticipated losses ahead of time.

02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:13.640
[Guest]: And because you don't do that, the banking system is always like a tight rubber band

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:20.240
[Guest]: that is stretched so hard that even a little bit of disturbance might actually run the

02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:21.880
[Guest]: risk of snapping it.

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:26.120
[Guest]: The bankers feel the pressure themselves, because they have never recognized what their

02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:28.560
[Guest]: loan losses are in a true economic sense.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.440
[Guest]: So they're always dealing with legacy problems.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.240
[Guest]: And you get two kinds of problems in bank behavior out of this one, banks are now very

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.680
[Guest]: fearful of any further losses.

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:44.280
[Guest]: So they want to keep evergreening and keep lending to the same borrowers who have already

02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:45.280
[Guest]: defaulted.

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:49.800
[Guest]: So this is called a zombie lending, you extend and pretend as though everything is fine on

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.800
[Guest]: the loans.

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:57.200
[Guest]: Or they do lazy lending, which is that they lend entirely to the government because that

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.120
[Guest]: RBI regulation doesn't require any extra capital to be brought by the shareholders.

02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:04.160
[Guest]: So that's called lazy lending.

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:09.600
[Guest]: Now, therefore, what you observe with public sector banks is that many times they are so

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:14.920
[Guest]: much in excess of the statutory liquidity ratio, they would have, if the statutory liquidity

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:19.800
[Guest]: ratio is 18%, they will have 25 to 27% of government bond holding.

02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:23.480
[Guest]: Effectively, that's again a repression because they have no capital.

02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:29.760
[Guest]: So they are going to lend to an MSME or a private sector borrower or a household only

02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:38.120
[Guest]: if they get a lot more extra return to compensate them for not having to provide capital on

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:40.840
[Guest]: these other kinds of holdings that they have.

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:48.220
[Guest]: So in one way or the other, the repression is a repression of the saver.

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:53.480
[Guest]: Because in the end, you know, the quality of deposit services, etc. being provided by

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.800
[Guest]: public sector banks is not great.

02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:00.880
[Guest]: If RBI is being forced to keep interest rates low, then deposit rates will eventually follow

02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:05.520
[Guest]: and the saver again gets low returns on deposits.

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.560
[Guest]: It's a repression of the borrowers in the private sector because they are going to have

02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.620
[Guest]: to pay higher costs to borrow.

02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:13.760
[Guest]: So they have higher hurdle rates.

02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:18.240
[Guest]: Many investments don't look profitable, or as we have been discussing, they switch from

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:23.200
[Guest]: a value creation to a rent extraction mode in order to generate these higher returns

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.880
[Guest]: given their higher cost of capital.

02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:31.440
[Guest]: And third, and importantly, there is also a repression of the overall allocation of

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.120
[Guest]: capital in the economy.

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:40.320
[Guest]: Instead of taxpayer money going to the government and the government being under fiscal discipline

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:45.860
[Guest]: to allocate this capital well to generate growth, to do the right kinds of investments

02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:51.040
[Guest]: such as infrastructure, health and education, which will expand the growth path of the economy

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:55.480
[Guest]: and build a credibility with the market that yes, the government can repay even a higher

02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:57.160
[Guest]: cost of borrowing.

02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:05.440
[Guest]: Instead, the taxpayer money gets allocated into short term revenue programs of the government

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.520
[Guest]: that have a lot of populist appeal.

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:13.880
[Guest]: They are an easy narrative to provide to the common man without ever spelling out what

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:20.000
[Guest]: are the true economic costs of actually running these programs in the long run.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.120
[Guest]: And so I think it's such a massive repression of the economy all around.

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:33.080
[Guest]: So to me, it is not a surprise at all that investments in many parts of Indian real economy

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:39.680
[Guest]: are very tepid, because when you have a government that is trying to do so much in the short

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:47.600
[Guest]: term pump priming of the economy, short term subsidy based narrative friendly programs,

02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:53.240
[Guest]: and so much to repress the financial sector policies to facilitate its own borrowing,

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:56.720
[Guest]: where is the space for the rest of the economy to grow?

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:57.840
[Guest]: It's simply not possible.

02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:03.400
[Guest]: The only entities that are able to grow well in India are those who are able to go outside

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:09.720
[Guest]: the country and borrow in the external markets, or get foreign direct investments.

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:11.680
[Guest]: And those parts of the economy thrive.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.840
[Guest]: And of course, what are these in the FDI case, it is mainly the tech and pharma space.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.040
[Guest]: And in case of external borrowings, it has to be relatively large and well rated companies.

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.080
[Guest]: But that leaves out a large chunk of enterprises which are small, who contribute very valuably

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.600
[Guest]: to job creation in the economy.

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:38.220
[Guest]: And you can see actually that over a period of time, gradually, the average young person

02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:42.600
[Guest]: in India is now saying that the job they want is actually with a public sector firm.

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.600
[Guest]: They are no longer thinking about the job that they want is being with a private sector

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:48.680
[Guest]: firm.

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:53.560
[Guest]: Because we have gradually reshaped the economy to have more and more of the government and

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.320
[Guest]: less and less of the private sector.

02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:02.200
[Guest]: And I think this is a fundamental misdirected course from which we have to correct our direction

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.680
[Guest]: and strike the right balance again.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:11.920
[Guest]: And I think, if I could essentially give one final example here, which is that, you know,

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:18.120
[Guest]: what is often lost in the political thinking of the economic management of the country

02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:27.800
[Guest]: is that a small share of taxes of a larger pie may be much bigger than having a larger

02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.480
[Guest]: tax percentage of a very small pie.

02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:34.240
[Guest]: And you know, basically, what it's saying is that there's a simple concept in economics

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:41.040
[Guest]: that if you tax too much, at some point, the private investments collapse so quickly, that

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.760
[Guest]: actually the economy shrinks.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.200
[Guest]: And even though your percentage tax rate is high, actually, you don't collect much tax

02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.340
[Guest]: revenue in the first place.

02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.800
[Guest]: And so, beyond a point, your desire to collect more and more taxes backfires.

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:59.640
[Guest]: Now, I'm not saying that we don't need to improve our tax collection in a very fundamental

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.640
[Guest]: sense.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:06.160
[Guest]: What I'm trying to say is that repression of the economy through public sector banks,

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.000
[Guest]: through fiscal dominance of the central bank, through excessive borrowings and crowding

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:16.640
[Guest]: out of private sector enterprise, all of these are forms of taxes, implicit taxes that are

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.160
[Guest]: being imposed on the rest of the economy.

02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:24.240
[Guest]: And in sum total, they are now so large that the pie is actually shrinking.

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:29.240
[Guest]: And even though the repression is very high, in the end, the government is worse off, because

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.960
[Guest]: actually the pie is shrinking at a faster pace than you are benefiting from the pie

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:34.960
[Guest]: in the first place.

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.920
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, the reason many people miss this profound insight is that the whole

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:45.680
[Amit Varma]: idea that a pie grows or can shrink feels counterintuitive in the sense that, you know,

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.240
[Amit Varma]: our brains evolved at a time where, you know, in prehistoric times, you lived in tribes

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.120
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, up to 100 to 150 people, there was natural scarcity all around.

02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:57.280
[Amit Varma]: So we've evolved to think of the world in zero-sum ways.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:01.820
[Amit Varma]: The fact that, you know, every transaction leaves both parties better off and the value

02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:07.080
[Amit Varma]: in a society goes up and the pie can grow is deeply counterintuitive.

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of aspect in your book, which, you know, I was reminded of earlier in the

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.040
[Amit Varma]: show when you spoke about the proverb, where if the raja is a vaipari, the raja becomes

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:21.480
[Amit Varma]: bhikari, was, you know, again, what the ownership of public sector banks does as a whole, where

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:26.480
[Amit Varma]: the government is not only a participant through the banks, but also the regulator of the banks

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.640
[Amit Varma]: and the perverse incentives in play.

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And again, I'll quote from your book where you write, on the one hand, the overarching

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.920
[Amit Varma]: presence of public sector banks, other large state-owned financial institutions, and state-owned

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:41.440
[Amit Varma]: enterprises creates the incentive that the government dominates the central bank and

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:46.760
[Amit Varma]: its financial sector policies to affect outcomes for the entities that it owns and for its

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:47.760
[Amit Varma]: borrowing programs.

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.560
[Amit Varma]: This skews the market terms against the private sector and distracts the central bank from

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.120
[Amit Varma]: its long-term policy goals, stop quote.

02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:00.480
[Amit Varma]: And this also affects the private players then, as you later point out, quote, the government

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.080
[Amit Varma]: has incentives to influence policies as such and that it is not at arm's length from the

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:10.240
[Amit Varma]: regulators, drives the private sector into hyperactive lobbying, read an overdose of

02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:12.720
[Amit Varma]: consultations with the government and regulators.

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:17.860
[Amit Varma]: This in turn induces an overall culture in the system of putting in place business-friendly

02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:23.160
[Amit Varma]: policies that are pro incumbents at the cost of market-friendly policies that encourage

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:28.520
[Amit Varma]: creative destruction, asset reallocation, ease of doing business, and new entry, stop

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.520
[Amit Varma]: quote.

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Which I think, you know, and I wanted to read this out and it's an important point to make

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.400
[Amit Varma]: because in the popular imagination, most people conflate business-friendly and market-friendly.

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.400
[Amit Varma]: The two are often contradictory because what is business-friendly is if you keep competition

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.040
[Amit Varma]: out and that's not necessarily good for the people at large or for society.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.360
[Amit Varma]: That's crony capitalism.

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.040
[Amit Varma]: And what is good for the market is that you have this dynamism that leads to creative

02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.160
[Amit Varma]: destruction, easy entry and all that.

02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:00.080
[Amit Varma]: But the way the system is set up and a lot of it has to do with, you know, the ownership

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.960
[Amit Varma]: of public sector banks, you know, it seems inevitable, almost destined to just play out

02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:06.960
[Amit Varma]: this way.

02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.240
[Amit Varma]: What are sort of your thoughts on this and how difficult is it to eventually move away

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.240
[Amit Varma]: from it?

02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Like you pointed out in an interview that look, it is possible for public sector banks

02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:16.440
[Amit Varma]: to get sold.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.600
[Amit Varma]: It happened all over Southeast Asia, but it took a massive crisis for it to happen.

02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Now we can't hope for a crisis.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: There doesn't seem to be much coming from the demand side of the political marketplace.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, are things bleak for you, unless they get really bleak and we have a crisis?

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.320
[Guest]: Yes.

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:39.240
[Guest]: See, in the end, we have to recognize the costs of running the system the way it is.

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:46.720
[Guest]: I think, see, the reason why a part of the narrative hasn't shifted around to reforming

02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.080
[Guest]: the public sector banking, you know, most people don't even realize that these banks

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.040
[Guest]: were nationalized, most of them in 60s and 70s in two waves.

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:57.760
[Guest]: They used to be private banks earlier.

02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:03.760
[Guest]: It was done under the political objective of running government's programs for development

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.840
[Guest]: and financial inclusion.

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:10.440
[Guest]: And lo and behold, after close to 50 years of their existence, we are still at barely

02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:15.920
[Guest]: 60% of credit to GDP ratio, much lower than developed countries.

02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.800
[Guest]: Where are their losses?

02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:20.280
[Guest]: Are they in financial inclusion loans?

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.440
[Guest]: No, they are in loans to the largest industrial firms.

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:25.440
[Guest]: That is where their biggest losses have come from.

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.840
[Guest]: So they have failed on that front.

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:33.320
[Guest]: In fact, increasingly, their quality of deposit service and account and branch services is

02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:36.960
[Guest]: so weak that even their deposit share is actually shrinking.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.960
[Guest]: So depositors are now voting with their feet, gradually by saying, listen, I would rather

02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:51.560
[Guest]: bank with well capitalized, good service providing better technology run private bank than with

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.560
[Guest]: public sector banks.

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:58.400
[Guest]: So I think my sense is this has been a disaster in the making for a while, the public sector

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:01.400
[Guest]: banking enterprise.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:07.120
[Guest]: We quote in the paper with Dr. Rajan that we have injected more than 4 trillion rupees

02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:10.000
[Guest]: of capital over the last 10 years.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.760
[Guest]: And the opportunity cost of that, because you could have invested this capital in the

02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:19.540
[Guest]: market index or in a private sector banking index as two comparisons, would be anything

02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:21.840
[Guest]: in the range of three to three and a half lakh crores.

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.480
[Guest]: This is a hundred billion dollars, if we had that available with us, you know, we could

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:31.840
[Guest]: have done such a more significant stimulus for relief and repair of the COVID affected

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.840
[Guest]: economy.

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.520
[Guest]: Now, why is the narrative not shifting?

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.800
[Guest]: The narrative is not shifting partly because this public sector enterprises have become

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:44.560
[Guest]: cozy jobs for a part of the middle class in India.

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.720
[Guest]: You know, you get these secure jobs, they are not as well paying as in the private sector,

02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.560
[Guest]: but you have the job security because these entities aren't going away.

02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:00.800
[Guest]: But now the costs of actually keeping them in good shape have become so high, because

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.440
[Guest]: the government balance sheets have expanded on other fronts and the losses they've made

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:09.640
[Guest]: are very large, that actually it's not at all clear that these entities can even grow

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:15.000
[Guest]: and provide the kind of security that was possible to provide earlier.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.160
[Guest]: You know, take the example of Air India, or take the example of the public sector banks

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:23.560
[Guest]: that are losing their market share of deposits.

02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:28.640
[Guest]: You know, it's not going to be that pleasant to be employed in these firms going forward.

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:33.520
[Guest]: So I think the labour itself has to recognise that they would have more interesting growth

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:41.200
[Guest]: potential, even if some more risk on the job, if some of these entities were in fact, better

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.760
[Guest]: governed at arm's length from the government and eventually reprivatised.

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.120
[Guest]: The second problem that always gets mentioned is, oh, you know, ultimately, when a crisis

02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.880
[Guest]: happens, you have to backstop the banks anyways, then what is the problem with public sector

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.080
[Guest]: banks?

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:59.440
[Guest]: And it's a clever argument, but it's wrong on many counts.

02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:01.960
[Guest]: And let me explain three counts.

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.520
[Guest]: First, yes, deposit insurance is in place all over the world.

02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:10.040
[Guest]: But the reason why it's not a blanket deposit insurance is because there are capacities

02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:13.400
[Guest]: to how much the government can provide insurance.

02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:18.680
[Guest]: The sovereign can go on the brink, if it takes on too much private liabilities of the system.

02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.920
[Guest]: Therefore, there's a line drawn on how much deposit insurance will get provided.

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.520
[Guest]: And that deposit insurance is provided even to private banks.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:32.800
[Guest]: So why do you have to suffer all the inefficiencies, misgovernance, behest lending, you know, lack

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:38.640
[Guest]: of adequate technology, etc, of a public sector banking system that has, quote unquote, as

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.520
[Guest]: I said, failed us for 50 years in attainment of what it was supposed to be.

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:47.880
[Guest]: So you know, you can strengthen your deposit insurance system, rather than actually having

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.240
[Guest]: to suffer all the consequences of government ownership.

02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:56.920
[Guest]: Second, by keeping them as public sector banks, as I explained in the chapter, you actually

02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:02.720
[Guest]: through fiscal dominance, keep the quality of the regulation weak at all times.

02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:06.160
[Guest]: And this also means weaker rules on private sector banks.

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:12.640
[Guest]: We did not adopt better accounting standards, such as the IFRS or INDEAS, which would require

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.160
[Guest]: provisioning for losses in anticipation.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:20.160
[Guest]: And now even our private banks are actually not providing as much in anticipation as we

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160
[Guest]: would like.

02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:27.320
[Guest]: So there is a common reduced denominator or a race to the bottom in the regulation of

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:32.440
[Guest]: the financial system, because you have weakly managed, weakly governed, weakly capitalized

02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:34.020
[Guest]: public sector banks in the system.

02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:38.480
[Guest]: So the entire system is made worse off because of their presence in my view.

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:44.040
[Guest]: And third, and most importantly, is about the efficiency of the allocation of capital

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:45.040
[Guest]: in the economy.

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:50.720
[Guest]: As I explained earlier, because of the presence of public sector banks, capital is getting

02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:57.520
[Guest]: inefficiently allocated, either to distressed borrowers in order to first gold plate them

02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:03.080
[Guest]: in good times, and then allow them to continue to borrow through as zombies in bad times.

02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:08.440
[Guest]: So you get zombie lending, or you get lending to the government, lazy lending.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:14.240
[Guest]: And the middle, which is the healthy firms, MSMEs, and the households, they are getting

02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.480
[Guest]: creamed out because they have to borrow at much higher costs of borrowing.

02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:24.080
[Guest]: Now this has implications on productivity, investments, high quality jobs being created

02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:25.460
[Guest]: in the economy.

02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:32.280
[Guest]: And ultimately, even though as a saver in a public sector bank, or as an employee in

02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:37.680
[Guest]: a public sector bank, in the narrow, I may feel good about their presence, the entire

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:41.000
[Guest]: economy is paying a huge cost for this.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:48.000
[Guest]: And I tell everyone who defends the public sector banking enterprise on basis of the

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.320
[Guest]: safety of the deposit, or on the basis of the job that it has created for them, I ask

02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:59.280
[Guest]: them, if you had a child, where would you want your child to work when he grows up?

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:03.040
[Guest]: And you know, in many cases, the answer would be that they would rather have the child be

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:08.680
[Guest]: working in the best private bank out there, rather than in an Air India or in a public

02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:09.920
[Guest]: sector bank out there.

02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:17.600
[Guest]: So I think my sense is that this has come at a colossal cost to the economy.

02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:22.720
[Guest]: Even those who are inside are a bit blinded by the fact that they are leaving behind a

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:28.200
[Guest]: much worse economy for the youth and the children, including their own.

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:31.720
[Guest]: Even though privately, some of them might be better off themselves with the presence

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:33.640
[Guest]: of these enterprises.

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:36.280
[Guest]: I think it's time to call it a day.

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:41.560
[Guest]: I think the sooner we stop bleeding this wound, the better it is.

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:48.360
[Guest]: In my Feb 2017 speech on NPAs, I gave this analogy that we keep festering this wound

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:49.720
[Guest]: more and more.

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:55.960
[Guest]: And now we run the risk that we may have to not just impute some organs, but also, you

02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.760
[Guest]: know, we may have to deal with the side effects of the wound spreading to other parts of the

02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:00.760
[Guest]: body.

02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:04.320
[Guest]: I think it's time to recognise this is a failed experiment.

02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:11.400
[Guest]: It was entirely political when it was undertaken as nationalisation in 60s and 70s.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:15.560
[Guest]: It has led to poor returns on taxpayer money.

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:20.760
[Guest]: It has led to poor quality of deposit franchise servicing.

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:27.840
[Guest]: It has led to peak central banking apparatus in supervision and regulation.

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.640
[Guest]: It's a form of cancer, in my opinion, it is.

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:35.120
[Guest]: I have no two views about it in spite of the resistance that has been provided in many

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:40.600
[Guest]: parts of the society, because you have to listen to the facts on the table.

02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:46.840
[Guest]: And now a multiplicity of books have been written explaining how bad it is to have come

02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:51.080
[Guest]: out this year, another one is coming out later this year.

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:56.200
[Guest]: This is a common theme that's running through my book and my paper on how to reform the

02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:02.600
[Guest]: banks with Dr. Rajan, that government has to divest stakes, it has to improve the governance,

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:07.720
[Guest]: reprivatise some of these entities and prioritise some of the business models of the smaller

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:13.760
[Guest]: ones, so that they just do financial inclusion, like microcredit or microfinance institutions

02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:19.600
[Guest]: rather than trying to be universal banks to the industrial firms of the country.

02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:22.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I couldn't agree with you more about bank nationalisation.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I often and this is something I feel strongly about most people I don't think understand

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that economic policy has real humanitarian consequences.

02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Like when I look back on many of the economic policies of the Indira Gandhi period, bank

02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:39.480
[Amit Varma]: nationalisations and so much else, you know, I think they kept millions of people in poverty

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:44.400
[Amit Varma]: for decades longer than necessary, which is, of course, an unseen effect and people don't

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:45.400
[Amit Varma]: get it.

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:49.320
[Amit Varma]: And what you're saying about this also holds true that not only are we kicking the can

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:53.680
[Amit Varma]: down the road, we are kicking the children down the road, this is going to affect, you

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:54.680
[Amit Varma]: know, future generations.

02:23:54.680 --> 02:24:01.040
[Guest]: Yeah, if I could just add one point there, I mean, see, this is the beauty and the sadness

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.080
[Guest]: of the government balance sheet, right?

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.080
[Guest]: What is the beauty?

02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:10.220
[Guest]: The beauty is that you can touch the individual and spread the cost across.

02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:12.440
[Guest]: What is the tragedy of it?

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:18.080
[Guest]: The tragedy of it is that because you are spreading the losses around, you know, no

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.680
[Guest]: one really cares about it, it's someone else's problem.

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:26.920
[Guest]: And therefore, I think proper accounting of government balance sheet, preventing off balance

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:32.480
[Guest]: sheet accounting from masking the true picture of the government balance sheet, having an

02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:37.720
[Guest]: independent fiscal council that will evaluate every single program of the government before

02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:43.400
[Guest]: the budget is announced, you know, the 14 Finance Commission chaired by Dr. Reddy made

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:48.300
[Guest]: this very clear that the independent fiscal council should vet the programs before the

02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:52.360
[Guest]: budget is announced, are the assumptions reasonable, what are going to be the recurring costs of

02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.600
[Guest]: these programs, we can't just announce programs and then figure out what are going to be the

02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.160
[Guest]: budgetary and financing implications of this.

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.720
[Guest]: And once you do this, once you do a proper accounting of what is the total borrowing

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:10.920
[Guest]: being undertaken by the government across centers, states, different center and state

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:14.840
[Guest]: owned enterprises, this is called as a public sector borrowing requirement.

02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.400
[Guest]: Once you have a council that's vetting the reasonableness of the government budgets,

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:24.080
[Guest]: it will become very clear that the government is trying to do too much, it is pushing on

02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.960
[Guest]: a string, the borrowing costs and borrowing amounts are very large.

02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:36.320
[Guest]: And that we need to embark on a massive disinvestment program, the way we had it during 98 to 2003.

02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:41.640
[Guest]: In all non-strategic sectors, the government needs to shed stakes, reprivatize wherever

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:46.840
[Guest]: possible, including in the financial sector, in the banking sector, the insurance sector,

02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:47.840
[Guest]: and so on.

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.560
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't agree more.

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:54.560
[Amit Varma]: And in your book, of course, you lay out a bunch of ways in which, you know, we can fix

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:58.920
[Amit Varma]: the system now assuming and we'll come to the political economy later, but ignoring

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:02.800
[Amit Varma]: the political economy for the moment, assuming that all the politicians and bureaucrats fall

02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:03.800
[Amit Varma]: in line.

02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:07.640
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of steps among what you haven't already mentioned?

02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:12.680
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of steps that should be done to fix the system to get it functional

02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:13.680
[Guest]: again?

02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:19.660
[Guest]: Yes, so I think I would say, you know, in my view, the fiscal stability and financial

02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:23.600
[Guest]: stability are now almost joined at the hips.

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:27.840
[Guest]: You know, they are very deeply intertwined through this fiscal dominance channel, as

02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:31.800
[Guest]: well as through the direct linkages between the two.

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:38.040
[Guest]: So first and foremost, I would say we need to be honest about our fiscal side, that,

02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:42.920
[Guest]: you know, we need to spend right now in the midst of COVID, but that we didn't leave much

02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:48.160
[Guest]: space for it because of the slippages pre-COVID.

02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:54.520
[Guest]: And I think the best way to do this is to put in place an institutional fiscal reform

02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:59.400
[Guest]: package, which gives credibility to the market investors and rating agencies that the country

02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.680
[Guest]: means business, as far as consolidation and a reversal to better path is concerned in

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:09.480
[Guest]: the medium term, so that you can borrow more in the short term to meet the immediate fiscal

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.120
[Guest]: needs, you know, because you are on a better path.

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.880
[Guest]: But you know, we need to reorient for that the expenditure has to be growth focused.

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:23.480
[Guest]: So we need to reorient from subsidies towards infrastructure, health and education.

02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:30.400
[Guest]: I would do a very deep analysis of the subsidies, there is a lot of wastage, a lot of money

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:38.000
[Guest]: gets spent in administration and financial enterprises that run and house the subsidies

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.200
[Guest]: on their balance sheets, rather than the subsidies being spent entirely in reaching the last

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:46.960
[Guest]: mile consumer or the citizen.

02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:52.160
[Guest]: They can all be rolled perhaps into a universal basic income, and a lot of these inefficiencies

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:58.000
[Guest]: of administrative costs be economized, and that freed up space can be used to increase

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.400
[Guest]: the infrastructure and ease of doing business on the ground.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:04.360
[Guest]: So I would say that's first part of the fiscal institutional package.

02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:08.400
[Guest]: The second part of the package is something I wrote about in an op-ed in the Economic

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:09.400
[Guest]: Times.

02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:13.120
[Guest]: And I just mentioned, we need an independent fiscal council.

02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:19.880
[Guest]: And we need a transparent public sector borrowing requirement, the council should be non-partisan

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.600
[Guest]: or bipartisan, it should report to the parliament and not to the finance ministry.

02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:28.680
[Guest]: And the public sector borrowing requirement should be calculated by the independent office

02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:30.360
[Guest]: of the CAG.

02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:34.800
[Guest]: Because if the government is producing these numbers itself, it becomes a prey to what

02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:39.640
[Guest]: is the good hearts law, which is that, you know, if the measure by which I'm regulating

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.880
[Guest]: you can be manipulated by you, of course, the measure will have no economic meaning

02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:46.960
[Guest]: or content in the first place, and which is what has happened.

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.960
[Guest]: We have a real deficit, and we have an official deficit, and the gap between the two has now

02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:57.480
[Guest]: become very, very large, that we have to always talk about both in the same breath whenever

02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.160
[Guest]: we speak about them.

02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:00.160
[Guest]: That's two.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.840
[Guest]: And third, I think we just need to undertake massive divestments, we need to unlock the

02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:11.000
[Guest]: growth potential of so much enterprise space that has been captured by the public sector,

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.080
[Guest]: it would have the collateral benefit of reducing the government's borrowing programs, and putting

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:19.360
[Guest]: us on a better debt to GDP ratios.

02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:26.200
[Guest]: Now, this requires conviction and commitment at the top in the government that this is

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:31.800
[Guest]: a better path in the long run, rather than continuing to repress the economy, which would

02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.280
[Guest]: be necessary if we don't course correct on the fiscal front.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:42.280
[Guest]: But I think, you know, the government is still in the early phase of the electoral cycle.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:44.280
[Guest]: It has majority.

02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:51.480
[Guest]: So I think this is the kind of transformational institutional reform that one would hope the

02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:56.400
[Guest]: government would seriously undertake, or at least start debating and discussing.

02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:01.960
[Guest]: Second, I would say we need significant reforms on the financial front.

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:07.760
[Guest]: I think something we pushed for when I was at the Central Bank, through a speech by Governor

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:16.360
[Guest]: Patel, is that the ownership of public sector banks, the regulation of public sector banks

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:20.760
[Guest]: should be ownership neutral, whether they are owned by the government or whether they

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:25.200
[Guest]: are in the private sector space, the Central Bank should be able to regulate and discipline

02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:32.160
[Guest]: them in the same way, including replacement of management and, you know, dilution of the

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.680
[Guest]: government stakes if government is not injecting the required capital.

02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:40.560
[Guest]: This way, you know, problems happen even in private banks, there are idiosyncratic governance

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:44.740
[Guest]: failures as we have seen, but at least the Central Bank is able to take corrective actions

02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:45.740
[Guest]: to fix that.

02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:49.480
[Guest]: That is, that's not possible right now in public sector banks.

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:55.800
[Guest]: Second, we do need a calibrated, comprehensive plan for public sector presence in banks,

02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:58.520
[Guest]: insurance and other non-banks.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:03.880
[Guest]: This would mean, I think, divesting stakes below majority to start with, then using that

02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:08.660
[Guest]: time to improve governance standards by becoming arm's length.

02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:13.680
[Guest]: In the paper with Dr. Rajan, we suggest creating state-linked banks rather than public sector

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:22.120
[Guest]: banks where you basically move all the ownership of the banks, etc., into an investment managing

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:23.120
[Guest]: arm.

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:26.960
[Guest]: It's almost like a sovereign wealth fund, so to speak, which would be run by professionals

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:30.680
[Guest]: rather than actually run by the bureaucracy.

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:35.480
[Guest]: And you know, they would basically just appoint independent board members and then let these

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:43.000
[Guest]: boards run these entities rather than having a lot of control through a department of the

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.960
[Guest]: government as we currently have.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:51.880
[Guest]: And third, I would say that we need to continue with the process of strengthening bank supervision

02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:54.200
[Guest]: and regulation.

02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:58.600
[Guest]: This would mean actually creating buffers of capital in good times.

02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:04.280
[Guest]: See, even right now, we are doing a lot of restructuring and relief for the borrowers,

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:11.400
[Guest]: which is required because of the COVID's unanticipated and unprecedented, large nature of the shock.

02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:15.880
[Guest]: But we are not raising capital into banks on a war footing.

02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:18.800
[Guest]: Large private banks are doing it on their own, but what about others?

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:20.080
[Guest]: What about public sector banks?

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:22.080
[Guest]: Why aren't we asking them for capital?

02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:29.240
[Guest]: If the losses start materializing when the debt moratoria expire, how are we going to

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:30.760
[Guest]: capitalize these losses?

02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:33.560
[Guest]: Why aren't we planning for it ahead of time?

02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:38.760
[Guest]: Because if we are doing this recapitalization when the economy is coming out of COVID, banks

02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:42.040
[Guest]: are not going to be in a position to lend that time because they will still be dealing

02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:43.480
[Guest]: with the legacy loans problem.

02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:50.120
[Guest]: So if we learn the lesson from the last five, six years, we should be on a war footing capitalizing

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:53.580
[Guest]: the banks right now rather than leaving it for later.

02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:55.580
[Guest]: So that I would say is point three.

02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:58.760
[Guest]: So the first point was ownership neutral regulation of banks.

02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:02.600
[Guest]: Second is a comprehensive plan to restructure the public sector banks.

02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:08.200
[Guest]: And third, I would say capital, capital, capital on an anticipated basis rather than backloaded

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:09.280
[Guest]: basis.

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:14.720
[Guest]: And lastly, you know, everyone has been saying this, we are done with milking the fruits

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:20.880
[Guest]: of 90s reforms and capitalizing on the divestment gains of 98 to 2003.

02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:27.960
[Guest]: I think we need a new round of reforms, at least on, in their spirit, several parts of

02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:31.160
[Guest]: the Farm Bill to me seem to be in the right direction.

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:36.320
[Guest]: I don't know about the process through which it was implemented, but focusing on the economics

02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:44.000
[Guest]: of the Farm Bill, it is trying to actually get the farmers closer to the direct market

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.840
[Guest]: prices rather than having, giving a lot of power to the intermediary wholesalers in between.

02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.720
[Guest]: I think that was a problem.

02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:54.600
[Guest]: And hopefully, this is a step in the right direction.

02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:58.960
[Guest]: But you know, farming is only a small part of the Indian economy in a GDP sense, it's

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.540
[Guest]: very large in a job sense, but it is not the best jobs India can create.

02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:08.340
[Guest]: We need the rest of the private sector in services and manufacturing to get an even

02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:09.840
[Guest]: further boost.

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.400
[Guest]: Again, the labor laws are a step in the right direction.

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:18.600
[Guest]: But to get manufacturing away from China, as the world is moving away from China or

02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:24.800
[Guest]: diversifying supply chains, we are going to have to make land transactions to be done

02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:27.520
[Guest]: more transparently and readily.

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:32.240
[Guest]: So we certainly need reforms there, we need better ease of doing business on the ground

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:38.240
[Guest]: in terms of requiring fewer government clearances, and reducing that implicit taxation in the

02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:39.240
[Guest]: government.

02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:42.880
[Guest]: And third, we just need better infrastructure.

02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:48.000
[Guest]: Even now, we barely keep up all the time, every time I go to Mumbai, I feel it always

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.040
[Guest]: does enough when I'm on the roads.

02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:54.000
[Guest]: In certain parts of the country, the roads are very good, but in many parts of the countries,

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.360
[Guest]: they are still very uneven.

02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:03.600
[Guest]: And you know, to have a national manufacturing and delivery and logistics system, you know,

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:07.800
[Guest]: the logistics, there is a lot of improvement happening because of use of tech, etc.

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.920
[Guest]: But I think the physical parts of the logistics, the physical infrastructure that's underlying

02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:18.920
[Guest]: it can still be improved in terms of airports, airports, roads, trains, and so on.

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:25.720
[Guest]: So I think we need fiscal, financial and real sector reforms that are truly transformational

02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:28.520
[Guest]: to me, this is like a 1990s moment.

02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:35.360
[Guest]: We are not in a crisis, one does not want a crisis to be required to force these decisions

02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:36.360
[Guest]: on us.

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:42.920
[Guest]: I think we can use a bit of our sagacity in being able to see forward, visualize what

02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.400
[Guest]: the stress may be down the line, visualize what a low growth would mean for the youth

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:52.800
[Guest]: and the children of the economy down the line, visualize that if we have to do it and sell

02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:57.880
[Guest]: our enterprises in the midst of a crisis, like a Southeast Asian crisis, it would be

02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:04.040
[Guest]: the first time actually to plan for their reprivatization instead laid out as a calibrated

02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:05.520
[Guest]: strategy ahead of time.

02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:11.400
[Guest]: If this is done in a decisive manner as a package, I think it will increase the confidence

02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:18.800
[Guest]: and the investor sentiment towards India tremendously, and enable the government to undertake more

02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.340
[Guest]: fiscal expenditure in the short run, without actually there being a backlash in the market.

02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:30.680
[Guest]: So if I could give an analogy, you know, I like watching birds, it is something I learned

02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:35.800
[Guest]: with a group of naturalists when I was doing my RBI term, but the naturalists were also

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:38.760
[Guest]: very adept at explaining the rest of the nature to you.

02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:45.160
[Guest]: And once we were observing an insect, I think it was a praying mantis, which was trapped

02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:52.200
[Guest]: in a spider's web, and they explained to me how the spider builds the web in the first

02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:58.560
[Guest]: job of the spider is that it actually makes a massive leap from wherever it is sitting

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.320
[Guest]: on to where it wants to be on at the other end of the web.

02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:09.160
[Guest]: And to do that, it basically squats and uses all the strength of its thighs to make that

02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.200
[Guest]: one big jump to lay that first web across.

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:17.200
[Guest]: It knows what the target point is, it has to make a big leap.

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.960
[Guest]: Now once you have built that first bridge to your target point, building the rest of

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:24.160
[Guest]: the web around it becomes very, very easy.

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:30.280
[Guest]: And I think India is at that kind of a moment, we have to use all the strength that we have,

02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:35.720
[Guest]: figure out where we want to be, give a clear path, build a bridge to that by announcing

02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:37.760
[Guest]: the right sets of reforms.

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:43.680
[Guest]: Once we show that path as being our trajectory, building the rest of the growth around it

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:45.440
[Guest]: will become much, much easier.

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:51.000
[Guest]: And I think we don't have to be paralyzed, we don't have to be in inaction mode, we also

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.720
[Guest]: don't have to gamble.

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:56.960
[Guest]: We also don't have to say, oh, we will just spend and we will worry about what happens

02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:57.960
[Guest]: later.

02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:03.800
[Guest]: No, we can actually anchor whatever medium term long run need to be with the right fiscal,

02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:06.600
[Guest]: financial and real site package.

02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:12.360
[Guest]: And once you do that anchoring, we would actually be on a very prudent and safe path in my view.

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:19.160
[Guest]: I don't see why India can't grow at a very good rate, given the demographics, given the

02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.680
[Guest]: potential, given the hardworking nature and the aspiration of our youth.

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.520
[Guest]: I think it's a matter of course correction, and being on the right trajectory, avoiding

02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:34.440
[Guest]: the regression to the centralized, nationalized state, and allowing the private sector, both

02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:41.640
[Guest]: in terms of space, and incentives to flourish in a manner that it did during the 90s and

02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.200
[Amit Varma]: early 2000s.

02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:48.120
[Amit Varma]: That metaphor of state as spider is quite awesome, because you know, like some spiders,

02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.400
[Amit Varma]: the state can also be rather predatory.

02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, before I go on to talking about the political economy of this and the practicality and likelihood

02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.640
[Amit Varma]: of these kinds of changes happening, I want to take another tangent, because which came

02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:03.280
[Amit Varma]: to mind when you sort of mentioned the farm bills, that what happens in the discourse

02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:09.080
[Amit Varma]: in India, because, you know, everything is so polarized, and everything is so tribal,

02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:12.600
[Amit Varma]: is that typically, we have chosen our tribe.

02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we will stick with it regardless of what the issue is, for example, what's

02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:22.080
[Amit Varma]: giving me what's almost ironic now is that a lot of the people in the Congress opposing

02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.200
[Amit Varma]: the farm bills are completely oblivious to the fact that in their manifesto in the election

02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.040
[Amit Varma]: last year, they had very similar proposals and intellectually, many of them in private

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.840
[Amit Varma]: will tell you that, you know, yeah, this is a step in the right direction.

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And ditto, there was a lot of reflexive opposition to the labor reforms a few months ago, only

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:46.760
[Amit Varma]: because they came from, you know, a particular government, while earlier across parties is

02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:51.240
[Amit Varma]: pretty much been a consensus on the kind of reforms needed, especially since our labor

02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: laws hurt workers.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.240
[Amit Varma]: So does that then become an issue?

02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Because on the one hand, we want to build a constituency for these kinds of ideas.

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.920
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, is it incredibly frustrating to see that in these polarized times, people

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.880
[Amit Varma]: just respond at this base tribal level, where they're not looking at the ideas themselves,

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.600
[Amit Varma]: they are just seeing which is a party they happen to be associated with at this moment

02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:15.600
[Amit Varma]: in time.

02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.860
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, any criticism of this government will, regardless of the merit of the criticism,

02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:26.240
[Amit Varma]: be attacked by a lot of people as being anti-national and being whatever and, you know, the whole

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:28.160
[Amit Varma]: discourse just gets toxic.

02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:29.160
[Amit Varma]: Is this something you've thought about?

02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:34.240
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that's unfortunately, the politics of the times we are in, it's not just in India,

02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:35.840
[Guest]: it's actually all over the world.

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:42.760
[Guest]: I don't know if you saw the presidential debate yesterday, but, you know, it was probably,

02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:45.840
[Guest]: I don't know whether it was tragical or comical.

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:52.520
[Guest]: But it certainly epitomized everything that you said about the highly polarized nature

02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.840
[Guest]: of the politics at the present point of time in the world.

02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:02.160
[Guest]: I think the only way out is to keep sending soundbites of reason.

02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:07.200
[Guest]: I think we need more economic analysis of these kinds of reforms being laid out in a

02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.440
[Guest]: dispassionate, objective, nonpartisan way.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:18.040
[Guest]: I think agri-economists such as, you know, Professor Ashok Gulati at ICRIAR or Dr. Ramesh

02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:25.760
[Guest]: Chand at the NIPFP, they need to, they need to be read, they need to be heard, they need

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:32.400
[Guest]: to explain what exactly were the failures in the existing system and how they are going

02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:33.400
[Guest]: to be tackled.

02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.280
[Guest]: Of course, it would help if the government in the same week, when they remove onions

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.720
[Guest]: from the Essential Commodities Act, don't then ban exports, sending exactly the opposite

02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:45.600
[Guest]: signal at the same time.

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:51.920
[Guest]: But you know, we just need, we need more economic discourse, we need more discussions along

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:52.920
[Guest]: these lines.

02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:58.440
[Guest]: And perhaps there needs to be greater preparation through written documents, laying out what

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:02.360
[Guest]: the failures are with facts and data on the ground.

02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:06.480
[Guest]: What are the reforms, what are the options on the table, what are their pros and cons

02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.660
[Guest]: and why specific reforms are being chosen?

02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:14.800
[Guest]: I think it would be nice if there was a little bit of a discipline of going about this in

02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:16.560
[Guest]: an organized manner with documents.

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:21.640
[Guest]: See, in the past, even though we never implemented many of the committee's reports, we used to

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:27.640
[Guest]: set up committees at national level, they would be chaired, or at the central banking

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:33.680
[Guest]: level, they would be chaired by the highest quality, highest integrity bureaucrats, former

02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:36.240
[Guest]: central bankers, and so on.

02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:38.360
[Guest]: And they used to provide a blueprint.

02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:44.360
[Guest]: Even now, in my piece with Dr. Rajan, we refer to the Narsimhan Committee of the 90s, the

02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:52.280
[Guest]: P. J. Nayak Committee of the 2014, and maybe there is some usefulness in the bureaucracy

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:58.320
[Guest]: of actually creating records of proposals which are very carefully laid out, reasoned

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:04.440
[Guest]: for, analyzed with their merits and demerits, and so on.

02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:08.560
[Guest]: I think that is the only way forward that I see.

02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:16.560
[Guest]: I think, in a way, I feel quite strongly that we are at a moment when transformational reforms

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:17.560
[Guest]: are needed.

02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:23.000
[Guest]: There is a sign that some of this is being undertaken in the farm and the labor front.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.120
[Guest]: I would add three more pillars to that on the fiscal institutions, the financial sector,

02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:34.800
[Guest]: notably the public sector, banking and presence in insurance, pension, etc.

02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:39.560
[Guest]: And third, on the real side, especially on infrastructure front.

02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:45.600
[Guest]: I think if we can add these three pillars, I think we would be more decisively on a course

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:52.560
[Guest]: correction from the last 10, 12 years that we've had of, I would say, patchy growth,

02:43:52.560 --> 02:44:00.720
[Guest]: short-term growth, backloaded with macroeconomic or financial misdirection, short-term pump

02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:07.520
[Guest]: priming of the economy with down-the-line losses that are materializing in a very significant

02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:15.840
[Guest]: way, constant fudging and band-aid kind of solutions rather than decisive action to stop

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:21.200
[Guest]: the wounds from festering and spreading to other parts of the economy.

02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:24.320
[Guest]: I think we need to do something very decisive.

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:29.960
[Guest]: And I think if we do that, the 90s should show us that there will be fruits that will

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:35.400
[Guest]: bear out for at least a couple of decades if we do that in a decisive way.

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:43.480
[Guest]: I think, I hope that COVID is not just a difficult humanitarian crisis for the country, it is,

02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:50.520
[Guest]: and tragic as it is, it perhaps also offers an opportunity to also actually fix many of

02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:52.960
[Guest]: the things that were not right even pre-COVID.

02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:59.000
[Guest]: And if we do that, at least the crisis would be, you know, we would have utilized the crisis

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.320
[Guest]: to the best advantage of the economy under the circumstances.

02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:09.200
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no, and just sort of thinking aloud and adding to, you know, what we were talking

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:15.200
[Amit Varma]: about, about discourse is that I think people also are attracted to simple narratives and

02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:17.160
[Amit Varma]: therefore attracted to easy binaries.

02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:20.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what's happened in the Farm Bills Week was very complex.

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:22.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's a means versus ends issue.

02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:25.760
[Amit Varma]: I think the way they pushed it through was anti-democratic.

02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:29.640
[Amit Varma]: There are issues that you can raise against the bills by saying, hey, what about states

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.440
[Amit Varma]: rights and these should have been left to the states.

02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:37.160
[Amit Varma]: Equally, many of the, you know, the details of the bill are great and is in fact what

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:40.240
[Amit Varma]: the Congress had in their manifesto last year, which makes it ironic.

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, they also did the incredibly stupid thing of banning onion exports

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:45.960
[Amit Varma]: same week.

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.120
[Amit Varma]: So God knows what was happening.

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:50.360
[Amit Varma]: So the point is, it's all very complex and nuanced, there are things to praise, there

02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:54.320
[Amit Varma]: are things to not praise, there are things to withhold judgment on, but we don't have

02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:55.520
[Amit Varma]: an appetite for that.

02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, before we kind of wind it up and I'll leave sort of the political economy

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:05.400
[Amit Varma]: question for the last, but I'll get to it by taking a segue back into the personal where

02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:09.720
[Amit Varma]: you had once said that you chose the life of an academic because, you know, you were

02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:10.720
[Amit Varma]: in charge of your day.

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:15.120
[Amit Varma]: You can wake up when you want, you can wear what you want, and so on and so forth.

02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:19.480
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you, you know, chose to give up that life of an academic and actually

02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:24.140
[Amit Varma]: come and work in the Reserve Bank of India and, you know, so on.

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:26.200
[Amit Varma]: What drove you to do that?

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, were there problems that you thought you needed to solve and that you could contribute

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:31.520
[Amit Varma]: to?

02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:34.800
[Amit Varma]: And what was it like the experience of then joining the government?

02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:37.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, how was it different from what your expectations were?

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:38.880
[Guest]: Yes.

02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:45.440
[Guest]: See, as I said, for someone like me who was studying banking crises, banking regulation,

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:51.240
[Guest]: financial stability, I think a central banking job in some ways a natural culmination.

02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:59.080
[Guest]: You know, at least at some point, you want to be able to take your, your analysis, your

02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:06.920
[Guest]: research, your expertise to implementing things in a policy sense, a central banking job can

02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:12.920
[Guest]: be fairly academic, as far as allowing you to have the conceptual framework to solve

02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:14.440
[Guest]: the problems is concerned.

02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:19.280
[Guest]: So I'd always thought this would be a nice thing to do, I engage a fair bit with central

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:22.720
[Guest]: banks in an advisory capacity.

02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:28.520
[Guest]: Of course, most of the times advisory roles have no executive decision making capacity.

02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:34.480
[Guest]: Of course, in the end at a central bank, the governor and the board are the ultimate executives

02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:35.480
[Guest]: who are in charge.

02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:41.040
[Guest]: But you know, deputy governors can shape the agenda a fair bit in their own respective

02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:42.040
[Guest]: portfolios.

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:48.040
[Guest]: And I was fortunate that I was allowed to have a voice even in portfolios such as bank

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:53.360
[Guest]: regulation, which were not under me actually, in fact, it became one of my thrust areas

02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:59.240
[Guest]: as the face of the RPI on some of this, even though I would say Deputy Governor N S Vishwanathan

02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:05.740
[Guest]: was the main person driving the regulation side when we were there.

02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:10.480
[Guest]: So I think it was just a very natural thing to do, the opportunity came about, I applied

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:15.800
[Guest]: for the job, I had a video conference interview with the appointments committee of the Government

02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:20.800
[Guest]: of India, it was very serious grilling, I felt inside I was the right person for the

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.800
[Guest]: job.

02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:23.560
[Guest]: Of course, I didn't know who else was applying.

02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.160
[Guest]: So you don't know whether in a relative sense, you would look right or not.

02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:31.440
[Guest]: But in an absolute sense, I thought I was the right person for the job.

02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:38.240
[Guest]: And even when I finished my term, I still think, you know, it was a very good fit, I,

02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:44.080
[Guest]: you know, sometimes when you are doing what is exactly right for you, there is a magical

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.600
[Guest]: feeling inside you of satisfaction, that this comes naturally to you, the job requires you

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:56.560
[Guest]: to do certain things, and you are able to bring all of your experience, knowledge, and

02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:58.520
[Guest]: the ability to work with teams.

02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:05.000
[Guest]: And I think it was all kind of very nice, I think I enjoyed my experience thoroughly.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.120
[Guest]: I thank the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India for this opportunity.

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:15.320
[Guest]: I think I had a great time working with the staff at the RBI, I hold them in the highest

02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:20.280
[Guest]: regard, both for their hard work as well as integrity.

02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.480
[Guest]: And I think I couldn't have asked for anything more.

02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:28.920
[Guest]: You know, it was also personally very rewarding for me, because I spent two and a half years

02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:29.920
[Guest]: with my parents.

02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:34.080
[Guest]: It was also personally challenging with my wife and son were in New York.

02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:40.360
[Guest]: So I was going back and forth a lot, and you know, I, at some point, I just got better

02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:41.920
[Guest]: at managing the jet lag.

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:42.920
[Guest]: But it was quite crazy.

02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:48.800
[Guest]: Now, when I think about it, you know, to have a family 10 and a half hours away or nine

02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:55.880
[Guest]: and a half hours away in a timing sense, and you know, total travel time 20 hours each

02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:56.880
[Guest]: way.

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:03.440
[Guest]: Like sometimes I used to come to New York for a day or 36 hours and go back, I had my

02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:07.600
[Guest]: son was in a play and I really wanted to watch one show.

02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.360
[Guest]: So I remember I landed on Saturday morning, I watched the show at 2pm and I took the 8pm

02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:15.120
[Guest]: flight back because I had to be at RBI on the job.

02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:18.280
[Guest]: So it was quite crazy in some ways.

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:24.080
[Guest]: But you know, sometimes you are in the midst of things and costs don't actually bear upon

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.080
[Guest]: you.

02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:26.080
[Guest]: So that was I would say second.

02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:32.320
[Guest]: The third, see, I have a slightly different take on central banking than what a lot of

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:33.920
[Guest]: central bankers do.

02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:38.800
[Guest]: A lot of central bankers say even if they've been academics in the past, that real world

02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:40.600
[Guest]: is very complex.

02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:45.920
[Guest]: You can't use your frameworks, you have to be willing to think on the fly, etc.

02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:48.400
[Guest]: And of course, all of that is true.

02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:51.800
[Guest]: But I disagree with not being able to use frameworks.

02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:57.000
[Guest]: In my view, it is so complex, the problems are so complex that unless you discipline

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:03.080
[Guest]: yourself and think through an organizing framework, it doesn't have to be academic.

02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:10.680
[Guest]: But you do need to do analytical thinking that clarifies what are the big issues, what

02:51:10.680 --> 02:51:14.920
[Guest]: is the key diagnosis of the underlying problem?

02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:20.660
[Guest]: And based on that diagnosis, what is the ideal reform or policy that you want?

02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:25.940
[Guest]: What are the political or other constraints in the system?

02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:30.840
[Guest]: And what is the best way to actually then advocate for change and make it happen?

02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:33.640
[Guest]: Sometimes you can make the change yourself.

02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:37.160
[Guest]: Sometimes you have to work with others to make the change.

02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:43.800
[Guest]: My approach was that my speeches, which are combined in the book along with this new detailed

02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:50.440
[Guest]: introductory chapter, I thought my speeches were basically an advocacy for change.

02:51:50.440 --> 02:51:54.560
[Guest]: They were sometimes written right from first principles.

02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:56.960
[Guest]: Some of them are a little more advanced.

02:51:56.960 --> 02:52:02.680
[Guest]: But whatever way, invariably at the end, whether it was resolution of bank loans, setting up

02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:08.400
[Guest]: of a public credit registry to satirize and democratize credit in India, whether it was

02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:13.160
[Guest]: about striking the right balance between the government and the central bank, whatever

02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:19.680
[Guest]: the issue be, they were always meant to actually provide a diagnosis of the key underlying

02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:23.360
[Guest]: problem and then push for a change.

02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:29.320
[Guest]: My ideas may not have been the best ones, but I think if you push for change, you advocate

02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:34.480
[Guest]: for change, what you want is a public discourse, a public debate.

02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:42.560
[Guest]: And if that bubbles up, then you get better ideas and you get some movement towards the

02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:43.640
[Guest]: right solutions.

02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:49.040
[Guest]: As you rightly pointed out, it's not just about a central bank.

02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:55.520
[Guest]: It's about the fact that there is common man and the economy, there is the government.

02:52:55.520 --> 02:53:03.080
[Guest]: And very often the narratives have to be brought together to meet at a point where politics

02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:08.400
[Guest]: and the economics align with what, in my case, the central bank would do.

02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:11.520
[Guest]: And I think building that narrative is important.

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:18.520
[Guest]: It's key to lend it some reason and an objectivity in the decision making.

02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.400
[Guest]: And I think that's a part of the challenge.

02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:26.480
[Guest]: And I think I'm very happy, I'm very grateful to the governors I worked with, especially

02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:35.160
[Guest]: Governor Patel for giving me a lot of freedom to speak as a deputy governor and sort of

02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:36.960
[Guest]: being this agent for change.

02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:39.200
[Guest]: And I see the book as just a continuation.

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:44.520
[Guest]: I wasn't sure when I left the Reserve Bank of India, whether I would do something like

02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:47.680
[Guest]: this as a historical account.

02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:52.120
[Guest]: It's mainly my speeches, but with that historical account as the common lessons I learned in

02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:59.360
[Guest]: the introductory chapter on fiscal dominance, I thought I may just let it be and move on.

02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:04.920
[Guest]: But the more I spoke to the former governors and deputy governors and reflected myself,

02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:11.680
[Guest]: it became clear that you are on a continuous trajectory of pushing for change.

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:13.840
[Guest]: There are no full stops.

02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:20.680
[Guest]: You want to use your knowledge, experience, historical account to try and constantly push

02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:23.360
[Guest]: the system into the right direction.

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:32.280
[Guest]: I think I've been very dispassionate and objective in my discussion of the problems.

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:38.320
[Guest]: I've tried to just push for economics wherever they are well grounded.

02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:45.120
[Guest]: And whatever I see as the clear stream of reason emerging out of that thinking.

02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:48.280
[Guest]: And you know, hopefully it travels to the right place.

02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:53.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I was just quite alarmed to know that you had contemplated not writing the book

02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:57.600
[Amit Varma]: because on my own behalf and on behalf of many of my listeners who I think are surely

02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:00.680
[Amit Varma]: going to be future readers of your book, I want to thank you for writing it.

02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:05.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, while you were just talking about why you took up the assignment, you pointed

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.280
[Amit Varma]: out that, you know, one of the things that reassured you was that you knew you would

02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:09.800
[Amit Varma]: have a voice.

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:14.560
[Amit Varma]: And I have heard you say elsewhere, and I found it very poignant, that your exit was

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.080
[Amit Varma]: a kind of voice.

02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:21.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in an interview that you did with Ira Duggal, you, you know, spoke about

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:26.000
[Amit Varma]: the time you left and the sort of how you push back against the short termism or whatever

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.000
[Amit Varma]: pressures there were.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And you said, quote, when these came to a head, the central bank has to have the ability

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:34.360
[Amit Varma]: to say no when that is not in the public interest.

02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:38.600
[Amit Varma]: We did say no, we put up exactly the right defense and resistance that needed to be put

02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.880
[Amit Varma]: up in the face of such pressures.

02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:43.740
[Amit Varma]: Whatever defense we put up was entirely in the public interest.

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:47.920
[Amit Varma]: The country is far better off that our banks are not in worse shape than what they could

02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:50.400
[Amit Varma]: have been given the pressures on us at that time.

02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I think it came at a huge professional cost to some of us.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.520
[Amit Varma]: But given the mandate of the RBI, and given what we interpreted that mandate to be, we

02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:01.440
[Amit Varma]: thought we had to pay the price, stop quote.

02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:04.640
[Amit Varma]: There are a couple of questions here, and one is, of course, the question about the

02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.160
[Amit Varma]: political economy itself, that you go in there, you have a clear framework, you're professionals,

02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:10.880
[Amit Varma]: you know what is the right thing to do.

02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:14.640
[Amit Varma]: But all of these reforms that you laid out earlier in the episode, and that you've, you

02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:20.040
[Amit Varma]: know, elaborated upon so lucidly in your book, how likely are they to happen?

02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Just given the incentives of the political players in question, number two, how hard

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:27.520
[Amit Varma]: was that struggle for you?

02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Did it get frustrating?

02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Did it seem rewarding at times?

02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And thirdly, what kind of struck me is that, you know, when I think of the way some of

02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:40.960
[Amit Varma]: the protagonists here involved, really fought for the good ideas, which in this case by

02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.240
[Amit Varma]: V, I presume you meant yourself and Governor Patel, you know, in a democratic republic,

02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:49.000
[Amit Varma]: we can't depend on people of principle to come and do the right thing.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, we need rules of the game to be laid down, everybody who comes won't fight

02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:54.400
[Amit Varma]: for the same principles.

02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:58.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, some will toe the line, and that's just over a long term, that's completely

02:56:58.880 --> 02:56:59.880
[Amit Varma]: inevitable.

02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:01.120
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of it?

02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:02.720
[Amit Varma]: One, was it a futile battle?

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Two, can the battle actually be won given the way the system is already designed in

02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:11.200
[Amit Varma]: the way it exists and the way everybody's incentives are?

02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is basically my penultimate question.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.400
[Amit Varma]: I'll have one more after this.

02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes, yes.

02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:19.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, let's go through the three questions in sequence, because it's a very

02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:21.640
[Guest]: interesting thread, actually.

02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:28.880
[Guest]: So first, I would say, I think the question to me is, I think this goes back to the theme

02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:30.680
[Guest]: you have been raising on and off.

02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:35.280
[Guest]: The question to me is, what is it that the people of India want?

02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:37.840
[Guest]: Is economics on their agenda or not?

02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:39.760
[Guest]: Do they want growth or not?

02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:45.320
[Guest]: Do they want their children and youth to have high skilled jobs down the line or not?

02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:53.280
[Guest]: Or do they really want what looks like easy distribution of subsidies by the government,

02:57:53.280 --> 02:58:00.080
[Guest]: low growth, low productivity, and, you know, cozy public sector banking jobs, which are

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:06.040
[Guest]: highly unproductive for the rest of the economy and eventually also for themselves and their

02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:08.000
[Guest]: children and youth down the line?

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:13.200
[Guest]: I think this is a deeper question I just want to raise.

02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:18.280
[Guest]: I would think the economics should be a lot more on people's minds than what it seems

02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:19.280
[Guest]: to be.

02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:22.800
[Guest]: Maybe it is, but it is not getting vocalized as much.

02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:28.480
[Guest]: There are distractions of various types, and maybe they are taking over.

02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:33.040
[Guest]: But as we said, the right reforms will happen when the politics and economics aligned or

02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:37.920
[Guest]: when they are thrust upon us by an unfortunate shock or a crisis.

02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:43.000
[Guest]: It's better to be in the first situation where politics and economics align and to that everyone

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.240
[Guest]: has a responsibility.

02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:48.280
[Guest]: I think they have to want the reforms, they have to want the economic change for the long

02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:49.280
[Guest]: run.

02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:55.920
[Guest]: I think the narratives, the public discourse, the debate are an attempt to bring together

02:58:55.920 --> 02:58:58.480
[Guest]: that confluence of politics and economics.

02:58:58.480 --> 02:59:05.440
[Guest]: But I do think that no one individual can just simply relegate the responsibility to

02:59:05.440 --> 02:59:08.200
[Guest]: everyone else in the end.

02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:10.400
[Guest]: Second, was it frustrating?

02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:11.400
[Guest]: Not at all.

02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:17.160
[Guest]: You know, I expected the problems to be severe, as I told you, that India chapter in my Guarantee

02:59:17.160 --> 02:59:23.760
[Guest]: to Fail book, just yesterday I read it again, and I actually felt that, oh, actually the

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:29.080
[Guest]: same thing happened, you know, it all happened all over again, whatever the problems flagged

02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:31.120
[Amit Varma]: in that chapter after eight or nine years.

02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:36.240
[Guest]: And sometimes that is the beauty of economics, that when you learn robust lessons from past

02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:42.320
[Guest]: experiences, and you are able to extrapolate with the right caution, you actually realize

02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:47.400
[Guest]: that the underlying economics and political forces are likely to play out unless you fundamentally

02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:48.400
[Guest]: shift them.

02:59:48.400 --> 02:59:51.680
[Guest]: I think the pressures that we faced were anticipated.

02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:58.800
[Guest]: I think they were a bit more, if I could say, they were a bit more open, and maybe a bit

02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:05.280
[Guest]: more concentrated because of the short term pressures that we were alluding to in 2018.

03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:11.280
[Guest]: It was also a challenging period because there were some other shocks, you know, oil prices

03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:16.000
[Guest]: were going through the roof between April to October 18, creating a current account

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:17.000
[Guest]: deficit problem.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:24.800
[Guest]: We had the non-bank finance sector and related banking sector issues in September, August,

03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:26.180
[Guest]: September of 2018.

03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:28.000
[Guest]: So it was a very complex mix.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:32.440
[Guest]: I tried to describe it to an extent in the previous chapter.

03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:34.560
[Guest]: But no, I was never frustrated.

03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:37.080
[Guest]: I think I tried to do my job.

03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:41.920
[Guest]: At some point, I had to take a call on whether what I thought were the key issues, which

03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:47.560
[Guest]: were now the intertwining of the fiscal and financial, whether being in the central bank

03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:51.760
[Guest]: was the right position to raise these issues or being outside.

03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:57.480
[Guest]: And that combined with my personal situation meant that it was better to be outside.

03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:01.260
[Guest]: But exit was a form of voice to raise these issues.

03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:06.760
[Guest]: And therefore, in the end, I decided to write the book because I wanted to flag these issues,

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:10.480
[Guest]: both as a historical account for everyone to see.

03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:13.280
[Guest]: In fact, I've even put my minutes verbatim.

03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:16.920
[Guest]: I have not even changed the description of the speeches.

03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:21.560
[Guest]: I have not tried to provide any narrative in hindsight because I wanted to record them

03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:27.880
[Guest]: as they were given rather than with the benefit of hindsight around, you know, what they meant.

03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:33.800
[Guest]: Of course, the introduction chapter is entirely new and binds everything together.

03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:39.320
[Guest]: The good news is I won't have done anything differently if I was given a rerun.

03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:46.080
[Guest]: And I always had this clarity inside me that I want to be able to sleep at night with a

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:48.960
[Guest]: no regret outcome for the day.

03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:54.120
[Guest]: If I could change something in the right direction based on my assessment of it, I should make

03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:58.440
[Guest]: an earnest effort to do it and, you know, you accept whatever comes out of it.

03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:05.000
[Guest]: These are very complex problems, complex sets of forces involved, not just economic, but

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000
[Guest]: also political, as you mentioned.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.640
[Guest]: And third and the last question, can you can you repeat what was the last point?

03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:17.960
[Amit Varma]: My third was sort of a thinking aloud of how we cannot depend on many principles.

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:18.960
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:19.960
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:24.120
[Guest]: And in fact, this is my thrust all along the book, which is that we have to strengthen

03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:25.360
[Guest]: our institutions.

03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:33.600
[Guest]: I think I'm very clear that this idea that a country can be made just on the basis of

03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:37.760
[Guest]: a few individuals, of course, it is about individuals in the end, it's individuals who

03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:40.440
[Guest]: have to make the institution stronger.

03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:45.640
[Guest]: But as a framework for thinking about what the country needs, I think what we lack in

03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:56.560
[Guest]: a significant measure is that our key institutions, enforcement of contracts, rule of law, the

03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:03.040
[Guest]: independence of the financial regulatory processes, I think these need to be given greater sanctity

03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:07.800
[Guest]: in the letter of the law, in their execution and implementation.

03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:15.680
[Guest]: And they have to be more robust over long stretches of time to short term political,

03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.280
[Guest]: industrial or other kinds of captures where the pressures might come from.

03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:26.800
[Guest]: I think I see the independence or the operational autonomy of the central bank as a small piece

03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:32.320
[Guest]: of this bigger puzzle that we have to solve on on strengthening our institution.

03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:38.320
[Guest]: I think if our institutions are strong, if we get the right individuals, we will blossom

03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:39.320
[Guest]: even further.

03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:45.200
[Guest]: But if our institutions are weak, even with the right individuals, we might not be able

03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:46.200
[Guest]: to make progress.

03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:51.320
[Guest]: And I think that to me, is what we have to tackle.

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:56.280
[Guest]: A lot of the reforms are proposed, a lot of the reforms that are proposed in the individual

03:03:56.280 --> 03:04:02.200
[Guest]: speeches, they are all about actually strengthening the institutions of the country in the financial

03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:04.160
[Guest]: sector decision making.

03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:10.160
[Guest]: And I think COVID has in a difficult way, I think, offered us the right opportunity

03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:13.560
[Guest]: to undertake some of these institutional changes.

03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:14.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:18.880
[Amit Varma]: So my final question, which is, you know, something I ask all my guests on whatever

03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:23.400
[Amit Varma]: is the subject we're speaking about, and, you know, you've been an insider in the system,

03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:28.480
[Amit Varma]: you are, you know, you're intimately aware of all the nooks and crannies of the politics

03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:29.940
[Amit Varma]: and the economics of it.

03:04:29.940 --> 03:04:35.680
[Amit Varma]: If I ask you to look forward 10 years to the year 2030, and where India could be then,

03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.360
[Amit Varma]: what's like a best case scenario and a worst case scenario for you or to phrase it differently,

03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:45.520
[Amit Varma]: what gives you hope and what gives you despair about the trajectory of events right now?

03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:53.560
[Guest]: See, I think what happens with having a financial sector that is not doing very well, what happens

03:04:53.560 --> 03:05:03.080
[Guest]: with fiscal situation that's a bit overstretched, what happens with lack of adequate decentralization

03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:09.400
[Guest]: and privatization of the sectors of the economy is that outcomes become very risky, they start

03:05:09.400 --> 03:05:13.560
[Guest]: depending too much on political decisions that will be taken.

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:17.520
[Guest]: And of course, many people think this is actually a defining characteristic of what's an emerging

03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:22.600
[Guest]: market versus what's a developed economy, which is that politics should not matter too

03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:26.840
[Guest]: much to the end outcomes, because politics is mattering more and more even in developed

03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:27.840
[Guest]: economies.

03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:33.680
[Guest]: To me, that's a sign that they are also actually down, not such a great path in many cases.

03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:39.200
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is that I think the risks have risen, in my view, not just

03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:44.760
[Guest]: because of COVID, but because of our pre-COVID conditions as well, COVID has exacerbated

03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:45.760
[Guest]: these risks.

03:05:45.760 --> 03:05:54.360
[Guest]: If we take the transformational institutional reform path on fiscal, financial, and real

03:05:54.360 --> 03:06:00.000
[Guest]: economy, I think given that the rest of the world is on average also sliding on to not

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:06.200
[Guest]: such a great path, we could actually emerge as very important winners in the process in

03:06:06.200 --> 03:06:07.200
[Guest]: my view.

03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:14.760
[Guest]: Viewed this way, this could be a golden opportunity for India, without doing much on our own.

03:06:14.760 --> 03:06:19.560
[Guest]: The world is looking to diversify its supply chains away from China, and given our size,

03:06:19.560 --> 03:06:23.880
[Guest]: given our workforce base, we are a natural contender.

03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:29.600
[Guest]: So the question is, do we contend well, given that this opportunity has arisen?

03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:34.040
[Guest]: And will we do what is required to really make it count?

03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:39.200
[Guest]: I think, as I say in the first sentence of my appeal, no country can take growth for

03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:40.200
[Guest]: granted.

03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:44.480
[Guest]: It is like you have to invest in it every single day.

03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:48.400
[Guest]: Sometimes you have made a big investment and then you can milk it for a while, but you

03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:49.600
[Guest]: have to keep at it.

03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:51.720
[Guest]: You simply can't take growth for granted.

03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:59.640
[Guest]: No country is so good or strong that they can grow for decades without actually undertaking

03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:02.800
[Guest]: more transformation along the way.

03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:08.440
[Guest]: So that's the rosy part, that if we take the right institutional reforms in fiscal, financial,

03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:13.400
[Guest]: and real side, the global situation is such that India could actually emerge to be a very

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:14.600
[Guest]: significant beneficiary.

03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:17.320
[Guest]: See, we have always done well in services.

03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:21.000
[Guest]: Where we have not done well is in manufacturing.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:27.120
[Guest]: And where we have, I would say, finally shown signs of some conviction and intent is on

03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:28.120
[Guest]: the agri side.

03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:34.160
[Guest]: But on agri side, I think you need also consolidation of the sector, so that a lot of our agri labor

03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:40.600
[Guest]: can actually move into higher paying and better skilled jobs over a period of time.

03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:45.960
[Guest]: So to me, that's the rosy outcome that politics and economics indeed align, recognize the

03:07:45.960 --> 03:07:50.880
[Guest]: opportunity that exists both in a global and in a domestic sense.

03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:56.160
[Guest]: In a global sense, it's an opportunity, in a domestic sense, it's a necessity.

03:07:56.160 --> 03:08:00.060
[Guest]: But it's not going to come without taking tough actions.

03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:01.800
[Guest]: What is the bad scenario?

03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:07.600
[Guest]: The bad scenario is one in which we don't get out of this regression of the last 10

03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:14.000
[Guest]: years in going for more centralization, going for more quick fixes, to pump priming of the

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:21.520
[Guest]: economy, rather than actually putting in real pillars of fiscal, financial and real stability

03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:23.960
[Guest]: for the next two or three decades.

03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:28.960
[Guest]: If we go down that path, we just keep doing band-aids on our fiscal, financial and the

03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:35.660
[Guest]: real economy side, I think we will see an erosion of the growth potential of the economy

03:08:35.660 --> 03:08:42.000
[Guest]: on a steady basis, loss of productivity, loss of the ability to create good jobs and high

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.440
[Guest]: skilled jobs.

03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:53.840
[Guest]: And it could just be, it could be sort of stagnation of growth, whether our supply side

03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:59.980
[Guest]: remains benign, and doesn't allow inflation to pick up down the line, or whether inflation

03:08:59.980 --> 03:09:01.120
[Guest]: also starts rising.

03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:06.200
[Guest]: If inflation starts rising with stagnating growth, that would be a very, very terrible

03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:08.120
[Guest]: stagflationary outcome.

03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:12.560
[Guest]: Typically high debt situations also have their own deflationary pressures.

03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:19.680
[Guest]: And so my sense is a bad scenario, a really bad scenario would be stagflation, a scenario

03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:27.640
[Guest]: not as bad as that would be a stagnation of growth, but with also kind of very low inflation

03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:28.880
[Guest]: or even deflation.

03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:37.440
[Guest]: I think so, I think a course correction, if undertaken, could put us closer to the rosy

03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:38.440
[Guest]: path.

03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:45.120
[Guest]: But if we don't course correct, I think, I do fear that we are slipping in terms of our

03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:47.640
[Guest]: growth potential.

03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:48.640
[Guest]: That worries me.

03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:55.760
[Guest]: But therefore, I hope that the book, the chapter, some of the messages in there at a minimum,

03:09:55.760 --> 03:10:03.440
[Guest]: they get more individuals to think about economics in what they are demanding from the system.

03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:07.960
[Guest]: As I said, you know, the ideas I have may not be the right ones, but I think they certainly

03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:11.200
[Guest]: seem to be relevant questions for India.

03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:19.280
[Guest]: And so hopefully, public debate can push the system closer to the rosier path than the

03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:21.160
[Guest]: worst scenarios that I outlined.

03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:24.800
[Amit Varma]: Viral, I love reading your book, and I enjoyed talking to you today, I think I've learned

03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:29.160
[Amit Varma]: so much and it'll take me some time to, you know, listen to the episode again and process

03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:30.160
[Amit Varma]: everything.

03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:31.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for your time and insights.

03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:32.160
[Guest]: No, thank you, Amit.

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:40.240
[Guest]: It's been a terrific conversation and all the best to you and all the listeners and

03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:44.960
[Guest]: to your loved ones for staying safe and healthy during these challenging and difficult times.

03:10:44.960 --> 03:10:48.760
[Guest]: I hope that the curve is about to peak soon.

03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:54.240
[Guest]: It shows showing some signs of declining over the last week or two, and I hope it has as

03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:59.520
[Guest]: steady a decline as New York City had post mid-April.

03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:04.000
[Guest]: For the last three, four months, I would love to see that every day I wake up and I see

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.480
[Guest]: I type India coronavirus cases.

03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:11.280
[Guest]: That's my first thing I type because I want to see that the curve is steadily declining

03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:17.080
[Guest]: for several weeks in a row so that we can start dealing with the post-COVID recovery

03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:19.280
[Amit Varma]: phase very soon.

03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:21.200
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:25.280
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode, hop on over to your nearest online or offline

03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:30.560
[Amit Varma]: bookstore and pick up Viral Acharya's book, Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in

03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:31.560
[Amit Varma]: India.

03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:35.560
[Amit Varma]: The show notes contain various other links, including interviews of his, so check that

03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:36.560
[Amit Varma]: out.

03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:39.360
[Amit Varma]: Viral is not on social media, which is hardly a surprise.

03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:43.240
[Amit Varma]: He is already viral, so why should he care about going even more viral?

03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:48.760
[Amit Varma]: You can follow me on Twitter at Amit Verma, that's A-M-I-T-V-A-R-M-A, where I promise

03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:52.760

03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:57.080
[Amit Varma]: You can browse past episodes of The Seen and the Unseen at seenunseen.in.

03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:26.360
