00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.800
[Amit Varma]: What is Democracy?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Democracy doesn't just mean voting one political party to power for five years and then sitting

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.800
[Amit Varma]: back and hoping it all works out.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Democracy only functions well when there are safeguards that keep a check on the people

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.760
[Amit Varma]: in power and mechanisms that keep governments transparent and accountable.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.680
[Amit Varma]: In India, though, democracy has become just a once-in-five-years samasha.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.840
[Amit Varma]: Democracy is an opaque, parasitic beast that sucks citizens dry while delivering no services

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
[Amit Varma]: to them.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.480
[Amit Varma]: And the elections that happen every five years are a contest between competing mafias, all

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480
[Amit Varma]: of them trying to bribe their way to power one way or another so they can rake it in

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.200
[Amit Varma]: while we suffer silently.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.400
[Amit Varma]: What is a citizen to do?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhatma.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.400
[Amit Varma]: I tend to be a pessimist when it comes to government.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.640
[Amit Varma]: Governments never grow smaller.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.680
[Amit Varma]: It is in the nature of the beast to grow and grow like a parasite sucking the blood of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: the common citizen.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And yet, we can't just sit there and let it happen.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.340
[Amit Varma]: We need to fight back for our own sakes.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And my guest today is a man who has spent two decades doing just that.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: V. Ravi Chander, a businessman based in Bangalore, describes himself as a civic evangelist and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.920
[Amit Varma]: a patron saint of lost causes.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.640
[Amit Varma]: While those around him have merely outraged, he has actually dived into the cesspool that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.720
[Amit Varma]: is local government and worked hard on bringing about reform.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.080
[Amit Varma]: I caught up with him at the sidelines of the Bangalore Literature Festival a few weeks

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.120
[Amit Varma]: ago, and I found his insights to be incredibly thought-provoking.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.720
[Amit Varma]: Without any further ado, here it is.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Ravi, welcome to the show.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
[Guest]: Thanks Amit for having me.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Ravi, I'm really glad to have you here.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've been working in the field of urban governance for the last 17 years.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: You're described by people as a civic evangelist.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've described yourself as a patron saint of lost causes.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.440
[Amit Varma]: So I want to delve a little further into this.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Why?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even though you're being ironic, why did urban governance seem like such a lost

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.580
[Amit Varma]: cause to you?

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And clearly you don't really feel that way because you've been at it for 17 years.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320
[Guest]: That's true.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.560
[Guest]: Actually, it all started in 2000, when we had the Bangalore Agenda Task Force.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.960
[Guest]: And Nandan asked whether I would serve on that.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.160
[Guest]: And I had no idea what urban governance was about.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.000
[Guest]: That's Nandan Nalekani, who's been an old friend of yours.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Guest]: That's right.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[Guest]: That's right.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
[Guest]: So I had no idea.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
[Guest]: And I said, okay.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.560
[Guest]: And trust me, within the first month of working in the space with civic authorities and the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.040
[Guest]: like, I just got hooked.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.200
[Guest]: I realized that this was an area that could do with a lot of reform.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.160
[Guest]: That was the obvious thing when you go with a private sector consulting mind.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.320
[Guest]: But as you worked within the system, you realize how dysfunctional it was, how difficult it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.240
[Guest]: was to get outcomes that people want in the city space.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.680
[Guest]: And when you work in an environment like that, you suddenly start thinking about what can

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.920
[Guest]: you do differently.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.440
[Guest]: And I'll talk about the property tax reform that we did at that point of time.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.040
[Guest]: How you can make a difference in the public space with innovative ideas from outside.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.360
[Guest]: The reason for patron saint for lost causes, after 17 years, well, we have Bangalore's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.120
[Guest]: traffic, we have Bangalore's potholes, and a whole lot more.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.460
[Guest]: So at one level, it's a lost cause in the sense that it's not getting fixed.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.680
[Guest]: But at another level, even when you make an inch of positive movement in the space, it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.400
[Guest]: gives you a whole lot of confidence that change is possible.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.880
[Guest]: And that's the reason I've been at it for 17 years in Bangalore and some other cities.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.760
[Amit Varma]: And even an inch of positive movement in the context and given the scale is actually a

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.000
[Guest]: heck of a lot of...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
[Guest]: I think so.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.640
[Guest]: In fact, I think you're going to see change in the space incrementally, marginally better

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.800
[Guest]: tomorrow compared to things.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.680
[Guest]: I don't think you're going to see a dramatic day and night difference in urban governance.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.320
[Guest]: And here, actually, I'd like to take, for example, the property tax that I mentioned

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.320
[Guest]: earlier.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.840
[Guest]: Now, back in 2000, before that, we had a system of property tax, where the revenue inspector

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.100
[Guest]: came and decided what tax you needed to pay.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.280
[Guest]: And there was an adjustment between the revenue inspector and the house owner in terms of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.320
[Guest]: the tax paid and the money to be paid to him.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.000
[Guest]: We came up in 2000 with a self-assessment scheme of property tax built on a basic premise.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.360
[Guest]: Trust the citizen to tell the truth, rather than a revenue officer to uncover a lie.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320
[Guest]: So you make a very simple system by which people can comply.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.640
[Guest]: And what we noticed in that process is that more and more people chose to come forward

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.780
[Guest]: under the self-assessment scheme.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.020
[Guest]: And if you see the statistics in Bangalore, property tax over the last 17 years has collections

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.020
[Guest]: have jumped over 20 times under the self-assessment scheme.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.560
[Guest]: So the point really is, if you think differently about an issue like property tax, rather than

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.720
[Guest]: having a command and control revenue inspector Raj, you have a citizen trusting system, you

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.480
[Guest]: suddenly find that change is possible.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, when you told me the story earlier, when we were having breakfast today,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.080
[Amit Varma]: it kind of blew my mind because it's very counterintuitive.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.640
[Amit Varma]: It's the opposite way people, you know, people in government generally think, oh, we have

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.360
[Amit Varma]: to control the citizens, we have to bring them to heel.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And here what you're saying is no, leave him alone, let him self-assess, trust the guy,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.200
[Amit Varma]: he'll do it.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.800
[Amit Varma]: And one reason it worked, of course, as you pointed out, was that under the older rent

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.520
[Amit Varma]: seeking regime, you would have a certain amount of money going to bribes and a certain amount

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.160
[Amit Varma]: of money going to taxes.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And here, even though the tax collection was higher, because they were paying zero bribes,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.320
[Amit Varma]: they benefited as well by paying less.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.680
[Guest]: Actually, the system started getting more money, and the revenue inspector was starved

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680
[Guest]: of his bribe.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.880
[Guest]: That was the essential reform that we did.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.440
[Guest]: And it worked because citizens loved it.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.760
[Guest]: And the other thing I realized in that process, that once citizens taste something that they

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.720
[Guest]: love in the civic space, it's almost very difficult to reverse it.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.320
[Guest]: In fact, the system did try to reverse the self-assessment scheme.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.760
[Guest]: But citizens protested saying, we like it, we want this.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.000
[Guest]: So the way to get change in the civic space is get the citizens to taste the good things

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.320
[Guest]: that are possible.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.280
[Guest]: And that's the way change is possible.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.440
[Amit Varma]: How hard was it to, for example, convince people about this kind of thinking when you

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.320
[Amit Varma]: first started doing your pro bono evangelism?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Because typically in government, people just want to expand their own power, the incentives

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.200
[Amit Varma]: are towards increase your budgets and increase rent seeking opportunities.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And government never actually reduces power or gives up control.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And like this property tax incident, you mentioned itself seems to me almost unbelievable, like

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.440
[Amit Varma]: why would they just allow that opportunity for them to go away.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.160
[Amit Varma]: But in general, while you had this one success, do you find that mindsets are an impediment

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.560
[Guest]: to getting things done?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.720
[Guest]: Without a doubt.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.440
[Guest]: In fact, you know, it's about power.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440
[Guest]: It's about money.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.000
[Guest]: There's a whole lot of money riding on projects.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.360
[Guest]: In fact, you know, anecdotally, I've built estimates of the kind of leakage in civic

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.600
[Guest]: projects.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.480
[Guest]: And if you include ghost works, the extent of leakage in civic projects is almost about

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480
[Guest]: 50-55%.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.040
[Guest]: That's the level, but including ghost works.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.120
[Guest]: So but typically you can say as a rule of thumb, 25-30% in a project is definitely gone.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.080
[Guest]: So what are ghost works for just for my listeners, because, okay, so I found there were five

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680
[Guest]: categories of ghost works, for example.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.320
[Guest]: So you'll find project works, which you know, there's a reason why they name roads with

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.760
[Guest]: new names.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.840
[Guest]: So if you go actually to the project file, there will be one work in the old name of

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.960
[Guest]: the road and the same work in the new name of the road.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.720
[Guest]: And unless you know that both the roads are the same, you already created one ghost work.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.200
[Guest]: I have seen projects which say that while going northwards, the left side of the road,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest]: and the same road project being described going the other way as the right side of the

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.640
[Guest]: road.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
[Guest]: So that's another one.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.880
[Guest]: Then another one, you have private sector people coming and saying, I will do this road

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.240
[Guest]: for you.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.040
[Guest]: Now, the civic system waits for that road to be completed as a donation by the private

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.280
[Guest]: sector.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.360
[Guest]: And then they raise the same thing as a job in their works, because the work's already

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.400
[Guest]: done.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.240
[Guest]: And that's another kind of ghost work and I could go on.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.600
[Guest]: The problem really is we have a pretty dysfunctional system and it's a long road back to fix it.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.440
[Guest]: And corruption and this is clearly one important thing to deal with.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.920
[Guest]: The other thing really is we want to bring change in this place.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.580
[Guest]: I think if you ask for change in terms of giving up power, etc., it's not going to happen.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.880
[Guest]: So you have to work in terms of making the benefit case for the person doing it.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.520
[Guest]: So for example, I hate to say it, but they like projects.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.320
[Guest]: So if they see the possible projects at the end of this road, for example, in the case

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: of property tax, the reason why they don't mind getting more money is the ability to

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.420
[Guest]: do more projects.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.720
[Guest]: So they are okay with doing this because they know their downstream benefits with more money

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
[Amit Varma]: in the system.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.400
[Amit Varma]: That's a very perverse kind of reality check for me, because what it means is that whenever

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.640
[Amit Varma]: you then sell a plan or a project to these guys, you're not selling it to them because

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.240
[Amit Varma]: it's good for the citizens.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.280
[Amit Varma]: You're selling it to them.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.900
[Amit Varma]: You're keeping their own self-interest in mind that, hey, I love projects at the end

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.280
[Amit Varma]: of this, or I'll be, you know, I love this much more.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280
[Guest]: We don't know.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.760
[Guest]: I mean, they have that in mind because they are able to smell the opportunities.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.120
[Guest]: In fact, we are naive.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.920
[Guest]: We are just saying these are good things to do.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.960
[Guest]: And their mind is clicking away saying, what are the possible downstream benefits of doing

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
[Amit Varma]: this?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.520
[Amit Varma]: But over time, I guess you do keep into account how they are looking at it as well.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520
[Guest]: Without a doubt.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.640
[Guest]: In fact, I keep saying, you know, the problem with a lot of theoreticians who give suggestions

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.520
[Guest]: in the civic space, they come from what I call a systems theory outlook.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.720
[Guest]: In a systems theory, it's this orderly world, everybody knows their place and things are

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.600
[Guest]: happening in an orderly way.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.840
[Guest]: I always say that in this space, very crudely, we need a modified game theory.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
[Guest]: Everybody has an agenda.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.920
[Guest]: They have their own goals and objectives.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.660
[Guest]: And the trick to get good outcomes, good people wanting good outcomes have to understand everyone's

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.000
[Guest]: motivation and find an alignment of stars of these diverse group of people, which gets

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.440
[Guest]: you the good outcomes, but they believe that they're getting what they want.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.880
[Guest]: So I really feel that we need this whole new science to develop of what I crudely call

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.920
[Guest]: modified game theory.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.960
[Guest]: Because frankly, to sit back and say people must be good, they must do good things is

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.260
[Guest]: not going to happen.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.840
[Guest]: So we have to realize it's an imperfect world.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.080
[Guest]: And as I mentioned earlier, dysfunctional setup, the trick is to really figure out how

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.440
[Guest]: to navigate this system and still get some good out there.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.360
[Amit Varma]: That seems deeply complex, because you have all these self-interested actors acting in

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.480
[Amit Varma]: their own self-interest very rationally with different ends.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And to find a way to sort of nudge them in the same direction, it seems a very hard task.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Let me...

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600
[Guest]: Sorry.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.560
[Guest]: So there actually, Amit, I'd like to come in, for example, lots of people mentioned

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.480
[Guest]: that a directly elected mayor in the city is the way to go, for instance, which is really

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.480
[Guest]: the second tier of state government giving their powers to the third tier of city government.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.680
[Guest]: Not going to happen because this is where the power lies, but you want them to give

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680
[Guest]: away power.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.680
[Guest]: In fact, I think there's even a private member's bill in parliament seeking directly elected

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680
[Guest]: mayor.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680
[Guest]: It's not going to happen.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.720
[Guest]: But if you start thinking about how it could potentially happen, if you look at our history,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.200
[Guest]: Sardar Patel, Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, they're all city mayors.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.680
[Guest]: They cut their teeth in city government before they went to state and national politics.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.600
[Guest]: So the way potentially to think about directly elected mayor is if we got the political dynasties

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.560
[Guest]: of different parties, their children to convince their parents that I could be the mayor of

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.800
[Guest]: the city, let's go for that route.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.080
[Guest]: And if they did it across parties, it has a greater chance of you getting the directly

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.720
[Guest]: elected mayor because different political scions of political families are saying this

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.360
[Guest]: is the way to go.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.360
[Guest]: Then saying that the state must give away power to the third tier of city government

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.960
[Guest]: because that is not going to happen.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.760
[Guest]: So this is my example of thinking in terms of what could motivate people to give away

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.360
[Guest]: power to a third tier that lies with the political system.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.080
[Amit Varma]: And we've got to figure out how to make that happen.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Which is very interesting and pragmatic and something I hadn't thought of where what you're

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.720
[Amit Varma]: essentially saying is that there are limits to democratic advocacy within the system.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.960
[Amit Varma]: So instead you subverted by talking to the privileged elite so that they can use some

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.000
[Guest]: of the privilege and taking the system in the direction that I don't want to be considered

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.800
[Guest]: as a subversive guy.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.440
[Guest]: It's just about being pragmatic.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.280
[Guest]: As you said, we all know that you need the city, you need somebody accountable, a directly

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.280
[Guest]: elected mayor.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.560
[Guest]: That's the way to go.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.200
[Guest]: Everybody by and large agrees that the question is, how do we get there?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.440
[Guest]: And to me, anything that gets us to a good outcome of that kind is worth considering.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's where I was coming to.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, people could make the philosophical argument at the end never justifies the means

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: and therefore blah, blah, blah.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.960
[Guest]: But anyway, the pragmatic guy in this space, because I'm very clear that, you know, the

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:18.840
[Guest]: ecosystem is quite compromised and it's extremely difficult to make the moral argument to do

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840
[Guest]: the right thing.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840
[Amit Varma]: So we have to navigate this minefield.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.920
[Amit Varma]: So your sense would be, look, there's too much at stake and we have to be practical

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.760
[Amit Varma]: and get things done somehow.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760
[Amit Varma]: That's my belief.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760
[Amit Varma]: However we can.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.000
[Amit Varma]: So let me now take you back to a broader fundamental question.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.200
[Amit Varma]: What is wrong with our cities today, the way they are governed?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.800
[Guest]: See first thing is there's no one in charge of the city to carry on with something I said

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800
[Guest]: earlier.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.480
[Guest]: I think that's the fundamental thing.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.920
[Guest]: It is too much under the state's control.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.160
[Guest]: So whether it's Bombay or Bangalore or Chennai, which has a problem, let's say it could be

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.800
[Guest]: flooding portals or whatever, you will find invariably the chief minister of the state

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.640
[Guest]: talking about it.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.360
[Guest]: And that's the problem.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.920
[Guest]: Why should the state chief minister who is the state chief minister be answering questions

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.960
[Guest]: about traffic and portals in a city?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.220
[Guest]: It's not his remit or her remit.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.920
[Guest]: So I think we don't have clear cut accountability and somebody in charge of the city's destiny.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.200
[Guest]: That's the start point.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.240
[Guest]: Our governance and administration structure is, those institutions have collapsed.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.160
[Guest]: There was a 74th constitutional amendment.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.280
[Guest]: We had the 73rd of Panchayati Raj for rural areas and 74th for cities.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280
[Guest]: That hasn't worked.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.120
[Guest]: There's hardly any state that has implemented it.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.360
[Guest]: So we now need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a governance and administration

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.480
[Guest]: framework for cities that can work.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.760
[Guest]: Then there is a challenge of human resources and capacity.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.480
[Guest]: You know, this World Bank came up with this thing that capacity building is the way out.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.920
[Guest]: I think it's just a thing for getting consultants jobs because the reality is what we have got

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.440
[Guest]: in the system to work with is extremely weak clay or quicksand and therefore to mold it

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.000
[Guest]: is very difficult.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.800
[Guest]: So we need a fresh infusion of ideas.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.680
[Guest]: We need to think about human resources differently.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.160
[Guest]: We need to think of lateral recruitment.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.520
[Guest]: We need to think of a commissioner who comes from outside and becomes a city commissioner.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.840
[Guest]: So we need some transformational thinking in this space.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.920
[Guest]: The other thing about cities where everybody is making a mistake is they are trying to

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.240
[Guest]: fix yesterday's problems unsuccessfully.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240
[Guest]: Band-Aid solutions.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.920
[Guest]: We're not planning ahead.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.520
[Guest]: What we really need to do if Bangalore is to work, the extended region has to work internationally.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.280
[Guest]: The focus is on city regions.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.240
[Guest]: London works because it's housed in the South England region.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.160
[Guest]: Same as the case with New York.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.880
[Guest]: So if you improve Bangalore, even marginally, another half a million people will come into

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.400
[Guest]: Bangalore and the place will collapse again.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.600
[Guest]: So unless you have a regional clusters that work as live and work, you're not going to

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.800
[Guest]: fix this problem.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.080
[Guest]: So the way we do our plans, they are also quite messed up in terms of...

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.800
[Guest]: So the master plan is nothing but a land use plan.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.960
[Guest]: It's about there's a price for the color by which various land parcels get covered.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.240
[Guest]: What you need are strategic spatial plans.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.920
[Guest]: We are nowhere there.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.120
[Guest]: I could go on and on.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.040
[Guest]: We tried to fix the inner city.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.200
[Guest]: The periphery is going for a six.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.840
[Guest]: We need a municipalization strategy to deal with the periphery.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.880
[Guest]: So there's a whole range of problems, lots of moving parts that need to be worked on

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.960
[Guest]: when you try to fix this.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.400
[Guest]: I think really governments have to figure out where do they want to start in this journey

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.920
[Guest]: and start doing something about it.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.400
[Guest]: That's really the need of the hour.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.240
[Amit Varma]: So I'll come back to regional clusters in a bit.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.520
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I want to ask you both about regional clusters and your City Connect program, which

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.200
[Amit Varma]: you carried out so successfully before that.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.520
[Amit Varma]: But just to go back to the fundamental question, like I had done an episode of the scene and

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.560
[Amit Varma]: the unseen with Shruti Rajgopalan, the economist and legal scholar, and we'd spoken about open

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560
[Amit Varma]: governance.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.200
[Amit Varma]: One of the points that she made was that the incentives are skewed because the people who

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.560
[Amit Varma]: have the power to actually do something in cities aren't accountable to you.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And the people who are accountable to you, your local corporators who you vote for directly,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.360
[Amit Varma]: don't have the power to do anything.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.020
[Amit Varma]: And you can't expect anyone to actually give away power, like you can't expect state governments

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.800
[Amit Varma]: to then say that, oh, okay, we'll empower the cities and therefore there'll be less

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.800
[Amit Varma]: money to buy votes from rural regions, which crudely put is what it comes down to.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Elections are all about bribing voters, essentially in one form or the other.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
[Guest]: That's true.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.160
[Guest]: For example, I have met MLAs who actually want to run the city and are running the city.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.680
[Guest]: And you ask yourself, essentially, when you got elected as an MLA, you signed up for the

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.680
[Guest]: state legislature and to frame laws and the like.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.080
[Guest]: If you wanted to run the city, you should be a corporator or a mayor.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.480
[Guest]: That's the whole point.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.840
[Guest]: So our whole setup is really messed up in terms of things.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.520
[Guest]: And it's a fact that, and when it comes to the corporator, you get into this whole area

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.380
[Guest]: of petty corruption, you know, people say that you don't know where the corporator ends

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.240
[Guest]: and the contractor begins.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.800
[Guest]: And you then, so consequently, every time I see a pothole, I see that nexus at work.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.800
[Amit Varma]: In fact, in Bombay, I'm amazed that people expect potholes to be permanently fixed.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.320
[Amit Varma]: It's not going to happen because it's in the corporator contractors nexus to make sure

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.320
[Amit Varma]: that roads are repaired so badly that potholes come up again and more repairs are required.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.480
[Guest]: In fact, in Bangalore, we have actually doing a project called Tender SURE, SURE stands

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.920
[Guest]: for Specification for Urban Road Execution under our City Connect platform, where we

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.920
[Guest]: have made the case that if you build your road right with stormwater drains and pedestrian

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:56.120
[Guest]: footpaths, underground utilities, and take a life cycle cost view to the investment,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.400
[Guest]: you actually end up spending much less than the half yearly pothole filling exercise model

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.800
[Guest]: that we have got.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.160
[Guest]: And we have said that if you get it right, it will cost you more upfront.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.360
[Guest]: But within four to five years, you have a payback after which you're in the positive

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360
[Guest]: zone.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.360
[Guest]: Now, the system doesn't like it.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.520
[Guest]: We have pulled off a few roads in the in the city.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.840
[Guest]: But there again, the betting has been that citizens will like the roads and say that

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.920
[Guest]: we want similar roads in our neighborhood as the way to change.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.800
[Guest]: But the system per se does not like it.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.440
[Guest]: Because it goes against the repair model every six months where there's a whole lot of money

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440
[Amit Varma]: right.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.320
[Amit Varma]: So my question then is to come back from the earlier point about power and accountability

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.840
[Amit Varma]: being in separate hands, that as then a citizen reformer within the system as you have been

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.180
[Amit Varma]: for so many years, what is your approach because the people who have the power are very different

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.400
[Amit Varma]: from the people who have the accountability?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.480
[Amit Varma]: How do you navigate that?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.820
[Guest]: So the thing really is, you have to understand who's got in fact, some of us have been working

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:03.280
[Guest]: in this space have been criticized by NGOs and civil society groups saying, why are you

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.440
[Guest]: spending so much time convincing the state government to do this and that you should

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.560
[Guest]: be investing more energy with the corporator.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.160
[Guest]: But the reality is, if you can get change happening through the state government route,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:20.200
[Guest]: that's where you spend your time till the system is changed, where the power lies with

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.700
[Guest]: the city government.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.440
[Guest]: So we do get criticized, saying that this group prefers to sit with the chief minister

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.140
[Guest]: and solve the problem, rather than sit with the corporator.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.760
[Guest]: But the way I look at it is the following.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.000
[Guest]: At the end of the day, of course, currently in Karnataka, the chief minister is not the

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.880
[Guest]: minister for Bangalore, but for the longest time, the chief minister was also the minister

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880
[Guest]: for Bangalore.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.760
[Guest]: And at one level, it could be argued that if he's the minister for Bangalore, he's the

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.960
[Guest]: place that you go to get change done, which is really the state government.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.480
[Guest]: My sense really is, for those of us who are spending time trying to bring about change,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.000
[Guest]: you try to spend time in places where you can make the change happen in terms of things

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.720
[Guest]: till such time that the system itself, the architecture is changed, so that the true

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: power resides in the third tier of city government, ward committees, ward planning actually take

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.280
[Guest]: shape in reality.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.680
[Guest]: That day is a long way off.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.040
[Guest]: We need to get there.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.600
[Guest]: And many of us who are working in the space are battling for those kinds of ideas.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.880
[Guest]: But while we battle for those ideas to take root, we at the same time, figure out how

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.360
[Guest]: to improve mobility, how to get pedestrian walkable footpaths, how to do a better property

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.360
[Guest]: tax system and the like, because you need to bring change on multiple fronts.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.680
[Amit Varma]: In other words, we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, while that perfect state of being is a long way away, we still have to keep

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.320
[Amit Varma]: working.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.880
[Amit Varma]: And would it then be fair to say that since administration is really a chain of joggers,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.760
[Amit Varma]: where you do little band-aids from time to time, what you try to do besides tackling

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.160
[Amit Varma]: the root cause, which is a long-term project, what you also try to do is influence the specific

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.120
[Amit Varma]: band-aids that are put and try to sell them and make sure that they're at least better

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120
[Amit Varma]: band-aids and make a long-term...

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.720
[Guest]: So I have a term for it, you know, North by Northwest, like the movie.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.120
[Guest]: See, we know that we need to head north.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.040
[Guest]: That's the route, the goal.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.200
[Guest]: And often you have the, I mean, a crow would say, I'll fly north straight.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.240
[Guest]: But in real life, the way to north may be north by northwest, and that's fine.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.080
[Guest]: It's when some of the things you're doing as taking you south, then you have to stop

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.680
[Guest]: and say, hello, what am I doing out here?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.320
[Guest]: And this is not the right thing.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.680
[Guest]: So that's the kind of compass that should guide you as you work in this space.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's now talk about CityConnect.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me more about CityConnect.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.440
[Guest]: So CityConnect is an idea which has been about 11, 12 years old.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.840
[Guest]: It started in Bangalore, and today it's there in Chennai, Trivandrum, Panjim, and Pune,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
[Guest]: five cities.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.720
[Guest]: See, when you look at a city, you realize that there's one stakeholder who has really

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: not participated in the city development, and that is the business industry, the corporates.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
[Guest]: They crib about the city, they say it doesn't work.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.280
[Guest]: They say, I pay my taxes, the city better work.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.960
[Guest]: So they're really giving those kinds of press statements, which doesn't help the cause.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.640
[Guest]: None of them have been into the belly of the beast, which is local government, and realize

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.320
[Guest]: that it's impossible for this system to fix the place and give them the kind of city that

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.580
[Guest]: they desire, but they don't know it, and they crib.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.320
[Guest]: So the idea of CityConnect was to tell business, look, guys, the system is broken, and unless

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.460
[Guest]: you find a way to get involved in the system in a positive manner, and for things which

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.040
[Guest]: are larger than your company, it's not about the road to your company.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.240
[Guest]: It's about the largest city, fixing the city, pollution, roads, and drainage, sewerage,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.520
[Guest]: the works, and also the public spaces.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.480
[Guest]: You have to embrace an idea larger than yourself, or before you realize it, you will find that

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.720
[Guest]: your best talent are leaving your firm.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.160
[Guest]: And why did they leave?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.800
[Guest]: Because their spouses told them, this city doesn't work for us and our children, let's

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800
[Amit Varma]: go somewhere else.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.560
[Amit Varma]: They are actually in the long-term interest to work for the city because network effects,

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.840
[Guest]: more talent will come in if the city is better.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.040
[Guest]: And for the individual company, they'll be able to retain talent and attract talent if

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.840
[Guest]: the ecosystem works.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.960
[Guest]: And I tell companies, your involvement in the space and the money you spend, I don't

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.760
[Guest]: want it from your CSR.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.800
[Guest]: You're doing no favor as a social responsibility.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.400
[Guest]: I want it as a balance sheet item in terms of I'm investing this kind of money for a

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.600
[Guest]: better city.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.080
[Guest]: It's a cost item to make a better city.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.640
[Guest]: The payback on the top line by a city which is productive and that works, it'll more than

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.800
[Guest]: pay anything that you invest in the city, in improving the city.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.520
[Guest]: And in what way can you improve the city?

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: So the CityConnect platform is a bunch of business leaders.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.080
[Guest]: Typically, I look for about four to six committed people who believe in the idea.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.600
[Guest]: The platform has scope for everybody to be on it.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.960
[Guest]: Resident welfare associations, NGOs, citizens, and the like.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:06.800
[Guest]: But basically, as the elite, it's the corporate's responsibility to take ownership and make

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.280
[Guest]: it happen.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.360
[Guest]: They definitely bring in money not to do one road, but to prove a concept, basically proof

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.280
[Guest]: of ideas on the ground, spend money on designs and drawings.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.540
[Guest]: The big money is spent by government.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.120
[Guest]: And that's how we did the Tender Shore Road.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.960
[Guest]: So we did the designs.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.040
[Guest]: And therefore, the compact with this local government is, I will bring in expertise in

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.040
[Guest]: a non-threatening manner and in a non-dictatorial manner that you better do this.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.720
[Guest]: And can we collaborate so that we try new models to do better roads or better drainage

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.580
[Guest]: of fixing the lake problem so that we can collectively improve.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.520
[Amit Varma]: So can you elaborate on that illustration you gave me of the roads that you designed

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520
[Guest]: and which were then?

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.240
[Guest]: Yes, about a decade ago, the most successful example in Bangalore is what's called the

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.000
[Guest]: Tender Shore Roads.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.480
[Guest]: So in the Tender Shore Road has a core idea that we need to build the road around pedestrians

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.680
[Guest]: and not around motorists.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.520
[Guest]: The problem today is we have a motorist oriented thinking when it comes to the roads.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.920
[Guest]: But actually, if you think about it, half of a city like Bangalore moves in public transport

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920
[Guest]: buses.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.800
[Guest]: Now, guys don't fly into buses and fly out of buses.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.160
[Guest]: They walk on footpaths to reach it.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.480
[Guest]: The invisible lacks in our cities, the informal labor, etc., they walk on footpaths which

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.920
[Guest]: are non-existent.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.060
[Guest]: So when you think about it, even electorally, it's actually good politics to build good

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.760
[Guest]: footpaths, but we have never done it.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.840
[Guest]: We always try to cater to the motorized vehicles.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.280
[Guest]: So the idea here was two or three ideas.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.000
[Guest]: One idea is pedestrian at the heart of the, what does that mean?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.080
[Guest]: Wider footpaths, pedestrians cross at grade, not taking them over bridges.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.120
[Guest]: And when there's a conflict, you rule in favor of the pedestrian.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.400
[Guest]: You have a hierarchy, pedestrian, cyclists, bus transport, and then the motor vehicles.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.600
[Guest]: Motor vehicles will get uniform lanes end to end, but that's all they will get.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.080
[Guest]: Today, they're getting just about everywhere you get space, they're pouring tar, which

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.920
[Guest]: is a dumb way to do things.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:12.680
[Guest]: The second concept in what we did as an idea is to think life cycle costs.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.240
[Guest]: Instead of doing the six monthly pothole repair, you actually spend more money upfront, redo

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:26.040
[Guest]: the drains, redo the power lines and the sewerage lines, and spend more, but you don't have

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.120
[Guest]: repair work.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.480
[Guest]: And then you do contracts, which are five years maintenance all built in.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.720
[Guest]: Now, for example, if you take the recent Bangalore flooding, which we saw in the last one and

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.400
[Guest]: a half months, lots of areas getting flooded, the streets that actually worked were the

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:47.440
[Guest]: seven Tendershaw streets, their waters got drained away, there are no potholes on those

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440
[Guest]: roads.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.520
[Guest]: It works.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's a proof of concept.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.280
[Amit Varma]: So how did it come about like, okay, conceptually, you explained to me the thinking that was

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.560
[Amit Varma]: behind designing such roads.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.560
[Guest]: But how did it come about out of CityConnect?

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560
[Guest]: How did you persuade people?

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.600
[Guest]: So as I mentioned, so CityConnect is this body, which is, I mean, for example, in the

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.720
[Guest]: case of Bangalore, it has a Kiran Mazumdar Shah, Chris Gopalakrishnan and a few other

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.520
[Guest]: people.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.440
[Guest]: What that group has got, has got access to the system.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.320
[Guest]: So when they speak, the system listens, and that's the big role they play.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: There are people like us who actually are willing to run around and get and implement

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.660
[Guest]: some of these ideas, but you need access to people to listen.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.800
[Guest]: So the proposition to the chief secretary that we made on the platform really was this

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.720
[Guest]: idea that we will not give gyan, we will spend money on doing the designs.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.400
[Guest]: All we seek from you is you will do a pilot trial of two roads based on designs on which

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.600
[Guest]: we will spend money on.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.240
[Guest]: So that's how it started.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.160
[Guest]: It took us about a year to put that whole thing together.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.760
[Guest]: When we went back to the chief secretary, he said the idea is much larger.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.840
[Guest]: Let's get also a political clearance for the idea.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.800
[Guest]: We went to the then chief minister, who said, look, this sounds great.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.280
[Guest]: Why are you looking at two roads, we'll do 50 roads like this.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.920
[Guest]: That's how it started.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.280
[Guest]: And on the City Connect platform, what's now happened, we spent 85 lakh rupees of the City

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.880
[Guest]: Connect money got from industry on the designs, the manual and the like.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.040
[Guest]: In return, the city is now going to get, has already got about 85 crores worth of roads

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.920
[Guest]: and commitment wise, we have 600 crores worth of roads on that principle.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.320
[Guest]: So the power to get the right thing done.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.520
[Guest]: And what's it at the end of the day?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.480
[Guest]: It has two core ideas.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.160
[Guest]: Pedestrians should be able to walk without fear and with comfort.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:47.680
[Guest]: And second, once done, we don't have to repeatedly repair the roads, two ideas behind that project.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.920
[Guest]: And evangelized in this manner, and I want to repeat, if you want to really get things

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.880
[Guest]: done in the system, don't lecture, don't give gyan.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.560
[Guest]: Be ready to work as a partner along with them.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.400
[Guest]: Know your place in the overall ecosystem, then it gets accepted.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.160
[Guest]: But if you talk down, I know more, you better listen to me, that kind of stuff.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.520
[Guest]: People may nod in the room, but they'll kill the project outside.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.240
[Guest]: So you have to find ways to collaborate in a healthy, friendly manner with these people

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.520
[Amit Varma]: to go in there with humility and work hard.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, the cynic in me would say that I've seen so many civic initiatives break down

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:32.280
[Amit Varma]: over the years because of diffuse responsibility or because of the free rider effect that you

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.080
[Amit Varma]: might go to these captains of industry and they will say, hey, great idea.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.080
[Amit Varma]: I support you.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.120
[Amit Varma]: But they'll expect someone else to actually do the hard work and, you know, put themselves

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.120
[Amit Varma]: out there.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.400
[Amit Varma]: But what you had with City Connect is you've actually had these captains of industry getting

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.280
[Amit Varma]: involved at a level deeper than that.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.480
[Guest]: There's a reason for that.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.360
[Guest]: If you actually see the kind of people who come on board across the cities and their

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.920
[Guest]: captains and leaders, they are invested in the city long term.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.280
[Guest]: They expect their children and grandchildren to be in the city.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.280
[Guest]: That's very important.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:08.280
[Guest]: In contrast, you have industry people who flit from city to city, here today, there

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280
[Guest]: tomorrow, gone day after, whatever.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.020
[Guest]: They, for example, they just, it's a plug and play people.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.360
[Guest]: They just want to come in, plug in and expect the place to work.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.980
[Guest]: So you can't expect them to get too emotionally involved with the city.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:27.560
[Guest]: So even in constructing such a platform, you need to find people who are vested in the

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.640
[Guest]: city long term, only then it works.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.600
[Guest]: Because they also believe that, in fact, when I go and evangelize, because I've gone and

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:40.880
[Guest]: evangelize this across 10 cities and crafted it in five cities, I tell people, if you're

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.760
[Guest]: not willing to commit a minimum of a decade to the idea, don't enter.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.640
[Guest]: So I tell them at the door itself, unless you're willing to think that you're going

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.480
[Guest]: to stay with this for the long term, don't even sign up for the idea of City Connect.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.400
[Amit Varma]: So by making that clear at the start, you sort of ensure that the people who join are

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400
[Amit Varma]: right.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's move on to talking about the future of cities and what you were talking

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.640
[Amit Varma]: about these expanded sort of regional zones where cities in a sense, become the hub of

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.720
[Amit Varma]: urban networks.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.760
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that you think is organically happening anyway?

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Or is that something that you think needs to be proactively planned for and enabled?

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.680
[Guest]: It is happening organically, but in a very haphazard manner.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.560
[Guest]: It needs to actually happen in a proactive plan manners, the way it needs to happen.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.820
[Guest]: So really, when I say it's happening in a haphazard manner, pockets are developing in

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.820
[Guest]: different places.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.680
[Guest]: Take a simple thing, according to me, the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.600
[Guest]: Urban Development at the state level need to be together.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.040
[Guest]: Because frankly speaking, a new industrial area, it's not about just the factory, people

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.100
[Guest]: have to live there, they have to have educational schools, social infrastructure.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.800
[Guest]: And in the silos of government agency, you say that somebody else's problem.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.680
[Guest]: So you need a thinking, which, and that's the problem in governance.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:13.400
[Guest]: We want outcomes, outcomes invariably are across multiple silos of government.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.720
[Guest]: And integration is the biggest challenge.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.080
[Guest]: And in our flawed system, that integrator is the chief minister and the chief secretary.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.200
[Guest]: Any one level below, nobody is able to do that role.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.720
[Guest]: So unless we crack the code on how we are going to build a governance administration

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:36.120
[Guest]: architecture that cuts across this, the future of cities and urban areas in India is bleak.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.600
[Guest]: I believe, you know, we have put out a paper called the Game Changers.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.800
[Guest]: I have about 12 to 15 ideas as game changers for future cities.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.600
[Guest]: Broadly, very quickly, I'll try and give the big points.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.520
[Guest]: One is you need to think in terms of city region, you want to fix a city, have a regional

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520
[Guest]: thinking.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.760
[Guest]: So if you're thinking of fixing Bangalore, look at the Bangalore larger metropolitan

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.360
[Guest]: regional area, which is 8000 square kilometers, almost 11 12 times Bangalore size, look at

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360
[Guest]: that.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.600
[Guest]: Second, the periphery is got the most unplanned growth, because they don't come under the

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.360
[Guest]: civic system, which has all said and done some kind of rules and procedures.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.920
[Guest]: You need a municipalization strategy to deal with the periphery.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.160
[Guest]: For larger cities, you have to break the city corporation into smaller corporations.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:30.840
[Guest]: For example, if you take a place like Bangalore, 198 wards, 80% of them have never spoken in

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.080
[Guest]: five years in the council meetings, and they just travel in Bangalore's traffic to the

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.680
[Guest]: council hall, waste of time, decentralize and do things at the ward level, what can

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.280
[Guest]: be done at the ward level with citizen participation, integrate what you need to do at the city

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.440
[Guest]: level like transport and the like.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.840
[Guest]: Another thing really is planning.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.760
[Guest]: We have static land use planning, terrible.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.720
[Guest]: It is absolutely terrible.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.480
[Guest]: And it just gives you rules and regulations to manage land use.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:07.960
[Guest]: We need a master plan that actually embraces ideas on mobility, water, sanitation, environment

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960
[Guest]: and the like.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960
[Guest]: Not happening currently.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.640
[Guest]: We need to do something out there.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.440
[Guest]: Land acquisition is a big problem as we go forward.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.240
[Guest]: We need to come up with innovative land pooling mechanisms, you know, that town planning schemes,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.920
[Guest]: a whole lot of methods.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.760
[Guest]: We tend to still think of one more outer ring road as a strip development.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.240
[Guest]: We need to think of area based development and innovative ways to be able to procure

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.800
[Guest]: land for public purposes.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.240
[Guest]: Data, information, we don't have observatories at all.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.840
[Guest]: We don't have a culture of respect for data.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.000
[Guest]: We need a spatial data center.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.680
[Guest]: Today, if you go to most agencies, everybody has their own GIS map.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.640
[Guest]: How can a city have 10 maps floating around?

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.160
[Guest]: There's only one base map.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.600
[Guest]: You need a spatial center which takes care of that.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600
[Guest]: I could go on and on.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are a whole lot of other ideas.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Please do go on and on, we have time.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.600
[Guest]: So that's another thing that we can do.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.320
[Guest]: The other thing which is important in this space, for example, is we're not paying enough

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.240
[Guest]: attention to maintenance.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.320
[Guest]: There's a lot of excitement in creating assets, the point we spoke earlier about projects

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.840
[Guest]: because there's scope for kickback money in projects.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.900
[Guest]: But actually, we don't budget enough for maintenance of those assets.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.840
[Guest]: So we have a lot of decaying assets across our cities.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.320
[Guest]: Another good principle to adopt as we go forward to change our cities is we must sweat our

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.960
[Guest]: existing assets.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.600
[Guest]: For example, we have the commuter rail in many cities.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.560
[Guest]: Now, many of those tracks are utilized maybe for two or three hours a day.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:41.280
[Guest]: Now, if we can get more trains to run for local services on those racks, I'm sure that

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.600
[Guest]: technical problems, of course, the biggest problem is railways is central government

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:50.680
[Guest]: and this is silo issues, then it's central state, which is even more complicated.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.320
[Guest]: But if you adopt the principle of sweating your existing assets, you'll start thinking

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.320
[Guest]: differently.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.680
[Guest]: For example, I always felt that while we had BIL, we should have also had HAL airport.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:07.680
[Guest]: BIL could run HAL airport, but don't deprive the city of an existing asset and people could

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.040
[Guest]: fly into different airports depending on the willingness to pay more or whatever, rather

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.240
[Guest]: than be dumb and say, I'm shutting it down under some MOU in terms of things.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.520
[Guest]: So we need to think more innovatively and differently.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.600
[Guest]: You want to fix, for example, transport and mobility keeps coming back.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.040
[Guest]: Because we see on mobility, there is no fix and many cities and state governments don't

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.840
[Guest]: seem to get it.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.720
[Guest]: Public transport and huge investment in public transport and walkable footpaths is the only

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.920
[Guest]: way to fix mobility problems.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.480
[Guest]: Today, for example, I'll just give you a quick Bangalore statistic.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.480
[Guest]: Bangalore, they roughly say from available data, citizens make about a hundred lakh trips

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.240
[Guest]: per day.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.960
[Guest]: Fifty lakh trips of these are made in the buses.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.560
[Guest]: Three lakh trips are made in the metro.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.600
[Guest]: And the balance, roughly 50% are made in 50 lakh private vehicles.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.760
[Guest]: And the 50 lakh trips in buses is made in 6,500 buses.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.400
[Guest]: So you have 6,500 buses that carries half of Bangalore every day.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.640
[Guest]: And the other half of Bangalore travels in close to 50 lakh vehicles.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.720
[Guest]: Now common sense will tell you that if I went to 10,000 or 12,000 buses and did route rationalization,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:28.520
[Guest]: I could go from a 50% modal share for transport to maybe a 70% modal share.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.200
[Guest]: And then you watch the magic on the road.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.360
[Guest]: But what we find our leadership are pandering to motorized vehicles.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.600
[Guest]: I am not saying motorized vehicles don't have a place.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.040
[Guest]: By all means, it's an aspirational thing and people should buy it if they can afford it.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:51.720
[Guest]: But as public policy, your job is to give them some space to drive, but promote public

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.080
[Guest]: transport as the core thing of your mobility policy.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And it's of course an old sword that you don't judge the modernity of a city by the quality

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.360
[Amit Varma]: of the private vehicles, but by the quality of its public transport.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.880
[Guest]: In fact, another one, which is a really a moral hazard, if I can call it that, take

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.120
[Guest]: the whole issue of solid waste management.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:15.800
[Guest]: We don't think anything about Bangalore, for instance, a city of 10 million, its garbage

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:22.400
[Guest]: is dumped on the outskirts in villages of 5,000, polluting their water forever, their

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.100
[Guest]: crops and a whole lot of things and health and sanitation problems in those areas.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.920
[Guest]: Is it right to even do this?

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:36.120
[Guest]: We have to embrace a policy like I spoke about mobility, where we have to say that landfills

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.040
[Guest]: will get only about 10 to 15% of the waste and the rest will get resolved.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.760
[Guest]: I keep saying that what we need to embrace are two really slogans.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.360
[Guest]: The old hum do humare do needs to become the segregation policy, wet waste and dry waste

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:56.600
[Guest]: segregated source because without segregation, you don't have a solution for waste internationally.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.360
[Guest]: Second is what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:06.200
[Guest]: So my garbage must be resolved in my locality or the extended locality near my area and

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.200
[Guest]: not in a village, 40 kilometers away, out of sight, out of mind.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.240
[Guest]: So this, for example, is another thing that we need to embrace and go down that route

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.520
[Guest]: and hammer away till we get there.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.720
[Guest]: Now these are known and these are wicked problems to solve.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.640
[Guest]: But all the time, what happens is you suddenly have some problem on potholes.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.200
[Guest]: They will and that's the system loves because you have rapid release of funds, drop processes

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.400
[Guest]: to select contractors and say, fill it up, fill it up, etc.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.920
[Guest]: And then that's again money down the drain, because in the next rain comes, it again opens

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.920
[Guest]: up.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.240
[Guest]: So to cut a long story short, I mean, there's a whole lot of game changers that one can

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.400
[Guest]: go for in fixing the future of cities.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.840
[Guest]: It has a mix at the larger level.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.540
[Guest]: As I keep saying, there's the governance that needs to be thing, which is really city needs

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.240
[Guest]: to be in control of its own destiny.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.920
[Guest]: It clearly needs its own leadership.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.200
[Guest]: I personally believe that the directly elected mayor is the way to go to get there.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.800
[Guest]: I know we will get scared when we see our corporators and say, oh my God, this guy is

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.480
[Guest]: a mayor or something.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.480
[Guest]: But trust me that if you incentivize the third tier of city government with true powers,

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.720
[Guest]: the right kind of people will stand for those posts because the incentives will drive them

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.560
[Guest]: saying it's worth my time to cut my teeth in city government.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.280
[Guest]: So the start really, so there are governance issues.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.360
[Guest]: On the administration side, I really believe that we need a municipal cadre.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.040
[Guest]: It's a specialist job and we are sitting with generalists.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.040
[Guest]: Won't work.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.200
[Guest]: Environmental issues, for example, are serious town planning.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.440
[Guest]: Most cities don't have qualified transport planners, don't have qualified town planners.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.720
[Guest]: How are you going to get the city you wish?

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.280
[Guest]: So we have to address that whole issue.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.280
[Guest]: I really believe that laterals, we need to have a policy.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.040
[Guest]: I believe osmosis between people in government with people in private for both parties.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.680
[Guest]: If they had a chance to work together, it would change both parties.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.920
[Guest]: That's my belief.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.360
[Guest]: So I believe that that's another thing that we should encourage going forward.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.360
[Guest]: I'm sorry, Amit.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.240
[Amit Varma]: I've been rambling a whole lot.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm just wrapped because a lot of these are both eye opening and mind blowing ideas for

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080
[Amit Varma]: me.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a lot to process.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And I also love the way you figured out, you know, a language to communicate these like

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.400
[Amit Varma]: hum do humare do and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, which is perfect.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:35.160
[Amit Varma]: So my sort of my next question, therefore, is that when you try to communicate these

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:41.400
[Amit Varma]: ideas and the overall thinking behind these ideas to the governing class, is it that they're

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.000
[Amit Varma]: not receptive at all because they're trapped in old ways of thinking or is it that they

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.920
[Amit Varma]: are sometimes receptive?

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.320
[Amit Varma]: But the in their incentives in the silos they inhabit are the way they are and there's not

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320
[Guest]: much.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.760
[Guest]: I think it's more of the latter.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.040
[Guest]: They realize that some of this holds the answer for the future.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.040
[Guest]: Somehow they feel powerless.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:05.280
[Guest]: You know, the problem seems so huge and invariably when you deal with them on a one on one basis,

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.440
[Guest]: the person across the table agrees with you.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.120
[Guest]: I know this needs to be done, but immediately the defense mechanism kicks in saying, but

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.520
[Guest]: that and that is in somebody else's hands, you know, I agree.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.640
[Guest]: But you know, how do we get everybody to work together to make this happen?

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:25.840
[Guest]: So I really believe, hopefully we need a new leadership that's coming out there, both political

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.720
[Guest]: and in the bureaucracy, who says that, look, this is something I'd like to take head on

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.600
[Guest]: and I'd like to give it the requisite leadership.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.920
[Guest]: What we are handicapped by is that political leader who may be in charge of the city gets

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.480
[Guest]: changed at one level.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.680
[Guest]: The bureaucrat definitely will get changed and will go to fisheries or some other department

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.920
[Guest]: and we have to start all over again.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.720
[Guest]: The funny thing that's happened for some of us who work in the system, we are holding

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.080
[Guest]: the collective knowledge of what has preceded in the last two decades on the space and what's

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.760
[Guest]: worked and not worked.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.080
[Guest]: And invariably when a new person comes, we again go with that toolkit and say, look,

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.080
[Guest]: so you reinvent the wheel, reinvent the wheel.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.600
[Guest]: So it's one step forward, two step backwards, et cetera.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.800
[Guest]: I really believe the way out really is we need a little more thing from the leadership.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.120
[Guest]: The other thing government needs to realize, the way I see it, is there's a huge trust

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.920
[Guest]: deficit between government and the citizen.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:24.640
[Guest]: One of the reasons that property tax compliance, for example, is low, it's 50% or less, is

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.920
[Guest]: the citizen takes the view that government is going to misuse my money.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:34.400
[Guest]: So better I cheat the government by not paying my due share of taxes, then allow them have

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.740
[Guest]: my money and cheat me.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.960
[Guest]: So I personally feel that we need to find a way to bridge this trust deficit.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.360
[Guest]: Which brings me to the other big thing, which is very badly required, transparency.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.120
[Guest]: To me, you have to have increased transparency.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.040
[Guest]: You know, I think it was a Supreme Court justice in the US who said that transparency is the

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.860
[Guest]: best, or sunlight is the best disinfectant, is the same transparency idea.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.480
[Guest]: What people need to realize that the more transparent you are, you know, I have another

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.160
[Guest]: analogy since I've been giving you some stories, I might as well say this one also, what's

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.060
[Guest]: happening in our political system.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.700
[Guest]: And you know, somebody keeps talking about China, things happen, and it's not happening

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.700
[Guest]: out here.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:22.720
[Guest]: You see, when you get elected, I say you get elected with leadership to a lake.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.280
[Guest]: And you start with fishing rights in the lake, that pond, if I can call it that.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.480
[Guest]: Now, normally in the private sector, when you have a small market, you say, how can

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480
[Guest]: I expand the market?

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.720
[Guest]: How can I make the pond into a lake, into a river, so that there's more to go around

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.160
[Guest]: and a smaller thing will happen.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.160
[Guest]: That's how you start thinking.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.160
[Guest]: Here what happens is, people prefer to fish in the pond that they have got rights to rather

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.960
[Guest]: than think about expanding the pond to a lake or a river.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.480
[Guest]: And I've asked politicians this, that why don't you invest to expand, because even a

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.640
[Guest]: smaller share of a larger portion will still get you more.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.640
[Guest]: But the politician is thinking is for a limited period of time.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.800
[Guest]: And also, that is one, and people have said this, what if I don't come back?

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.000
[Guest]: I would have set the ground for the next guy to fish with more rights.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.040
[Guest]: So I don't want to lay the ground for the next guy's fishing rights.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.640
[Guest]: So I would rather fish.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640
[Guest]: And that's what you see.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:21.440
[Guest]: So metaphorically, the frothing and the pollution of our lakes that you see, is essentially

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.360
[Guest]: coming from the excessive fishing, using these fishing rights in the pond, rather than thinking

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.240
[Guest]: about expanding it into a lake and more.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.240
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:36.880
[Amit Varma]: So like, you know, while society and markets tend to be positive sum games, everybody benefits.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Politicians look upon governance as a zero-sum game, get whatever you can out of it, don't

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.240
[Amit Varma]: leave enough for the next guy.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.120
[Amit Varma]: I want to end this podcast by asking you two questions.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.720
[Amit Varma]: One, what makes you hopeful about the future of cities and urban governance in India?

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And two, what is the worst case scenario that you're worried about in our country today?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.520
[Guest]: So the first one, really, what makes me hopeful are the few wins that one has personally experienced.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.800
[Guest]: For example, in my own case, the property tax reform that we did, or the tender shore

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.680
[Guest]: roads.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.720
[Guest]: These are two things that I've been intimately involved in.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.480
[Guest]: And though that's all I've got to show for 17 years of effort, I'll take it.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.720
[Guest]: So the key thing really here is you need patience and resilience for the long haul.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.600
[Guest]: And for me, it's a passion.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.980
[Guest]: So I'm fine with it.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.920
[Guest]: So that gives me hope that all is not lost, because there are pockets of win that are

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920
[Guest]: visible.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.480
[Guest]: I mean, green shoots or whatever you want to call it.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.400
[Guest]: What worries me, actually, there are two or three things that worry me.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:44.900
[Guest]: The one that worries me most is the fact that people are coming to cities in search of jobs.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:50.440
[Guest]: Cities are supposed to be engines of growth and jobs and the like.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.200
[Guest]: And if we don't cater to that, cities tend to die.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.720
[Guest]: I mean, you've seen internationally, whether it was Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit recently

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.740
[Guest]: in the West, cities rise, they have heydays and they die.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.840
[Guest]: People think they will never die, but it's happened elsewhere.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.300
[Guest]: And there's no reason to believe it won't happen here.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:13.800
[Guest]: If we don't deliver on those aspirations of jobs and quality of living, etc., we could

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.680
[Guest]: see a fair amount of unrest on the road.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.000
[Guest]: In fact, I really believe that we need city development agencies, for instance, just to

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.120
[Guest]: address that job point.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.240
[Guest]: You know, in wave one, we were trying to say, come to India.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.040
[Guest]: If you saw Davos 10, 12 years ago, the slogan was India everywhere.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.760
[Guest]: Today you see state summits in West Karnataka, vibrant Gujarat, emerging Kerala, people trying

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.840
[Guest]: to say, come to my state.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:41.880
[Guest]: The next inevitable wave is going to be cities competing for investments.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:47.280
[Guest]: So you're going to see that and cities and states that prepare itself earlier by proactively

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.040
[Guest]: thinking about jobs, economic development, and I say jobs from the informal sector to

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.640
[Guest]: the formal sector.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.480
[Guest]: That's really what's required.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.400
[Guest]: The other thing that worries me and sometimes makes me a tad unhappy as I work in this space,

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.960
[Guest]: I believe that we citizens are to blame.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.840
[Guest]: It's easy to blame and throw stones at the system and government and all that.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.800
[Guest]: I think we need to look in the mirror ourselves.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:15.880
[Guest]: If we did not litter, if we did not jump traffic signals, if we kept to our lane, we could

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.040
[Guest]: in our own way, make a big difference.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.880
[Guest]: And so something that I believe that if we are going to fix the city and that worries

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:30.440
[Guest]: me that our civil behavior as manifested in the cities and the roads and the by lanes

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.040
[Guest]: could be a whole lot better and we can play a role in making that happen.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040
[Amit Varma]: That's very enlightening.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And I have a confession to make here.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.200
[Amit Varma]: I consider myself the best driver in the history of Bombay.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.020
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that is no one changes lanes like I can, but I promise to reform

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.320
[Amit Varma]: after listening to you.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.720
