00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And now let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.620
[Amit Varma]: When I was growing up in India in the 1980s, making phone calls wasn't the easiest thing

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
[Amit Varma]: in the world.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.840
[Amit Varma]: The government had a monopoly on providing telephones, and the waiting list for a telephone

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960
[Amit Varma]: could extend to five years or more.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.240
[Amit Varma]: I was a privileged kid, my father was in the AIS, so we had a phone at home.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320
[Amit Varma]: But even for a privileged kid like me, air travel was a luxury.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.480
[Amit Varma]: You guessed it, the state had a monopoly on airlines as well.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.360
[Amit Varma]: All we had then was Air India and Indian Airlines.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.880
[Amit Varma]: Airlines were prohibitively expensive for most people, including us.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.160
[Amit Varma]: That changed in the 1990s, when India was forced to liberalize because of the balance

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.960
[Amit Varma]: of payments crisis of 1991.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.160
[Amit Varma]: Telecoms and airlines were thrown open to private players, whose incentives were different

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.280
[Amit Varma]: from the government.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.320
[Amit Varma]: The government survives because it has a monopoly on violence.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.440
[Amit Varma]: When it needs more money, it simply takes it from us the people, the bakras, its subjects,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.120
[Amit Varma]: by force.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Private players in a free market, when they are not cronies of the government, have only

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.160
[Amit Varma]: one way to survive.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.820
[Amit Varma]: They need to provide value to their customers.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.120
[Amit Varma]: The freer the markets, the more the competition, the harder they have to try.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280
[Amit Varma]: And relatively free markets transform telecom and airlines.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.380
[Amit Varma]: Today if you want a phone, you don't have to wait for five years.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.600
[Amit Varma]: You can get it in five minutes at a very low price, without having to bribe anyone.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.960
[Amit Varma]: Equally, air travel is affordable for vastly more people than it used to be.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Now all this is very nice, but useful as telephones and airlines are, there is one thing that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.720
[Amit Varma]: is far more important for us, and for our nation, education.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.920
[Amit Varma]: The government has done a terrible job of providing education to its people for over

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.700
[Amit Varma]: 70 years.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.400
[Amit Varma]: As bad as it used to do in telecoms and airlines before those markets were opened up.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And yet, there are enormous restraints on private players in the marketplace, especially

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.560
[Amit Varma]: those who provide budget education to the poor, which, contrary to popular stereotype,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.080
[Amit Varma]: is a majority of private schools.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.080
[Amit Varma]: In less important fields like telecom and airlines, the government has allowed society

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.960
[Amit Varma]: to help itself, which is basically what markets do.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.680
[Amit Varma]: But not in the case of education, and our children still suffer for this.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680
[Amit Varma]: This is a crime.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.800
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.840
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about education in India.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.200
[Amit Varma]: And my guest is my friend Amit Chandra.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Amit has been a researcher and activist in the field of education since the early days

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.520
[Amit Varma]: of the century, working first for the Center for Civil Society, and now with NISA, or the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.360
[Amit Varma]: National Independent Schools Alliance.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.200
[Amit Varma]: He has strong thoughts on education.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.440
[Amit Varma]: He terms it a fraud committed on the people of India by the government.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.840
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, we decided not to talk about the many solutions people offer, like school

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.920
[Amit Varma]: vouchers and so on, but just describe the scope of this fraud, which, in our opinion,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.960
[Amit Varma]: is actually inevitable because of the way the incentives of government are structured.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.480
[Amit Varma]: I've done episodes on education before, you can find them on seen and seen.in, but this

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.800
[Amit Varma]: was the longest and most comprehensive one so far, so do listen in.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.480
[Amit Varma]: But first, before that, a quick commercial break.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.000
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.880

[Amit Varma]: Amit, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Amit, all of us know, I mean, all Indians know that we have a problem with education.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.720
[Amit Varma]: And at some level, that problem is not just restricted to like the education sector and

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.640
[Amit Varma]: children studying and so on and so forth.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.760
[Amit Varma]: It cuts across every level of society, even the unemployment problem that we have in India

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.440
[Amit Varma]: today, to some extent is because our education isn't skilling people enough, and you see

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.160
[Amit Varma]: so many people come out of the education system and actually not be good for anything.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.920
[Amit Varma]: And I know that you have worked in this field for more than a decade and a half and you

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.800
[Amit Varma]: have very deep and strongly felt feelings about what is happening in education in this

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800
[Amit Varma]: country.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.720
[Amit Varma]: You've often described it as a fraud.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.020
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like you today to elaborate on different aspects of our education system and the politics

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.720
[Amit Varma]: behind it.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.720
[Amit Varma]: What is been your biggest learning in all these years?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.240
[Guest]: Thank you so much for having me on your show.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:41.040
[Guest]: Yeah, so one insight after working for so such a long year in education sector, I realized

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.680
[Guest]: that something that we are not doing right to our next generation and somehow for whatever

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.040
[Guest]: reason, reasons we can explore later.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.000
[Guest]: But what we are doing, it won't be wrong if we simply call it that we are frauding our

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Guest]: next generation.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.760
[Guest]: And we, our system is frauding our own children.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.080
[Guest]: One simple way to give you why I'm saying and why I have such a strong opinion is, you

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.040
[Guest]: would know recently by the government, there were advertisements for government jobs and

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.780
[Guest]: those were of peons and chaprasis and all of that kind.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.800
[Guest]: And you know that for thousand position, you get applications of millions, which would

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.440
[Guest]: also include applications by those who have done MBA, LLB, even PhD, they're applying

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.560
[Guest]: for a job of peon.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560
[Guest]: Why?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.800
[Guest]: It simply means the certificate that they are holding, it might say that you are a B-take,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.760
[Guest]: you are engineering graduate, but they don't have that skill, neither they think that they

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.760
[Guest]: are able to, they have those skills to claim themselves as their rightful position of engineers,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760
[Guest]: right?

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.000
[Guest]: So that simply gives you an indication that this entire system, which has designed and

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
[Guest]: which you have not a fake certificate, it's an original certificate, while there have

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.080
[Guest]: been several debates about people with fake certificates, also, this is original certificate,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.160
[Guest]: but it has completely artificial value, it has no real value.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.920
[Guest]: And therefore, I say we are cheating our own students, we are cheating our people.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And this is what, you know, activists like you called degree inflation, that you have

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.880
[Amit Varma]: an inflation in degrees and these degrees are meaningless.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.720
[Amit Varma]: And these degrees, of course, are degrees which the ones you mentioned, LLB, MBA, they

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.640
[Amit Varma]: come at a much later stage.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.860
[Amit Varma]: But according to you, the fraud starts right from the earliest stage of schooling, because,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, surveys like the famous ACER reports, and so on, listeners should search for these

00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:00.320
[Amit Varma]: ACER reports on Google, A-S-E-R, and they show learning outcomes across the country.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.320
[Amit Varma]: And they are mind blowing.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.880
[Amit Varma]: They talk about how people in 10th standard can't add or subtract or, you know, put a

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:12.200
[Amit Varma]: sentence together and they are in just, you know, and even by forget come out with a degree

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.120
[Amit Varma]: later on, even before they get to that stage, they are unequipped for anything.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest]: What has gone wrong?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.520
[Guest]: And at times, I think why there is no human cry about either ACER report or similar government

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520
[Guest]: reports also.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:36.440
[Guest]: So if you know, when PISA report came in 2010, India was ranked, if I'm correct, 72nd out

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.360
[Guest]: of 73 countries only next to Kazakhstan on the learning outcome.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.600
[Guest]: And that to think of what was the most interesting part was the response from the government.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:54.920
[Guest]: Government decided not to participate in PISA assessment and ranking from next year onwards,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.920
[Guest]: which is, to me, something shooting the messenger, shooting the messenger, exactly, instead of

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.520
[Guest]: taking that as a benchmark and learning and finding out what is wrong.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:14.600
[Guest]: And you say, okay, next round of PISA report, we'll put a benchmark for ourselves and we

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.280
[Guest]: come up with better ranking, something what we are doing now on ease of doing business

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.880
[Guest]: index, right.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.280
[Guest]: But the response in 2010 was government decided not to participate in it.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.400
[Guest]: And they could also criticize and give certain reasons about methodology and foreign style

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.640
[Guest]: of conducting assessments and all.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.640
[Guest]: But when ACER did it, ACER also shows pathetic learning outcome.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640
[Guest]: What is that?

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:49.000
[Guest]: It says 6th grade students, 64% of 6th grade students cannot do basic Hindi, English and

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.240
[Guest]: maths of 2nd grade.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:11:00.720
[Guest]: I mean, 64% of 6th grade students not able to do 2nd grade learning outcome.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720
[Guest]: What does it indicate?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.840
[Guest]: I mean, certainly massively we have failed to deliver what is basics and they also do

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.480
[Guest]: a basic assessment.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.320
[Guest]: Even if we are not able to provide that, we should fire ourselves as simple as that.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.100
[Amit Varma]: It's a criminal activity.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.440
[Amit Varma]: And one of the tragic things here is that, you know, we the elites who have the most

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.000
[Amit Varma]: volume in media and all of that, and we think, hey, our kids are going to a good school.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.480
[Amit Varma]: And we sort of ignore this as not as big a deal as it is, but it just impacts everyone.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And we're talking about the point you made that if a 6th standard kid cannot show learning

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.920
[Amit Varma]: outcomes of 2nd standard, 64% of them.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.120
[Amit Varma]: Also consider what it does as you go down the road, when he reaches a 7th standard,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.080
[Amit Varma]: can he even understand what is being taught?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.640
[Amit Varma]: He won't be able to cope.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And when he's not able to cope with that learning, it affects your self-confidence, it affects

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.440
[Amit Varma]: your morale, it affects your eagerness to learn more and more, it creates a vicious

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.920
[Amit Varma]: circle and we just lose generations of children like this.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.680
[Guest]: Okay, let me tell you something very interesting here as well.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.160
[Guest]: So first thing is certainly we have failed to deliver whatever is even basic desirable

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.240
[Guest]: result we were thinking of.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:22.840
[Guest]: Now, government had in 2009 passed this act called Right to Education Act, wherein their

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:31.240
[Guest]: idea was that they will have 100% literacy rate and therefore also 100% school enrollment.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.240
[Guest]: Now since the quality is so bad, and if you look into data, I have actually also brought

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:45.320
[Guest]: this report in case we need to dig data, that students, and you have rightly pointed out,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.800
[Guest]: are migrating, they're abandoning government schools and coming to private schools.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.840
[Guest]: That's one reason for quality.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.880
[Guest]: But whatever students they have, they are not able to teach and they have set the goal

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.840
[Guest]: of 100% literacy.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.240
[Guest]: Now then think of what they are doing wrong to meet the goal without teaching.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:11.520
[Guest]: And that is how they have beautifully exploited this provision of Right to Education Act called

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:19.320
[Guest]: No Detention Policy, which means up to 8th grade, well certainly there is a fascinating

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.920
[Guest]: way of justifying No Detention Policy as well.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.120
[Guest]: Or there could be a sincere logic also, I don't really want to get into it, but how

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.920
[Guest]: that has been used.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:39.000
[Guest]: Up to 8th standard, then you don't fail at all, which simply means it's a mass certification

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.680
[Guest]: program without any assessment.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.560
[Guest]: So up to 8th you keep coming to my place, there is nothing and at the end I give you

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:54.280
[Guest]: a degree or a certificate saying you are 8th pass and we achieve as a nation 100% literacy.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And because you need to do nothing to get to that 8th pass point, that immediately becomes

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.200
[Amit Varma]: meaningless and therefore all the way down the line other certificates also become meaningless

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.900
[Amit Varma]: because a certificate has no correlation with the learning.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.900
[Guest]: It has nothing.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:16.400
[Guest]: And let's say government school students, it has similar kind of impact on private

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.800
[Guest]: schools as well.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:26.280
[Guest]: So private schools who are being in some sense glamorized or justified in terms of doing

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:33.360
[Guest]: well etc. or students who are growing up or we call millenials who are growing up that

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.200
[Guest]: thinking okay the assessment is student centric etc. we have not failed blah blah blah.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.520
[Guest]: But the moment they are going to 10th standard or 12th standard or later, they realize that

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:53.120
[Guest]: they know nothing or almost nothing or they get through a psychological situation where

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.680
[Guest]: they are certainly reflecting upon themselves that all along they have been kind of applauded

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.560
[Guest]: for doing what they are doing and later on they realize that possibly what they were

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:11.120
[Guest]: doing was certainly not wrong for almost everything for which they were given 3 stars or 5 stars.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.480
[Guest]: And which later on if they finally get into some kind of let's say medical or engineering

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.320
[Guest]: good colleges, you also see that increasing rate of societal where students are actually

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.920
[Guest]: not able to cope up.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.800
[Guest]: Now there is family pressure also they have paid some good fee or donation or whatever

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:37.080
[Guest]: and got a seat of let's say medical or engineering in high reputed college and under society

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.760
[Guest]: and parents and peer pressure they know that they got into this good college.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.120
[Guest]: But if they are not able to cope up they don't want to go back to family and say I am a failure

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.400
[Guest]: and that is where I believe there is that is also one of the factors leading to increase

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.480
[Guest]: societal attempts among students.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So I mean exactly like this is so basic that a failure in our education leads to a failure

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.180
[Amit Varma]: in every aspect of our society it affects everything.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.720
[Amit Varma]: It affects our employment situations because as much as the fact that there aren't enough

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:15.440
[Amit Varma]: jobs being generated there is also the fact that we are churning out millions of people

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.800
[Amit Varma]: with the degrees that really are meaningless and they are not equipped in the job market.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.920
[Amit Varma]: This affects their confidence and their sense of self worth and it's just a massive social

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920
[Amit Varma]: problem.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.360
[Amit Varma]: So for a moment you know and I think this is something all my listeners would agree

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.360
[Amit Varma]: on that even if within whatever elite cocoons and I'm assuming that everyone who listens

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.000
[Amit Varma]: to the podcast is elite in some way right like you and me but whatever life may be like

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.960
[Amit Varma]: there in the cocoons I think everybody agrees education in India is badly broken.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:52.060
[Amit Varma]: Now what I want your sort of insights on and you've been in the field doing all this work

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:57.440
[Amit Varma]: for 15 years not just at the micro level but at a broader level of fixing policy and trying

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.120
[Amit Varma]: to fix the structure of education in the country take me through some of the root causes for

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.280
[Amit Varma]: this problem.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.440
[Guest]: This is something very difficult to identify one root cause.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.720
[Amit Varma]: So give me a laundry list whatever comes to mind let's just go with because we have created

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:22.080
[Guest]: such a mess now even this mess has piled up so big decoding the root of the mess is too

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:30.880
[Guest]: difficult but one thing certainly I would say is we have highly politicized and bureaucratized

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.120
[Guest]: our education system that is certainly not acceptable.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.320
[Guest]: In terms of this you can see some sense of nationalization or controlling the entire

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:49.760
[Guest]: education system and which is also very discriminatory and one thing also I talk about is it's pretty

00:17:49.760 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: anti-poor while certainly government may claim that almost everything is free if you get

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.920
[Guest]: into government schools and you might find that their per child expenditure per year

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:14.840
[Guest]: goes ranges between 30,000 to 60,000 rupees.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:23.920
[Guest]: So if that is the amount being spent on per child per year then certainly it is a massive

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.880
[Guest]: expenditure and that is the price on which you can in some private schools you can find

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.640
[Guest]: decent education that's one.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:42.160
[Guest]: Second thing happens to be that government lets out norms for all kinds of schooling.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:50.040
[Guest]: I'll give you example if you if let's say you want to start a school in urban area you

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:58.560
[Guest]: need one acre of land if you want CBSE affiliated schools or if it is a rural area around two

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:06.100
[Guest]: acres of land and thereafter the number of classrooms so for each section there should

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:13.160
[Guest]: be or for each class there should be a separate room, principal's rooms, teacher's room, library,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.680
[Guest]: separate toilets, separate drinking water, laboratory etc etc, playground, size of your

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:27.520
[Guest]: staircases, size of window, fire and safety requirements and everything.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:34.840
[Guest]: If by this norm if any tier one or tier two city that you want to start a school you would

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:44.360
[Guest]: require an investment today of at least around 50 crores to start one school and that is

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.720
[Guest]: only when I'm talking just money.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.520
[Guest]: It also has a number of licenses and permissions and which on an average goes around 30 licenses

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:02.080
[Guest]: or permissions altogether and therefore what you see if school is being started at this

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.400
[Guest]: cost at this price and it also gets thousand students enrollment your price point happens

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.140
[Guest]: to be very high so simply it doesn't make sense in economic terms and the moment the

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:23.840
[Guest]: price is very high which simply means only elite or few people can afford schooling rest

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.920
[Guest]: are supposed to go to government or municipality schools which certainly are not giving desired

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.080
[Guest]: results and that is what led to private school revolution in India.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:40.200
[Amit Varma]: So before I come and I want to talk about this private school revolution in India and

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.440
[Amit Varma]: especially the rise of budget private schools and parents of the poorest families voting

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.680
[Amit Varma]: with their feet and taking their kid out of government schools and putting them into budget

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.120
[Amit Varma]: private schools which are like operating in holes in the walls and paying for that sums

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.160
[Amit Varma]: of money which will seem trivial to us but means a lot to them.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.560
[Amit Varma]: But before I come to that I want to address like three broad points that you raised at

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.560
[Amit Varma]: the start of your answer where you spoke about politicization of education, bureaucratization

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.200
[Amit Varma]: of education and first I want to address a great point you made about the sort of the

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:22.200
[Amit Varma]: attitude of nationalization of education where you have a sort of a command and control way

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.000
[Amit Varma]: of looking at it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.120
[Amit Varma]: So let me sort of try to paraphrase what that might be and you tell me if you agree with

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.840
[Amit Varma]: the assessment and what you can add to that is that in education what we have tended to

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.800
[Amit Varma]: do is that like in all parts of our economy after independence we decided that we need

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.320
[Amit Varma]: a command and control structure and especially because it is so important the government

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.040
[Amit Varma]: needs to make sure that education is provided to the people and one of the things they did

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.040
[Amit Varma]: was not just pour money into education and government schools and all which is great,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.200
[Amit Varma]: but they also stopped the private sector from coming up, they placed restrictions like you

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.960
[Amit Varma]: cannot open a school for profit which came out of a mistaken notion that profit is a

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.680
[Amit Varma]: bad thing necessarily while you can really only get profit by benefiting society.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And I've had an episode on this a long time back which listeners can find at seen unseen

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:18.320
[Amit Varma]: radhai and the profit motive in education with Parth Shah and the result of that was

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.360
[Amit Varma]: that while there was this demand for quality education, the supply wasn't allowed.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:28.080
[Amit Varma]: The government said no, we will do the supply and there were too many restrictions on private

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080
[Amit Varma]: schools.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So there's a profit motive around which people find ways like you have trusts and all that,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.880
[Amit Varma]: but you have to find jogar ways around it and the other is a kind of regulations you

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.920
[Amit Varma]: pointed out that your playground has to be this size, you need to have so many toilets,

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.560
[Amit Varma]: you need to have falana dhimkana rather than leave it to the market and leave it to parents

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.080
[Amit Varma]: to decide what kind of school they want to send their kid to, they restrict the supply

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.280
[Amit Varma]: so badly that there is a massive shortfall there, which the government itself because

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.360
[Amit Varma]: of incentives can't really provide.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.440
[Amit Varma]: So structurally firstly, have I summarized it correctly?

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.480
[Guest]: Pretty much, pretty much, in fact something that you were talking about and the norms

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:16.040
[Guest]: I talked about is, before 2009, before Right to Education Act, unrecognized schools also

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:23.680
[Guest]: could operate and there was number of unrecognized schools which are giving only primary education,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.120
[Guest]: they could operate but RT Act has made it mandatory to be recognized and actually what

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:37.560
[Guest]: that has led to, post this act around 20,000 schools have already closed down, so 20,000

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.840
[Guest]: low-cost private schools which came up as an alternative, as what you talked about parents

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:50.160
[Guest]: are choosing by feet and they are also paying money because they think that education is

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.680
[Guest]: their only hope, if you want to change whatever poor people have gone through and they want

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:02.360
[Guest]: to change their fortune, finally is for the next generation through education, otherwise

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.600
[Guest]: they know that they don't have a huge investment to set up a business or something like that

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.160
[Guest]: and that is also being closed down and therefore that leads to this major question and that's

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.480
[Guest]: why I really want to very strongly say everything is fraud in education, that we are certainly

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.200
[Guest]: cheating our next generation and if then we are thinking of something like Make in India

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:34.200
[Guest]: or Start of India etc etc, it's all just shame, I mean we can't do basics, while I talked

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.080
[Guest]: about politicization, you also have to think about why all of these things have sustained

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:46.240
[Guest]: for so long, how come we were able to control, while talking about education any bureaucrat

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.120
[Guest]: would give you a reply that education is a state subject, so there is nothing called

00:24:52.120 --> 00:25:00.640
[Guest]: nationalization etc, but directly or indirectly it's all controlled by governments, certainly

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:07.080
[Guest]: they have certain liberty to pick up which language to use etc etc, but by and large

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.520
[Guest]: they follow NCRT curriculum and there is a similar trend, so what let's say Gujarat adopts

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:19.280
[Guest]: also Maharashtra adopts and then Karnataka adopts etc and it spreads out, when I also

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.200
[Guest]: talked about politicization of education, specifically you should look for politicians

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:37.040
[Guest]: who are either coming from education background or are highly influenced by people in education,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:45.080
[Guest]: so something like that has happened is union of government school teachers, something I

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.280
[Guest]: specifically point out and the kind of role that they play in education policy or its

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:58.600
[Guest]: execution is, we know that there is no accountability, I mean one of the reason why it happens to

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.600
[Guest]: be a very lucrative occupation is, this is the only job where you are, the school operates

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:13.120
[Guest]: for 210 days or something around it, it's largely their day or in case there are second

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:22.560
[Guest]: shifts it's a 4 to 6 hours job, with as number of holidays and decent pay per week.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.960
[Amit Varma]: And despite that there are huge rates of absenteeism in government schools.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.920
[Guest]: There was a report by World Bank which says on any day around 25% of teachers are absent,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.240
[Guest]: which means one-fourth, randomly and those who are there, they are not motivated or you

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.280
[Guest]: can also look into who all are going into this government teaching occupation.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.900
[Guest]: Those who are looking to become a great teacher, certainly not, all those what they are looking

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:57.480
[Guest]: for a one state job, a government safe secure job, their motivation is certainly not teaching,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: however I'm not kind of vilifying all of those young talent which is getting into.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.480
[Amit Varma]: It's a structural issue, it's not like individuals are at fault, those teachers are at fault,

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.800
[Amit Varma]: they are in a sense also victims.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:16.400
[Guest]: Right, they are also victims and that is also good, I have actually a friend who got into

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:26.400
[Guest]: government job as a school teacher and she had to pay bribe to just claim her salary.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:35.520
[Guest]: Anyways, so the other role I wanted to point was the role of teacher union.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.720
[Guest]: Also because teacher happens to be an influential personality in any community, which has been

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.800
[Guest]: so good, I mean we have been proud of that.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:54.280
[Guest]: But since they are influential, no political representative actually want to get into anything

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:59.360
[Guest]: which causes conflict or confrontation, right.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:06.080
[Guest]: Also if you get into a little further more detail, when voting happens and polling happens,

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.680
[Guest]: the only person present inside the polling booth is a teacher because all of these teachers

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.160
[Guest]: have polling duty.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.360
[Guest]: And you know inside they can either influence the voters or do any mess thing which you

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:27.120
[Guest]: don't really want to get into and therefore they are able to influence political parties

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.880
[Guest]: who come or go in government and therefore they are able to control it.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.800
[Guest]: And that is one of the reasons why you find in Right to Education Act all kind of norms

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:45.760
[Guest]: in terms of input or school recognition, salary, qualification, but not as much in terms of

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.280
[Guest]: duty and if duty is not being performed, accountability or penalty or punishment or whatever you could

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.560
[Guest]: think of.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.160
[Guest]: That's completely not there.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:04.320
[Guest]: And therefore, so what happens is it's politicized, the entire management of education, management

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.040
[Guest]: in government schools is not done by management professionals.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.120
[Guest]: It's all done by bureaucrats.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.280
[Guest]: So those will be block education officers or district education officers or education

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.600
[Guest]: secretary or additional secretaries.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:27.720
[Guest]: They all completely behave like inspectors who are coming here to inspect, penalize and

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.400
[Guest]: in the process also make money for themselves, frankly speaking, and that happens to be the

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400
[Guest]: only aim.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.280
[Guest]: Nowhere, I will tell you one incident, I was in a school in Trichy, I was visiting and

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.040
[Guest]: I was interacting with the school leaders and they said their experience.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:53.280
[Guest]: One of the guy told me that 10-20 years ago, when education officers used to visit schools,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:59.920
[Guest]: we used to prepare students, ki wo aayega, ye puchega, ye bolega, to kaise jawab doge,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.720
[Guest]: kya karoge, kaise khade hona hai, etc, etc.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:09.120
[Guest]: Now when the education officer comes to visit school, we prepare the building.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.760
[Guest]: So that the toilet is fixed, there is drinking water, it's in clean, it's painted, the benches

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:20.720
[Guest]: are there, those sprinklers are there or fire safety equipment is there.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.640
[Guest]: So all of that focus has completely shifted on input rather than quality of education

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.060
[Guest]: and output and which I don't see improving as long as the bureaucrats leading it.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.640
[Guest]: There has to be some kind of educationist coming in the role and they deciding or at

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.000
[Guest]: least working together with schools, figuring out what is wrong happening.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.180
[Amit Varma]: So I want to examine, I want to go a little further into this point and examine the interplay

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.360
[Amit Varma]: between power, accountability and incentives.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But before we do that, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to another week on IBM.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.320
[Unknown]: And with that, I'm going to take you on to your shows.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.360
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, we are discussing the state of education in India.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And my guest is Amit Chandra, who's been a researcher and activist in this area for more

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.560
[Amit Varma]: than a decade and a half and has very deep insights about it.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And before the break, Amit, you were talking about how teachers unions are so strong and

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.120
[Amit Varma]: they're a very powerful interest group, and therefore they control a lot of the politics

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.120
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.760
[Amit Varma]: Now, tell me if my understanding is correct, because I kind of try to look everything through

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.720
[Amit Varma]: the economic lens of what are the incentives.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.880
[Guest]: And before we get into, because then we are going to the next step of discussion, let

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:31.080
[Guest]: me give you one more example, which tells you when I say fraud at several levels of

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.200
[Guest]: fraud, not only with the kids, with the system, with the teacher, with the quality, almost

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200
[Guest]: everything.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.200
[Guest]: Go ahead.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:47.440
[Guest]: Very recently, CAG, which is the auditing body, came up with its report, and it estimated

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:56.040
[Guest]: 1.1 crore fake student enrollment in government schools of Uttar Pradesh alone.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.520
[Guest]: That's more than 10 million people.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.520
[Guest]: Wow.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520
[Guest]: Yes.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520
[Guest]: Fake enrollment.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520
[Guest]: Fake student enrollment.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.800
[Guest]: Now, you would wonder why there are fake student enrollment.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.040
[Guest]: Yes, because that decides the amount of fund you would get.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.960
[Guest]: You know, there is a midday meal scheme.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:18.560
[Guest]: So, assume the cost per child per day is 10 rupees, right?

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560
[Guest]: What does it mean?

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:25.680
[Amit Varma]: 10 crore rupees every day is 100 crore per day expenditure on midday meals.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.680
[Guest]: Yes.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.480
[Guest]: Which is going into someone's pocket.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.960
[Guest]: Then there are altogether 14 kind of freebies, which is given shoes, socks, uniform, textbooks,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960
[Guest]: etc.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.880
[Guest]: Stationery, all of those.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:48.240
[Guest]: Then the teacher positions are created and all this transfer posting appointment happens

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.840
[Guest]: on the basis of number of students there.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.520
[Guest]: And also you want to increase your enrollment and you show you are performing better.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.120
[Guest]: There is also now, at least with ASER and government data, even MHRD is conducting,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.440
[Guest]: there is NAS.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.440
[Guest]: So now the data is being collected that whether students are enrolled or not coming or not.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:16.360
[Guest]: So you are fuzzing all the data to show that students are there and they are coming.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.280
[Guest]: However, they are not present in school.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.720
[Guest]: They are not learning all the money is being eaten or drunken by others.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.400
[Amit Varma]: With all the different freebies and so on.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is such an amazing illustration of how government inevitably tends to descend

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.560
[Amit Varma]: into a parasitic role and everything in India, especially just becomes a jhol.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.880
[Amit Varma]: But to get back to the question of incentives, which I think is worth unpacking for our listeners,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:52.040
[Amit Varma]: is that because teachers in government schools essentially have power without accountability

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.400
[Amit Varma]: because they are teachers, they are tenured, they get the salary they get, but they are

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.560
[Amit Varma]: not actually held accountable in terms of the kind of education they provide.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And very often there are more teachers than you need because if there are so many fake

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.920
[Amit Varma]: students and you have to maintain a student teacher ratio that rationalizes the appointment

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.320
[Amit Varma]: of many more teachers who are not required and who probably won't show up to work.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.880
[Amit Varma]: And because the incentives are so flawed, because they don't actually need to deliver,

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.040
[Amit Varma]: unlike a private school, which is dependent on the fees coming in every month.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.520
[Amit Varma]: So there's pressure to actually perform and compete.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.320
[Amit Varma]: But because that pressure isn't here and the incentives are so bad, your learning outcomes

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.360
[Amit Varma]: are bad on a per capita basis, in the sense, I don't know whether it was you, but I heard

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:41.000
[Amit Varma]: this statistic recently about how the same outcomes are provided by private schools for

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.080
[Amit Varma]: one third the cost of a government school, the per student cost, despite the fact that

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, governments.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:53.960
[Guest]: This study, this paper was done by Karthik Muralidharan in Hyderabad schools, wherein

00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:01.920
[Guest]: he simply compared students of government schools and students of low cost private school,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.120
[Guest]: not just private schools, very low cost with the similar kind of economic background of

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.420
[Guest]: students.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:16.680
[Guest]: And he found that while the learning outcome in those low cost private school was slightly

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.960
[Guest]: better.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:24.400
[Guest]: So if you are comparing in terms of learning outcome, it's not great, slightly better.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.520
[Guest]: But in terms of cost, those happens to be one third.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.320
[Guest]: So one third of the same cost you can provide in low cost private school, something similar

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.320
[Guest]: quality education.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.080
[Amit Varma]: So even if you're not providing a better education in an absolute sense, you are providing much

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.280
[Amit Varma]: more bang for the buck, which really matters for poor people.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.720
[Amit Varma]: The reason you're doing and again, you know, it's often an unfair sort of rap, which is

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.360
[Amit Varma]: placed on libertarians like me that you think all government is bad and all private is good

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
[Amit Varma]: And that's not the case at all.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.160
[Amit Varma]: I just come at it from a point of view of incentives.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.640
[Amit Varma]: And in the case of education, who do you want to be in a position of power?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.880
[Amit Varma]: You want the children and the parents of those children to be to be the people who have the

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.100
[Amit Varma]: power and who dictate the outcomes.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And you want teachers to be accountable in terms of the education that they provide.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And you have those incentives in private schools, including low cost private schools, where

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.600
[Amit Varma]: the parents will just walk with their feet and go elsewhere if they feel the education

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.040
[Amit Varma]: isn't good enough.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.520
[Amit Varma]: But in a government school set up the way our school system is set up, that power is,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, the kids and their parents aren't empowered with that, because teachers are

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.760
[Amit Varma]: completely unaccountable.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.400
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, whenever any reform is proposed, the teachers will obviously oppose that reform,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.120
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, this brings accountability, that brings accountability, the system works

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.920
[Amit Varma]: so beautifully for them, why would they mess with it?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.600
[Guest]: While we talked about this study by Karthik Muralidharan, let me also mention, and your

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.840
[Guest]: audience could find out a paper done by Professor Geeta Gandhikindan.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:08.520
[Guest]: So what she did, she took all the learning outcome and kind of converted into units.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.680
[Guest]: So units of learning, and compared with the cost, I don't remember exactly, but it comes

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:24.280
[Guest]: somewhere around, if I'm not mistaken, is that for each unit of learning outcome, if

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.720
[Guest]: you compare with government and private school, government schools spend 10 times more, so

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.520
[Guest]: it doesn't give you bang for the buck.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.320
[Guest]: And the simple reason is, anywhere you go, private sector has efficiency, and that is

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.840
[Guest]: what they are known for.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:48.220
[Guest]: And that actually leads to the, in case of accountability and designing system-wise,

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:54.520
[Guest]: you don't want even centrally designed or at a state level also, which also happens

00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.680
[Guest]: to be like a centre, when we have states like UP, which is bigger than several countries,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:08.360
[Guest]: why can't we trust parents, teachers, or people who are locally, or even students?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:17.320
[Guest]: I mean, simply we ask students, at times we have wondered, if students had voting rights,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:24.240
[Guest]: the scene today could have been different, because as we talked about politicians trying

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.880
[Guest]: not to take panga with teacher unions, the moment they would realize, okay, now students

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.920
[Guest]: have got voice and voting right.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.760
[Guest]: And they would certainly force them to think about, could we think of a student-centric

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.480
[Guest]: education model, right?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.960
[Guest]: So why can't we involve them?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.400
[Guest]: Why can't we simply give them liberty?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:51.720
[Guest]: And in case of India, it is common sense, before India becoming democratic, at least

00:39:51.720 --> 00:40:01.680
[Guest]: electoral democratic, education in some sense, and even when Britishers came and introduced

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.600
[Guest]: formal education, it was almost free.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:10.080
[Guest]: And there was no government and therefore there was no politicization or bureaucratization

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.480
[Guest]: of education.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:20.840
[Guest]: So we have had history and in fact, if you get into the reports of James Tooley, he says,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:29.200
[Guest]: in the British India, Bengal province alone had around five lakh schools.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.680
[Guest]: And today, after like hundreds of years, today, altogether, we have around five lakh schools.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:42.520
[Guest]: So in that sense, the number of schools that you could kind of compare only Bengal as a

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:48.000
[Guest]: state and currently entire India, and in those sense, the number of schools should have gone

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.880
[Guest]: up rather than going down or staying stable, while the population has gone at least 10

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.880
[Amit Varma]: times, no?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Much more than that.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And because the demand for quality education is always high, I mean, that's what parents

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.800
[Amit Varma]: really want a good education for their kids and but that the supply is not allowed to

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.800
[Amit Varma]: exist and the government system has essentially become parasitic, rather than, you know, actually

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.460
[Amit Varma]: trying to deliver outcomes.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:15.240
[Amit Varma]: But the other point I want to address, and I'm sure you face this all, you know, you

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:21.440
[Amit Varma]: face this throughout your, the many years you've spent in this, is that when you talk

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.200
[Amit Varma]: of private schools, people often say, oh, private school to manga and you know, government

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.600
[Amit Varma]: schools are doing this social service and private schools are too expensive.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.120
[Amit Varma]: But actually, that is a massive myth.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, as James Tooley himself pointed out, for example, in a beautiful book he wrote

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.240
[Amit Varma]: on the subject, all the papers and books that Amit is mentioning, by the way, will be linked

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.200
[Amit Varma]: at the bottom of the page of this podcast.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.320
[Amit Varma]: So do look for those.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.440
[Amit Varma]: But to come back to the question, I mean, is it true that private schools are only for

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440
[Amit Varma]: the rich?

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.240
[Guest]: Not at all, certainly not at all.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.800
[Guest]: And therefore, I have brought this report also, this is called a report on budget private

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.560
[Guest]: schools in India.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:06.240
[Guest]: And that is what, therefore, if you look into how schooling has developed in India, you'll

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:16.720
[Guest]: find at, let's, if we start from independence, country decided to go for a kind of state

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.440
[Guest]: taking responsibility of providing education.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.880
[Guest]: However, they did not have capacity as much.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:29.200
[Guest]: But thereafter started this idea of government schools and private schools.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.560
[Guest]: But at that point of time, private schools were only for elite or some missionary schools

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:42.520
[Guest]: which were private, with the idea of also spreading religion or as they are called missionary

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520
[Guest]: schools.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:50.200
[Guest]: Similarly, not missionaries in terms of Christian itself, but also other religion.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:56.720
[Guest]: But slowly as state realized that they don't have capacity, and in fact, if you go back

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:03.600
[Guest]: to the debates of drafting constitution, at that point of time, there was debate of having

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:09.720
[Guest]: something called right to education as a fundamental right, so that it's state's responsibility.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:17.000
[Guest]: But the constitution makers, at least they realized that it's a new nation coming up,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.320
[Guest]: and state doesn't have that capacity.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:27.080
[Guest]: And therefore, they dropped the idea of keeping right to education as a fundamental right.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.160
[Guest]: So by and large, coming to the point that there has been government schools and small

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.680
[Guest]: private schools and some missionary schools.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.080
[Guest]: And thereafter, when government realized that there is a capacity issue, they started something

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:44.480
[Guest]: called aided private schools, which means it's a privately run school.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.160
[Guest]: And if they are able to sustain it for more than three years, then government will pitch

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:54.120
[Guest]: in with funds, etc., which later on, because then government was funding it, they started

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:59.600
[Guest]: controlling it, it also become exactly like any government school.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:04.800
[Guest]: And this third segment, which is private school, and if you read all of these education policies

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:11.480
[Guest]: with the national education policy of 1968 or 86 or 92, or the new one we were drafting

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:21.200
[Guest]: or State Education Act, you'll find it takes the view of government schooling.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.360
[Guest]: So schooling through government institution or aided government institution, there will

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:32.040
[Guest]: be only a small segment which will say, if there are private school, what are the rules

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.920
[Guest]: and norms, etc.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.840
[Guest]: And in that sense, it happens to be completely biased.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.800
[Guest]: So you think of government schools, they are ours, we will run them.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:46.720
[Guest]: But if it is a private school, then it has norms, guidelines or control mechanism.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.400
[Guest]: So by approach itself, we are completely biased.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.720
[Guest]: So government school is ours, we will run it, there is no set timeline, standard, or

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.800
[Guest]: if you have not delivered, what will be the penal mechanism, etc.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.480
[Guest]: The approach that you take for private schools.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:09.800
[Guest]: Anyway, so the main point I want to come to, that this low cost schools or budget private

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:17.480
[Guest]: schools, the revolution kind of that James Tooley talks about, I don't attribute it as

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.680
[Guest]: a success of policy.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:26.680
[Guest]: What I say is, there is a revolution of low cost private school, because the policy provisions

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680
[Guest]: failed.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.320
[Guest]: Because as a policy issue, we never wanted private schools to flourish.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:39.520
[Guest]: And therefore, now as government has challenged, and if you look at now the DICE data, almost

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.240
[Guest]: around 40% students are enrolled in private schools, now only around 60%.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:54.480
[Guest]: And this I'm saying as a nationwide, you can also find some urban areas, specifically let's

00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:03.720
[Guest]: say Hyderabad, Delhi or Mumbai, where majority of students you'll find going to private schools.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:12.720
[Guest]: So the point I wanted to make is, this revolution has as a failure to policy design, neither

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.320
[Guest]: that policy was designed to promote it.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:23.480
[Guest]: The other part to answer your question is, whether these are for only elite or rich people?

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480
[Guest]: Certainly not.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.440
[Guest]: Once again, I would refer to Professor Geeta Gandhi Kingdon's report, which is in the same

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.680
[Guest]: report.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:41.680
[Guest]: The average monthly fee of private schools in UP comes around 250 rupees.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.800
[Guest]: And therefore, now if you will also identify, as I travel a lot, I also interact with auto

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.600
[Guest]: rickshaw drivers, taxi drivers, even cycle rickshaw pullers.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:58.040
[Guest]: And I have found that even poorest of poor such as cycle rickshaw puller, today, he would

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:06.120
[Guest]: prefer to skip a day's meal, but wants to send their children to a private school.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.440
[Guest]: And certainly these are not elite private schools.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.760
[Guest]: These are those low cost private schools.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.560
[Guest]: So I would not say it is only for rich, certainly because of several policy provisions that

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:24.000
[Guest]: we talked, the cost happens to be inflated, which certainly through reforms could be brought

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
[Amit Varma]: down.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and that's to me, it's a deeply poignant story that if someone who's earning three

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.240
[Amit Varma]: or 4000 a month, you know, is his household income, and he cares deeply about his kids

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.960
[Amit Varma]: education, because he wants them to go beyond what he has managed to do in his life, and

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.040
[Amit Varma]: he wants his kid to get an education.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.260
[Amit Varma]: But the free government schools which are set up for that are simply not doing that.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.080
[Amit Varma]: And he's actually paying money, which is a substantial amount of money for him to 50

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.360
[Amit Varma]: may not seem anything for us or 500 may not seem anything for us, but for those people

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.200
[Amit Varma]: is a substantial amount of money, but they're making that sacrifice, because it is their

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.560
[Amit Varma]: only way out.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.320
[Amit Varma]: And then what they also see is that even those private schools that they send their kids

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.040
[Amit Varma]: to face these enormous, enormous challenges from the state itself.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.160
[Guest]: And like you pointed out, those are the schools being closed down, those are your even I come

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.560
[Guest]: from a city called Banaras.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:21.680
[Guest]: And at my house, there is a maid and maids and her children to a private school.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.960
[Guest]: And that is the kind of schools being targeted now by the government, which I see completely

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.120
[Amit Varma]: it's injustice, it's inhuman.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And you have 10s and 1000s of low cost private schools like that having to shut down because

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.000
[Amit Varma]: of government regulations, despite the fact that they came up in the first place because

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.160
[Amit Varma]: the government had failed to provide that education.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And that just makes me so angry that I think that your term of anger for this, which is

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.200
[Amit Varma]: fraud is not sufficient.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.160
[Amit Varma]: It's it's much worse than that.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a crime on the people of our country.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, a lot of these things, activists like yourself have been talking about for

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.600
[Amit Varma]: a long time trying to raise awareness and so on.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And of course, parents of kids everywhere understand this, especially the poorer you

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.080
[Amit Varma]: go, the more they understand how bad things are.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, I was told of some statistic recently, some that's a more than 80% of government

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.720
[Amit Varma]: school teachers send their children to private schools.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.960
[Guest]: You know, what better evidence you require than this, not only teachers, all the politicians

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.640
[Guest]: even who advocate government schooling, they send their children to private schools and

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:35.720
[Guest]: they also since the money and power and sources, they're sending their kids to foreign schools.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.320
[Guest]: So then they don't even have to teach here in the Indian curriculum.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.320
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:46.560
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and it's kind of obvious that the way this structure is a lot of interesting

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:52.000
[Amit Varma]: ways towards moving towards a solution emerge and let's not discuss any of those individually.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.280
[Amit Varma]: But in terms of let's talk about what in the political economy makes change so difficult,

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.240
[Amit Varma]: like one thing you pointed out is that there are interest groups like government teachers

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.520
[Amit Varma]: unions which hold a certain amount of power, and they lobby politicians and they don't

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.720
[Amit Varma]: let it happen.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:13.320
[Amit Varma]: So can you shed some more light on the incentives in the political economy and the different

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.920
[Amit Varma]: interest groups?

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.560
[Amit Varma]: And also earlier, like you've spoken a bit about the politicization of education, but

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.880
[Amit Varma]: you also mentioned bureaucratization of education.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.640
[Guest]: So can you expand on that as well a little bit?

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.640
[Guest]: Sure.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:32.520
[Guest]: Let's come to that political economy thing first.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:38.600
[Guest]: A little difficult to explain it in a short time.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.240
[Guest]: But I mean, I'll give you just snapshots.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:48.920
[Guest]: The first thing you could see is politicians, they also have to go by the public sentiment

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:57.960
[Guest]: and somehow, it's already built in public sentiment that there should be free education

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.760
[Guest]: and therefore government could deliver it.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.600
[Guest]: However, everything is taxed and paid by citizens themselves.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:10.560
[Guest]: But somehow there is this acceptance that free education should not be charged.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:16.440
[Guest]: Second, whomever is providing should not make profit out of it, be it private or government

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:23.040
[Guest]: or anyone else, but should do it for the purpose of charity.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.400
[Guest]: And therefore, for politicians who sincerely also want to bring change, it becomes too

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:34.240
[Guest]: difficult because all of a sudden there will be many organizations, unions on street protesting

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:40.280
[Guest]: against them that they are kind of privatizing or commercializing education or giving in

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.520
[Guest]: profit hands.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.680
[Guest]: So that makes itself difficult.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680
[Guest]: That's first thing.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:53.560
[Guest]: Now, second thing, I would also doubt whether politicians are so interested in doing it

00:51:53.560 --> 00:52:02.320
[Guest]: for reasons and this parasite culture and the pressure groups that they have, with teacher

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.480
[Guest]: unions or other lobby groups to reform it.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:14.480
[Guest]: Also, one thing has come to my notice is education or things like that happens to be a deliverable,

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.200
[Guest]: the outcome of which will be shown in long term.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:23.080
[Guest]: So for an example, my parents decided to invest in my education and after 10-15 years only

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.680
[Guest]: they can see outcome and when the tenure is only five years or something and it to make

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:34.000
[Guest]: bureaucracy work and get a school sanction for any MLA or MP in the constituency will

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.040
[Guest]: take one, two, three years.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:44.200
[Guest]: So the impact is not as visible and therefore, in my opinion, let's say even if I might be

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:51.160
[Guest]: wrong too, but their interest is more into, let's say, building toilet or giving kumble

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:56.080
[Guest]: or whatever, which is more of a photo opportunity that the MP MLA is doing something or cleaning

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.040
[Guest]: road or whatever.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:05.120
[Guest]: So I don't really see that they are as interested.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:10.520
[Guest]: Any points that you think is more relevant?

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:17.400
[Amit Varma]: I just want to say that I 100% agree with your opinion and this is one of the problems

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.920
[Amit Varma]: you face with governance is that politicians are always focused on the short term and like

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.960
[Amit Varma]: you correctly said, something like investments in anything that show results in the long

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.360
[Amit Varma]: term, beyond the five-year term of a politician, therefore become pointless.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:36.640
[Amit Varma]: They are more interested in optics and photo opportunity, which a toilet shawl will provide

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.520
[Amit Varma]: more than something that is more abstract, especially if it means withdrawing from the,

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, removing restrictions on private schools.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.360
[Amit Varma]: The government servant can't then, there's nothing concrete for him to show too, because

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.440
[Amit Varma]: it seems like, I mean, what have you done?

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.000
[Amit Varma]: But what you correctly pointed out earlier and something that makes me almost despair

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.160
[Amit Varma]: is this attitude that Indians have that whatever problems we have, the government is a solution.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:09.080
[Amit Varma]: People realizing that in cases like education, for example, the government is a problem.

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one example I often kind of try to point out is that, you know, people

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:16.000
[Amit Varma]: say that, look, education is so important, so the government has to do it.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And my reply to that always is that it is because education is so important and crucial

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.920
[Amit Varma]: that the government must allow society to participate in it.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And like, I'm an 80s child and the classic analog I give is of telecom and airlines and

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.240
[Amit Varma]: especially telecom, that those were government monopolies in the 80s, it took you five years

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.040
[Amit Varma]: to get, you had a five year waiting list for a telephone and then private players were

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040
[Amit Varma]: allowed.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.120
[Amit Varma]: And if you go by the same rhetoric they give behind education, then you would expect the

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:51.080
[Amit Varma]: quality to drop, the private players to exploit customers and the prices to be too high.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:55.760
[Amit Varma]: But instead, what you have is an explosion in quality because of competition and because

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.200
[Amit Varma]: of those incentives.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:02.440
[Amit Varma]: And now today, the poorest of the poor have smartphones, even if they're not educated,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, and it's one of the great tragedies of our country.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.200
[Amit Varma]: And it makes me angrier and angrier as the years go by.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:15.520
[Guest]: And the students are able to understand English today because of mobile English keypad rather

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.400
[Guest]: than going to school and understanding English.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.640
[Guest]: Anyways, something that I also wanted to talk more because these days, the anger comes out

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.800
[Guest]: is you did not contest my insight of education being fraud, otherwise they could have given

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800
[Amit Varma]: you several examples.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's imagine, I know, because I agree with you, but I know much less about why it is

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.880
[Amit Varma]: a fraud.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.120
[Guest]: So let's assume for a moment that I have contested it, I have said, no, Amit is not a fraud.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.120
[Guest]: So why don't you elaborate?

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:51.800
[Guest]: Because we started talking about government teachers also and how even they are victim.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:59.280
[Guest]: One of the things I can talk about is at the beginning of the session around March or April,

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.840
[Guest]: try going to meet any of the education minister at the residence or office or education secretary

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.640
[Guest]: in any of the state.

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.120
[Guest]: What you'll find that there is a huge crowd.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.320
[Guest]: And you'll find most of the people in the crowd are teachers.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:24.120
[Guest]: Now these teachers are there lined up at the house of education minister.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:31.040
[Guest]: And if you investigate into the reason, you'll find they're mainly asking for their transfer

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.160
[Guest]: and posting.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:39.120
[Guest]: And then certainly minister would do whatever formally has to do.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:46.120
[Guest]: There will be a guy, more like an agent or mediator or whomever you call it, would be

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.240
[Guest]: there who would then deal with them.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.680
[Guest]: So fix up a certain price and that.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.960
[Guest]: So if you pay, then you will get your desired postings, etc.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.960
[Guest]: Right.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.880
[Guest]: That itself has become a massive fraud.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.000
[Guest]: At places though, this was being done at a secretary level.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.160
[Guest]: Then ministers realized that we are losing money that we can make.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:16.200
[Guest]: So ministers have taken, in some states, lets me, I hope I go back home, as chief minister

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.320
[Guest]: realized that there is enough to make.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:25.520
[Guest]: Those kind of people don't listen to this podcast, so don't worry about that.

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:34.520
[Guest]: At times, I remember at some education minister office that I had gone to meet, and a teacher

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.160
[Guest]: walked in for the same request.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.840
[Guest]: And he says, no, no, now chief minister is looking directly at us.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.920
[Amit Varma]: So it's become so lucrative.

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.960
[Guest]: So that is the kind of day to day examples that you get.

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:53.120
[Guest]: And then you think of, do we as a country have some hope?

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.120
[Amit Varma]: So you're someone who's not only been a researcher and shredded all this, but you've also been

00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.720
[Amit Varma]: an activist and you've tried to bring about change.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:14.120
[Guest]: I mean, you are in a sense, the other big thing happens in your marks inflation, right?

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.360
[Guest]: So there are boards, education board, each state has education board and CBSE, ICSE and

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.480
[Guest]: IG and all of that.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:28.840
[Guest]: Specifically, one fraud thing started with the evolution of CBSE itself.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:37.320
[Guest]: So if you remember, I, as I said, I'm from UP, I went to a state affiliated board school.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:45.040
[Guest]: So at our age, at that time, there was this chief minister called Kalyan Singh, right?

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:51.800
[Guest]: And people say I passed high school or intermediate in Kalyan Singh's regime, which means before

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:58.920
[Guest]: that was Mulayam Singh and at the Mulayam Singh time, they were very generous and liberal

00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.920
[Guest]: with cheating approach.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:05.160
[Guest]: You know, today, you can see Bihar, the massive, you know, cheating their parents or friends

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.360
[Guest]: who are helping them to copy.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.580
[Guest]: So that used to happen and therefore Kalyan Singh.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:17.560
[Guest]: So on what the main point I want to come to, on an average, if you see the result every

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:24.200
[Guest]: year would be 30%, 40%, maximum 50% students who have passed.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:30.240
[Guest]: And the topper of the state would have 82%, 83%, right?

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.600
[Guest]: Now, then CBSE came in and CBSE had a different marking pattern.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.720
[Guest]: And therefore, the similar kind of average student like me, if I'm getting 50% marks

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:49.160
[Guest]: in state board, I would get 65 or 70% mark in CBSE board, right?

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:57.880
[Guest]: Slowly that state realized that all of these CBSE students are easily getting admission

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:04.280
[Guest]: later on in, let's say, Delhi University or whatever university for college.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.200
[Guest]: And our students are not finding admission.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:14.080
[Guest]: If the admission is based on your high school and enter marks, and therefore they also started

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.600
[Guest]: figuring out other ways of inflating the mark, inflating or changing the marking pattern

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.720
[Guest]: so that students get more marks.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.240
[Guest]: There happens to be one more dynamics here.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:32.800
[Guest]: So every time, and let's say as an education minister, I want to show my performance that

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:40.000
[Guest]: I have done very good in education segment or like we recently, last year in Punjab,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.840
[Guest]: the education secretary was expelled, he was fired because of the poor percentage of result.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.400
[Guest]: So you want to show that earlier, 50% students used to pass, we have improved so much that

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.680
[Guest]: 70% students are passing, right?

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.560
[Guest]: Something similar is happening in Delhi also, currently they're debating, our students

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.080
[Guest]: are performing very well, right?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.480
[Guest]: I won't get into that Delhi debate, I can get into that separately.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:13.920
[Guest]: But states are also inflating, state boards are inflating marks to show that we are doing

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
[Guest]: a good job.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920
[Guest]: Students are studying more.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.000
[Guest]: Look, the results of this government school are also coming out very well.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.080
[Guest]: And even CBSE adopted this system, what they called it, moderation system.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:34.600
[Guest]: So they figured out scientifically and justified ways of giving you more and more marks.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600
[Guest]: That is another level of fraud happening.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.640
[Amit Varma]: And then we say, okay, the kid looks dumb, but he has 90% marks.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I remember back in the day in my 10th and 12th, I got like around 70% and my now

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.120
[Amit Varma]: wife got a little more than me.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And we were just talking like a couple of days back that boss, in today's time, we would

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.040
[Amit Varma]: have got admission nowhere, we are finished.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:05.960
[Guest]: In Delhi, something like since Stephen College, they got 100% students with 100% marks as

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960
[Guest]: admission.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.320
[Guest]: So even you have 99, you're not going to get admission.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.080
[Guest]: So think about it.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:21.160
[Guest]: Now why is that as an activist or as a solution, if we start thinking about it, is because

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.600
[Guest]: the producer, when you design or produce is who, the same government, when the assessment

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.160
[Guest]: is happening, it's the same government, when the outcome has to be shown, it's the same

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160
[Guest]: government.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:38.800
[Guest]: So as long as I monitor myself, I would give all good marks, I'll say I'm the best person

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.960
[Guest]: even better than Narendra Modi, right?

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And that is what is happening.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Be careful what you say.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.640
[Guest]: Not that kind of audience listens to your podcast anyway, right?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.960
[Guest]: I mean, whomsoever.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.920
[Guest]: So you need to bring some level of accountability and transparency in the system, otherwise.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's a great insight.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.440
[Amit Varma]: Again, to go back to the question of incentives, the government is the provider, the government

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.600
[Amit Varma]: is also the person who is ranking the quality of the provision, financing and financing

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.120
[Amit Varma]: the provision and everything, whereas, you know, in a regular market system, what you

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.720
[Amit Varma]: would really have is that it's the parents who decide, the people who are, and therefore

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.360
[Amit Varma]: they keep the system sort of accountable.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.360
[Guest]: So, they don't take anything from the consumer, they don't get any assessment from the parents,

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.960
[Guest]: they don't get any assessment from the children, how good is the teacher, how good is the infrastructure,

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.520
[Amit Varma]: how good is your education minister.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, the fact that so many poor parents vote with their feet and take their

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:43.560
[Amit Varma]: children to budget private schools, is itself them assessing the state of education and

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.960
[Amit Varma]: the state then reacts by shutting down as many of those private schools as it can.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And the other tragic point that you just pointed out, and which is, again, a great insight

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.160
[Amit Varma]: I'd like to call attention to, is the relation between optics and performance.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.280
[Amit Varma]: And that's not, I mean, it is in the nature of governments and the parties that are ruling

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.160
[Amit Varma]: the governments at any time, that their incentive is not really to perform because no one's

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.520
[Amit Varma]: holding them accountable.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But their incentive is to focus on optics like, look, so many kids have passed and it's

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.560
[Amit Varma]: more than last time, because they want to get re-elected.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.240
[Amit Varma]: And again, the incentives are completely destroyed.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:25.680
[Amit Varma]: But the question I sort of want to ask is that, you've not only, you know, done a lot

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.600
[Amit Varma]: of research and gained a lot of insight into this field, but you've also been an activist

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.880
[Amit Varma]: and a very passionate activist who's, you know, you meet politicians all the time, you

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.720
[Amit Varma]: meet bureaucrats all the time.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.920
[Amit Varma]: So my two part question is that, what level of acceptance is there among these individuals

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.320
[Amit Varma]: in government, you know, outside of their roles and their incentives, that there is

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.840
[Amit Varma]: a problem and that, you know, that it has to be fixed?

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
[Amit Varma]: That's part one.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And part two is that going beyond this acceptance of, going beyond this recognition of the problem,

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:04.120
[Amit Varma]: has there been any movement towards a solution in all the time that you've been working?

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.680
[Guest]: This is a difficult one.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:16.120
[Guest]: Because to answer this, I will have to decode all of these conversations that I have with

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:21.400
[Guest]: politicians and policy makers and, and I'll have to base my judgment on that everything

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.720
[Guest]: that they're saying is sincere and true.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.240
[Guest]: Yeah, which you have a sense of whether it's not by...

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:35.400
[Guest]: So I do think that in a certain level and within the government also they realize.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:42.640
[Guest]: So number one, because they have designed and they are doing it, they know it.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.400
[Guest]: But as I said, the major, major challenge for education sector happens to be this public

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.480
[Guest]: sentiment itself, the moment that is changed, or politicians get a sense that people are

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480
[Guest]: open for change.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:02.320
[Guest]: And if by bringing some sort of reform, I would not be thrown out of office, they would

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.480
[Guest]: be open to it.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.480
[Guest]: The other way of thinking is until it becomes inevitable.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:19.960
[Guest]: I know with my conversation with people, formally and informally, they, whenever they have realized,

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:28.760
[Guest]: in fact, we had, I personally had high hope with this current MHRD minister and the secretary

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.720
[Guest]: also.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:37.960
[Guest]: And specifically the secretary, however, I'm deeply, deeply disappointed, is they realize

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:47.320
[Guest]: it and they were trying to look for political viability of bringing some of those reforms.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.920
[Guest]: Specifically you, so within government, there are segments, something like Niti Aayog, Niti

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.720
[Guest]: Aayog published its three years action plan.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.000
[Guest]: And within there, there is a section on school education.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.760
[Guest]: And they have proposed some good ideas.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.320
[Guest]: But it's difficult at the moment.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.560
[Guest]: Also I understand their challenge too, for currently BJP led government.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.280
[Guest]: No matter what they do, the moment they touch education, everyone, opposition, etc., comes

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.320
[Guest]: in as a saffronizing education, or commercializing education.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.960
[Guest]: And for that they have also, so if you know, twice they constituted committee for national

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:37.320
[Guest]: education policy, and yet they have not progressed on it.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.960
[Guest]: I can't comment on future, but today or tomorrow, it's going to become inevitable and they will

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:49.560
[Guest]: have to do it because there is no other way than saving truth by accepting the truth.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, this has been an incredibly insightful episode and I want to end by asking

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.600
[Amit Varma]: you two questions.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.800
[Amit Varma]: I ask all my guests on whatever subject they're talking about at that point in time, and those

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.360
[Amit Varma]: two questions are, what makes you despair about what is happening to education in this

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360
[Amit Varma]: country?

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And what gives you hope?

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.500
[Guest]: Once again, these are difficult questions.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:23.000
[Guest]: So something is why I got into it and still investing my time and energy, even it's very

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:32.440
[Guest]: frustrating thing to do, is we ourselves have gone through this system.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.520
[Guest]: At times I feel that it was good to be a backbencher because the system could corrupt me less.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.960
[Guest]: All of those in the front were highly corrupted.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.000
[Guest]: I was also a backbencher.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.440
[Guest]: And I have seen many of our own friends and colleagues or relatives or cousins struggling

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.520
[Guest]: with it, or even today.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:59.880
[Guest]: And that makes me work on it, frankly speaking, that...

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.600
[Amit Varma]: You feel you have no choice, you owe this to...

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.500
[Guest]: We have to, because the, I mean, the pain I have seen people going through of unnecessarily,

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.920
[Guest]: for an example, let's say, parents scolding or relatives scolding for bringing lesser

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.240
[Guest]: marks than 70% or 90% or why not to study.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:25.120
[Guest]: I mean, this study thing has become such a, I don't know what to call it, a big burden

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120
[Guest]: on children.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.120
[Guest]: All the time, parents are behind them, study, study, study.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:35.600
[Guest]: See what people are teaching, what they are teaching, what relevance is going to come

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
[Guest]: out of it?

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600
[Guest]: How is it going to make a difference?

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:44.640
[Guest]: I mean, as simple as the question I ask is, today we possibly, our average lifespan would

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.680
[Guest]: be 50 to 60 years, I assume not more than that.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:55.600
[Guest]: What is so great with our education thing that I spent half of my life studying it?

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.960
[Guest]: Great point.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.080
[Guest]: So that is what, and that is where you have to be optimistic.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.720
[Guest]: You have to have hope that things would improve.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.040
[Guest]: At times, and that is why my disappointment, I have seen some hope, some light at the end

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.560
[Guest]: of tunnel, but then it happens to get longer and longer.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:21.600
