00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
[Amit Varma]: When I think about the battle for India's independence, I have to sometimes remind myself

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.440
[Amit Varma]: of the shifting meaning of both those words.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: For much of our freedom struggle, the word India would have had a shifting, nebulous

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.280
[Amit Varma]: meaning without the firm shape of the nation-state that we know by that name today.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.480
[Amit Varma]: And equally, what was independence?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Our early freedom fighters cared about the well-being of our people and negotiated for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.920
[Amit Varma]: greater rights, but independence, in the specific shades of meaning of 1947, took shape pretty

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.320
[Amit Varma]: late in the game.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.420
[Amit Varma]: This is especially so when I think of our 19th century leaders who had the harsh reality

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.720
[Amit Varma]: of the British Empire to work with, a reality they could not wish away.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:01:09.280
[Unknown]: When Dadabhai Naoroji fought for his fellow Indians, what exactly was he fighting for?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about Dadabhai Naoroji, known in our popular culture as a grand old

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.920
[Amit Varma]: man of India, a man who Mohandas Gandhi once called father of the nation.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Naoroji was an inspiration not just for Gandhi, but an entire generation of our freedom fighters

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.300
[Amit Varma]: and he epitomized what is known as the moderate school within the Congress Party.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.200
[Amit Varma]: He wanted peaceful change from within the system, so much so that he became the first

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.360
[Amit Varma]: Indian to win election into the British Parliament so that he could push for change from within.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.000
[Amit Varma]: He was 67 years old at the time, with a lifetime of activism behind him, and in his last years,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.840
[Amit Varma]: having failed in his moderate ways, he turned towards the so-called extremist wing of the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Congress Party, men like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and gave them reason to be inspired.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Dadabhai Naoroji lived into his 90s, and when a man spent so many decades in public life,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.480
[Amit Varma]: beginning with fighting for the education of girls and ending with a battle against

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.760
[Amit Varma]: the empire, it's hard to build a simple narrative around him. Like so many other great figures

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.960
[Amit Varma]: in our freedom struggle, Naoroji contained multitudes.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.240
[Amit Varma]: My guest today on the show is Dinyar Patel, whose outstanding biography of Naoroji, simply

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.400
[Amit Varma]: titled Naoroji, Pioneer of Indian Nationalism, is on the stands now. It's a rich and nuanced

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.320
[Amit Varma]: look at Naoroji's life, not just giving a sense of the interior life of this complex

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.680
[Amit Varma]: man, but also painting a vivid picture of Indian society and British politics. I had

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.360
[Amit Varma]: been hearing rave reviews of Dinyar's book for a while now, and I was delighted to get

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.600
[Amit Varma]: him onto the show. Before we begin our conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Are you one of those people who not only loves to read, but also wants to write better? If

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.520
[Amit Varma]: so, I have something for you. Since April this year, I've been teaching an online course

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.880
[Amit Varma]: called The Art of Clear Writing, four webinars spread out over four Saturdays, in which I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.520
[Amit Varma]: share whatever I've learned about the craft and practice of writing over 25 years as a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.920
[Amit Varma]: professional writer. The course also contains many writing exercises, discussions on email

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.120
[Amit Varma]: and WhatsApp, and much interactivity. It costs rupees 10,000 or $150. You can check out the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.840
[Amit Varma]: details at indiankar.com slash clear writing. This link will be in the show notes. If you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.600
[Amit Varma]: want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and the words on the page, then

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.800
[Amit Varma]: the art of clear writing might be just what you need. September batches begin on Saturday,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.680
[Amit Varma]: September 5th. So hurry and register before then, indianuncut.com slash clear writing.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.280
[Amit Varma]: Dinyar, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you. It's great to be here.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Dinyar, I loved reading your book on Dadabhai Naoroji, especially because despite my deep

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.200
[Amit Varma]: interest in Indian history, I hadn't really read much about him. You know, he was a peripheral

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
[Amit Varma]: figure in all the other books I'd read on Gokhale and the 19th century freedom struggle

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.320
[Amit Varma]: and so on. And part of the reason, of course, is that your book is really the first comprehensive

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.880
[Amit Varma]: biography out there. But before we get started on the book, which, you know, had so many

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.200
[Amit Varma]: TIL moments for me, and I enjoyed reading so thoroughly, I'd like to know a little bit

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.960
[Amit Varma]: about yourself, you know, what has your journey been like, not just your, you know, bare bones

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.560
[Amit Varma]: career or academic journey to getting a PhD in history and at Harvard and writing the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.920
[Amit Varma]: book and so on. But in general, your intellectual history, who are the sort of thinkers who

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.280
[Amit Varma]: influenced you? Were there books that made a big difference to your life? What drew you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.600
[Amit Varma]: to history? What drew you to Dadabhai?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.200
[Guest]: Yeah, so I was born and raised in the US, actually, I was born in Houston, and I grew

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.880
[Guest]: up in a relatively small town in California called Bakersfield, which is unlike most of

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.520
[Guest]: California in the sense that it's quite conservative. And, you know, it's the type of place that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.160
[Guest]: voted for Trump quite solidly in the last election. So keeping in mind where I grew

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.920
[Guest]: up, it's a little bit of an unusual trajectory to first of all, land up in Mumbai and also

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.320
[Guest]: be studying Indian history. But I think there were a few things again, growing up that kind

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.400
[Guest]: of pointed me in this direction, studying kind of the world around you. When at least

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.800
[Guest]: I was in school, again, obviously, before internet and such, I, you know, while other

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.680
[Guest]: people are reading, you know, teenage novels or whatnot, I would pick up books from a series

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.640
[Guest]: that our library had on countries around the world. And I just got very interested in geography,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.600
[Guest]: you know, in the US, at least there's a geography B that takes place. So I used to take part

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.080
[Guest]: in that every year. And so I just, you know, I think also just growing up in a relatively

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.160
[Guest]: small town, you naturally become much more interested in the world around you. And, you

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.280
[Guest]: know, the little bit of experience I had traveling before college kind of solidified that experience.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.000
[Guest]: I, you know, I remember going with my mother to visit relatives in Calcutta when I was

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.800
[Guest]: about 10 years old. And that was kind of the first trip at least to India, which I really

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.880
[Guest]: remembered and kind of left an impression on me and also traveling through different

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.520
[Guest]: parts of Asia on the way to get there between Los Angeles and Calcutta, through Bangkok

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.860
[Guest]: and Tokyo. And so once I got to college, at least, you know, I was deciding between two

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.280
[Guest]: different trajectories. I've, I've always been quite interested in architecture and

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.640
[Guest]: urban planning. And still, to this day, I kind of wonder if maybe I should have done

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.080
[Guest]: that instead. But the other trajectory was doing something with international relations

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.280
[Guest]: or history. And so in college, I went to college in Stanford, I started taking a lot of IR,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.480
[Guest]: international relations courses and history courses, and eventually studied abroad or

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.640
[Guest]: worked abroad for the equivalent of about one and a half years. And that really was

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.600
[Guest]: a very formative experience for me. I mean, just kind of living outside of one's comfort

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.400
[Guest]: zone. And, you know, I studied in China for a long time. Actually, I learned Chinese in

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.640
[Guest]: college and eventually gave it up once I realized that I just could not, you know, I just could

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.320
[Guest]: not do the language. It's, it's a very complex process. But nevertheless, that allowed me

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.680
[Guest]: the opportunity to live in China for a few months in, I think, the year 2002. So a fascinating

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.600
[Guest]: time to be there. I just do with all the breakneck change. I got to see the Three Gorges Dam

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.400
[Guest]: being under construction, go to parts of China that were just opening up to kind of foreign,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.960
[Guest]: foreign visitors and, you know, signs of economic development around you. And slowly, I got

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.800
[Guest]: drawn more and more towards Indian history in college. And I worked for a few years after

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.680
[Guest]: college and while working, I decided I wanted to do a PhD, but in history, in Indian history

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.080
[Guest]: specifically. But I did not anticipate becoming an academic after doing a PhD. So even when

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.560
[Guest]: I was admitted to my program in Harvard, I told my advisor, look, you know, I probably

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.640
[Guest]: won't become an academic historian after this. I'll probably go into more of a policy world

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: type job. And I was looking at programs at MIT, for example, that had programs on on

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.760
[Guest]: IR and such. And as happens inevitably, I guess, when you're on a PhD program, you get

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.800
[Guest]: sucked into it. So you don't really have a choice. So, you know, here I am so many years

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.960
[Guest]: afterwards in an academic career. And when I began my academic career, at least in Harvard,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.520
[Guest]: when I started my PhD, you know, I was very struck by certain things about the discipline

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.560
[Guest]: of Indian history. I mean, when you when you study 19th and 20th century history in India,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.040
[Guest]: you notice that there's a great deal of focus on certain things, and the rest is oftentimes

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.360
[Guest]: just a blank slate. So there's a great deal of work on Bengal, specifically in the 19th

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.360
[Guest]: century. You have the subaltern studies perspective on kind of this bottom up approach of history.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest]: You know, you have a great deal of writing on a few characters. But again, you know,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.200
[Guest]: there was hardly anything on on on anyone else. So this struck me, especially for early

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.600
[Guest]: Indian nationalist leaders. I mean, where were good up to date books and writings on

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.400
[Guest]: figures like Naoroji, or Gokhale, or Ranade, or those other characters, or even later on?

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.720
[Guest]: I mean, people like Patel, or Azad, or others, where was that scholarship? And so I got attracted

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.840
[Guest]: to writing something on Naoroji for partly that reason. And the other reason was, I always

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.920
[Guest]: had a long standing interest in Parsi history. I'm a Parsi myself. And so, you know, a PhD

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.440
[Guest]: was a good excuse to kind of find out more about, you know, your community and your family.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.320
[Guest]: And Naoroji kind of fit the bill. I mean, since he was a Parsi leader, in addition to

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.160
[Guest]: being a nationalist, he was kind of a natural choice for investigating and researching.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.080
[Guest]: But you know, again, when you when you are in a PhD program in the US in history, and

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.560
[Guest]: you propose to write on someone like Naoroji, you oftentimes will get a lot of stares, or

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.880
[Guest]: people ask you, what are you doing? Because at least 10 years ago, that was not the type

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.640
[Guest]: of PhD dissertation people expected you to do, you're supposed to do something kind of,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.800
[Guest]: I guess, you know, to use a word more fashionable, more in keeping with some of the political

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.080
[Guest]: orientations of the field, maybe something a bit more narrow, definitely not something

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.520
[Guest]: on a political elite. So I definitely got a lot of question marks from people, why are

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.280
[Guest]: you doing this? Why are you researching this boring elite? You know, who has very little

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.200
[Guest]: to do with where the rest of the field is going. And I was very lucky, at least in the

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.080
[Guest]: sense that my advisor was very supportive, first of all, and I got to meet other people

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.120
[Guest]: who were, you know, again, slowly changing the parameters of the field. So I met Ramchandra

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.440
[Guest]: Guha, when I was probably in my third or fourth year, I think, was, I think, third year of

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.360
[Guest]: my PhD program. And again, I found someone who was extremely supportive, and who has

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.200
[Guest]: supported me ever since then, and has, again, really helped shape the direction in history

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.800
[Guest]: where now we are taking biographies more seriously. So I was very fortunate to have that particular

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.520
[Guest]: source of help. And, you know, through Ram and through others, I've met so many others

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.520
[Guest]: who again, are kind of pushing the boundaries and helping diversify the field of history

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.320
[Guest]: beyond kind of the ideological frames that it's been, you know, oftentimes kind of channeled

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.800
[Amit Varma]: in over the past few decades.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.900
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that that's something that, you know, non historians don't often realize looking

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.940
[Amit Varma]: from the outside in, that so much of history writing is driven by ideology, like you pointed

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.240
[Amit Varma]: out that it became unfashionable at one point to, you know, do biographies to focus on the

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.360
[Amit Varma]: lives of men, especially elite men, as Naoroji obviously was, and you instead want to, you

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.000
[Amit Varma]: know, follow other set narratives, and, you know, look at bottom up currents of history

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.920
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. And so is that something that was a strain to fight against in the

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.720
[Amit Varma]: academy? Or did you find that meeting professional historians who don't take that approach, like

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Ram, for example, is something that helped you kind of work past that? And what do you

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.600
[Amit Varma]: feel about that? Is that a problem? Does it color the way we view history or write history?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.000
[Guest]: It definitely is a problem. I mean, now, I think that we're seeing a bit more of a diversity

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.400
[Guest]: in history. But I mean, when we think of the current political moment we're in right now,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.560
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, politics and the way history has been politicized, if you think of, you

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.040
[Guest]: know, again, the whole principle of action and reaction, I mean, you can understand why

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.680
[Guest]: we're in a particular moment right now when history has been so deeply colored by political

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.160
[Guest]: perspectives from, you know, the other side, from the left side. So, you know, I mean,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
[Guest]: when we have these particular narrow perspectives for studying history, and, you know, India

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.500
[Guest]: is no different in many cases from other parts of the world, which have had these ideological

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.760
[Guest]: straitjackets, you know, it has a knockoff effect. And yes, it was difficult a little

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.400
[Guest]: bit, you know, while writing and researching the PhD to kind of justify my project. But

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.720
[Guest]: with the help of people like Ram and others, and, you know, you meet people along the way

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.680
[Guest]: who kind of, you know, take on a supportive role. And I think as I started to write a

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.360
[Guest]: bit more about what I was finding, you know, I was looking at a series of papers in the

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.800
[Guest]: National Archives in Delhi, which really had not been looked at by more than three or four

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.680
[Guest]: historians ever, since Naroji passed away, you know, those tons of interesting new material

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.560
[Guest]: that, you know, one finds in such a collection. And once you start writing about that, people

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.880
[Guest]: tend to kind of latch on and realize that what, you know, what you're going after. So,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.040
[Guest]: even though I've always been very skeptical about theory, I've never really enjoyed it,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.560
[Guest]: I found it very frustrating to read in graduate school. And, you know, maybe I wasn't a very

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.760
[Guest]: popular grad student on account of that. I do think that I do believe very, very strongly

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.440
[Guest]: in kind of these strongly empirical groundings and methods that, you know, historians have

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.120
[Guest]: used. And, you know, the really good historians have, you know, known to make sure to read

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.360
[Guest]: everything that's out there, or, you know, as much as you possibly can. And that really,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:36.080
[Guest]: you know, the example that I had from people like Ram or others, like the senior Indian

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.040
[Guest]: professor SR Mehrotra, really made a very big difference in kind of providing a source

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.680
[Amit Varma]: of encouragement. And one of the things that I really liked about your book is, you know,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.160
[Amit Varma]: when I get historians on the show, and if you're talking about the 17th century, or

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.080
[Amit Varma]: the 16th century, or whatever century, which is not the current time, you know, I'll often

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.400
[Amit Varma]: ask things like, what did they eat in those days? You know, what was their day like, give

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.480
[Amit Varma]: me a sense of the texture of their day and all of that. And they're kind of blank about

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.160
[Amit Varma]: that. And one of the things I enjoyed about your book is, of course, you said that there

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.200
[Amit Varma]: are a lot of papers which cover especially his London years, right down to, you know,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.600
[Amit Varma]: little quotidian bills and small memos and all of that. But from all of that, you could

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.800
[Amit Varma]: actually also, you know, draw a picture for the reader of the kind of clothes he wore,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800
[Amit Varma]: how that changed depending on the occasion and the thinking behind it, the kind of food

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.000
[Amit Varma]: he ate, how, I mean, I was fascinated by, you know, he wakes up, he doesn't have breakfast,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.440
[Amit Varma]: he has three raw eggs for lunch while standing and all of that. And, and those I thought

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.080
[Amit Varma]: were excellent details, which other historians may have just chosen to ignore because they're

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.520
[Amit Varma]: so mundane and banal that you, but I'm glad that you put them in. So tell me a little

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.360
[Amit Varma]: bit about your process. And that's really a two part question. One is the process for

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.880
[Amit Varma]: the project. How do you approach the project? Where are the papers located? What kind of

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.000
[Amit Varma]: condition are they in? What do you do? Do you, you know, like, if they're at an archive,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.680
[Amit Varma]: you go, you take them out, you photograph them all? How do you handle them? How are

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:08.520
[Amit Varma]: they kept? And then secondly, just the mental process of then working on the narrative where

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:14.360
[Amit Varma]: obviously you go in knowing a lot of facts about Naoroji, which are in the popular domain.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.680
[Amit Varma]: But you know, do you kind of have to ignore them and pretend that you have a blank slate

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120
[Amit Varma]: in your mind and you're discovering everything all over again, given that, you know, we all

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.680
[Amit Varma]: suffer from the hindsight bias, we know everything that has happened intimately, we feel it was

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.840
[Amit Varma]: inevitable. And your book doesn't seem to sort of make that mistake at all, you know,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.360
[Amit Varma]: reflected, for example, in the way that someone like Mahatma Gandhi plays such a small peripheral

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.080
[Amit Varma]: part in it, though I can easily imagine other approaches to the history making, you know,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.100
[Amit Varma]: because of what he went on to become, giving more importance to his connection with Naoroji,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.720
[Amit Varma]: but he was a peripheral figure for India and Naoroji and that kind of comes across. So

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.000
[Amit Varma]: yeah, so these two, you know, one is, you know, what is the process in terms of physically

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.960
[Amit Varma]: what do you have to do? How long did it take you? What is the work like? Do you get disheartened?

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.640
[Amit Varma]: And then mentally, how do you approach it?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.120
[Guest]: So if you are studying Indian history in the 19th or the 20th century, and to a certain

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.400
[Guest]: degree, the 18th century, chances are you're going to be in one of two or three places,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.320
[Guest]: including the National Archives of India or Teen Murthy, the Nehru Memorial Museum and

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:25.120
[Guest]: Library in Delhi. And I was in both places because Naoroji's papers, so when Naoroji

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:33.280
[Guest]: died, there was a collection of probably maybe 50,000 documents in Naoroji's collection.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.520
[Guest]: And there's a very kind of long history of what happens to those papers after he dies.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.500
[Guest]: They're kept in Bombay and they rot away and every 10 years or so someone will fish them

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.940
[Guest]: out and see what's there and make a catalog. And there's a attempt to catalog and publish

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.260
[Guest]: the papers, but it ultimately falls through. Eventually, they move to Pune and there's

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.960
[Guest]: a scholar there called R. P. Patwardhan who spends, he's told by someone called R. P.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.460
[Guest]: Masani, who was Naoroji's first biography. He was told by Masani that, look, it'll take

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.960
[Guest]: you a few years, just go through the papers, show me, tell me what is good to publish in

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.440
[Guest]: a selected volume. And it took the rest of R. P. Patwardhan's life, it took him 20 odd

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.560
[Guest]: years to go through the papers and cull out collections for publication. And eventually

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.320
[Guest]: from Patwardhan's residence, they get transported to the National Archives in Delhi in the 1960s.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.440
[Guest]: And by this point in time, what had originally been a collection of about 50,000 documents

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.960
[Guest]: when Naoroji died, had whittled down to maybe around 40 to 30,000 documents. And by the

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.120
[Guest]: time I got there, probably 30,000, you know, maybe a little bit more. So what we have over

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:51.760
[Guest]: here is a very clear track record of loss, which is true across the board in Indian archives

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.600
[Guest]: and records. Because of the climate, because of bad record keeping, because of, you know,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.400
[Guest]: people just throwing away their collections, a lot of stuff gets lost. And Naoroji is actually

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.800
[Guest]: one of the best cases of preservation that we have, because at least here the collection

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.920
[Guest]: is in, you know, the order of tens of thousands, right? If you look at someone like Ranade,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.800
[Guest]: we have a handful of his letters, right? If you look at W.C. Banerjee, the first president

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.960
[Guest]: of the Congress, we have basically nothing. I mean, someone had his letters up until 1940,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.240
[Guest]: published a few in a not terribly good book, and that's it. We never hear anything after

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.880
[Guest]: that about what happened. So India's had a very shoddy track record of archival preservation.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.040
[Guest]: And at least with the Naoroji papers, that record was much better. So a lot had been

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.600
[Guest]: lost, yes, but the vast majority had been preserved. It was not in a very good state

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.720
[Guest]: of preservation. So when I got to the National Archives, and I think that was the year 2011

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.040
[Guest]: to start my research, you know, I was taken to a room and said, here's the catalogue,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.760
[Guest]: you know, tell me what you want, basically. So, you know, only when I got to the archives

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.000
[Guest]: did I discover that there are these 30,000 documents, right? And, you know, I thought

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.640
[Guest]: I might be in the National Archives for a few months. I ended up being there for about

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.840
[Guest]: two years, and I only got through about half of the collection. So there's another half

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.360
[Guest]: that I haven't even seen. But, I mean, one of the nice things about doing archival work

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.520
[Guest]: in India, which you do not get at, say, like a British library or archives in America,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.920
[Guest]: is that if you show to the archivists that you're there for the long run, and, you know,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.200
[Guest]: you are, you know, an honest and committed scholar, they give you certain privileges

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.120
[Guest]: that you would not otherwise enjoy in other facilities. So I started working very closely

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.760
[Guest]: with some of the archivists and saying, you know, I found this document, can you make

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.800
[Guest]: sure it gets preserved properly, because otherwise it will fall apart. And over time, at least

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.760
[Guest]: I was lucky enough to build up a relationship of trust with them that they allowed me to

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.480
[Guest]: actually go into the back room and get material myself. So I didn't have to worry for, you

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.640
[Guest]: know, about waiting for someone to deliver the papers for me, I could go in the back

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.840
[Guest]: and get the material myself. And that definitely helped me in the sense of understanding what

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.040
[Guest]: the papers were like, what it's like to go through someone's life collection and how

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.080
[Guest]: it's organized, and where there are discrepancies and where there's too much material where

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.440
[Guest]: there's too little material. So I mean, to answer your question, at least of methodology,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.080
[Guest]: I, you know, I think the author Robert Carroll was onto something when he said, you know,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.480
[Guest]: you have to go through everything, you have to turn every page. And of course, you know,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.600
[Guest]: in a PhD program, you don't necessarily have that luxury, because you eventually have to

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.840
[Guest]: graduate. And I definitely took much longer than I should have, I took eight years, and,

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.080
[Guest]: you know, I should not have taken that long. But I tried to get as close to that as possible.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.640
[Guest]: And I think in the ultimate end, it was very helpful. I mean, perhaps 80% of the material

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:41.240
[Guest]: I collected, I never used in the book. But it helped me kind of create an overall structure

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.280
[Guest]: of where this individual's life was going. And it ultimately will help me as I write

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.200
[Guest]: my next books as well.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and Caro, of course, has taken more than 40 years over his Lyndon Johnson biography,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.880
[Amit Varma]: which I think the sixth volume will be out sooner. So that was so I'm glad you didn't

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.600
[Amit Varma]: follow his example that seriously. And the second part of the question, then, you know,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.160
[Amit Varma]: when you begin, how do you sort of approach it? Do you have a preset narrative in your

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.640
[Amit Varma]: mind that kind of changes as you go along? Or do you try to just sort of put yourself

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.320
[Amit Varma]: in the moment that a document is from and try to figure it out from there? You know,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.840
[Amit Varma]: how did the book mutate and take shape in your head?

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.240
[Guest]: Yeah, so when I started the project, you know, I read the little material on Naroji that

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.120
[Guest]: was around beforehand. I mean, the first biography, as I mentioned, for Naroji was written by

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.280
[Guest]: Rustom Masani, R.P. Masani. And it was written in 1939. And it's a great book in the sense

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.360
[Guest]: that it's far more comprehensive than mine in terms of, you know, wanting to know about

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.960
[Guest]: Naroji's life. It's 400 odd pages. He had access to material that was gone and lost

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.280
[Guest]: by the time I had the chance to look at the material. But it is ultimately colored by

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:59.200
[Guest]: the politics of the time. I mean, Masani was a moderate, and he was writing in a way to

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.520
[Guest]: try to show Naroji as kind of a moderate, loyalist leader, in that sense, somewhat separate

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.240
[Guest]: from Gandhi. And he tried to hold up Naroji as a model of what nationalism was like before

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.440
[Guest]: it took this kind of break from, you know, some sense of British loyalism, you know,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.520
[Guest]: this difference that took place after the Puran Swaraj Declaration was made by the Congress

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.840
[Guest]: in 1929, 1930. And so, you know, I went into the archives with kind of this literature

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.760
[Guest]: showing Naroji as being quite a moderate leader, ultimately a loyalist, not a terribly radical

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.640
[Guest]: leader. And again, I think the most important thing I gained from reading his private correspondence

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.080
[Guest]: was helping me get away from that narrative. I mean, ultimately, yes, Naroji, during the

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.840
[Guest]: course of his life, made several declarations talking about how he was loyal to British

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.960
[Guest]: rule. You know, he was a proud member of the British Empire. But at the same time, he was

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.240
[Guest]: making completely contradictory statements. He was talking about British rule being evil.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.800
[Guest]: If you read his private correspondence with certain people, he's talking about British

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.160
[Guest]: rule in quite condemnatory terms. I mean, he's talking about how British rule was responsible

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.880
[Guest]: for mass famine, and people were being killed in the millions because of the policies that

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:14.120
[Guest]: were being pursued or not pursued by the British. So, you know, it kind of evolved, in my sense

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.480
[Guest]: at least, a question of what does it mean to be loyal? So you can say that you are a

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.040
[Guest]: loyal member of, you know, the Empire, you're loyal to the Queen or the King or whatever,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.200
[Guest]: but what does that mean? And ultimately, you know, I kind of understood Naroji's loyalism

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.440
[Guest]: as a bit of a tactic, and a way to kind of undercut a lot of the elements of, you know,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.120
[Guest]: nefarious colonial policy. You know, he said, he and other early nationalists kind of built

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.840
[Guest]: up this narrative of British rule should be this, it should be X, right? But in reality,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.280
[Guest]: we have Y. British rule should be something about equality, democratic rights, some sort

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.080
[Guest]: of progressive impulse. But in reality, you know, what you had in India was this very

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.060
[Guest]: reactionary, undemocratic, fiercely authoritarian rule where, you know, progressive, any sense

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.000
[Guest]: of progressive policy was completely absent, right? I mean, it was very derogatory towards

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.080
[Guest]: Indians, it didn't really support education. So, you know, the idea of British rule was

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.040
[Guest]: ultimately, you know, not British rule. It was some kind of idealized conception that

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.000
[Guest]: involved separating yourself 99% from actual British rule. So, in many ways, it was kind

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.960
[Guest]: of a tactic, and that helped me kind of separate my particular view on Naroji from, say, what

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.040
[Guest]: Massani or others had written about beforehand. And, you know, this is important, at least

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.920
[Guest]: from the standpoint of writing history. Whenever you investigate an individual, what someone

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.520
[Guest]: writes and publishes in public is obviously very different from what they're saying in

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.000
[Guest]: private or writing in private. And this only really comes across when you're able to do

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.520
[Guest]: sustained archival research. I mean, again, not something like what Caro has done. I can't

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.360
[Guest]: afford to take 40 years. But, you know, if you put several months or perhaps years into

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: it, you gain a familiarity with someone's life and you're able to discern what the real

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
[Guest]: meanings were.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things that strikes me, especially about how we view history today,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.440
[Amit Varma]: is that we look for simplistic narratives, and especially we make these harsh binaries.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.280
[Amit Varma]: While the fact is that someone who's been in public life for decades, as Naroji was,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.160
[Amit Varma]: will inevitably contain multitudes. And also what seems to happen, and what you've charted

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.520
[Amit Varma]: out very well in your book, is that at different stages of his life, and you, of course, divided

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.400
[Amit Varma]: his career into sort of three broad stages, but at different stages of his life, he's

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:32.120
[Amit Varma]: responding to incentives. And a lot of the moderating statements come from that, like

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.400
[Amit Varma]: in that initial theoretical phase, where he comes up with a drain theory. And because

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.880
[Amit Varma]: he needs to be taken seriously, he can't take a radical tone. So he's got to sort of be

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.680
[Amit Varma]: moderate there. Similarly, when he's standing for parliament, of course, he's got to gain

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.040
[Amit Varma]: and again, proclaim his loyalty. And once that is done, of course, he's, you know, towards

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.360
[Amit Varma]: the end of his life, he's a little more radicalized. Let's start by sort of talking about, at this

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.920
[Amit Varma]: point, the early phase of his life, which was quite interesting to me, because even

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:08.000
[Amit Varma]: his early years, like, of course, he leaves Bombay when he's 30, when he goes to London.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.880
[Amit Varma]: But even in that time, he seems to have lived a fairly rich life, been a community leader,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, especially in something like, speaking of feminism, starting girls schools, all of

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that. Tell me a bit about those early days in Bombay and what his background is, like

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.520
[Amit Varma]: he is, of course, from this Parsi priestly family, which had once seen much better days,

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.840
[Amit Varma]: but is relatively impoverished when he comes and he's expected to join the priesthood.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And you've spoken about how, you know, when he's three, his father dies, and that probably

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:45.320
[Amit Varma]: saves him from a life of priesthood. And even though he does a little bit of early training,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.360
[Amit Varma]: but otherwise, you know, so tell me a bit about the Bombay of those days and Naoroji

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.400
[Amit Varma]: growing up and what was the sort of environment around him, which shaped him and which shaped

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.800
[Amit Varma]: his thinking about the empire?

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.240
[Guest]: So if we want to talk about Bombay in the early 1800s, we automatically have to think

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.480
[Guest]: about the places where people were coming from, right? I mean, Bombay, as this immigrant

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.880
[Guest]: center was drawing in people from all across Western India, and in Naoroji's case, the

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.240
[Guest]: place his family came from was Navsari and Dharampur. Navsari was a very old Parsi settlement.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.480
[Guest]: You know, there still is a relatively large Parsi population there. And Naoroji's family

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.080
[Guest]: was from a priestly line. You know, they could actually trace the descent right back to the

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:37.920
[Guest]: first priest, the first Zoroastrian priest who settled in Navsari. And so, you know,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.160
[Guest]: it's kind of funny, the people in Navsari who still believe that Naoroji was born there.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:48.480
[Guest]: And if you go to Navsari today, you will see a Naoroji birthplace. It's a very old house.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.680
[Guest]: And, you know, ever since the early 1900s, people have believed that Naoroji was born

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.160
[Guest]: there. Even Gandhi thought that Naoroji was born there. And he went and paid a pilgrimage

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.000
[Guest]: to that site in the 1920s during non-cooperation. Naoroji wasn't born there. He was born in

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: Bombay. And he was born out of this kind of poor migrant perspective. I mean, his parents

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.240
[Guest]: had left Gujarat in probably the year 1824, 1823. And at that moment in time, there was

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.200
[Guest]: a famine in parts of Gujarat. So there's a good chance that his family was impelled to

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.400
[Guest]: move because of the real specter of poverty. And that was the same reason that was pushing

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:32.600
[Guest]: people, Parsis, Gujaratis, you know, Maharashtrians, Konkanis, from all across Western India into

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.480
[Guest]: this new commercial entrepreneur. So Bombay was growing by leaps and bounds. In the year

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:44.760
[Guest]: that Naoroji is born, 1825, the Maidan, what is now Azad Maidan, was covered with tents

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.200
[Guest]: of people who were living there who had just migrated from famine tracts. So it's a city

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.120
[Guest]: that's growing every day. And you get the sense of a city that's really kind of in formation.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.920
[Guest]: It was also a very kind of rough and tumble place at this point in time. I mean, this

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.760
[Guest]: is before, you know, the grand colonial buildings that were constructed that we think of when

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.200
[Guest]: we associate that particular era of Bombay. So it was not an easy place to live in. I

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:14.840
[Guest]: mean, if you read descriptions of Bombay from this era, people talk about wide sewers, you

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:22.120
[Guest]: know, that basically would lap up on the doorsteps of people. Trash was a huge problem. The water

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.520
[Guest]: that you drank was muddy and there was a good chance that it would kill you. So it was not

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.480
[Guest]: a great place to live in from the standpoint of the vast majority of people. But I think

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.040
[Guest]: that the important thing for Naoroji and many others in his generation who grew up to be

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:41.160
[Guest]: important political leaders, is that they recognize the power of the diversity of the

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.960
[Guest]: city. I mean, unlike any other city in India at this point in time, you had people coming

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.560
[Guest]: from all walks of life and they were all living right next to each other. So the region of

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.360
[Guest]: Bombay that he grew up in, an area called Khadak, is located right next to an area called

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.960
[Guest]: Israeli Mohalla, which is where, you know, members of the Beni Israeli community lived.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.680
[Guest]: It's next to a very large Muslim district, today's Bendi Bazaar. And just to the north

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.360
[Guest]: of it, you have very rich Anglo-Indians, Pisces, Jews, British individuals living in places

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.000
[Guest]: like Baikala, which were fashionable in that day. So he got a very strong flavor of kind

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: of this cosmopolitan diversity. And this played a really important role in his early activities.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.560
[Guest]: I mean, he was admitted into a school at a very young age. And as you mentioned, you

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:35.160
[Guest]: know, the fact that his father passed away soon probably saved him from a priestly career.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.240
[Guest]: And he instead goes into a free school that was a quite novel experiment in this era.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.200
[Guest]: Free schooling was not common anywhere in the world really at this point in time, 1830s.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.920
[Guest]: And that really commits him to a life of public service because he realizes, at least he says

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.080
[Guest]: so later on when he writes about this later in life, he realized from a very early age

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:02.440
[Guest]: that he owed something to the general public. They had paid for him getting as good an education

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.640
[Guest]: as you possibly could in Bombay at this time. And he was learning from British teachers.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.800
[Guest]: He was learning from Indian teachers. He was reading Shakespeare. He was reading, you know,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.840
[Guest]: the latest science and philosophy coming from Europe. So, you know, he received a very well-rounded

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.080
[Guest]: education and as importantly, it was in the English language. So he grew up speaking English

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:26.360
[Guest]: fluently and being able to write in English fluently in addition to Gujarati. And he probably

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.520
[Guest]: knew some Hindustani and Marathi as well. So that really set him on kind of this course

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.600
[Guest]: of needing to pursue a public career. And so he attends Elphinstone College. He kind

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.520
[Guest]: of widens his intellectual horizons more at this point in time because the professors

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.320
[Guest]: there are quite progressive in this era. You know, even the British people who are teaching

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.040
[Guest]: are very forward-looking and kind of freely associated with Indians and support their

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.960
[Guest]: reformist efforts. And ultimately, after he leaves college, he decides to join Elphinstone

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.200
[Guest]: as a teacher and he rises through the ranks quite quickly and becomes the first ever Indian

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.280
[Guest]: appointed to the rank of full professor in a colonial college in India. So, you know,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.040
[Guest]: from this very early age, he is already marked out for success and, you know, kind of he's

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.000
[Guest]: a symbol of change in many ways. I mean, he was this very poor individual who's now at

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.520
[Guest]: the very top of Indian society. And this impels him, you know, this whole experience of, you

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.840
[Guest]: know, getting a kind of a very liberal education, feeling responsible to the public, pushes

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.960
[Guest]: him to adopt progressive causes. And one of them, again, was female education. You know,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.840
[Guest]: in the 1850s, no Indian community had a strong suit with female education, including the

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.720
[Guest]: Pisces. The Pisces were almost as reactionary as any other community in India at this point

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.880
[Guest]: in time. And Naorochi, to his credit, gets a group of fellow Indians, not just Pisces,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:53.680
[Guest]: but also Gujaratis and Maharashtrians, also gets them together, forms a network of indigenous

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.400
[Guest]: schools for girls and persists in getting their parents to send girls to schools in

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:04.280
[Guest]: spite of threats, in spite of, you know, editorials against them, verbal abuse. And what starts

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.840
[Guest]: as a very unpromising venture grows into an experiment where hundreds and hundreds of

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:14.480
[Guest]: Indian girls are being educated by the mid-1850s. And this is an unqualified success. So he

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.920
[Guest]: really kind of helps turn the table on orthodox thought at this point in time.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I was struck by a couple of strands here. One was his passion for education, not

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.120
[Amit Varma]: just self-education. And you've actually done another really interesting thing that I liked

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book, where when I read the biographies of people, I want to know what are the kind

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.760
[Amit Varma]: of books that they read. And, you know, you've got a little list of that. And obviously,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.400
[Amit Varma]: they're all freely available on the internet, because they're, you know, so I kind of looked

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.000
[Amit Varma]: up a couple of them. And it was quite, quite sort of interesting to try and figure out

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Amit Varma]: what those strands might have been. And he takes education so seriously that at one point

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.680
[Amit Varma]: towards the end of his life, you quote him as saying, quote, several honors came to me

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:01.200
[Amit Varma]: during my lifetime, but no other title created in me that sense of pride, which I felt in

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.200
[Amit Varma]: being known as a professor, stop quote. And as you point out, he was, of course, you know,

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.920
[Amit Varma]: the first Indian to be made a full professor, even the sort of the two people he really

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.040
[Amit Varma]: admired, you pointed out at Elphinstone, Bal Gangadhar Shah, Sri Jambekar and Navroji Fardunji

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.000
[Amit Varma]: were assistant professors at the time. So he was sort of the first. The other strand

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.520
[Amit Varma]: that struck me and, you know, very often, I think what happens is that when men get

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.880
[Amit Varma]: into women's rights, they get into women's rights, but they get into it looking at women

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:37.720
[Amit Varma]: as instrumental to the world of men. And Navroji actually went beyond that. So you've got a

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:43.840
[Amit Varma]: passage here, which I'll quote, quote, like Kaikhoshru Harmasi, Navroji believed that,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.600
[Amit Varma]: quote, good and educated mothers only will raise good and educated sons, stop quote.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.080
[Amit Varma]: But he also possessed notably progressive views on female education, arguing that it

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.480
[Amit Varma]: was a fundamental pillar for establishing gender equality. Indians, he argued, would

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.220
[Amit Varma]: one day, quote again, Navroji's words, understand that women had as much right to exercise and

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.920
[Amit Varma]: enjoy all the rights, privileges and duties of this world as man, each working towards

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.560
[Amit Varma]: a common good, stop quote. And this seems remarkably sort of progressive. And it was

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.420
[Amit Varma]: clearly a cause he cared about, because like you said, he started schools for first Parsi

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:22.600
[Amit Varma]: girls and then Maharashtrian Hindu girls, and then Muslim girls. And it was something

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:29.880
[Amit Varma]: that he cared deeply about. Also, give me a sense of, you know, he founded many organizations,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.920
[Amit Varma]: he was part of many organizations, notably, what you call as Young Bombay. Tell me a bit

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.000
[Amit Varma]: about Young Bombay and his other community work. He also founded a Gujarati newspaper

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.160
[Amit Varma]: called Rast Guftar, for which he continued sending dispatches even when he was abroad.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.840
[Amit Varma]: And all of this before he's turned 30, because he leaves Bombay when he's turned 30. So what's

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.640
[Amit Varma]: going on? How is such a young man so incredibly active and already a leader in his community

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.080
[Guest]: at such a young age?

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.200
[Guest]: So what you said about education really being kind of a hallmark of his career, I think

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.920
[Guest]: can be applied to pretty much all the nationalist leaders of this early era, this kind of pre-Gandhian

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.960
[Guest]: era. It's written all throughout the narratives of, you know, anyone, you can pick Ranade,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.640
[Guest]: Gokhale, all the way down to people who are less known. I mean, you know, recently in

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.840
[Guest]: my research, I've been coming across articles written in Modern Review by a lot of people

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.320
[Guest]: who are not very familiar to us nowadays. And education is always that theme. Education

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.720
[Guest]: is the key for uplifting Indian society. And, you know, I think the reason why education

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.120
[Guest]: was so important for both Naoroji and these other leaders is that there was a general

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.440
[Guest]: understanding that India was at a very low point in its history. Right. I mean, most

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.960
[Guest]: people, of course, would have no point of reference. They would not be able to understand

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:52.040
[Guest]: how rich the rest of the world was in comparison to India. But they understood a sense of what

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.480
[Guest]: the type of poverty India was experiencing through oral narratives of, you know, parents

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.880
[Guest]: or grandparents talking about how at one point in time there was this very prosperous, you

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:07.240
[Guest]: know, trade in cottons, in cotton goods, through understanding that poverty was increasing

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: dramatically just through the spate of famines, just through the fact that so many people

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: were pouring into the city of Bombay due to terrible conditions in the countryside. So

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.600
[Guest]: at this point in time, with so much evidence of poverty around you, education was really

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.520
[Guest]: the one tool you had for betterment. And it was also one of those areas which the colonial

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.760
[Guest]: government obviously exercised control, but you had enough space to also exercise your

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:39.200
[Guest]: own agency. So, you know, the British officials at this time would talk a lot about how Indians

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.840
[Guest]: need to embrace Western education and, you know, they're so ignorant and they're so backward,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.580
[Guest]: but they wouldn't really lift a finger for that. Right. I mean, if you look at the amount

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.360
[Guest]: of money that the government of Bombay was paying for Indian education at this point

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.280
[Guest]: in time, it's a few hundred rupees. It's not much. Right. I mean, it's terribly low. So

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.680
[Guest]: Indians kind of filled the gap. And so I think there were many reasons why Naoroji was motivated

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.240
[Guest]: to take on these educational activities just by surveying the condition of people around

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.680
[Guest]: them and realizing that he himself had grown up in such an impoverished background. So

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:19.120
[Guest]: there was, you know, struggle makes people all the more motivated to undertake such work.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.400
[Guest]: And this theme of betterment and reform through education was something that, again, just

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.360
[Guest]: propelled young Bombay from its very start. And a very similar dynamic worked in Bengal

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:34.760
[Guest]: with young Bengal, you know, one or two decades beforehand. So there really was an idea that,

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.360
[Guest]: you know, something was wrong. The best way to help India to provide some sort of self-help

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.400
[Guest]: was education. And education could provide reform in three crucial aspects, religious

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.920
[Guest]: reform, social reform, and finally, political reform. And these three spheres of reform

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:59.200
[Guest]: are completely linked. You know, it was impossible to think of one type of reform throughout

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:04.080
[Guest]: the other. And these three pillars of reform, therefore, became kind of the foundation upon

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.960
[Guest]: which all these different organizations that Naoroji helped to found in Bombay in the 1840s

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:17.240
[Guest]: and 1850s, you know, come into life. So, you know, he helps establish learned societies.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.920
[Guest]: As you mentioned, he helps establish a Gujarati language newspaper, which is explicitly for

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.920
[Guest]: the purpose of disseminating education and talking about the need for reform, not just

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.440
[Guest]: within the Parsi community, but within the wider Gujarati reading public. He takes part

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.240
[Guest]: in the first formal political organization, the Bombay Association in 1851, 1852. So it's

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.680
[Guest]: a very well-rounded attempt to kind of think about how Indian society needed to be reformed

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:49.560
[Guest]: and changed in reference to, you know, impetus from the West, but also in reference to what

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.160
[Guest]: Indians themselves thought about what was wrong and what the situation was like under

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.920
[Guest]: colonialism. And there definitely was a very radical streak in all of this also. You know,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.000
[Guest]: I mentioned in my book how people like Naoroji were influenced by a generation of quite radical

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.520
[Guest]: Maharashtrian thinkers from the 1840s who talked about colonialism being terrible and

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:13.040
[Guest]: wrote about it publicly and talked about something like a drain of wealth well before, you know,

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.600
[Guest]: Naoroji popularized the term. So all these different forms of impetus, you know, explain

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.080
[Guest]: how young Bombay took place and why it took place at that particular point in time.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, just on a tangent to use a phrase which has possibly become overused these days,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.360
[Amit Varma]: but is there a sense of what is the idea of India, if there is an idea of India, or what

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:39.440
[Amit Varma]: are the ideas of India that are floating around in the ether which, you know, Naoroji can

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.200
[Amit Varma]: sort of imbibe and, you know, take further?

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.920
[Guest]: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, you know, depending on what sources you're looking at, India still

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.640
[Guest]: could be, you know, it still could include Afghanistan, it could include Singapore, it

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.160
[Guest]: could include what, you know, what was called the East Indies in the sense of what we now

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.960
[Guest]: know as Indonesia and Malaya. And certainly, since there were Indian populations in all

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:06.400
[Guest]: of these places, there was an understanding of, you know, India validly being a part of

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.280
[Guest]: these regions. But there definitely is a sense that, you know, the subcontinent as we think

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.920
[Guest]: of it, you know, everything south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, being India, that sense

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.760
[Guest]: is definitely coming into play. I mean, when you read the newspapers from this era, people

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.120
[Guest]: are talking about what's going on in Bengal, what's going on in Madras, they're also talking

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.160
[Guest]: about what's going on in Ceylon. And, you know, eventually, by the time of the mutiny,

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.400
[Guest]: parts of North India gather people's interest. But there definitely is a sense that, you

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.160
[Guest]: know, there is this kind of contiguous unit. I mean, yes, there's a great degree of diversity

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.560
[Guest]: in it, but there's a certain commonality. And there already is the idea that, you know,

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.480
[Guest]: we should, you know, think about what Bengalis are thinking about, because ultimately, you

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:55.480
[Guest]: know, we're part of the same milieu. We should exchange letters with whatever political association

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.760
[Guest]: is taking place in Madras, because ultimately, their concerns are very similar to what we're

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:06.080
[Guest]: talking about also. So, you know, there was, I think, a certain sense of cultural cohesion

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.880
[Guest]: happening. And, you know, we can't discredit the, you know, the role of at least British

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.760
[Guest]: colonial administration in this process. I mean, the fact that all of these places were

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.080
[Guest]: under British colonial administration, obviously got people talking about how they could jointly

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.480
[Guest]: together campaign for better rights towards the same government.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And just looking at what sort of shapes Naoroji's personality and his approach to dealing with

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.040
[Amit Varma]: the British, the famous moderate approach, quote unquote, so to say, you know, how big

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:42.160
[Amit Varma]: a role did the contingency of just the environment around him in Bombay play in that? Because

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.920
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me like there's one passage where you write, quote, as a student, Naoroji was

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.240
[Amit Varma]: exposed to a constant tussle between a miserly government and Indian stakeholders demanding

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.680
[Amit Varma]: more resources and better funding. He did not have to look far beyond the classroom

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.840
[Amit Varma]: walls to observe the many yawning gaps between imperial rhetoric and reality, stop quote.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:08.280
[Amit Varma]: And the sense that I got from your chapter on this phase of his life is that number one,

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:14.560
[Amit Varma]: whatever empire might be, at a personal level, like you said, the British teachers he encounters

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.360
[Amit Varma]: at Elphinstone are very progressive and, you know, different from what the establishment

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.680
[Amit Varma]: is like. Plus, there are other British people in power who take an interest in him, who

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:29.120
[Amit Varma]: try to help him out in various ways, which to some extent could, you know, explain the

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.840
[Amit Varma]: fact that he isn't a radical and thinking in terms of breaking away. Instead, he wants

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.240
[Amit Varma]: to continue doing and he does for the rest of his life, what he's learned to do in these

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.600
[Amit Varma]: early years in Bombay, that if you want to change something, say, if you want more funding

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.760
[Amit Varma]: for schools, you petition, you know, you try to take legal ways, you send a petition, you

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.520
[Amit Varma]: try to talk to sort of all of these people, you know, how contingent is the background

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.520
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, how you grow up and these sort of influences and what you later on go on

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.320
[Amit Varma]: to do, like, obviously, you've also looked at other historical figures, like, say, a

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Tilak or a Bipin Chandrapal on one end, and, you know, maybe a Gokhale and a Ranade at

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.320
[Amit Varma]: the more moderate end, you know, his fellow Parsi, Feroz Shah Mehta, for example, does

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.200
[Amit Varma]: that make, does that kind of background and all of that sort of make a difference in what

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.280
[Amit Varma]: you do for the rest of your life, you think?

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.940
[Guest]: I think it plays a very large role. You know, towards the end of his life, Naoroji was rightly

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:32.320
[Guest]: criticized by many radical nationalists as being too unwilling to give up this idea that

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.800
[Guest]: the British people themselves were beneficent. Ultimately, they were on the side of justice

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.160
[Guest]: and only if you tried hard enough, you would you would get what you what you deserved and

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.640
[Guest]: what you demanded. And that sentiment, I think, stems to a large degree from what you said,

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.880
[Guest]: his upbringing in Bombay. He was around a lot of relatively progressive minded Britons,

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:00.240
[Guest]: you know, people who believed in, obviously, the British Empire, but at the same time,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:07.840
[Guest]: were critical of it and did make an honest attempt to help people like Naoroji. So there

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.200
[Guest]: was a definite sense that, you know, the system as it was in Bombay had certain advantages

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.720
[Guest]: and the British British rule, you know, even though it had all these terrible flaws, at

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.120
[Guest]: least that progressive impulse was there. And, you know, if you if you just if you pushed

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.280
[Guest]: and prodded enough and if you try to convince people enough, you know, they'd come around

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.520
[Guest]: to your viewpoint. And that was something very difficult for Naoroji to let go of. I

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:34.600
[Guest]: mean, by the time he's 80, he's just about wrestling with this idea that, you know, maybe

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.360
[Guest]: all of this is wrong and, you know, ultimately something like Swaraj, where you're completely

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.960
[Guest]: separate from the British Empire, might be a possibility. And again, for someone like

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:49.640
[Guest]: Tilak or Bipin Chandra Pal or others, this idea, they had thrown out the window many

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.960
[Guest]: decades ago. Right. I mean, they had already realized that this sense of British justice

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.440
[Guest]: was more illusion than fact. And so it was much easier. They had made this realization

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.920
[Guest]: much earlier in life. Naoroji, since he had a relatively positive experience with many

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.560
[Guest]: of these figures and since the figures in his life who were British were more progressive

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.920
[Guest]: in many ways, did not have this opportunity. You know, so I think that's that's one ground

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.560
[Guest]: which we can definitely criticize Naoroji for not seeing, you know, a more holistic

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: perspective on what the British public was like or, you know, interrogating this idea

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.600
[Amit Varma]: of what British justice meant.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.160
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, at 30, so till 30, there have been sort of these two strands that I see

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.800
[Amit Varma]: in Naoroji's life. One is that he's intensely into education and he's a math whiz. You know,

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:43.080
[Amit Varma]: if he was alive today, he'd be a quant or a serious economist. I mean, you know, some

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:48.600
[Amit Varma]: of that work is just remarkable. And that's on the one hand where he's on the track and

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.640
[Amit Varma]: massive academic success because hey, first Indian professor and all of that. The other

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.840
[Amit Varma]: track is he's doing things within society. He started all these girls schools and he's

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.920
[Amit Varma]: part of these organizations. He started this Gujarati newspaper. And then at 30, he gives

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.920
[Amit Varma]: it all up or not gives it all up, but leaves it for the moment and decides to go to England

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.080
[Amit Varma]: to basically work in a corporate job for the commas, you know, and strikes out on his own

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:16.240
[Amit Varma]: a couple of years later. But essentially, he ends up spending decades in England. Give

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.280
[Amit Varma]: me a sense of what's going through his head at this time. Like, what does he want? Why

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.960
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, these two things are so important to him being everything that he's doing in

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:31.200
[Amit Varma]: Bombay as part of Young Bombay and outside that and equally as an academic, you know,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.640
[Amit Varma]: he's making such a difference here in Bombay. And yet he goes there and this is in fact

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.040
[Amit Varma]: the criticism that will come to him even later when he's, you know, settling down and wants

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.200
[Amit Varma]: to run for parliament after losing the first time and you point out in your book how all

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.240
[Amit Varma]: his friends including people in the Congress because the Congress is supporting him financially

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.680
[Amit Varma]: and morally and they're sort of with him but they're like, no, you come back here, we need

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.520
[Amit Varma]: you here. And he's still there. What does he want? This was very sort of interesting

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.360
[Amit Varma]: to me because it's not like he goes to England and he immediately gets into activism for,

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, a better India or whatever. So I was just trying to kind of figure out his

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.720
[Guest]: motivations here.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.920
[Guest]: It's very tough to understand and figure out those motivations because so much of the source

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.920
[Guest]: material is lost. You know, amongst those 30,000 documents that I talked about, there's

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.080
[Guest]: nothing for this era. Most of the 30,000 documents come from after the year 1886 and we're in

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:31.920
[Guest]: the year 1855 when he decides to go out to England. So it's very tough to reconstruct

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.100
[Guest]: what his motives are. But we do know that his announcement to sail and go off to England

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.440
[Guest]: and give up everything that he had done in Bombay came as a complete shock to everyone.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:49.720
[Guest]: So when his superiors at Elphinstone College learned that he has decided to quit and join

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.920
[Guest]: a commercial firm, they're so caught off guard. I mean, apparently the school principal says

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.520
[Guest]: to him, you know, what a fall. You know, what have you done? There are other officials in

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.680
[Guest]: the government who are so panicked by this that they actually use the telegraph to contact

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.480
[Guest]: the governor. And the telegraph had just been introduced into India at this point in time.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.640
[Guest]: So they're using this newfangled technology because it's really urgent. What do we do?

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.640
[Guest]: This star teacher is now leaving and he's been such an important part of the urban fabric

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.720
[Guest]: in Bombay. What do we do? What we do know is that Naorochi was only expecting to be

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.680
[Guest]: in the United Kingdom for a few years. He wanted about two or three years leave from

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.480
[Guest]: Elphinstone and then he wanted to come back and teach. That, of course, never happened.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:37.400
[Guest]: He ended up staying on in Great Britain and he pursued a career as a businessman. But,

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.040
[Guest]: you know, if we if we try to think of what's going on inside his mind, a few things come

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.760
[Guest]: to mind. I mean, first of all, by 1855, he's getting much more involved in political activities

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.560
[Guest]: and political activities in the direction of criticizing colonial rule. By this point

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.880
[Guest]: in time, the Bombay Association is established. There's kind of a, you know, a more forward

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.160
[Guest]: looking wing within the Bombay Association where people like Bawda Jilard or Naorochi

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.480
[Guest]: Fardunji are participating. And they're much more vocal in their criticism of British rule.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.440
[Guest]: So what better can you do than to go to the heart of empire and see for yourself what's

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.560
[Guest]: going on there? You know, what what what is the heart of empire like and how how does

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.520
[Guest]: the you know, the whole political process work over there? And the second reason, again,

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.560
[Guest]: of why this would have been an attractive thing for Naorochi is that when he joins the

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.840
[Guest]: Kama Company, he's specifically going there to work in the cotton trade. And in this era,

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.880
[Guest]: the cotton trade was the big business for Bombay. I mean, opium has just started to

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.760
[Guest]: fade as being kind of this important, you know, component of the economy and cotton

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:43.800
[Guest]: was really coming in. And by being an Indian in Great Britain, you were kind of, again,

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.760
[Guest]: going against the tide. You were, you know, cotton was flowing out of India and enriching

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.320
[Guest]: Great Britain. Here you were an Indian going out to Great Britain in order to kind of reverse

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.760
[Guest]: that direction a little bit and, you know, help Indians acquire machinery by which they

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.640
[Guest]: can eventually build their own cotton mills and maybe take a chunk out of Lancashire's

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.760
[Guest]: profit. So I think it was exciting in that aspect also from him. And the last component

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.120
[Guest]: where I think it really plays an influential, an idea that really plays an influential role

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:16.680
[Guest]: in Naorochi's thought and his decision to go out to England is that at this time, there

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.080
[Guest]: is, you know, discussion about Indians being allowed to join the Indian Civil Service.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.720
[Guest]: And again, the Indian Civil Service was this elite cadre, kind of the, you know, the origins

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:32.680
[Guest]: of what is now the IAS. And 99.9 percent, it was, it was, well, 100 percent at this

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.960
[Guest]: point in time, it was British. The people working at, you know, all rungs of power of

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:44.920
[Guest]: importance in the ICS were British. And through a system of civil service examinations, finally,

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.400
[Guest]: there was the possibility that Indians could be allowed to compete. And so Naorochi went

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.200
[Guest]: out to England in part in order to kind of help guide the first Indians who came out

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.320
[Guest]: to Great Britain in order to compete for the civil service exam. Because, again, in this

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.680
[Guest]: era, if you as an Indian wanted to join the civil service, you could not take an exam

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.560
[Guest]: in India. You had to, you know, shell out your life savings, sail halfway across the

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.000
[Guest]: world to Great Britain, spend upwards to two years studying in an extremely expensive,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.240
[Guest]: cold foreign country with bad food, and only then, you know, maybe take the exam and, you

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.800
[Guest]: know, 50 percent chance that you might pass. So, you know, if you failed, you lost everything

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:28.680
[Guest]: and you had to return to Bombay or Calcutta or wherever, humiliate. So this was not an

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:34.120
[Guest]: easy prospect for anyone who wanted to undertake this effort. And Naorochi thought, you know,

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.080
[Guest]: as someone who is interested in political matters, why don't I go out there and, as

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.360
[Guest]: a professor, try to help people and help them get prepared for this exam? And that's initially

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.960
[Guest]: what he does. I mean, when he goes out to Great Britain, he joins this cotton firm of

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.640
[Guest]: the Kama family, but he's immediately distracted. He might have been a very bad businessman

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.880
[Guest]: in this aspect, in the sense that he's immediately distracted by political activities. He starts

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:03.480
[Guest]: to campaign for civil service reform. He joins as a professor in University College in London,

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:09.200
[Guest]: teaching Gujarati. And this puts him in touch with people like Henry Maine or other important

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.560
[Guest]: colonial officials who are sitting as examiners for the civil service exam. So Naorochi is

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.740
[Guest]: one examiner alongside Henry Maine and other important individuals. And so he's automatically

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.960
[Guest]: drawn into this political world that he could only see at a distance when he was sitting

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.960
[Amit Varma]: in Bombay.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And I found it instructive to remind myself, and your book makes it easy to do so, that,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:36.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, going to London in those days wasn't quite what it is today, that you just take

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.080
[Amit Varma]: a flight and you're there. It took weeks to get there. And London is a shitty city in

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:45.800
[Amit Varma]: those days. It's polluted, it's grotty, it's Charles Dickens' London, it's full of disease.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:50.880
[Amit Varma]: It's a mess, life isn't easy. And you've got various parts in your book where you paint

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:57.680
[Amit Varma]: a very vivid picture of sort of the trouble Naorochi had in just adjusting there and why

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.580
[Amit Varma]: he became such a focal point of the community. At this point, it's time to actually sort

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:07.120
[Amit Varma]: of begin with what, in your book, you describe as the three phases of Naorochi's life. We've

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.920
[Amit Varma]: just reached the beginning of phase one, when he lands up in London. So let's take a quick

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:17.560
[Amit Varma]: commercial break, and then we'll get into the meat and bones of it as soon as we are

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.560
[Amit Varma]: back.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.680
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.720
[Amit Varma]: show alive. The Scene and the Unseen has been a labour of love for me. I've enjoyed putting

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:32.160
[Amit Varma]: together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.000
[Amit Varma]: as well. But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.640
[Amit Varma]: the show. Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.600
[Amit Varma]: woken up to the insane engagement level of podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:53.040
[Amit Varma]: for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself. Scheduling guests,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.400
[Amit Varma]: booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:04.080
[Amit Varma]: keeping this thing going, and that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:09.160
[Amit Varma]: episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:14.120
[Amit Varma]: lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:20.160
[Amit Varma]: slash support, and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:27.200
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.600
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help keep this thing going. sceneunseen.in slash

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.880
[Amit Varma]: support.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.180
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and the Unseen. I'm chatting with Dinyar Patel on his excellent

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:46.320
[Amit Varma]: biography of Dadabhai Naoroji. And, you know, at this point, Naoroji has reached London

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:52.480
[Amit Varma]: and we have reached London with him. The year is 1855. And now begins sort of the first

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.560
[Amit Varma]: phase, or rather he moves towards the first phase of his career, which you describe as

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:03.200
[Amit Varma]: a theoretical phase, where he comes up with what is known as a drain theory. And, you

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.840
[Amit Varma]: know, one of the interesting points you made here is you pointed out how Naoroji is often

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:14.040
[Amit Varma]: considered an economic nationalist, but you point out that economic nationalism and political

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:19.800
[Amit Varma]: nationalism for him kind of go together. They are so intimately enmeshed. So tell me a little

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.760
[Amit Varma]: bit about the kind of work he does during this period. What is his thesis? What is his

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760
[Guest]: solution?

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.240
[Guest]: Economic nationalism and political nationalism, at least in my perspective, and at least in,

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:36.240
[Guest]: you know, in light of Naoroji's career, were two sides of the same coin. Naoroji began

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.520
[Guest]: his interest in, began pursuing an interest in Indian poverty out of this question of

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:48.400
[Guest]: reform, government reform, and ultimately poverty becomes the rationale for political

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:54.240
[Guest]: reform in India. And I think there are a few reasons why, again, he starts to think about

00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.760
[Guest]: poverty and reform at the same time. So, again, if you are in London in the late 1850s and

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:05.800
[Guest]: the early 1860s, you are in the biggest city of the world. You are in the most powerful

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.040
[Guest]: city in the world. As you mentioned, you're in a terrible city also, right? I mean, it's

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:15.320
[Guest]: horribly polluted. It's smelly. It's dirty. The Thames smells like sulfur. The food is

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.320
[Guest]: awful, of course. I mean, so it's a difficult place to be, but it's also it's a fascinating

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:24.440
[Guest]: place to be. It's kind of like Bombay today. I mean, it's, you know, it's both, you know,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:30.480
[Guest]: dirty and smelly, but also very exciting and, you know, very, you know, it's an exciting

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:37.840
[Guest]: place to be in. And in this era, when Naoroji is in London, again, he realizes just how

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.920
[Guest]: rich, you know, in spite of all these terrible things about London, how rich Great Britain

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.560
[Guest]: is in comparison to India. You know, the country is booming. It's, you know, the world's most

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:52.520
[Guest]: prosperous country. There are factories everywhere. There's a large working class that's being

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.440
[Guest]: slowly empowered through political reform. There are politicians who are talking about

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.320
[Guest]: democratization. And at the same time, you know, being in London and Liverpool, which

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.480
[Guest]: was the other city he lived in, he was, you know, miles away from the places where all

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.280
[Guest]: the wealth of empire was dumped and distributed across the country. So when we think of the

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.240
[Guest]: drain of wealth, he was at the very end of the spigot. I mean, he saw the wealth that

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.920
[Guest]: had been drained out, you know, come to British shores and be disseminated through the banks

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.240
[Guest]: and bank accounts of various British individuals. So, you know, there's a very vivid kind of

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:30.120
[Guest]: understanding of how imperialism works when you're at the very heart of empire. And again,

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.520
[Guest]: the last reason for why this era is particularly important is what is going on around the empire

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.480
[Guest]: and globally at this moment. So, of course, in the early 1860s, you have the American

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:46.480
[Guest]: Civil War, which has an immediate global knockoff effect. All of a sudden, in one stroke, the

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:51.600
[Guest]: cotton that had been feeding this great industrial machine in Great Britain is cut off. It had

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.840
[Guest]: come from the American South. And there's this huge panic, right? People like Sven Beckert

00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.640
[Guest]: have written about it in his book, Empire of Cotton. What do you do? You know, the cotton

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.720
[Guest]: that was sustaining your industrial prowess is no longer there. Well, eventually, India

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.960
[Guest]: became one of those places where cotton was was brought into to feed these, you know,

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:15.280
[Guest]: dark sustanic mills, so to speak, of of Great Britain. And Naroji's friends in Bombay and

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.520
[Guest]: he in London get extremely rich during this cotton boom during the American Civil War.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:26.400
[Guest]: And as quickly as the cotton boom ends, they all go bankrupt. You know, Naroji goes bankrupt

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:31.360
[Guest]: because he loans out money to friends who turn out to, you know, not have been able

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:36.040
[Guest]: to pay him back. He was a bit too honest of a businessman in that regard. But automatically

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.240
[Guest]: you get this huge slump in Bombay, which eventually, you know, which has terrible consequences

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.400
[Guest]: in the countryside. I mean, it contributes to to famines in places like Kandesh and Gujarat

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:52.640
[Guest]: by the 1860s and 1870s. So there's one kind of big global shock, right, that kind of brings

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.600
[Guest]: home this idea of how the economy is linked together and how poverty and and prosperity

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.320
[Guest]: are again two sides of the same coin. The other big event that takes place, which again

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:10.160
[Guest]: Naroji is seeing from a distance, is the Orissa famine of 1867, 1868, where again, you know,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.160
[Guest]: he he'd never stepped foot in Orissa at this point in time. But the reports that were coming

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.400
[Guest]: out of Orissa at this point were gruesome and terrible. One out of every three people

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.840
[Guest]: might have died. And as later investigations took place, it was realized that this was

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.760
[Guest]: largely preventable. I mean, there were boats with grain that could have easily been shipped

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.520
[Guest]: in. But, you know, the colonial officials, for various reasons, did not do it. And the

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.360
[Guest]: result is one million people dead. And so the the very first proper speech that Naroji

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360
[Guest]: gives on the drain of wealth, he doesn't call it the drain of wealth at this point in time.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.840
[Guest]: He doesn't even use the word drain, is kind of in reflection to these two particular moments

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.240
[Guest]: and especially the Orissa famine. I mean, he gives a speech in 1867. So the Orissa famine

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.360
[Guest]: is definitely very much on his mind. And he asks a question, you know, OK, so British

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.320
[Guest]: rule, we're told, is good. It's provided us with all these benefits, rule of law. It's

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.640
[Guest]: supposedly better than the chaos that was present in India before British rule. So you

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.080
[Guest]: have that. But at the same time, you have these terrible famines, whereas the life that's

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.520
[Guest]: secured through law and peace is ultimately being killed anyway, right, through terrible

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.800
[Guest]: famine. So what gives? What explains this contradiction? And that really is the impetus

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.800
[Guest]: for understanding Indian poverty in Naroji's mind. Why is, on one hand, British rule being

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.680
[Guest]: credited with giving these benefits to India, yet on the other hand, it's very clearly impoverishing

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:40.080
[Guest]: the country? Why is there this central contradiction? And as Naroji progresses through about two

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:47.200
[Guest]: decades of close economic analysis, he again sheds this view that British rule was beneficent,

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.760
[Guest]: that it ultimately was doing all of these good things. So these ideas that he had during

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.800
[Guest]: his first few speeches that, you know, some of the drain was justified, that the services

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.120
[Guest]: that the British were rendered were being paid back in part through the drain, he throws

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.920
[Guest]: these out the window. And he realizes that, no, the drain itself is a nefarious process.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.400
[Guest]: And he realizes that, you know, the supposed benefits of British rule, like the railways,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.280
[Guest]: irrigation systems, et cetera, are actually accelerating the drain. You know, with the

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.480
[Guest]: railways, you get the wealth out of places like Kandesh or Berar or Gujarat even quicker,

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.040
[Guest]: and you impoverish the people even quicker. So, you know, this is also where this whole

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.240
[Guest]: idea of radicalization kind of seeps in, this kind of ability to kind of discard your previous

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.280
[Guest]: notions and based on the facts and evidence before you, go in a more progressive political direction.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it kind of struck me, you've given an example of how in many of these early speeches,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.760
[Amit Varma]: he's saying kind of fairly conciliatory things to the British, where his tone is extremely

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.400
[Amit Varma]: moderate, like at one point, you write, quote, somewhat incredibly, he believed that part of

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.960
[Amit Varma]: the drain was justified in exchange for the supposed political, moral and social benefits

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.600
[Amit Varma]: of British rule. It was inevitable that India had to sacrifice some of its wealth. And now,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.120
[Amit Varma]: you quote, Navroji, if India is to be regenerated by England, India must make up its mind to pay

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:13.200
[Amit Varma]: the price, stop quote. But, you know, as time goes by, this changes to, for example, at one point,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, speaking publicly, he says, quote, so far as my inquiries go at present, the conclusion

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.120
[Amit Varma]: I draw is that wherever the East India Company acquired territory, impoverishment followed

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.560
[Amit Varma]: their steps, stop quote. And he's far more scathing in private, you quote, something that he wrote to

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.440
[Amit Varma]: his friend, Bairamji Malabari, where he says, quote, these Englishmen cannot understand that

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.240
[Amit Varma]: the wealth that they carry away from this country is the whole and sole cause of our misery. They

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.600
[Amit Varma]: take away our bread, and then turn around asking us why we are not eating it, stop quote. So,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, very biting in this private message. Now, one of the early economic analysis, as you've

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:56.080
[Amit Varma]: spoken about is where he tries to calculate what we would today call maybe the, you know,

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.600
[Amit Varma]: income per capita. And he figures out that every Indian subject to the empire is getting 27

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.800
[Amit Varma]: shillings, while the average income in the United Kingdom is about 33 pounds per head, and between

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:16.080
[Amit Varma]: 27 to 40 shillings, depending on how you want to cut it. And one of the things that I was fascinated

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:25.360
[Amit Varma]: in this chapter by is his incredibly sophisticated use of data. And this also sort of evolves, like

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.040
[Amit Varma]: you've, you know, spoken about how, you know, by the time he's finished the last of his papers on

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.880
[Amit Varma]: the subject, his economic analysis has developed in three distinct stages. I found this incredibly

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.640
[Amit Varma]: fascinating, because each of these stages is one using data generated by the British, and B,

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.440
[Amit Varma]: the analysis is far more sophisticated than anything the British can do. Tell me a bit about

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:54.800
[Guest]: that. So in this era, again, when you are trying to get proper data on India, you are in many ways

01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:00.880
[Guest]: groping in the dark, it's very hard to get data at all, leave alone reliable data. So what the

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.120
[Guest]: British would do is at least for economic data, they would, you know, there'll be different people

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.360
[Guest]: around the country, and each district would tabulate approximately, you know, what was being

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:15.440
[Guest]: grown, how much revenue was being collected. And then that data was compiled at a national level.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:21.040
[Guest]: But oftentimes, it was done in a very sloppy way. So if you wanted to, you know, get even the gross

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.360
[Guest]: domestic product, you know, it was done in a way where, you know, lots of inaccuracies were in

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.800
[Guest]: place, if you want to get, you know, the average earnings of particular places, oftentimes, you

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.800
[Guest]: just take earnings figures for particular districts and divide by the number of districts.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.760
[Guest]: And as Naorochi pointed out, that's a flawed process, because each district was different,

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:46.800
[Guest]: you cannot compare Delhi with, you know, say, Tanna district, or what have you, it's a false

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:53.840
[Guest]: comparison. So there were many other people who, again, critical of the data, but only someone

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.920
[Guest]: like Naorochi, who, you know, by being in London had access to all of this data that was at the

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.520
[Guest]: India office, and also simultaneously had friends across the subcontinent who could give them

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.720
[Guest]: supplementary data, only someone like him was really able to, you know, kind of take a more

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.520
[Guest]: holistic view. So as you said, you know, he starts off with this original, you know, subset of

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:19.680
[Guest]: official data, and the picture presented is quite rosy. You know, there's a surplus of exports,

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.280
[Guest]: the economy is growing by X percentage, the amount of money that is being generated

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.120
[Guest]: through various goods being exported, like cotton, or what have you is very large.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.760
[Guest]: But ultimately, when you put all these different pieces together, you realize that, you know,

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.960
[Guest]: the big components of your economy aren't that big at all, anywhere in the first place. I mean,

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.440
[Guest]: a lot of people by the 1870s and 1880s attacked Naorochi's economic arguments by saying,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.640
[Guest]: how can you say India is growing poorer, whereas in Bombay, you have this huge mill industry that's

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.440
[Guest]: evolving? And certainly, yes, in Bombay, there was a very large mill industry. But ultimately,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.680
[Guest]: if you look at the whole economy of India, it wasn't that big, right? I mean, you know,

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:08.000
[Guest]: you had 30 or 40 mills, and sure, it was, you know, creating a lot of wealth for a few Indians,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.680
[Guest]: but the vast majority of the country was still agricultural, of course, right, and living in

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.240
[Guest]: rural areas of the country, which were being terribly impoverished. So it was kind of that

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:21.520
[Guest]: ability to kind of balance things out and look at the big picture that helps Naorochi interrogate

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.840
[Guest]: this data. And again, as he gains more friends around India, and as he himself goes on his own

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.920
[Guest]: tours throughout parts of Gujarat or Western India, he himself collects data, he revises it,

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.360
[Guest]: and he, by the end of his, you know, career as an economic thinker in the early 1880s,

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.360
[Guest]: presents a picture where he shows Punjab, which was thought to be the most prosperous

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.520
[Guest]: province of British India. It was also the part of British India which had British rule for the,

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.040
[Guest]: you know, the shortest period of time, only since the 1840s. He shows even that in Punjab,

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:02.080
[Guest]: the average person is living at bare subsistence levels. I mean, you know, if a famine came along,

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:07.760
[Guest]: they would be dead. So it's a really striking comparison that he makes between this, you know,

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.200
[Guest]: rosy pronouncement in the official circles of, you know, moral and material progress. There

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.040
[Guest]: were reports that the British government would issue every year on the supposed moral and

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.800
[Guest]: material progress of India, but the reality, as he discovered, was a very different picture.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I was kind of extremely struck by your, you know, description of the stages. Again,

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.120
[Amit Varma]: I'll, you know, quote from the book, quote, it indicates how Naoroji's economic analysis

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.560
[Amit Varma]: developed in three distinct stages, approximations based on scanty data such as land revenue as was

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.360
[Amit Varma]: undertaken in the wants and means of India, estimates based on rigorous analysis of official

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.800
[Amit Varma]: raw data seen in poverty of India, and finally, Naoroji's supplementation of this raw data with

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.680
[Amit Varma]: his own collected statistics and observations, enabling even more nuanced estimates and pointed

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.080
[Amit Varma]: refutation of government figures, stop quote. And then you speak about how, you know, the Punjab

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.600
[Amit Varma]: study where you pointed out where you said he, quote, analyzed production in Punjab through 21

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.080
[Amit Varma]: key agricultural commodities, 15 types of manufactured goods, and other activities

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.880
[Amit Varma]: such as mining and livestock, even taking into account marginal occupations such as fishing,

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.440
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And I can't imagine what he would have made of Indian data today. Because in many ways,

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:25.280
[Amit Varma]: it is as confusing and obfuscatory and scattered as the data back then seems to have been. And now,

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.840
[Amit Varma]: and here's one thing that I find so fascinating about Naoroji, that he excels in so many different

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:37.200
[Amit Varma]: areas, which he combines into, you know, one stream of action, but it's not necessarily so.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Number one, he is a numbers guy, who's actually crunched all this raw data figured out that the

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.520
[Amit Varma]: British conclusions are wrong. And he's, you know, he's done the rigorous analysis, and he's come to

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.960
[Amit Varma]: these his own conclusions. Two, he's skilled at rhetoric, so he can actually go out and talk about

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:59.120
[Amit Varma]: it, and present it and, you know, frame it in terms everyone can understand. Three, even before

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.760
[Amit Varma]: he actively enters politics, he's actually a very good politician in terms of making all the

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.200
[Amit Varma]: alliances he needs to make to get access to the data and to be able to speak at all these places.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And four, he's enough of a policy wonk to now go from economic analysis to policy suggestion

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:20.880
[Amit Varma]: and say that, okay, this is a problem, they're bleeding us dry, this is what we need to do.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.840
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, do you have a comment on how remarkable it is that one man can combine all of

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:32.960
[Amit Varma]: these different facets? And also now tell me about sort of what is, after that, tell me what is a

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.120
[Amit Varma]: political conclusion that he then reaches from his economic analysis? It is quite remarkable that

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.120
[Guest]: someone, again, this elite individual, this somewhat anglicized, quite anglicized individual,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.360
[Guest]: I should say, also had knowledge, such a deep knowledge of Indian agriculture that he could

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:57.200
[Guest]: identify different types of sugar, different types of soil, and point out where, you know, British

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.800
[Guest]: calculations were wrong, because, you know, they identified a different type of commodity

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:08.320
[Guest]: than what existed in actuality. So he definitely did his homework. And, you know, I think at this

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.440
[Guest]: point in time, again, he was just, he was a complete workaholic. His central focus of his

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.880
[Guest]: life was understanding this process of impoverishment in India. So pretty much every

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.000
[Guest]: activity he undertook was somehow connected with it. Whenever he went back to India, he would

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.720
[Guest]: obviously spend time with his family, he didn't spend nearly enough, but he would immediately go

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.640
[Guest]: and talk to officials and then head out to the countryside and go and look and see what's going

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:41.680
[Guest]: on on the ground. Now, with regard to the political aspect of the drain theory, if you look at

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:49.040
[Guest]: previous scholarship, most scholars have been quite puzzled by Naoroji's particular frame of

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.160
[Guest]: mind on the drain theory, because he ultimately talks about one source of the drain. I mean,

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.920
[Guest]: there were many sources of the drain, right? I mean, in terms of, you know, natural goods and

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.160
[Guest]: natural resources being taken out of the country, high land revenue, but he ultimately focuses on

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.400
[Guest]: one component that seems on the surface not terribly important, and that's the amount of

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:16.160
[Guest]: money that's paid for the civil service. So, you know, he calculates that about 33 million pounds,

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.840
[Guest]: which of course was a big amount in that day, was taken out of India every year and, you know,

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:28.080
[Guest]: was, you know, sent back to Great Britain. That was the actual number in numerical terms of the

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.920
[Guest]: drain of wealth. And of that, initially, he says only a small portion of that is the salaries that

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.240
[Guest]: are paid to these British officers, because ultimately those British officers retire,

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.920
[Guest]: or even if they stay in India, they send their earnings back to Great Britain to support family

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.440
[Guest]: members. But there's a reason for why Naoroji focused on this, because again, as I said,

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:53.440
[Guest]: politics and economics are two sides of the same coin in Naoroji's nationalism. The civil service

01:12:53.440 --> 01:13:00.480
[Guest]: is this major political issue of this era. It's kind of the linchpin of Indian grievances,

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.120
[Guest]: because ultimately the civil servants are the ones that are kind of enforcing these very draconian

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.840
[Guest]: policies throughout India. So Naoroji and others had this idea that if you open up the civil

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.760
[Guest]: service to more Indians, and if Indians themselves are working for their own government,

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.720
[Guest]: those policies will change. Indians would not be beholden to the same imperial principles.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.520
[Guest]: They would understand the country better. They, of course, spoke the languages. So by focusing

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.320
[Guest]: on that particular component, just the civil service, you could make your political point

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.080
[Guest]: very convincingly. And this was something that I think a lot of early historians didn't really

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:40.880
[Guest]: focus enough on. They asked, why fixate on this particular small component? And you see

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:47.280
[Guest]: throughout his writings that he, by the end of his career as an economic theorist, he doesn't

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.240
[Guest]: care anymore about what percentage of the drain of wealth comes from the civil service, paying

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.680
[Guest]: for the civil service. It doesn't matter. No matter what it is, it is what needs to be solved.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:02.000
[Guest]: It itself is the source of all other aspects of the drain of wealth, because once you had Indians

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.120
[Guest]: in power, those other forms of drain, the drain of wealth would also dry up.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, it struck even me while I was reading the book that, you know, I couldn't

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.160
[Amit Varma]: figure out at first that, okay, I understand the point he's made with the data that we are losing

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.360
[Amit Varma]: so much money, a quarter of our taxes are just going back to England and we are progressively

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.280
[Amit Varma]: getting impoverished by this. But why fixate on salaries of civil servants? And then it struck me

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.840
[Amit Varma]: and tell me if this sort of interpretation is correct, that he figures out that, okay,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.560
[Amit Varma]: politically, what can I achieve? This is a reform that I can achieve politically,

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.760
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, I'm going to make this the focus. And I'm not going to focus about all the other

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.320
[Amit Varma]: diffused things that could solve the problem. And of course, the main thing that could solve

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.240
[Amit Varma]: the problem is the end of empire itself. He can't go for that. So this is the one achievable thing

01:14:52.240 --> 01:15:00.640
[Amit Varma]: that he fixates on. But what is then fascinating to me is that he fixates on this for the rest of

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.440
[Amit Varma]: his life, basically, I mean, till the end of his career in England, that, you know, even when he

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.760
[Amit Varma]: is in parliament, which we'll talk about later, this is the one thing that he wants to do. It's

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.600
[Amit Varma]: like for 30-40 years, he's just fixated on getting Indians into the civil service. And you could

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.320
[Amit Varma]: argue that now we have an Indian civil service full of Indians, and it's not that much of an

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:28.480
[Amit Varma]: improvement. But leaving that aside, you know, it's kind of a fascinating period. What also

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.160
[Amit Varma]: I find really interesting here is this little detour he takes, where he concludes that, listen,

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, British India is not one monolithic mass. There are places like Bombay and Madras and all

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.720
[Amit Varma]: which they govern themselves, but there are all these princely states all around some 300 around

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.920
[Amit Varma]: the area of Bombay alone. And they have less interference. And very often, they don't have an

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.280
[Amit Varma]: English British civil service sitting there. And therefore, there is there is a better scope for

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.800
[Amit Varma]: comparing what governance across these two places are and figuring out if good governance can

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.840
[Amit Varma]: actually make a difference. And rather than theorize about it, he actually takes that step

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.800
[Amit Varma]: and becomes the Diwan of Baroda, you know, where for a couple of years, he gets his fellow policy

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.640
[Amit Varma]: wongs from the young Bombay days in and they try to do their own thing. And there is crazy politics

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.040
[Amit Varma]: where the previous cabinet still exists as a shadow cabinet while they are trying to do their

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.760
[Amit Varma]: things. And there are, you know, and there's a British guy there who's fighting with the king

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.880
[Amit Varma]: and the king tries to poison the British guy and it's mad fun. So tell me a little bit about

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.840
[Amit Varma]: that kind of period and what was he trying to do really? I mean, was he trying to sort of prove a

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.560
[Amit Varma]: point that, hey, you know, A, we can govern well and B, if you govern properly, you'll get far

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.240
[Guest]: better outcomes. Is that the whole thing that he was on? Princely states in this era are extremely

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.560
[Guest]: interesting, you know, in terms of both the intrigues that are going on and also the potential

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.600
[Guest]: that they held for some sort of reform. I mean, when we think of princely states nowadays,

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.680
[Guest]: we think of reactionary old rajas who are holding on to power, anti-democratic. But the perspective

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:09.680
[Guest]: from the late 19th century was very different. They were recognized as being the last vestiges

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:17.120
[Guest]: of indigenous rule. In many cases, the rulers who are on the thrones in places like, say,

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:23.040
[Guest]: Baroda or Gondal were quite progressive. They took tentative steps towards political reform.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.160
[Guest]: So, you know, Mysore, for example, set up a legislative assembly. So did Baroda. States

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.400
[Guest]: like Gondal were experimenting in things like compulsory education by the very early 20th

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.000
[Guest]: century. So these places were thought of as being almost political laboratories. These were the only

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.520
[Guest]: places you as an Indian could, in your country, exercise some real administrative control.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.880
[Guest]: And it's for that reason that so many early Indian nationalists gravitate towards a few

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:57.760
[Guest]: princely states. I mean, again, actually Dutt served as a diwan. Naoroji served as a diwan.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:02.400
[Guest]: Other individuals in the nationalist movement were constantly advising and were constantly in

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.520
[Guest]: touch with princely officials from Hyderabad, through states that are now in Gujarat,

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:14.320
[Guest]: through Rajputana states in eastern India as well. So they really kind of exercised the

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.880
[Guest]: imagination of early nationalists. And you're right. I mean, when Naoroji goes out to Baroda, it is

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.680
[Guest]: in many ways his attempt and the attempt of his young Bombay crowd, if you will, to kind of put

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:33.600
[Guest]: ideas into practice. Here's an ability to actually implement the reforms and see whether we're right

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.720
[Guest]: about, first of all, a drain of wealth existing in British territories that didn't really exist in

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.560
[Guest]: the quote-unquote native states because they were under the control of our own people and

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.200
[Guest]: whether or not government could be better when the people in charge were actually Indians.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.800
[Guest]: Now, in any other era, in any other place, this might have been a pretty interesting and

01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:02.160
[Guest]: potentially fruitful experience. Baroda in this period of time, 1873 through 1874, 1875,

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.280
[Guest]: is the exact opposite of that place. I mean, it was ruled by a man called Malharrao.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:14.720
[Guest]: And as you had mentioned, Malharrao, the Gaikwad at this time, was in kind of a

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.800
[Guest]: deadly battle with the British resident, a man called Robert Fair, who was himself no angel.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.000
[Guest]: He was kind of this very puritanical British officer who always tried to meddle in the affairs

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:33.120
[Guest]: of princely states. He caused chaos when he was posted in Sindh by scheming behind

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.240
[Guest]: the backs of various people. And when he goes to Baroda, he makes it his life's mission to

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.040
[Guest]: somehow take down the Gaikwad. And when he learns that Naoroji is coming to serve as Diwan,

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:49.600
[Guest]: a prime minister, he's livid. He regards Naoroji as being kind of a seditious traitor who's saying

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.320
[Guest]: all these terrible things about British rule. And he actually says that he will not allow

01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:00.880
[Guest]: Naoroji to enter Baroda. I mean, think about this. I mean, a native state, an Indian princely state

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.080
[Guest]: where the British agent, who's not really in power, still says, you know, I will not allow

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:10.960
[Guest]: your Diwan to come into the territory of the state he's supposed to rule. It's quite incredible.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:17.440
[Guest]: And so for the next one and a half years when Naoroji serves as Diwan, he tries on one level

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.440
[Guest]: to implement these reforms that he has been talking about. And at one level, it's very

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.800
[Guest]: successful. I mean, he and his colleagues from Bombay clean up the judiciary. They get rid of

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:31.920
[Guest]: practices like Nazarana, where people basically pay for, you know, judicial verdicts in their

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:38.640
[Guest]: favor. They come up with a proper civil and penal code. They reform the, you know, the economy of

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:46.560
[Guest]: the imperial household. They, you know, go through the country and revise the land rates, which were

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:54.800
[Guest]: quite high. But ultimately, none of this really sticks because the Maharaja, the Gaikwad,

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.160
[Guest]: was not fully committed to a program of reform. He wanted to kind of keep his cronies in power

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:06.080
[Guest]: and at the same time kind of play politics against Robert Fair, the resident. So Naoroji gets trapped

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.760
[Guest]: right in the middle. And many people at this point in time, you know, criticize him rightly for not

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.080
[Guest]: being politically very savvy. I mean, here's someone who, again, has lived his life for the

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.880
[Guest]: most part in an ivory tower. And now he's thrown into a very real politic environment where you

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.840
[Guest]: have these two kind of implacable foes against each other, fighting for political power. And

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:33.280
[Guest]: it gets so bad that, you know, in the, I think, November of 1874, Robert Fair, the resident,

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:40.960
[Guest]: is actually poisoned. He's poisoned by via some arsenic being slipped into his glass of pomelo

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.520
[Guest]: juice. And there was some, you know, glass shards and also in here. It's a huge scandal. And

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:51.360
[Guest]: eventually it's discovered that the Gaikwad of Baroda might have been behind this, which is

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.520
[Guest]: scandalous, right? I mean, you know, things have got that bad. And luckily, Naoroji resigns just

01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:02.320
[Guest]: before the, you know, things go to the wall and the Gaikwad is removed. But ultimately, it's quite

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:08.000
[Guest]: a disappointing experience. I mean, Naoroji at one point kind of validates his idea that Indians,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.800
[Guest]: if they are in power, can, you know, kind of implement their own reforms. And he always had

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.160
[Guest]: this idea that good government is no excuse for native government, indigenous government. And so

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.880
[Guest]: in that sense, it's validated. But at the same time, he realizes that Indians, when they're in

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:27.680
[Guest]: power themselves, are not always going to be these very selfless individuals who are out for helping

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.400
[Guest]: the fellow countrymen. They have their own motives when they're in power and their own

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.480
[Guest]: power dynamics. And the princely state system, you know, there's a reason why nationalists

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.800
[Guest]: eventually fall out of, you know, these princes fall out of favor with nationalists, especially

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.120
[Guest]: by the time of Gandhi's and Nehru's generation, because ultimately they are, you know, at one

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.280
[Guest]: element, they are unrepresentative and undemocratic leaders. I mean, it took a

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:55.760
[Guest]: Saiji Rao to kind of take that step of reforming. But ultimately, at the end of the day, Saiji Rao

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.040
[Guest]: still wanted to stay in power, right? And by Gandhi and Nehru's time, Indian nationalism had

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.200
[Guest]: moved beyond that stage where these princely rulers were already real political use to them.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, no. And it's also like you pointed out, the timing is just crazy that he actually goes in

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.360
[Amit Varma]: there and, you know, gets his great team together, makes a few changes. But the optics are terrible

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.640
[Amit Varma]: because the Indian guy tried to kill the British guy. So what are you going to talk about?

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Now, the interesting thing after this is that at this point, he decides that I,

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, he moves on to the second phase, like he's done the theoretical phase. And this is sort

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.720
[Amit Varma]: of a transition, I guess, between the theoretical phase of the second phase, which is a political

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:39.920
[Amit Varma]: phase where he decides that, okay, I need to now get into British Parliament because it looks like

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:46.080
[Amit Varma]: that is the only way I'll be able to make a difference. And there is sort of, for the concept

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.640
[Amit Varma]: of this, there is some precedent, like at one point in your book, you write about Raja Ram Mohan Roy,

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.560
[Amit Varma]: quote, in 1828, Ram Mohan dispatched petitions to both houses of Parliament, protesting the

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.680
[Amit Varma]: company's intention to restrict membership in grand juries only to Christians, a matter that

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:07.360
[Amit Varma]: he vigilantly pursued in Westminster after sailing to Great Britain in 1830. Recognizing the broad

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.000
[Amit Varma]: public significance of his agitation against the Jury Act, Prasanna Kumar Tagore, a prominent

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Calcutta lawyer, hailed Ram Mohan as India's unofficial MP, stop quote. And you talk about

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:23.680
[Amit Varma]: how Naoroji decides that, okay, it's time, you know, enough of theory, enough of giving policy

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.520
[Amit Varma]: suggestions. And hey, the Baroda experiment didn't work. So the only way to really change things is

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:37.040
[Amit Varma]: to get into British Parliament. How outlandish is this at the time? Like at the time, how do people

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.080
[Amit Varma]: think about this? And what is his thinking behind it? And you know, what happens after this? Just

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.040
[Amit Varma]: take me a little bit through his thinking, because just to conceive of something like this seems so

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:53.840
[Guest]: audacious at one level. It is quite outlandish. But again, from the perspective of Indian nationalism

01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:01.200
[Guest]: at this moment, you are searching for the weakest link, which is the reason why civil service and

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:07.120
[Guest]: civil service reform preoccupied Indians so much as well. It was the weakest link in the edifice of

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.960
[Guest]: British imperialism. Now that there were civil service exams, there was a chance for Indians

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:17.680
[Guest]: to compete as well. Similarly, Parliament, the British Parliament, was regarded accurately by

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.200
[Guest]: Indian nationalists as being the ultimate source of power. I mean, you had your viceroy, you had,

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.000
[Guest]: you know, the various officials throughout India. But ultimately, the people who they looked up to

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.560
[Guest]: was the British Parliament. You know, the Parliament would vote on a budget every year.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.680
[Guest]: The Parliament would occasionally, you know, censure the Indian government if it did some

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.640
[Guest]: things that it didn't like. The Parliament had played a very important role under the company,

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.440
[Guest]: under, you know, the East India Company of being a very vocal critic. So yes, it was outlandish,

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:55.600
[Guest]: but it was the best option you had. You know, there was, you know, a 99 out of 100 chance that

01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.640
[Guest]: you would fail, but at least it wasn't 100 out of 100, which was the case in any other aspect. So,

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:06.720
[Guest]: you know, at this phase, early Indian nationalism and the Congress, the Congress having just been

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.120
[Guest]: established in 1885, looked to Great Britain as the only possible source of hope. And if it meant

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.760
[Guest]: that an Indian would have to stand to get into Parliament, so be it. And Naoroji was in many

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.600
[Guest]: ways the perfect candidate to try this venture because he had lived in Great Britain for such a

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.640
[Guest]: long period of time. You know, he spoke English fluently, maybe because he was a Parsi, he might

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.960
[Guest]: have looked a little bit more like Gora, he might have looked a little bit more fair than other

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.040
[Guest]: Indians. So, you know, he probably had the best chance. And when he starts to campaign for

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.720
[Guest]: Parliament, or at least starts to think about campaigning for Parliament, he says, you know,

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.480
[Guest]: look, again, I've lived in this country in Great Britain for two or three decades off and on. I

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.880
[Guest]: know many of the important political leaders here. I've talked to members of the Liberal Party. I've

01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.800
[Guest]: talked to members of the Conservative Party. And since India is a big political hot button issue,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000
[Guest]: maybe there's a chance. Naoroji is not the first Indian to run, to stand for Parliament. That honour

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.360
[Guest]: goes to a man called Lalmohan Ghosh. And I spent the first month of lockdown researching his

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.840
[Guest]: activities for the next book I'm writing. And Ghosh comes very close to winning. It's quite

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:26.640
[Guest]: remarkable. He stands in a place called Deptford, close by to Greenwich, and, you know, comes within,

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.120
[Guest]: you know, a few dozen votes of winning, but ultimately doesn't win. So the door is already

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.520
[Guest]: open a little bit. Okay, so, you know, there already are a few people who are starting to

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.640
[Guest]: think about standing for Parliament. And the way that Naoroji thinks that he would have an even

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.320
[Guest]: better chance of standing for Parliament is if he made his parliamentary campaign not just about

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.120
[Guest]: India. If you're a Briton living in this era, your vote is not going to be swayed based on what you

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.880
[Guest]: talk about India, right? I mean, most people have no clue about what's going on in India. They can

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:04.320
[Guest]: maybe identify it on a map, maybe they can't. But if you link Indian political issues with issues

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.760
[Guest]: that resonated with the average British individual, whether it was Irish Home Rule, the idea that

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.720
[Guest]: Ireland should have some sort of autonomy from Great Britain at this point in time, whether you

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:21.520
[Guest]: were talking about labor rights, the rights of people to unionize, the rights of women to vote,

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.840
[Guest]: then you could catch their attention. And so Naoroji starts to do this during his first campaign,

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.320
[Guest]: which takes place in 1886. I should mention that, you know, he had started to think about standing

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:38.640
[Guest]: for Parliament many years beforehand, from at least 1877 onward. But it's only in 1886 that

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:43.920
[Guest]: he really gets the first opportunity to stand. And the reason why he chooses that year is because

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:51.040
[Guest]: parliamentary reform had just taken place in Great Britain. So Indians were very keenly observing how

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:56.480
[Guest]: democratization was going on in Great Britain, and then using that democratization to their

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.480
[Guest]: advantage. So in 1885, 1886, there had been these reform bills that had been passed, and

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:09.520
[Guest]: automatically now, you know, maybe 25% of men had the right to vote. Maybe it was a little bit

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.200
[Guest]: higher than that. I can't remember. But now more people have the right to vote, and you could be

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:22.400
[Guest]: more popular in your attempts to woo the British voter. And so when he stood for Parliament for the

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.600
[Guest]: first time from Holborn, close by to the British Museum, he doesn't just talk about India. He talks

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:32.480
[Guest]: about the rights of Irishmen and Irish women. He talks about labor rights, things like, you know,

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.000
[Guest]: eventually stuff like the eight-hour day. He talks to a limited degree about the right of women to

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.880
[Guest]: vote. He talks about local municipal issues, problems with the London municipality,

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.160
[Guest]: problems with transportation. So he's very clearly linking together India to a whole myriad of other

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.880
[Guest]: issues that will capture the attention of the average British voter. And this gives him a bit

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:59.840
[Guest]: more of a fighting chance. And eventually, again, he does lose in 1886. He loses by quite a large

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.920
[Guest]: margin. But he doesn't lose as badly as many people thought that he would have.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I was kind of fascinated again by this period, because before this, you mentioned that

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.800
[Amit Varma]: earlier there was this, you know, when he goes to Baroda, there is a suspicion that, oh, he's an

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:19.520
[Amit Varma]: ivory tower guy, and he's going to Baroda. And what does he know? And what I find about his

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.840
[Amit Varma]: England years, from your book, is that his political skills are remarkable, because

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:31.280
[Amit Varma]: he realizes that India is not a cause, he is not a celebrity. You know, he knows a lot of people,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:36.480
[Amit Varma]: how does he get ahead? And he forges these three kinds of critical alliances. You know,

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:43.200
[Amit Varma]: one, of course, with the Irish, where, you know, he adopts Irish home rule as, you know, one of his

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:49.520
[Amit Varma]: pet causes. And you point out how, in fact, by the time the election comes around, he's asking

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:56.160
[Amit Varma]: for electors' votes, quote, on behalf of the 5 millions in Ireland, and the 250 millions of India,

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.520
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And the other two sort of constituencies who he woos are, one is, of course,

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:06.880
[Amit Varma]: the communists. And, you know, he gets more and more drawn to the communists. And of course,

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:13.200
[Amit Varma]: and that obviously means a vote base of workers, and so on. And the third, interestingly, is women,

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.800
[Amit Varma]: and women can't even vote at that time, right. But he figures that getting the women on his side

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:25.760
[Amit Varma]: will have other knock on benefits, which indeed it does. So tell me a little bit about the sense

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.720
[Amit Varma]: that we get, like, you know, there's another quote that kind of fascinated me is where he

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.120
[Amit Varma]: gives a speech at Holborn, which you could quote from, where he says, during the first campaign,

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:39.840
[Amit Varma]: which he loses, where he says, quote, I have lived in this country actually for 20 years.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.840
[Amit Varma]: And I say that if there is one thing more certain than another that I have learned,

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:48.800
[Amit Varma]: it is that the English nation is incompatible with tyranny, stop quote. And of course,

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:55.760
[Amit Varma]: he knows this is bullshit. I mean, you know, so yeah, but he says it because hey, it's a means to

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.640
[Amit Varma]: an end. Now, my other deeper question, one is, I want to know a little bit more about your insights

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:06.000
[Amit Varma]: about how he's thinking at this time and how he's doing these alliances. But the other sort of meta

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.840
[Amit Varma]: question I have is that one of the things that has always struck me about politics is that politics

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.320
[Amit Varma]: corrodes character, in the sense that you might begin out with a certain set of principles,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.000
[Amit Varma]: but then you compromise so much, so much, so much, so much that you yourself change as a result of

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.200
[Amit Varma]: that. And those principles which you might have felt so deeply about don't matter anymore. Now,

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.400
[Amit Varma]: it's very clear from this biography that that didn't happen to Nauroji, that he was passionate

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:40.480
[Amit Varma]: about the cause right till the end. In fact, when he loses his last election at the start of the

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.920
[Amit Varma]: century, it's almost pitiful his reaction to it because he cares so deeply about getting in there

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.800
[Amit Varma]: and making change. So it doesn't really happen to him. But at the same time, it's like this is a

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:58.080
[Amit Varma]: point where his public persona and his private persona seem so different, you know. So what's

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:04.160
[Amit Varma]: kind of going on? And what is your sense of how can a person, you know, how is he remaining himself

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:09.200
[Amit Varma]: through this period? It all seems so calculated. How can it not affect you? Like one of the things

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:15.040
[Amit Varma]: that you do point out, and that does seem to be a genuine shift is his drift towards communism,

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.920
[Amit Varma]: where in fact, in 1902, he attends a second international like you point out, and he becomes

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.640
[Amit Varma]: more and more communist in his rhetoric as the years go by. And that seems to be a, you know,

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:30.400
[Amit Varma]: a genuine shift, whereas he would not have held those views earlier necessarily. But, you know,

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.600
[Amit Varma]: what is that whole kind of process like? Because the part that I'm sort of, I mean, I know the

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:40.800
[Amit Varma]: question is a bit long winded, but what I'm fascinated by is not just the events that he's

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.600
[Amit Varma]: so cannily putting together these alliances and saying whatever he needs to and dressing

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.760
[Amit Varma]: differently for different occasions, as you also point out. But you know, what must be the turmoil

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.640
[Amit Varma]: in his mind as he goes through all of these processes? Give me your sense of that.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.480
[Guest]: So I'll just mention at just at the outset, so he was definitely much more attracted to,

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:07.760
[Guest]: he was definitely attracted to socialism, communism, not really, since communism as an

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.880
[Guest]: idea was still evolving. And, you know, the ideas of Marx had not really trickled into,

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.640
[Guest]: at least the Indian stream of politics as yet. So I mean, I think it's correct to say that he

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.040
[Guest]: drifted towards socialism rather than towards communism. But you're right. I mean, you know,

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.960
[Guest]: towards the end of his life, he was, you know, associating with these individuals who eventually

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.080
[Guest]: will play a role in kind of leading the groundwork for kind of a global, you know,

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.480
[Guest]: the growth of communism globally. Now, with regard to your question about, you know,

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.960
[Guest]: what's motivating him at this point in time? You know, I think the really abiding passion of his

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:50.800
[Guest]: life was this belief that so many people in India were being affected by poverty. Every year,

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.800
[Guest]: you know, if it was a famine year, millions of people would lose their lives. And so he felt

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.800
[Guest]: kind of a heartfelt commitment to do all that he could to try to change the situation. He knew that,

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.360
[Guest]: you know, everything he did could potentially save, you know, people from this terrible fate.

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:12.240
[Guest]: And, you know, his ultimate goal was to reach a point whereby the drain of wealth would be

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.880
[Guest]: stopped and, you know, Indian impoverishment, the cycle of Indian impoverishment would be

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.240
[Guest]: reversed. So I think that was kind of the burning fire in him. And that was the reason why he stayed

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:29.040
[Guest]: so true to his core convictions. If you look at all of his close political comrades, they were all

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.000
[Guest]: people who had this similar kind of inner fire and made sure that politics did not corrode that

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.320
[Guest]: sense of, you know, pure principle. I mean, one of his good friends was Henry Hinman, who was the

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:46.240
[Guest]: founder of the first British Socialist Party. And like Naoroji, Hinman grows more radical as he grows

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:54.640
[Guest]: older. He grows far more radical than Naoroji, of course, in his socialist views. Another friend of

01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:00.800
[Guest]: his was Michael Davitt, who was an Irish home ruler who had gone to jail because of his activities and

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.560
[Guest]: political views. He was someone who was committed towards pacifism. You know, he ultimately was not

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.640
[Guest]: there for the political glory or, you know, money. He was there for principle, you know, fighting on

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:19.120
[Guest]: behalf of his fellow Irishmen and Irishwomen. And so these people, you know, were ideologically

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.720
[Guest]: motivated to such a degree to achieve some concrete end that I think they kind of, you know,

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.000
[Guest]: immunize themselves from the corroding influences of politics. You can argue that Naoroji was not a

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.560
[Guest]: very good politician in this sense. He did not compromise in many ways. He, as far as I can tell,

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.000
[Guest]: was not corrupt. You know, he pursued a very honest and deliberate line in all his activities

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.840
[Guest]: and that nearly cost him the election in 1892, which he won by five votes. But he very nearly

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.000
[Guest]: lost it because he refused to give in to certain tactics that might have, you know, led to some

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.480
[Guest]: sort of compromise that might have been politically remunerative, but ultimately would compromise

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.160
[Guest]: his core beliefs and his principles. So in that sense, yeah, I mean, he wasn't necessarily a very

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.400
[Guest]: good politician. But, you know, I think it's important to keep in mind that, you know, there

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:16.960
[Guest]: were these people in this era, just as they are today, of course, who are so committed to, you

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:23.040
[Guest]: know, doing good and achieving some concrete good that, you know, would have real consequences for

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.080
[Amit Varma]: lives on the ground that kept them running. There are people like that in this era, you said?

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:35.200
[Guest]: Perhaps a few. I know it's, you know, we live in such a cynical era, but I think there still

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.320
[Amit Varma]: are a few people out there. Okay, I won't ask you for names in this particular

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.840
[Amit Varma]: talking about Nauraj, you know, and also when you talk about his

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.920
[Amit Varma]: obduracy, I'm struck by what happens during the second election, which he finally wins,

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.440
[Amit Varma]: I think 2953 to 2948 or something like that by five votes, as you said. And what's interesting

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.360
[Amit Varma]: there is that he gets the candidateship of the Liberal Party. And then there is this internal

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.200
[Amit Varma]: rebellion and another Liberal candidate says, no, I'm the candidate. And there is for a couple of

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:14.400
[Amit Varma]: years, tremendous pressure on him to back out of the race. But he is so bullheaded that he just

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.240
[Amit Varma]: won't do it. And he hangs in there, and he somehow gets through and he faces a bunch of racism at

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.520
[Amit Varma]: this time as well. And one of the reasons that you pointed out might have helped him win is that Lord

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Salisbury referred to him as a black man. And this led to an outpouring of number one, sympathy across

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.000
[Amit Varma]: England, because you know, they could see that this is clearly a bit too racist, and the racism

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:46.240
[Amit Varma]: of it must have seemed starker, because he was essentially like a British liberal, well spoken,

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:52.320
[Amit Varma]: sophisticated, all of that. And besides outrage, it also leads to a little bit of fact checking

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.520
[Amit Varma]: when people point out that actually Lord Salisbury, who is quite swarthy, is actually darker than him.

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:05.040
[Amit Varma]: And this whole process was kind of fascinating. Tell me about what happens when he finally wins.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.760
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the things that strikes me is that number one, when he's standing, it's not as if

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.200
[Amit Varma]: he is standing as an individual. It's like he's standing for all of India. Across India, the

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.360
[Amit Varma]: people are raising money for him and sending it to him. And it's saying he's India's guy,

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.080
[Amit Varma]: you know. So it's almost as if this whole nation is at his back. And then when he finally wins,

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.720
[Amit Varma]: you point out how when he comes to India, I think he goes to the Lahore Congress. And over there,

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.720
[Amit Varma]: across the way, he does this railway trip, which is, you know, presages Gandhi's trip on the

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:42.080
[Amit Varma]: railways and getting mobbed decades later, where you have these massive mobs everywhere coming to

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.680
[Amit Varma]: see him. He, you know, he lands up at Lahore, and there are tens of thousands of people at the

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:53.920
[Amit Varma]: railway station or whatever. And it's just mad. So on the one hand, he is a big hope of India. He

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.240
[Amit Varma]: is their guy out there. It's almost like he's been elected President of India when he gets that seat

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.760
[Amit Varma]: as an MP. And yet within the British Parliament, he has a really tough time. Tell me a bit about

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:12.320
[Guest]: those years. So two things struck me at least about Naoroji's election. You know, his campaign,

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.080
[Guest]: rather, I should say. The first thing was that his campaign took such a long time. I mean,

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:24.800
[Guest]: he's nominated, as you say, and eventually there's a challenge that takes place. He's nominated in

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.560
[Guest]: the year 1888, and the election doesn't take place until June of 1892. So you have basically

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.320
[Guest]: a four-year-long campaign. And campaigns for Parliament in this era were in the span of days

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:42.560
[Guest]: and weeks normally. And yet here's someone, you know, going in every day for the large part of

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.440
[Guest]: four years and fighting internal rebellions that were, as you said, largely based on the question

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:53.360
[Guest]: of race. There are two people who challenge him. And at least as far as I could tell from my

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.800
[Guest]: research, those challenges are to a very large degree based on the fact that here was, you know,

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.080
[Guest]: a foreigner, someone who looked different, someone who had a name that we can't pronounce,

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.680
[Guest]: trying to represent us. And the irony of this was that he was standing in an area called Central

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:14.000
[Guest]: Finsbury, which was then, and is still today, a very radical area. I mean, this is an area that

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.240
[Guest]: still has, I think, a Lenin library. There was a statue of Lenin until recently over there. So it

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.120
[Guest]: had this very long kind of radical political streak, and yet he's facing this terrible racism

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.800
[Guest]: throughout his campaign. And it's so terrible that, you know, he nearly has to, you know,

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:36.640
[Guest]: you know, he's encouraged to quit by many people, including many of his friends, to quit. And as

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.840
[Guest]: you mentioned, you know, the prime minister at this point in time, Lord Salisbury, does kind of

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:45.840
[Guest]: an indirect favor to him by calling him a Black man, which sets up a huge debate about racism in

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:51.680
[Guest]: Great Britain. Was it acceptable to call, you know, an Indian a Black? What did that mean? And

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.360
[Guest]: of course, there was this whole side debate, as you said, about who actually was darker. And,

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.040
[Guest]: you know, that kind of reveals, I guess, a bit more about what racism was like in the Victorian

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.840
[Guest]: era than, you know, what, you know, we'd like to think of it. So, you know, he becomes kind of a

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.120
[Guest]: popular figure in this era, but that still doesn't help him. You know, he still faces challenges

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:15.200
[Guest]: after that moment to his campaign. And as you mentioned, he wins by only five votes. He becomes

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.120
[Guest]: dubbed the other by narrow majority. And that leads me to the second kind of really interesting

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.720
[Guest]: thing for me, at least about this election. If you look at the total electoral figures,

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:30.400
[Guest]: about 5,000 people are voting. This sounds kind of like, you know, a small college election,

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.720
[Guest]: right? I mean, this is not what you think of as, you know, the exercise of democratic power in,

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:43.680
[Guest]: you know, the beacon of democracy in this era. And that also shows you just how stunted democracy was

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.920
[Guest]: in the supposedly democratic parts of the world in this moment. I mean, the franchise, the power

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:57.600
[Guest]: to vote was only extended to those men in Great Britain who owned property and who, you know,

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:02.880
[Guest]: could meet a certain, you know, threshold for earnings. And oftentimes the people who voted

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.640
[Guest]: didn't even live in the particular district they were voting for. So, you know, you could be

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.880
[Guest]: someone who lived, you know, in a completely different part of London, but because you

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.680
[Guest]: owned property or you owned a store in central Finsbury, you had the right to vote. So it was

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:21.600
[Guest]: a very weird and wacky system. And, you know, I learned far too much about Victorian politics and

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:28.080
[Guest]: kind of the intricacies of how it worked in this era than I ever would have wanted to. But, you

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:33.840
[Guest]: know, the long and short of it is, yes, at the end of it, Naoroji is elected. He's elected narrowly,

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.920
[Guest]: but he's nevertheless elected. There's a brief recount effort that's put in place where, you

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.680
[Guest]: know, the Conservative candidate tries to disqualify Naoroji by saying that several of the

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.080
[Guest]: people who voted for him were immigrants, they were Italians or they were French, and how dare

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.120
[Guest]: they had the right to vote. But citizenship laws in this era were so vague that, again, even someone

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.000
[Guest]: like Naoroji had the right to vote in elections almost from the moment that he stepped on show

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.160
[Guest]: in Great Britain, because there was no kind of like law of citizenship at this point in time.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.960
[Guest]: If you were there on the ground and you met your minimum qualifications for income and such,

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.240
[Guest]: you had the right to vote. So getting to the second part of your question about how Naoroji

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.680
[Guest]: is kind of conceptualized, yes, he is conceptualized as being the MP for India, the member for India.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:24.480
[Guest]: And it creates, you know, a moment of jubilation across the country. He is flooded with telegrams

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.120
[Guest]: and letters from not just around the world, but all corners of India. I mean, when I was looking

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:36.240
[Guest]: through Naoroji's papers, I found letters from Kashmir. I found letters from parts of, you know,

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:43.600
[Guest]: Mysore province, you know, Chikmagalur, the place where coffee is grown, from village India,

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:49.840
[Guest]: from urban India, from Indians living in Shanghai or Zanzibar or, you know, other parts of the

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:56.160
[Guest]: diaspora, South Africa. So this really excites not just Indians in India, but Indians all across

01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:03.040
[Guest]: the world. And all Indians, whether they are, you know, an individual living in Chikmagalur or

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:10.160
[Guest]: an elite in Bombay or, you know, an indentured worker in South Africa recognize Naoroji as being

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.560
[Guest]: their representative. Finally, they have a voice, right? I mean, finally, there is an Indian

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:21.120
[Guest]: in power who claims to speak for Indians. And consequently, for the next two to three years,

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.680
[Guest]: when Naoroji is in parliament, he becomes these people's representatives. So he's dealing with

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.440
[Guest]: everything from matters of high policy, you know, the civil service and the question of who is being

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:38.080
[Guest]: appointed to what in the government of India, to the complaints of Indians living in the diaspora

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.840
[Guest]: in Madagascar. I mean, up until this point in time, I didn't even know that there were many

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.720
[Guest]: Indians in Madagascar, but I found a Gujarati letter from Indians in Madagascar complaining

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.880
[Guest]: about their treatment. So, you know, it's fascinating. And you find letters, again,

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:56.560
[Guest]: from Indians living in Guyana who are, you know, talking about their grievances and how Naoroji

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.600
[Guest]: will hopefully be able to help them. So it's a moment of kind of unificatory patriotism,

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:07.840
[Guest]: not just across India, but across the Indian diaspora at large. And it creates this huge

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:13.520
[Guest]: moment of hope. And I think for Naoroji, it really feeds into this idea of, you know, that he's held

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:19.120
[Guest]: so close to his heart throughout his life, British justice. You know, he's tried this hard, he's

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:25.680
[Guest]: walked this hard, he's walked against the odds. And finally, after four terrible years of campaigning,

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:32.720
[Guest]: he overcame, he succeeded. And now he would have a chance to make his point. Maybe there was a,

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:38.000
[Guest]: you know, a glimmer of hope in this idea of British justice. And ultimately, it all comes

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.920
[Guest]: crashing down. He loses election in 1895. And it's a moment of deep and dismal disappointment.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.000
[Guest]: It's probably the lowest moment in his political career. And we can go on and talk about that,

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:54.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, later on. Yeah, no, before we get to that, I mean, a couple of strands, which I was

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.720
[Amit Varma]: kind of fascinated by that, you know, what you're pointing out about India, you know, him being

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:05.280
[Amit Varma]: treated as, you know, India's MP in Parliament, as India's man out there, is actually something

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.680
[Amit Varma]: as you, you know, describe in your book, something that's been happening over the couple of decades

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:16.800
[Amit Varma]: before this also, in the sense that he becomes this sort of figurehead of the Indian community

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.520
[Amit Varma]: in London. So whenever parents are sending kids to study there, they'll send him a letter,

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.160
[Amit Varma]: and they'll say, please make sure he doesn't marry a British girl. And, you know, even Gandhi

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:32.800
[Amit Varma]: apparently is armed with a letter for Naoroji or, you know, your person X and person Y there with

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.120
[Amit Varma]: the letter for Naoroji saying, listen, I don't know him, but it doesn't matter. He's Indian.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And he'll, you know, so he is the dude there who's already this massive community figurehead.

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.840
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that struck me is how late in his life all of this is happening. You know,

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:56.160
[Amit Varma]: he's 67 at the time he wins that election, you know, he's born in 1825, this is 1892, he's 67,

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.880
[Amit Varma]: he's 70 at the time it's done, and he's not even nearly done, like his iconic Congress speech of

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:06.480
[Amit Varma]: 1906 is when he's 81 years old. And we'll kind of come to that later, which is pretty mind blowing.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And just reading about his years in Parliament in your book was so impressive, because one,

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.640
[Amit Varma]: you've described his schedule before that, where this is not the age of email. So he's like getting

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:24.320
[Amit Varma]: up every day, he's devoting hours to writing letters by hand. He's meeting people constantly,

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.600
[Amit Varma]: not just when he's in Parliament, but, you know, for years and years before that, he's giving

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.560
[Amit Varma]: speeches, he's doing all of this. And in Parliament, you point out about how he finally gets

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.280
[Amit Varma]: a victory that is not a victory, he gets a bill passed, which will allow Indians into the civil

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.720
[Amit Varma]: service. But the cabinet, which is from his own party, the Liberal Party, then blocks it and

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:50.160
[Amit Varma]: doesn't do anything with it. Tell me a bit about that sort of process and how it affected him,

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:56.960
[Amit Varma]: because this is where that other transition happens in his life, where he shifts from being

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.720
[Amit Varma]: a politician to an agitator. And this failure kind of radicalizes him. Tell me a little bit

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.080
[Guest]: about what this process was like. Going to the first part of your question, at least,

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:14.480
[Guest]: with regard to the Indian diaspora in Great Britain and what he was like to these students.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.640
[Guest]: You know, if I were to have written a standalone book on this process, you could almost, you could

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:23.280
[Guest]: probably title it Indian Uncle. You know, he served as kind of the uncle for all of these

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:31.120
[Guest]: people who came to Great Britain to study, to work, sightseeing, you know, everyone and anyone

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.560
[Guest]: who is coming to Great Britain from India is asking him for help. And this was one of the

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.280
[Guest]: fun things that I was able to do when I was in the archives, you know, since Naoroji kept

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.880
[Guest]: everything. He was a pack rat. He was very pious in that sense. He kept everything. And I can

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.400
[Guest]: sympathize being a pious thief. You read the letters that were written to him and they cover

01:49:52.400 --> 01:50:00.320
[Guest]: everything. So family disputes, you know, my son has sailed to London. He has not paid us

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:06.400
[Guest]: remittances. What's going on? My husband has left us. He is somewhere in London. Can you help me?

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:11.760
[Guest]: All the way down to the most mundane of things. Can you get me tickets to go see a session of

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.040
[Guest]: Parliament? Can you arrange for me to meet the Queen? I mean, completely absurd things like that.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.560
[Guest]: You know, so everyone is asking him these questions. And most of the letters that I saw,

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.400
[Guest]: there would be a small little note on top of them indicating the date he replied. So the

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.040
[Guest]: incredible thing was, regardless of how absurd the question was, he still had the time. He still

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.760
[Guest]: made the time to reply. It could have been a one line note saying, sorry, I can't help you meet

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.960
[Guest]: the Queen. But in many cases, it was a detailed response saying, you know, I'm trying to get in

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.360
[Guest]: touch with your long lost son and encouraging him to write to you. Or I'm trying to find your

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:51.920
[Guest]: husband or, you know, your brother or your son passed away. I'm making arrangements for, you

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:59.440
[Guest]: know, the funeral and, you know, money to be sent back home. So he was really involved in the nitty

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:06.560
[Guest]: gritty of the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of Indians during his time in Great Britain. I

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.360
[Guest]: mean, he really evolves as kind of this father figure or uncle, if you will, for the Indian

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.320
[Guest]: community. And so as a consequence, you get a snapshot of what Indian life was like, all the

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:22.960
[Guest]: troubles that people faced, their complaints about the weather, the food, British people and,

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:27.040
[Guest]: you know, whether they were friendly or not friendly, and also the good things that they

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.720
[Guest]: felt they experienced in British society, their friends, the fact that Britain was, you know,

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:38.880
[Guest]: much more educated society that, you know, socially, it was much more liberal. So, you know,

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.720
[Guest]: in that sense, Nehruji is important to us for understanding socially how the diaspora develops

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.400
[Guest]: in a place like Great Britain. Now, with regard to his time in Parliament, and, you know, kind of

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:56.240
[Guest]: the effect that it has on him. So as I said, yes, he begins in this moment of rosy optimism. And if

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.120
[Guest]: you read the speeches he gives in Parliament during his first few years, they are very

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.680
[Guest]: congratulatory towards British rule. You know, he says great things about what British rule has done.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:12.720
[Guest]: It's this force of progressivism. He's a loyal member of the Empire. And a very strong and

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:19.920
[Guest]: distinct break takes place after he realizes that, you know, the goal of his time in Parliament,

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:25.200
[Guest]: getting civil service reform would ultimately be thwarted. So as you said, you know, he succeeded

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.240
[Guest]: in getting a non-binding resolution for civil service reform passed in Parliament. And he did

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.600
[Guest]: this against great odds. He did this at a time when most parliamentarians were at home asleep,

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:39.520
[Guest]: very late at night. There were only a few stragglers left in the House, but just enough,

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:43.680
[Guest]: he made sure that there were just enough so that you would have a quorum and a vote could take

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.880
[Guest]: place. And this was significant because it left Gladstone, the Prime Minister at the time,

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:54.480
[Guest]: completely red-faced. His government was against it. It was the first defeat the government had

01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.920
[Guest]: faced, and it was a defeat by a fellow Liberal MP. So it's extremely embarrassing. But, you know,

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:08.320
[Guest]: this was all part of Naroji's strategy. And when he goes back to India for the first time after

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:13.600
[Guest]: being elected to Parliament, it's kind of like a victory lap. And he promises that now, you know,

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:19.760
[Guest]: having passed this non-binding resolution, the British people and the Parliament would be

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.960
[Guest]: honour-bound to, you know, commit themselves to this reform. And ultimately, that's not what

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.920
[Guest]: happened. And when he realizes that this would not happen instantaneously, you see a tone,

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:36.480
[Guest]: a change of tone. So he starts talking about the evils of British rule again. He starts comparing

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:42.960
[Guest]: the fate of Indians to those of slaves in America. He says that Indians were actually probably worse

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:47.360
[Guest]: off than slaves in America, because at least in America, there had been an incentive to keep

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.840
[Guest]: those slaves alive. In India, there was no incentive, you know, and therefore millions

01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:56.800
[Guest]: of people died. So again, he becomes very bitter and very radical towards the end of his career.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.120
[Guest]: And worse than that, he realizes that not many people are listening. So ultimately,

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:04.640
[Guest]: he would have thought that once you got to the stage of being an MP in Parliament,

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.560
[Guest]: people would listen to you. But you had magazines like Punch making fun of Naroji, saying that he's,

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:14.560
[Guest]: you know, giving this long speech and no one is listening and people are just making fun of him.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.160
[Guest]: So it's a moment of great despondency. And as you said, you know, he's 70 years old at this

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:25.840
[Guest]: point in time, he could have thrown in the towel, retired back to India, given up and, you know,

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:31.520
[Guest]: been a very bitter man but given up and he doubles down, if you will, he decides to become

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:38.560
[Guest]: more radical. He decides to amplify his schedule. So he spends even more hours writing speeches or

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:44.480
[Guest]: responding to people's letters, kind of haranguing colleagues to become more radical. And that

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.520
[Guest]: sets up the last moment of his political career where he kind of embarks on this much more radical

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:55.920
[Amit Varma]: phase of politics. Yeah, and that was almost kind of poignant that, and I guess it's a combination

01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.960
[Amit Varma]: of the two, but I was trying to figure out, was this radicalization because of the contingency

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:06.480
[Amit Varma]: of his failure that he was just so frustrated that he lashed out and whatever or was he perhaps

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:11.120
[Amit Varma]: expressing the radicalism he felt all along, because it was now no point in putting a veneer

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.960
[Amit Varma]: on it that wasn't helping? Or was it that simply at this point in his intellectual journey,

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.600
[Amit Varma]: he realized that these kind of moderate methods, petitioning and blah, blah, blah,

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.960
[Amit Varma]: are not going to work and therefore you have to try something else. But I also found this poignant

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:32.000
[Amit Varma]: because of course, he misses the 1900 elections because he's ill. And of course, he's, you know,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.560
[Amit Varma]: 75 at the time, but then he stands in the next elections, loses badly. And then it's so sad

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:44.640
[Amit Varma]: because he writes to his Irish friends and almost begs him for a safe seat there. And, you know,

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.360
[Amit Varma]: and he's turned down because there are internal squabbles happening there. And it's like he

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:55.120
[Amit Varma]: realizes that this is my last chance, I have to get into parliament and do this, get this

01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:01.760
[Amit Varma]: resolution passed. And eventually, that's kind of not happening. And the really interesting thing is

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:07.920
[Amit Varma]: you think at this point, he's done and dusted. But 1906, when he's 81 years old, is still almost a

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:12.320
[Amit Varma]: seminal moment for the Congress Party, because the extremists are fighting with the moderates.

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And as a way of stopping Tilak, like you point out, you know, Tilak is being intransigent and

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:20.880
[Amit Varma]: wants to be president of the Congress. And as a way of stopping that, they call in Naoroji. And

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.880
[Amit Varma]: even though the moderates think he's too extremist, and the extremists think he's too moderate, like

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:31.520
[Amit Varma]: you say, he's in, they all agree to him and he goes out there and he gives a speech, which he

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.880
[Amit Varma]: makes his compadre Gokhale readout, which is also an interesting tactic. Tell me a little bit about

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.240
[Amit Varma]: that. And why is it so seminal? Why is it such a remarkable moment in Indian politics, what

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:51.520
[Guest]: Naoroji now says? So going back as to why Naoroji radicalized at this moment, I mean, I think it's a

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:56.080
[Guest]: little bit of the various reasons that you mentioned, you know, so at one point, he realized

01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.720
[Guest]: that now that he wasn't in the in parliament, and he wasn't immediately standing for parliament,

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.360
[Guest]: he could afford to be more radical. You know, he first talks about self-government for India

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:12.160
[Guest]: publicly in the year 1884. And then in the year 1885, all references to self-government disappear.

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.720
[Guest]: And that's because this is, you know, when he starts to talk about standing for parliament,

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.720
[Guest]: and if you want to stand for parliament in Great Britain, talking about getting self-government

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.800
[Guest]: from Britain is probably not your most effective strategy. So he stops talking about it. And it's

01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:32.000
[Amit Varma]: only... And also, no one's taken screenshots on Twitter. So it's okay. Exactly. Yeah, this is a

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.440
[Guest]: much easier moment, I guess, for, you know, people's former statements to, you know, kind of

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.800
[Guest]: pass by and not be commented upon. So he doesn't talk about self-government, even though it's there

01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.720
[Guest]: in the back of his mind. And if you look at his private correspondence, he's still talking about

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:53.360
[Guest]: it with people like Alan Octavian Hume. And after 1895, well, the gloves are off, right? I mean,

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.600
[Guest]: you can start to talk about more radical views. And so he starts to talk again about kind of the

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:04.240
[Guest]: evil nature of British rule, a foreign government being, you know, terrible for India. He starts to

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.480
[Guest]: talk about the possibility of a second mutiny, because people were just so sick and tired

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:13.120
[Guest]: of, you know, the terrible effects of imperial rule. And ultimately, he starts talking again

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.040
[Guest]: about self-government. And he makes this public, even though he's standing for parliament at the

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:23.760
[Guest]: same time. So now, you know, he just doesn't care that that contradiction might be there.

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.000
[Guest]: And I think one reason for why he's able to let this slide is because he realizes,

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.960
[Guest]: you know, the fact of mortality staring at him in the face. As you said, he's, you know,

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:40.960
[Guest]: in his 70s when he, you know, when he loses his re-election bid in parliament and in his early

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:46.240
[Guest]: 70s when he's kind of radicalizing. And he realizes that these are his last chances to

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.440
[Guest]: kind of make effective change. He struggled all these decades on behalf of ameliorating

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:56.400
[Guest]: the condition of India. And during this period of time, again, it's, you know,

01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:01.040
[Guest]: the terrible things happening in India. The government in power is more reactionary and

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:05.760
[Guest]: conservative. There's the plague epidemic in Western India, coupled with a famine.

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.760
[Guest]: So the news coming out of India is awful, absolutely terrible. And if you read letters

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:16.800
[Guest]: written by people like Gokhale or Beramji Malbari, you know, they're heartbreaking.

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:21.280
[Guest]: You know, when I read them in the archives some 120 years after they were written,

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:27.120
[Guest]: you're really struck by just how awful things were. You know, people's relatives dying from

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:34.000
[Guest]: plague, famine camps being set up all around the country, people leaving Bombay in masks to escape

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:38.480
[Guest]: the plague, and this very kind of draconian effort on part of the British government to

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:43.600
[Guest]: kind of crack down on health and sanitation in order to, you know, alleviate the plague.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.440
[Guest]: It was an awful moment. And so I think Naoroji felt all this more keenly,

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:53.440
[Guest]: because everything that he had struggled for seemed to be at stake. So, you know,

01:59:53.440 --> 02:00:00.000
[Guest]: a part of it was trying to stand for parliament again, making a last ditch effort to be elected.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.000
[Guest]: And as you mentioned, in 1900, he can't stand for parliament because he's too sick. His doctor

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.240
[Guest]: actually tells him if you stand for parliament, there's a good chance you will die because,

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:17.600
[Guest]: you know, your respiratory problems that you're having could lead to, you know,

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.080
[Guest]: influenza and could lead to other diseases that, you know, could cause you to die. I mean,

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:28.240
[Guest]: you're 75 years old at this point in time. He tries again in 1905, 1906, when he's 80 years old,

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:34.320
[Guest]: and people around him are asking him, good God, what are you doing? Why are you, a man of 80,

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:42.560
[Guest]: trying to get into parliament? And, you know, he still has that fitness of, you know, of being

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:48.960
[Guest]: to give multiple speeches a day, to address multiple crowds, to write letters. Maybe it's

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:55.120
[Guest]: his diet of raw eggs. I don't know. I mean, maybe that keeps him ticking. Who knows? But, you know,

02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:01.040
[Guest]: he still has the energy of someone who is 20 years younger. And that kind of propels him in this more

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:05.920
[Guest]: radical direction. He knows that time is not on his side, yet he still has the energy, he still

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.880
[Guest]: has the drive, and he still knows that whatever he's doing, you know, has a chance to help save

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.760
[Guest]: people in his country from even worse poverty and famine and, you know, the plague epidemic.

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:23.440
[Guest]: So there's still that drive. And ultimately, you know, all of that collapses after his

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:29.360
[Guest]: Congress speech in 1906. His health gives way. And, you know, all of a sudden, this man of 81

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.560
[Guest]: years of age, who had been acting like a man of 50 or something, now is in his 80s. I mean,

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.840
[Guest]: he just cannot go any longer. But it sustains him long enough to do what he needs to do,

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:46.000
[Guest]: which is, again, give that speech to the Congress in 1906, where he really kind of helps tilt the

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.120
[Guest]: balance in favor of the extremists. You know, as you said, both the moderates and the extremists

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.000
[Guest]: kind of saw Naoroji as a compromise candidate. He kind of fell in between two stools in the sense

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.280
[Guest]: that he was too moderate for the extremists, but too radical for the moderates. And the moderates

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:07.920
[Guest]: really hope that he ultimately will help them preserve their basis of power in the Congress

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.440
[Guest]: through his leadership at the Congress. And the few eyewitness reports that we have of what people

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:19.040
[Guest]: like, say, Gokhale or Mehta or, you know, others like Surendranath Banerjee and such are thinking

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:25.200
[Guest]: after the Congress is a certain feeling of being crestfallen. They felt that Naoroji has really

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.720
[Guest]: passed on the baton to the extremists. And we know that Tilak, after the Congress speech

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.120
[Guest]: that Naoroji gives, has taken place. You know, again, he criticizes Naoroji's moderacy,

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.920
[Guest]: but he also says, look, you know, he has agreed with us, us being the extremists,

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.920
[Guest]: that Swaraj is the way to go for it. We can disagree with him about methods,

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.440
[Guest]: but he ultimately agrees with us for the end. So the means are different that we have,

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:56.480
[Guest]: but the ultimate end of Swaraj, and not necessarily Swaraj under British rule,

02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.520
[Guest]: Naoroji is on the same page with us. And even, you know, fierce critics like Dipenchandra Pal

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.560
[Guest]: ultimately realize this as well, that Naoroji has done us more good than bad through his Congress

02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.200
[Amit Varma]: speech of 1906. You know, the wording of the speech is fascinating in the sense that before

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:18.080
[Amit Varma]: this, as you point out, he's always, one, he uses the term Swaraj, which is Tilak's term and,

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, very deliberately. And the other thing that you point out is that before he has always

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.760
[Amit Varma]: spoken to self-rule in the sense of, you know, like the dominions like Australia or Canada or

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.080
[Amit Varma]: whatever, which are still part of the British Empire. But now he says like Australia or Canada

02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.520
[Amit Varma]: or the UK, which means, you know, completely independent. And he doesn't need to spell it out.

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Just saying like the UK, as you point out, is, you know, a big seminal moment. And, you know,

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:48.320
[Amit Varma]: you can imagine why, you know, you've spoken in your book about how Feroz Shah Mehta was so upset

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:55.360
[Amit Varma]: and crestfallen and all of that. And one can sort of totally imagine. And this shift happens and he

02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:00.960
[Amit Varma]: lives till 92. He dies in 1917. He shows traces of activity in that time, but he doesn't really,

02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:06.480
[Amit Varma]: he's not really too active after this. Gandhi comes to India and meets him, all of that happens.

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:11.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things which you mentioned you couldn't do much about during the book,

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:15.600
[Amit Varma]: because there isn't much written on it is, of course, his personal life. He got married at

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:20.000
[Amit Varma]: the age of 11 when his wife was seven, of course, which is the kind of classic child marriage thing

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.480
[Amit Varma]: that you have then. He had kids with her, many, many grandchildren, all of that. You know,

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:31.760
[Amit Varma]: you gave us a sense of his grief when his son Ardashir dies at the age of 35 and all of that.

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And one gets a sense of him as a father, even that moment when his daughter writes to him and

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:41.040
[Amit Varma]: says, please come to India for my wedding. And he writes back saying, no, no, the nation is

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: important. You want me to give this up? So, I got a kind of a sense of those conflicts,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.080
[Amit Varma]: but there's no mention of his wife anywhere. And obviously, as a biographer, you're looking for

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.440
[Amit Varma]: that. So, how do you sort of deal with that? Do you feel like there's something incomplete there?

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:59.280
[Guest]: Absolutely. That was the most frustrating aspect of my research. So, as you mentioned,

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:04.960
[Guest]: Naoroji was married when he was 11 and his wife was, I believe, seven. And they ultimately were

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:13.200
[Guest]: married for 70 years. And his wife apparently was not literate. She apparently had limited interest

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.640
[Guest]: in learning. At least this is what we know from R.P. Massani's biography that he wrote in 1939.

02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:24.640
[Guest]: Massani knew the Naoroji family, so he would have known family stories and such. There's no way for

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.680
[Guest]: me to verify this because there's just no material. So, when I looked through the Naoroji papers,

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:35.600
[Guest]: there was a collection of family correspondence, but there were no letters from Naoroji's wife. She

02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.920
[Guest]: didn't write or she wasn't able to write. And his wife only comes up every once in a while

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:44.640
[Guest]: in correspondence. I mean, this was extremely striking for me because, you know, here's a man

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:49.200
[Guest]: who talks a lot about feminism, right? I mean, he's consorting with some of the leading feminists

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:55.120
[Guest]: in the world, you know, throughout his political career. He's talked about female education and

02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:01.840
[Guest]: he's acted upon it and yet his own wife is such a distant and remote character for the biographer to

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:07.440
[Guest]: understand. I mean, you know, a friend of mine, a very good friend of mine found a picture of her

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.800
[Guest]: after having dug through a bunch of old and dusty newspapers in Baroda. And I was shocked to find

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:17.600
[Guest]: this picture because I'd never seen it before. I mean, there are just no descriptions of her

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:22.960
[Guest]: throughout his correspondence. So, you know, I would have loved to have written much more about

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:27.760
[Guest]: his family. But ultimately, you know, two things constricted me. One was, of course, word limit,

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:32.000
[Guest]: you know, there's only so much you could write about it. And the second was there just wasn't

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.080
[Guest]: that much material about his wife and many of his other children. We know a lot more about his

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:44.000
[Guest]: grandchildren. In fact, you know, still to this day, I get emails from people every once in a

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.920
[Guest]: while who said, you know, they knew his grandchildren or, you know, they were related

02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:51.840
[Guest]: to him. So I'm still kind of piecing together a few, you know, pictures of stories of his

02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:58.800
[Guest]: grandchildren. So what I can tell you definitely is that even though his marital relationship,

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:03.440
[Guest]: we don't know much about, and it doesn't seem like, you know, it was, you know, a marriage of

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:09.040
[Guest]: equals in many way. And, you know, on that ground, we can criticize Naroji for, you know, perhaps

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:12.480
[Guest]: not, you know, spending more time with his wife or not making more of an effort to kind of

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:18.960
[Guest]: integrate him into his, you know, his social world. But we do know that amongst his granddaughters,

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:24.560
[Guest]: he was extremely supportive of their ambitions, you know, with what they did. And, you know,

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:28.720
[Guest]: his granddaughters included people like the Captain Sisters, who are important players in

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:35.120
[Guest]: the nationalist movement under Gandhi. They were, you know, radical extremists who worked with

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:40.400
[Guest]: Madam Kama and even with Savarkar, and then ultimately gave this up in favor of Gandhi's

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:47.920
[Guest]: political following. My favorite character from his generation of grandchildren was a person

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:54.640
[Guest]: called Khurshid Ben Naroji, and I've written an essay separately on her. She was Naroji's

02:07:54.640 --> 02:08:02.960
[Guest]: youngest granddaughter through his son. So his son, as you mentioned, Adi, passed away in 1893.

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:10.400
[Guest]: And Khurshid Ben was born after the son passed away, so born posthumously.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:16.560
[Guest]: And she was trained as a classical singer. She was trained in French, and she goes and studies

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:22.080
[Guest]: in Paris, and eventually even spends a bit of time in Greece, where she meets a very important

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.560
[Guest]: figure involved in reviving the Delphic games in Greece in the early 20th century.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:35.680
[Guest]: And she comes back to India, and she gives all of this up in order to join Gandhi, and not just

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:40.480
[Guest]: join Gandhi in terms of, you know, temperance activities and walking in Sabarmati Ashram and

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:46.160
[Guest]: such. She does a completely amazing and courageous thing by deciding in the 1930s to go out to the

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:53.200
[Guest]: northwest frontier province and preach nonviolence to Dacoits. So she learns Pashto, and she goes

02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:58.240
[Guest]: around to camps of Dacoits. And imagine this, you know, petite, Anglicized, Parsi woman who was a

02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:03.280
[Guest]: classical singer living in Paris up until recently. Her house is on Napier and Sea Road in

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:08.560
[Guest]: Bombay, and now she's traipsing through Waziristan, talking to Dacoits and saying, please, you know,

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.120
[Guest]: stop kidnapping Hindus, you know, in order to restore Hindu-Muslim unity. Instead, why don't

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.360
[Guest]: you weave Khadar and, you know, learn about Gandhi. It's a completely ballsy thing that she's doing.

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:24.720
[Guest]: She, at several points in time, is probably nearly killed. I mean, she writes to Gandhi about

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:30.560
[Guest]: bullets whizzing by her in the desert. They're pretty remarkable letters. So, you know,

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.920
[Guest]: all of this is kind of, you know, comes from a political spirit that Naoroji helps inculcate

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:41.040
[Guest]: in his children and grandchildren. So, you know, his family legacy, even though it might not have

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.520
[Guest]: been very well reflected in his relationship with his wife, it's reflected in the political

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:51.600
[Amit Varma]: activities of his children and grandchildren. This is so fascinating. I can totally see this as a

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:58.480
[Amit Varma]: grand Bollywood film. So, you know, I've taken a lot of your time, two kind of final lines of

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:04.320
[Amit Varma]: inquiry. One is, you know, towards the end of his life, one, he himself becomes very embittered with

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.680
[Amit Varma]: his failure in Parliament or what he sees as his failure in Parliament and so on. And, you know,

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.480
[Amit Varma]: you point out how one of his constant enemies in London, Shyamji Krishnavarma, who I promise

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.880
[Amit Varma]: was no relative of mine, Shyamji Krishnavarma then sort of criticizes him and calls him a

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:25.680
[Amit Varma]: grand failure and says that he's achieved nothing through all these years. And, you know, when I

02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:31.040
[Amit Varma]: kind of, for me, this, you know, looking at that period of Indian history always seems to me really

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.720
[Amit Varma]: weird because everything seems coherent till the second decade of the 20th century. You have the

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:40.880
[Amit Varma]: moderates who are doing their petitioning, who are trying to work with government. You have the

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.360
[Amit Varma]: extremists on the other hand, who are gradually moving apart and all narratives are coherent.

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.600
[Amit Varma]: And then up comes this black swan event called Gandhi and he turns everything around. And it's

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.960
[Amit Varma]: like nothing that happened before that was even required or made any sense or whatever. So, on

02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:59.280
[Amit Varma]: the one hand, because, you know, that's also the decade when Gokhale dies, Feroz Shah Mehta dies,

02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, and of course, Naoroji dies, but he's already so old anyway, he's

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.760
[Amit Varma]: basically out of it. So, the moderates are out. But then again, it's a completely different stand,

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.400
[Amit Varma]: which is nothing, which is no continuity, which seems to have no continuity with what came before.

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:19.120
[Amit Varma]: So, one, looking back at his legacy and the fact that, yes, you know, on the surface of it,

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:24.720
[Amit Varma]: it seems like he didn't get much done. So, was he a failure? Did he have a legacy beyond that?

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.680
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps, is that legacy his failure in a sense? Because, you know, Gandhi at one point,

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:35.280
[Amit Varma]: you point out how Gandhi is telling one of his colleagues in South Africa around 1909 or 1910,

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, we must not give up because look at Dada bhai, he's been at it for 40 years.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.160
[Amit Varma]: And if you look at all of, for example, you know, one thing people don't realize when we think about

02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi, such a mythological figure is that all of Gandhi's Satyagrahas basically failed,

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:56.160
[Amit Varma]: including the ones in South Africa. But he just, you know, the last was sort of a half-hearted,

02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:02.400
[Amit Varma]: face-saving semi-success. But Gandhi essentially kept failing, kept failing, kept failing, but he

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:08.000
[Amit Varma]: kept at it and then at some point that turned. So, is that Naoroji's legacy or is there a legacy

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:15.200
[Amit Varma]: beyond the failure of it? How do we, you know, when we now look back at him, besides the mythology

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:22.160
[Amit Varma]: of Grand Old Man of India or the Indian uncle, as you point out, what do we see? Is it a frustratingly

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:27.120
[Amit Varma]: wasted life, you know, lived with the best intention, but going nowhere or, you know,

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.600
[Amit Varma]: is it easy to say that in hindsight and did he actually move the needle in ways that are not

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.360
[Guest]: so visible today? That's an excellent question because these are questions that I'm trying to

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:43.840
[Guest]: wrestle with in my next book. Oftentimes, both from our perspective and from the perspective

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:50.240
[Guest]: of someone in, say, the 1930s or the 1940s, you could look upon moderate nationalism,

02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.160
[Guest]: this kind of early phase of nationalism, as being a bit of a failure. What did they do,

02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:59.440
[Guest]: right? I mean, the Congress was this small party that was relatively elite and city-based.

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:04.320
[Guest]: What reforms were really, you know, wrested from the British government? And ultimately,

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.400
[Guest]: only when Gandhi comes to the scene do you really have a mass-based movement where there is

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:15.200
[Guest]: significant, you know, change on the ground. Now, the thing about this is that even people like

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:20.960
[Guest]: Gandhi realized how wrong that perspective was. Gandhi acknowledged himself. He did not come out

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.280
[Guest]: of any, you know, he didn't come out of nowhere, right? I mean, he came out of the particular

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:30.240
[Guest]: heritage that India had accumulated in terms of its nationalist history and its political trajectory.

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:37.920
[Guest]: And, you know, there's a passage in Hind Swaraj where Gandhi defends Naoroji by saying, you know,

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.440
[Guest]: we stand on the shoulders of our, you know, those who come before us, you know, that whole metaphor,

02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:47.200
[Guest]: right? You can see farther because of what people have done beforehand. And he says,

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.800
[Guest]: Naoroji was the person who really kind of laid the foundations. And I think that's what Naoroji's

02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:57.440
[Guest]: greatest legacy was. I mean, it was easy for people like Shyamji Krishnavarma to call him

02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:02.400
[Guest]: a failure because, you know, ultimately he did not achieve civil service reform, right? He did

02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:07.520
[Guest]: not stop the drain of wealth. I mean, India was poorer and more fab and written in the year 1900

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.720
[Guest]: than it had been when Naoroji started his political career in the 1860s. And Swaraj, of course,

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:17.840
[Guest]: was a very distant goal. So, you know, on those three particular goals, of course, Naoroji failed

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:26.240
[Guest]: in order to achieve those things. But ultimately he laid the organizational and the philosophical

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:32.160
[Guest]: and kind of political economic foundations upon which Indian nationalism eventually did achieve

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:38.320
[Guest]: success. I mean, when we think of any aspect of Indian nationalism, whether it was the organization

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.840
[Guest]: in terms of the Indian National Congress, whether it was the particular message about how poverty

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.080
[Guest]: was the kind of the central feature of why British rule was so bad for India, whether it was the

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.400
[Guest]: international aspects of Indian nationalism. I mean, this is something which I'm trying to

02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:59.760
[Guest]: talk more about in my next book, about how people like Naoroji did not make Indian nationalism just

02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.240
[Guest]: about India. It was about much more than just India. It was a much more global campaign for

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:11.360
[Guest]: emancipation. Any of these aspects had Naoroji at the very core. Naoroji was the people who laid

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:16.480
[Guest]: the groundwork for many of these aspects of Indian nationalism. He wasn't alone. I mean,

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:21.520
[Guest]: many other people were part and parcel of this process, but he was at the very center of all

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:28.480
[Guest]: these various networks. So it's really impossible to understand Indian nationalism without Naoroji.

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:37.040
[Guest]: Because if you were adopting Gandhi's or Tilak's methods in the 1860s through pretty much the 1880s

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.320
[Guest]: and 1890s, you would have been cut off. There was no way the British government would have

02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:48.880
[Guest]: countenanced your activities. And Gokhale himself recognized this in regards to Alan Octavian Hume.

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:56.000
[Guest]: When Hume dies in 1912, Gokhale delivers this eulogy for Hume saying, no one else could have

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.760
[Guest]: founded the Congress. It had to have been a British ex-official founding the Congress because

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:06.640
[Guest]: otherwise it would have been shut down. The government would have shut it down and dissolved

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:13.360
[Guest]: the Congress. And indeed, you know, the viceroys in power, Lansdowne and Dufferin, nearly did shut

02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:17.760
[Guest]: down the Congress. I mean, if you read their correspondence, they're this close to even,

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:23.120
[Guest]: you know, charging someone like Hume, a fellow British person, a fellow member of the civil

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.480
[Guest]: service with sedition and treason. So you can only imagine what, you know, they would have done to

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:34.480
[Guest]: Naoroji or Gokhale and what they did eventually do to Tilak by, you know, acting out on these

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.440
[Guest]: threats. I mean, there would have been no question of the, you know, the velvet glove being off and

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:44.720
[Guest]: the, you know, the metal fist of imperialism quashing and crushing these individuals.

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:50.160
[Guest]: So in that regard, it's impossible to really think of us, think of Naoroji as being a failure.

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.160
[Guest]: They did as much as they could do under the circumstances. In fact, they went beyond it

02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:00.160
[Guest]: in many ways. And, you know, they prepared the ground for a later generation when it was much

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:08.240
[Guest]: easier to kind of go against the grain of British imperialism. And finally, I'll, you know, I'll

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:13.360
[Amit Varma]: leave it to readers to read your book and to kind of discover Dadabhai Naoroji's fascinating life

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.600
[Amit Varma]: for themselves. But I'll shift back to the personal now. You know, biographers sometimes

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.640
[Amit Varma]: say that by the time they finish a biography, they feel bereaved when it's over. It's like a sense of

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:27.360
[Amit Varma]: loss because you get so attached to the person that you're writing about. Has it kind of been

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:32.640
[Amit Varma]: like that for you, especially as there'll be a lot of, I'm guessing, cultural echoes because,

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:38.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, you're also Parsi, you're in Bombay right now, you know, there would be sort of echoes

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:44.640
[Amit Varma]: of that also. So, you know, what was the relationship between you and Naoroji through

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:51.360
[Amit Varma]: this book? You know, how did it feel when it was over and in what ways did it sort of enrich

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:56.960
[Guest]: your thinking, as it were? I heard your conversation with Saman Subramaniam and I

02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:03.040
[Guest]: remember he mentioned that feeling towards Haldane. Curiously, I have not felt it. It's

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:08.240
[Guest]: odd. I mean, I remember when I did my undergraduate thesis, it wasn't even a biographical

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:14.240
[Guest]: project. It was on the construction of the city of Delhi. I felt a tremendous amount of just kind of

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:18.720
[Guest]: meaningless after it was turned in. It was almost like depression, you know, after you turned it in

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.400
[Guest]: and what do I do now? And I haven't had that feeling with Naoroji probably because he's not

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.480
[Guest]: done for me. You know, I have, I'm sitting on thousands of his letters that I eventually want

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:38.880
[Guest]: to publish. So, you know, there still is more work that I want to incorporate him into. And secondly,

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:45.200
[Guest]: the next book that I'm working on currently, you know, which has been thrown a little bit

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.320
[Guest]: asunder because of the whole pandemic, is on early Indian nationalism in general. And again,

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:55.680
[Guest]: kind of trying to show about why it was relevant, not just in its era, but in our era. I mean, why

02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:00.800
[Guest]: the, you know, the principles and ideas that they fought for and enunciated are as valid today as

02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:05.680
[Guest]: they were back then. And Naoroji, of course, has a big part to play in it. I'm looking at

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:11.040
[Guest]: other figures, I mean, like Lal Mohan Ghosh or Hume or eventually people like Ranade or

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.320
[Guest]: Feroz Shah Mehta, but Naoroji is always there. I mean, his correspondence figures

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.920
[Guest]: there, his ideas are important, and he's always hovering in the background. So,

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:28.560
[Guest]: strangely, I haven't felt that feeling of mourning as yet. You know, he'll be an important part of

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:33.600
[Guest]: my life, whether I like it or not, you know, for many years to come. I can't wait to read

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:38.080
[Amit Varma]: your next book, because that period of history also kind of fascinates me. You know, I went to

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:43.280
[Amit Varma]: college in Ferguson College, Pune, and it was only years after I had graduated and left that

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.600
[Amit Varma]: I realized what a rich history it has in terms of so many of the moderate leaders of that era,

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:52.080
[Amit Varma]: in fact, being there. And one of my favorite stories is, you know, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar,

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:57.360
[Amit Varma]: who sadly died too young. He was once teaching, I think, a biology class at Ferguson College.

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And he asked him the question that, if donkeys had a gourd, what would the gourd look like?

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:08.240
[Amit Varma]: And then, I don't know how I'll do this in a podcast, but he basically held both his hands

02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.760
[Amit Varma]: above his ears, you know, to imitate donkey ears. And that is such a fantastic thing. And you say

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.400
[Amit Varma]: that those leaders can have lessons for today. I don't think Agarkar could have gotten away with

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:24.640
[Amit Varma]: it today for all you know. But, Dinyar, it's just been so amazing talking to you. Thanks so much for

02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:28.480
[Guest]: your time and insights. Thank you very much, Amit. It's been a pleasure to be on this program.
