00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Many years ago, I was hanging out with a friend of mine in an industrial park.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
[Amit Varma]: His name is Narendra and he wasn't, at that time, the Prime Minister of India.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.320
[Amit Varma]: So we were just shooting the breeze, talking about girls and cars and all the books we'd

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.520
[Amit Varma]: read, I mean all the books I'd read because he isn't much of a reader, when suddenly it

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.720
[Amit Varma]: started raining.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.080
[Amit Varma]: I love the rain and this change in weather put me in a mellow mood.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.080
[Amit Varma]: Isn't this lovely?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.440
[Unknown]: I asked Narendra.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.480
[Unknown]: Yes, it's very romantic, he said as he reached out and touched my arm gently.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.200
[Unknown]: I could really do with some chai and pakoras right now.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.740
[Amit Varma]: I can organise the chai, I replied, but where will we get pakoras from over here?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.560
[Amit Varma]: No one here sells pakoras.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.400
[Amit Varma]: When he heard that, Narendra got very serious.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.760
[Unknown]: He thundered, No one here sells pakoras?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.680
[Unknown]: That is preposterous.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.280
[Unknown]: This must change.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.640
[Unknown]: I will change it.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.320
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.320
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Before we start today's episode, a note from our sponsors.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.920
[Amit Varma]: If you love art, but find the work of top Indian artists too expensive to buy and hang

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.600
[Amit Varma]: on your walls, here's a solution.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Hop on over to IndianColours.com.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colours is a company that licenses the work of top Indian artists and adapts

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.520
[Amit Varma]: it into objects of everyday use, including wearable art like stoles and kaftans, home

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.540
[Amit Varma]: decor like cushion covers and table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.760
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to get fine art into their homes at an accessible price, and artists

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.080
[Amit Varma]: get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.440
[Amit Varma]: The artists whose works you'll find include luminaries like Samir Mondal, Vasco X Vaxo,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Brinda Miller, Shruti Nelson, Harin Vakil, and the brilliant Dhruvi Acharya.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Do check it out at IndianColours.com, that's Colours with an OU, and use the code IVM20

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.720
[Amit Varma]: for a 20% discount.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Remember IVM20 at IndianColours.com, Colours with an OU.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.500
[Amit Varma]: And now, on with our regular programming.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.800
[Amit Varma]: My guests today are my good friends and regular guests on the show, Vivek Kaul and Shruti

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Rajgopalan.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
[Amit Varma]: Vivek and Shruti, welcome to the show.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Amit.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
[Unknown]: Hi, Amit.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Vivek is here with me in the studio, while Shruti is connected to us via Skype.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.600
[Amit Varma]: The topic for today is pakoda-nomics, I hope I pronounced that correctly.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Pakoda, not ra.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.320
[Amit Varma]: Pakoda, yeah, it's my Bengali nest egg.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.080
[Amit Varma]: You can even call it bonda-nomics, because bondas are more famous south of the wind.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But that's not the word Mr. Modi used.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So pakoda-nomics is inspired by a recent quote from our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Here's what he said, quote, if someone opens a pakora shop in front of your office, does

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.920
[Amit Varma]: that not count as employment?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.220
[Amit Varma]: The person's daily earning of rupees 200 will never come into books or accounts.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.920
[Amit Varma]: The truth is, massive people are being employed, end quote.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Now it's true that some massive people like me are indeed employed.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.320
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, I had a hard time trying to figure out just exactly what Mr.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Modi was trying to say here.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.920
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, what was he trying to say?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.480
[Guest 2]: So basically, you know, what I think he was trying to say is that we need to differentiate

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.160
[Guest 2]: between employment and jobs.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.120
[Guest 2]: It is not about creating jobs, as you know, we tend to argue over and over again, but

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.080
[Guest 2]: it is about creating employment.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.360
[Guest 2]: And I think that's a valid point.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.360
[Guest 2]: I mean, the second point that he was perhaps trying to make is that you shouldn't expect

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.040
[Guest 2]: the government to create jobs for around 1 million Indians who are entering the workforce

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.040
[Guest 2]: every month, and for around 8.4 crore Indians who need to move, be moved out of agriculture

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.880
[Guest 2]: so that agriculture becomes economically feasible.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.040
[Guest 2]: These were the two points that he made and his solution was that, you know, anyone who's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.720
[Guest 2]: sort of selling pakoras on the street, or anyone, you know, is selling anything for

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.960
[Guest 2]: that matter on the street, because pakoras are just incidental here, is also making money.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.440
[Guest 2]: And that is adding to the employment.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.920
[Guest 2]: So but I think, you know, that something like this shouldn't have come from the Prime Minister

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.360
[Guest 2]: of the country, at least.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.320
[Amit Varma]: So before we move on, I want to take a really layman's approach to this this episode and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.400
[Amit Varma]: ask you to elaborate on your point about jobs and employment.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.600
[Guest 2]: What do you mean jobs and employment are not the same thing?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.160
[Guest 2]: Okay, so jobs, I mean, let's say, you know, you were working for Wisden quick info at

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.960
[Guest 2]: a certain point of time, that that was a job right now, you don't work for anyone, you

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.640
[Guest 2]: work for anyone who gives you work, that is employment, right?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.720
[Guest 2]: So as long as people are employed, and gainfully employed, and are getting paid reasonably

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.840
[Guest 2]: for it, I don't think it matters whether, you know, they have a job or not.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.280
[Guest 2]: So I guess, so the debate should not be that India is not creating enough jobs, or India

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest 2]: is creating enough jobs, or whether India is creating enough jobs, but the debate should

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.560
[Guest 2]: be whether India is creating enough employment for the people who need it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560
[Guest 2]: And is it?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Of course not.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.400
[Guest 2]: I mean, we are not, we are nowhere near creating enough employment, as much as is needed.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And we have 1 million people coming into the workforce every month, like you pointed out,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.880
[Amit Varma]: that's 10 lakh people and nowhere near that amount of jobs are being created.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.680
[Guest 2]: Yes, I mean, so one of the, you know, recent estimates that CMI Centre for Monitoring Indian

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.600
[Guest 2]: Economy came up with was that in the year 2017, around 2 million opportunities were

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.160
[Guest 2]: created and nearly 11.5 million Indians entered the workforce.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.480
[Guest 2]: Now, we need to sort of also state here very, very clearly that India does not have very

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.240
[Guest 2]: high employment, very high unemployment, sorry, which is primarily because of the fact that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.000
[Guest 2]: anyone who does not, you know, get a job in India, ultimately ends up in self employment.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.440
[Guest 2]: So our unemployment rates are extremely low.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.080
[Guest 2]: In fact, the International Labour Organization just came out with numbers, and the rate of

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.360
[Guest 2]: unemployment in India is something like 3.5%.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.360
[Guest 2]: Now which is, I mean, then the next question to ask is, you know, why are we even, you

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.720
[Guest 2]: know, talking about all this if unemployment levels are so low?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800
[Amit Varma]: So, is it your point, like I've often heard it said that our problem isn't unemployment

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640
[Guest 2]: as much as underemployment?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.200
[Guest 2]: So which is, you know, our unemployment rates are low, because everyone's doing something.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.160
[Guest 2]: But the question is, whether that something is productive enough, and the answer is no.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.120
[Amit Varma]: And like recently, I heard about some PM's job in Delhi, where there were like 20 vacancies

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.600
[Amit Varma]: and some 40,000 people have applied, including hundreds of PhDs and MAs and all of that.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.640
[Amit Varma]: And that, I mean, that points to dual problems.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one of those problems, of course, is that a lot of the education system, you've

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.680
[Amit Varma]: had credential inflation in the sense it's, you know, those degrees have kind of become

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.120
[Amit Varma]: meaningless.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.580
[Amit Varma]: And people aren't really being trained for the workforce, there is a mismatch between

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.920
[Amit Varma]: education and what the labour market wants.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.560
[Guest 2]: And this is something you've, you know, you and I have spoken about in a previous podcast.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.440
[Guest 2]: So basically, what is happening there is twofold.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest 2]: One is that, you know, all these MBAs and PhDs and graduates that we are producing,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest 2]: a huge number of them are simply unemployable.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest 2]: And the second thing is that at lower levels, the government is a significantly better paymaster

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.140
[Guest 2]: than the private sector.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.200
[Guest 2]: So there was this study carried out, you know, by the 7th Pay Commission, and this is these

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.160
[Guest 2]: are 2013-14 numbers.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.560
[Guest 2]: And they figured out that, you know, at the junior most level, you know, what they call

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.840
[Guest 2]: euphemistically called a helper, but basically meant a peon, the government salaries are

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.120
[Guest 2]: at around 21-22,000 rupees per month, whereas the private sector pays around anywhere from

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.280
[Guest 2]: 8 to 9,000.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.560
[Guest 2]: So which is why you get so many people and so many qualified people applying for all

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest 2]: these jobs.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.880
[Guest 2]: And then job security also.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.040
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I mean, job security, then, you know, you obviously have this huge fascination for

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.760
[Guest 2]: government jobs in India, then, I mean, at any level, you at least have this thought

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.640
[Guest 2]: that you will make some other income as well, you know, beyond what you get as your salary

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.440
[Guest 2]: and so on and so forth.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.960
[Amit Varma]: So Shruti, I want you to chime in here.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.280
[Amit Varma]: My question to you is that, you know, one of the points which Vivek pointed out Modi

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.120
[Amit Varma]: was probably making is that, hey, it's not my government's job to create jobs, which

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.320
[Amit Varma]: I know all three of us would kind of agree with while traditionally, it's, you know,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.360
[Amit Varma]: you'll have politicians taking credit for job creation, and you'll have people criticizing

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.440
[Amit Varma]: this government or that government for not creating jobs.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.680
[Amit Varma]: But what government can't actually create jobs, right?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.280
[Amit Varma]: So where do jobs come from?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.360
[Guest 1]: The government doesn't have an obligation to create jobs, and the government can't actually

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.280
[Guest 1]: manufacture productivity.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.640
[Guest 1]: It's quite the reverse.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.520
[Guest 1]: Usually, when the government starts releasing employment schemes and programs, it's the

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.920
[Guest 1]: opposite of productivity.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:42.200
[Guest 1]: However, the government does have an obligation to create an environment that is conducive

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:51.240
[Guest 1]: for private individuals to be able to find their optimal job and for skills to be matched

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.240
[Guest 1]: to requirements in a very, you know, fairly low transaction cost way within an economy.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.960
[Guest 1]: So to that extent, the government does have an obligation to create an environment that

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.040
[Guest 1]: will then itself create jobs.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.200
[Amit Varma]: So what you'd mean by that is, for example, that the government would have to do things

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.760
[Amit Varma]: like maintain the rule of law, enforce contracts, and so on, on the one hand, while on the other

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.080
[Amit Varma]: hand, getting out of the way of voluntary exchanges within society and not having too

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.680
[Amit Varma]: much of the license and regulation, Raj, basically, which acts as a dampener on private enterprise

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.280
[Amit Varma]: and raises transaction costs.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.080
[Guest 1]: One of the things that's happening in India is that, as a country, we have made it too

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.920
[Guest 1]: costly to employ unskilled labor.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.220
[Guest 1]: And when it's too costly, then the skill level has to be higher.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.780
[Guest 1]: That is to make it worthwhile to hire that particular labor and pay that wage, or it

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.880
[Guest 1]: has to come in terms of productivity.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.800
[Guest 1]: It's a labor surplus country, but manufacturers are reluctant to hire labor and employ other

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.000
[Guest 1]: substitutes for labor.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.660
[Guest 1]: Now, in the process, the people have to do something.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.040
[Guest 1]: So one is in many developed countries where there are unemployed benefits and so on and

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040
[Guest 1]: so forth.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.680
[Guest 1]: You see these people reflected in unemployment figures, as Vivek pointed out, that doesn't

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.040
[Guest 1]: happen in India.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:18.880
[Guest 1]: So these people get reflected or rather get hidden in self-employment, in culture or street

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.960
[Guest 1]: vending or so on and so forth.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.760
[Guest 1]: So what is happening in India is we see very little of the problem in terms of data points,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.400
[Guest 1]: but we see the problem everywhere.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.240
[Guest 1]: People are not that productive and people are not that rich.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the things I've noticed in recent discourse is that, especially after

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.360
[Amit Varma]: demonetization and GST, is that the informal economy gets a bad name.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.840
[Amit Varma]: But the point I keep making is that the informal economy only exists because you made it so

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.540
[Amit Varma]: hard for the formal economy to function.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.600
[Amit Varma]: So all these people who can't get jobs in the formal economy because of these labor

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.920
[Amit Varma]: laws and the variety of other regulations and all have no choice but to be part of the

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920
[Amit Varma]: informal economy.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.280
[Amit Varma]: They're not there out of choice.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of these people who are self-employed are not self-employed in the glamorous way

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.160
[Amit Varma]: that I, for example, that Vivek and me are, where we are, you know, freelance columnists

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.840
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, but are self-employed in the sense of, say, the pakora seller, who don't

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840
[Amit Varma]: have a choice.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.240
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty much all they can do to survive.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.680
[Guest 1]: Yeah, there are two aspects to the problem that you just pointed out.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.640
[Guest 1]: The first is when the English speaking elite or elite who are tweeting that there's really

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.360
[Guest 1]: nothing wrong with what the prime minister said.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.520
[Guest 1]: I mean, they're right in the sense that factually, there's nothing wrong with what the prime

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.760
[Guest 1]: minister said.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.560
[Guest 1]: But their priors about self-employment are completely different from what is the reality

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.920
[Guest 1]: on the ground.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.040
[Guest 1]: For most of us, like you mentioned, especially you and Vivek, you are self-employed out of

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040
[Guest 1]: choice.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.080
[Guest 1]: That is, your choice of being self-employed is far superior to the alternatives of the

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.320
[Guest 1]: kinds of jobs that you might get.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.840
[Guest 1]: Now, what happens with the street vendors, the exact opposite.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.120
[Guest 1]: They would really like to get a job.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.680
[Guest 1]: They would like the security of the job, but they can't seem to find a job and they have

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest 1]: to make a living.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.280
[Guest 1]: So they are self-employed as last resort.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.080
[Guest 1]: And it is very difficult to be a street vendor in India.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.080
[Guest 1]: I don't think given a choice, most of these people would want to be self-employed.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.240
[Guest 1]: There's a secondary aspect to it.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.640
[Guest 1]: Normally, when we think about entrepreneurs, you would think, oh, so today he's selling

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.560
[Guest 1]: pakoras as a street vendor.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:36.000
[Guest 1]: Now, if he's really entrepreneurial tomorrow, that pakora enterprise will become bigger.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.080
[Guest 1]: Maybe he'll go from a cart to a food truck.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.600
[Guest 1]: Maybe he'll go from a food truck to a restaurant.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.240
[Guest 1]: Now that is the conventional thinking about self-employment and entrepreneurship when

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.080
[Guest 1]: you look at the West.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.560
[Guest 1]: That never happens in India.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.680
[Guest 1]: When we say, is it not jobs when a pakora seller makes 200 rupees a day?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.280
[Guest 1]: Let's be very clear, there is no upward mobility there.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.040
[Guest 1]: He's going to continue making 200 rupees a day.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.440
[Guest 1]: It's never going to turn into a pakora shop.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.400
[Guest 1]: It's never going to turn into one of those places where, you know, pakora store, AC at

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.520
[Guest 1]: the first floor and non-AC in the second floor.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.980
[Guest 1]: That's not happening.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:20.840
[Guest 1]: So the self-employment also has a very, very clear ceiling in terms of future growth and

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.600
[Amit Varma]: productivity and opportunity.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.160
[Amit Varma]: So before I cut back to Vivek, just break that down for me.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Why can't he scale up?

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.220
[Amit Varma]: Like why can't the pakora stall become a pakora chain?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:37.640
[Guest 1]: The pakora is affordable at that price for a regular person who might also be self-employed

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.520
[Guest 1]: or trapped in a low productivity environment.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:48.200
[Guest 1]: So if pakoras are selling at, say, 50 rupees a plate or 30 rupees a plate, then to make

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.780
[Guest 1]: it at that price, you can only do it on a street cart because it is just simply too

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.720
[Guest 1]: costly to scale it up into any kind of formal establishment, because formal establishments

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.200
[Guest 1]: require all kinds of permits and licenses and health inspections.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.920
[Guest 1]: And I mean, there are different surveys done in different cities on how many gazillion

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.040
[Guest 1]: units you need to open a small shop or a restaurant.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.560
[Guest 1]: I'm not exactly aware of what it is for an eatery in Mumbai in the exact locality where

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.480
[Guest 1]: you are, but I would guess it's pretty high.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.620
[Amit Varma]: So, Vivek, let me sort of come back to you here.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.960
[Amit Varma]: You published a column on the day we are recording, which is January 24th.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960
[Guest 2]: January 24th.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960
[Guest 2]: It's Awareness Day.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.720
[Amit Varma]: You're listening to this on the next Monday, or rather this is released on the next Monday.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.240
[Amit Varma]: And you wrote this column about pakoranomics, coining that most excellent term, which I'm

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.440
[Amit Varma]: very fond of.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.680
[Amit Varma]: And you sort of broke down Prime Minister Modi's logic.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.720
[Amit Varma]: So can I ask you to sort of go over your chain of thinking again?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.720
[Guest 2]: Sure.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.120
[Guest 2]: So, you know, first and foremost, I didn't come up with the example of pakora Mr. Modi

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120
[Guest 2]: did.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120
[Amit Varma]: So that's a very important point.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120
[Amit Varma]: But pakoranomics is your coinage.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, pakoranomics was my coinage.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.720
[Guest 2]: So, you know, we shouldn't be getting here into the unit economics of how profitable

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.440
[Guest 2]: it is to sell pakoras, because, you know, we all know of some pakodawala who made it

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
[Unknown]: big.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.160
[Guest 2]: You know, I was tweeting about this and one gentleman sort of tweeted back that there

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest 2]: was some pakodawala in Borivali, which is Mumbai suburb, which, you know, who had to

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.720
[Guest 2]: face a raid by the income tax department.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.320
[Guest 2]: I mean, there are always exceptions like that.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:39.540
[Guest 2]: But a pakodawala essentially is a representation of a self-employed individual who is trying

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.640
[Guest 2]: to make money by selling some stuff on the streets.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.280
[Guest 2]: And we have too many people selling too many things on the streets of India.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.480
[Guest 2]: I mean, this is a point that we need to keep in mind.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.320
[Guest 2]: Now, if you look at the fact that Mr. Modi talked about the pakodawala making rupees

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.840
[Guest 2]: 200 per day, that works out to around rupees 73,000 a year, the average per capita income

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.040
[Guest 2]: in 2016-17 of an average Indian was around 1.03 lakhs.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.960
[Guest 2]: So an average Indian essentially made 41% more than Mr. Modi's pakodawala.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.720
[Guest 2]: So there is a problem there.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, obviously, someone's got to, you know, when we're talking averages, someone will

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.520
[Guest 2]: make lower than the average.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.400
[Guest 2]: But you know, 41% gap is a little too much.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.960
[Guest 2]: Then the second point that we need to keep in mind is that the pakodawala, you know,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.920
[Guest 2]: unlike me, would definitely not be single.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, he would have a, I'm using, you know, I'm saying he because pakodawalas in India

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.960
[Guest 2]: typically are men, would typically have a family.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.480
[Guest 2]: Now, assuming, you know, the average Indian household has five people.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.240
[Guest 2]: Now, if this pakodawala has, you know, a wife and three children, then we are talking about,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:59.320
[Guest 2]: you know, a per capita of around 14,000 rupees per person per year, which is not a huge thing.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:06.400
[Guest 2]: So what we need to understand here is that, you know, all these pakodawalas and self-employment

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.520
[Guest 2]: guys are essentially, as Shruti said, not there by choice, but because they don't have

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.360
[Guest 2]: a choice because there are no jobs available or there are no jobs available for the skill

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.440
[Guest 2]: set that they have, making pakodawalas, hawking stuff on the street is very easy.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.200
[Guest 2]: You need very little capital to start off.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.320
[Guest 2]: Now, you know, if you look at, you know, there's some very interesting data that gets put out

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:44.800
[Guest 2]: by the Labor Bureau, you know, and they sort of suggest that close to half of India's workforce

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800
[Guest 2]: is self-employed.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, the exact percentage is 46.3, but since we live in an era of, you know, hyping

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.120
[Guest 2]: and overhyping things, so, you know, I've rounded off 46 to 50 percent.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.920
[Guest 2]: Now, half of India's workforce is self-employed, which is too high a number anyway, right?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.440
[Guest 2]: If you look at their income brackets, very, very interesting, around 41 percent of these,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.280
[Guest 2]: you know, self-employed people make up to rupees 5,000 rupees a month, which is up to

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:23.880
[Guest 2]: rupees 60,000 rupees a year, around 67 percent make up to rupees 90,000 a year, only 4 percent

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.440
[Guest 2]: make more than 2,40,000 a year.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.080
[Guest 2]: So most of these pakodawalas slash self-employed people do not even come into the income tax

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.600
[Guest 2]: bracket, okay?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.320
[Guest 2]: So the prime minister of a country sort of, you know, selling this as a vocation, I mean,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.160
[Guest 2]: that's not on.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:49.080
[Guest 2]: The other point I sort of wanted to make here is that, so there's clearly a problem with

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080
[Guest 2]: being self-employed.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.320
[Guest 2]: Now, what is happening now is that self-employment is sort of being mistaken, or rather, you

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.640
[Guest 2]: know, the propaganda is that self-employment is entrepreneurship, which it is not.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.360
[Guest 2]: Entrepreneurship and self-employment are two very, very different terms, which we need

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.480
[Guest 2]: to distinguish between, and entrepreneur is always an entrepreneur by choice.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.160
[Guest 2]: It may not be by, may or may not be by choice.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.200
[Guest 2]: So this is a very important, you know, difference that, you know, that needs to come out.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.160
[Guest 2]: Also, you know, if you look at, you know, the numbers of people, if you look at the

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.520
[Guest 2]: income of people who are self-employed, I mean, as I said, 41 percent of them make up

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.440
[Guest 2]: to rupees 60,000 a year, that is way less than the average per capita income.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.880
[Amit Varma]: That's less than the pakodawala, in fact, of Mr. Modi.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.040
[Guest 2]: That's less than the pakodawala.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:49.720
[Guest 2]: So the larger point here is that Indians have been pakodawalas for a few decades now.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:56.640
[Guest 2]: We have been self-employed for a few decades now because we haven't got enough jobs, enough

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.080
[Guest 2]: employment opportunities, enough viable employment opportunities going around.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.840
[Guest 2]: So this is not a new idea.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:08.760
[Guest 2]: I mean, it's just like, you know, old wine in a new bottle, which Mr. Modi is very good

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.760
[Amit Varma]: at.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Am I correct to say that the pakodawala is not so much a solution as a symptom of the

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.040
[Amit Varma]: problem which Mr. Modi is sort of ignoring and turning away from?

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.720
[Guest 1]: You have nailed it.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.040
[Guest 1]: So, you know, Amit and Vivek, just to jump in here, I don't think in general it's a very

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.880
[Guest 1]: productive idea to pick one sentence that the prime minister of a country says and then

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.000
[Guest 1]: pick it apart the way we usually do on Twitter.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.040
[Guest 1]: But here I think it's really important to do it because it seems that the prime minister

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.520
[Guest 1]: in this one sentence has captured exactly how much we are missing the point when it

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.080
[Guest 1]: comes to good economic reform.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:57.400
[Guest 1]: By pointing out the biggest symptom of the problem as an example of success, in this

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.840
[Guest 1]: case the pakodawala who earns 200 rupees by being self-employed because there's literally

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.960
[Guest 1]: no other choice for him.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:12.480
[Guest 1]: That I think is a bad idea coming from the leadership of the country, which is in charge

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.400
[Guest 1]: of economic reform.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And that shows a mindset problem, that shows that at some level, you know, our political

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.240
[Amit Varma]: class still hasn't figured out what the fundamental problem is.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest 2]: I don't agree with that.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.400
[Guest 2]: I think they know very well what the problem is, it's just that they can't do anything

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
[Guest 2]: about it.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.400
[Guest 2]: Given the number of structural reforms that are required and given the fact that we haven't

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.660
[Guest 2]: had them for a while now.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.760
[Guest 2]: So see, every politician needs to fight and win elections.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.720
[Guest 2]: Elections happen every five years.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.520
[Guest 2]: These structural reforms are to be initiated and if we were to sort of wait for the results,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.080
[Guest 2]: it would be a decade, decade and a half.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.680
[Guest 2]: So the politicians need to do something in between.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:05.000
[Guest 2]: Which is why I think, you know, what this, you know, the current dispensation is very

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.880
[Guest 2]: good at, is sort of taking the attention of people away from the real problem.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:19.240
[Guest 2]: I mean, you know, Mr. Modi was elected on the plank of jobs, employment, and, you know,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.760
[Guest 2]: economic development, minimum government, maximum governance, but all that's now fallen

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.040
[Guest 2]: by the wayside.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.320
[Guest 2]: What we have is Padmavat, which is basically Padmavati or Padmavat, whatever you might

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320
[Guest 2]: call it.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.800
[Guest 2]: I mean, from people who have seen the movie, I mean, they say it's a right-winger's wet

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800
[Guest 2]: dream.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.240
[Guest 2]: And, but, you know, you look at the kind of protests that are happening against the movie.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:52.960
[Guest 2]: Now, if, you know, if the right wing can protest and protest so successfully against what is

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.520
[Guest 2]: a right-winger's wet dream, imagine the kind of nuisance they can keep creating against

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.160
[Guest 2]: other, you know, cultural and other, you know, economic issues that keep propping up.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:10.080
[Guest 2]: So these are, you know, you basically want to take the attention away from the real problem.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.200
[Guest 2]: So then you make statements like, so this has been happening for a while.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:20.000
[Guest 2]: So, you know, before he made this pakora statement, he's also been talking about the fact as to

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.640
[Guest 2]: how mudra loans are creating employment.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.480
[Guest 2]: Now an average mudra loan is around 23,000 rupees.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.760
[Guest 2]: So I don't know how that is creating employment, but Mr. Modi believes that, you know, every

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.240
[Guest 2]: person who takes on a mudra loan has two, three more people and there's a multiplier

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240
[Guest 2]: effect.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.960
[Guest 2]: There has been no study which has shown this.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.400
[Guest 2]: The CEO of mudra has gone on record to say that we do not have any data on, you know,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.780
[Guest 2]: the number of jobs or employment opportunities that mudra loans have created.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:54.160
[Guest 2]: So this has been happening for a while when you cannot deliver on what you have promised,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.000
[Guest 2]: then you have to sort of create, you know, and say things which take away attention from

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Guest 2]: the real issues.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.680
[Guest 1]: I would want to add one more thing to what Vivek is saying.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:12.360
[Guest 1]: I mean, I partially agree with him that a part of this whole pakora story is just, you

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.200
[Guest 1]: know, some part of it is just spin, right, to deviate from the real problem.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.480
[Guest 1]: The first is what Vivek pointed out as the underemployment, which is masked as self-employment.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.720
[Guest 1]: But there's a second thing hidden in this number, which we haven't talked about yet.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.080
[Guest 1]: As Vivek pointed out, there's very low levels of unemployment in India.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.080
[Guest 1]: Now what is unemployment?

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.320
[Guest 1]: Unemployment is people who are looking for a job and can't find a job.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.640
[Guest 1]: Now one of the things that the self-employment story and this whole, you know, the fiasco

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.480
[Guest 1]: over the pakorawala tells us is, in India, people have stopped looking for jobs maybe

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.760
[Guest 1]: because they know that it is that difficult for jobs to come by.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.400
[Guest 1]: It's almost impossible to find one when you have 20,000 applications for four vacancies

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.120
[Guest 1]: for an office helper or something like that.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.360
[Guest 1]: So then the alternative is just to go into self-employment.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360
[Guest 2]: Which is true.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.360
[Guest 2]: Which is true.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360
[Guest 2]: I'll just, you know, budge in here.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360
[Guest 1]: Which is true.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.880
[Guest 2]: If you look at the CMI data, which came out a while back, so they have said that the labor

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.040
[Guest 2]: force participation rate has come down.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.680
[Guest 2]: So you're right.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.760
[Guest 1]: So, so he's, you know, applauding the 200 rupee pakorawala while I think they need to

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.040
[Guest 1]: be applauded for a completely different reason, which is that they work in a hostile environment.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:41.920
[Guest 1]: But Mr. Modi's reason for applauding the 200 rupee pakorawala is really trying to mask

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.600
[Guest 1]: both the reasons for the unemployment data point, which is people might have just given

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.920
[Guest 1]: up and the reason for the self-employment data point, which is just, it is underemployment

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.480
[Guest 1]: or, you know, you just need to eke out a living and look after your family and you have no

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:06.680
[Guest 1]: other choice, but to do something that seems relatively obvious and easier than the alternative.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And Shruti, what do you say about people giving up on getting a job is actually very poignant,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, in an earlier episode, I was chatting with JP Narayan about the state of Indian

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160
[Amit Varma]: politics today.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:23.440
[Amit Varma]: And he pointed out that two of the qualities that, you know, characterize the essence of

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.640
[Amit Varma]: the Indian voter are fatalism and tribalism, and it could even be argued that one leads

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640
[Amit Varma]: to the other.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.760
[Guest 1]: But can you really blame the average Indian person?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.400
[Guest 1]: I mean, the three of us sitting and recording this podcast are not the average Indian person.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.160
[Amit Varma]: Can you really blame them for being fatalistic about their situation?

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.960
[Amit Varma]: I meant that as explanation, not condemnation at all.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960
[Guest 1]: I mean,

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, no, no, I understand that.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:55.120
[Guest 1]: I mean, things are just really, really difficult for the average young Indian male joining

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.920
[Guest 1]: the job force.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.920
[Guest 1]: It's really difficult.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:07.080
[Guest 1]: And one part of that is, you know, what Vivek mentioned in terms of to hide that fact, you

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.960
[Guest 1]: know, there's a lot of political drama over Padmavat and things like that.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:19.840
[Guest 1]: But the other fact is, these young men and women need to be employed in some way.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.240
[Guest 1]: And when they can't get that, they find different ways to protest.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.200
[Guest 1]: And sometimes the most obvious thing that annoys you or offends you is a great way to

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.640
[Guest 1]: channel your energy because it's not like the economy allows them to channel their energy

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.800
[Amit Varma]: in a productive fashion.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, that makes Padmavat also a symptom of sorts, like one of the things we're

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
[Amit Varma]: all agreed on.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And I've been writing about it for ages is that Narendra Modi has always been a man who

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.880
[Amit Varma]: cares more about optics than anything else, and perhaps with good reason, because most

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.120
[Amit Varma]: people don't care about reality, but about the narrative, the nurturing in their heads

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.120
[Amit Varma]: and optics plays directly to that.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.320
[Amit Varma]: So he's always in campaigning mode, even after 2014.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.320
[Amit Varma]: He never exactly got into governance mode, which is where I want to focus my next question

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.400
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, Vivek, the point you made about, you know, they know what reforms have

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.000
[Amit Varma]: to be made, but they're not possible because of structural reasons, by which you mean,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, what the political economy is like, and those changes are simply not possible.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.360
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, they just resort to optics, thereby implying that the system is so sclerotic

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.080
[Amit Varma]: that things can never improve for the better.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, can you elaborate on that to give me a sense of what it's like, for example,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.680
[Amit Varma]: we all agree on certain labor laws, which need to be changed, we all agree on certain,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.520
[Amit Varma]: a whole bunch of regulations and licensing laws, which, if they changed, would allow

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.800
[Amit Varma]: greater employment in the formal sector.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.640
[Amit Varma]: But give me a sense of what are the sort of obstacles in their way, which prevent that

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
[Guest 2]: from happening?

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.640
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.160
[Guest 2]: So I was, you know, recently reading a column in the Business Standard written by A.K.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160
[Guest 2]: Bhattacharya.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.560
[Guest 2]: So Mr. Bhattacharya points out, and I didn't know this, that there are 260 labor laws in

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.440
[Guest 2]: the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:09.760
[Guest 2]: And I mean, I knew for a fact that there are around 200 labor laws all across India, state

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.120
[Guest 2]: and central labor laws, but Jammu and Kashmir seems to have outdone all of that.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.760
[Guest 2]: And they have 260 labor laws.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.680
[Guest 2]: Now they're trying to, so the state of J&K is trying to sort of come up with some sort

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.040
[Guest 2]: of a code which summarizes these laws.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.000
[Guest 2]: Anyway, that's a different point.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.760
[Guest 2]: The point is, you know, every time governments have tried labor law reforms, I mean, and

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.480
[Guest 2]: this includes Mr. Vajpayee, who tried some reforms in, you know, in the early 2000s,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.760
[Guest 2]: there have been grave protests from labor unions.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.800
[Guest 2]: Now, labor unions in India, as you would know, are politically affiliated.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.280
[Guest 2]: And ultimately, given the fact that they are politically affiliated and they are organized,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.320
[Guest 2]: they have a huge nuisance value.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.560
[Guest 2]: I mean, look at, you know, banks, I mean, the government of India owns 21 banks.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.760
[Guest 2]: I mean, why does the government need to own 21 banks?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.720
[Guest 2]: Some of these banks like, look at a bank like IDBI, it has a bad loans ratio of 25%.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.640
[Guest 2]: So why are we running these banks and wasting so much money?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.320
[Guest 2]: But ultimately, the point is the moment, you know, any government decides to sort of either

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.040
[Guest 2]: privatize or even shut down any of these banks, there will be a huge hangama because all these

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.680
[Guest 2]: unions, you know, they're all very well organized and nobody wants to get into that.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.640
[Guest 2]: Look at Air India, I mean, we've been talking about privatization of Air India for close

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.160
[Guest 2]: to a year now.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.880
[Guest 2]: But still, nothing is, you know, nothing concrete has happened.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.600
[Guest 2]: I mean, they've done, you know, they've said that, you know, we'll sell the company and

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.520
[Guest 2]: the employees will be protected.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.560
[Guest 2]: But then, you know, you need to, if they were serious about selling Air India, you know,

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.040
[Guest 2]: by now, we would have known as to what are the terms and conditions, which come attached

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040
[Guest 2]: with it.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.240
[Guest 2]: I mean, does the buyer take on the debt of the company?

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.760
[Guest 2]: What happens to the employees?

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.480
[Guest 2]: Can the employees be fired, so on and so forth?

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.760
[Guest 2]: But that has not happened.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.280
[Guest 2]: So essentially, you know, no, I think the...

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.320
[Amit Varma]: But is that a lack of will on their part or the friction in the system?

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320
[Guest 1]: I mean, both.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320
[Guest 1]: It's both.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:21.520
[Guest 1]: And it's also, I think, so as Vivek pointed out, the unions are a huge nuisance there.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.800
[Guest 1]: And I want to add to that, that the other group that is a huge nuisance value.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.920
[Guest 1]: So you know, just off tangent for a minute, in standard public choice theory, we call

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.760
[Guest 1]: this the transitional gains trap, which basically means that everyone, most people agree or

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest 1]: everyone agrees that moving from system one to system two is beneficial.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.520
[Guest 1]: But when you move or transition from system one to system two, there are some winners

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520
[Guest 1]: and losers.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.080
[Guest 1]: And if the losers manage to organize themselves very well, then they can actually prevent

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.480
[Guest 1]: the transition from system one to system two, which would benefit everybody largely.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.720
[Guest 1]: So now, what you need to think about is, like Vivek pointed out the example of the labor

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.360
[Guest 1]: unions, we need to figure out who are these groups, who are the winners and losers for

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.360
[Guest 1]: each of these categories of regulation or licensing.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.840
[Guest 1]: And it's pretty difficult, but I think we can summarize it in two big groups.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:24.520
[Guest 1]: The first is, of course, labor unions, which is the, you know, extremely formal, well-protected

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:31.160
[Guest 1]: fraction of the economy compared to this huge part, which is completely vulnerable in the

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.560
[Guest 1]: informal sector.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.120
[Guest 1]: The other is the bureaucrats.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.560
[Guest 1]: Now, if we get rid of all the stupid licensing requirements, then how are they going to make

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.280
[Guest 1]: the rents that they wish to make or their entire reason for getting into a particular

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.600
[Guest 1]: kind of job to get those rents will be defeated.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:55.300
[Guest 1]: So you actually, when Vivek says structural problems, it's not just frictions from outside.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:00.560
[Guest 1]: It's also frictions from within a very large part of the government, which is the bureaucracy,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.960
[Guest 1]: which never really goes away.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.520
[Guest 1]: You know, legislators are elected every five years.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.200
[Guest 1]: The bureaucracy is just there forever.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.920
[Guest 1]: They are extremely well organized, and it is very difficult to do things that are not

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.440
[Guest 1]: in their interest.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.040
[Guest 1]: So it's very difficult to change things.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:22.080
[Guest 1]: Now, having said that, I want to defend the prime minister here a little bit, and I also

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.080
[Guest 1]: want to zero in on where I place the blame.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.520
[Guest 1]: I want to defend the prime minister in the following fashion.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.120
[Guest 1]: The mess is really too large for one person at the top or a small group of legislators

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.840
[Guest 1]: at the center to do anything about it.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.400
[Guest 1]: Now, labor laws are concurrent list.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.480
[Guest 1]: You can legislate at the center or the state.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.880
[Guest 1]: There's nothing that prevents states from adding amendments, which many states have

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.740
[Guest 1]: to improve the mess that is the labor law in their particular environment.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:57.680
[Guest 1]: So we are not seeing any leadership at the state level either, which we could have.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.960
[Guest 1]: I mean, nothing precludes the leadership at the state level from doing something different

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.020
[Guest 1]: from what the center is suggesting.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:11.040
[Guest 1]: So the first is, you know, there is a lot of regulation at the corporate level, at the

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.480
[Guest 1]: state bureaucracy level, at the state legislation level, which I think it's a little unfair

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.560
[Guest 1]: and difficult to pin the blame on the prime minister, not just this one, but any prime

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.560
[Guest 1]: minister.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:28.800
[Guest 1]: Now, having said that, where do I think we can impose some responsibility, if not blame

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.240
[Guest 1]: on the prime minister?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:37.600
[Guest 1]: I think the leadership has to set out the ideas and the agenda at the top.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.840
[Guest 1]: And that is something that we find missing.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:46.140
[Guest 1]: The spin story of saying pakodawalas are doing just fine, and it's a sign of the Indian economy

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.960
[Guest 1]: doing well, sets a very poor example.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:56.180
[Guest 1]: The example needs to be that what can the government at the union level do to help governments

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:03.160
[Guest 1]: at the state level untangle the regulatory mess and make it easier or have a more conducive

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.720
[Guest 1]: environment for jobs?

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.520
[Guest 1]: That is completely missing from the current leadership.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.520
[Guest 1]: So on that aspect, I do think that the union leadership can do the lot and they're really

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.520
[Guest 1]: not doing anything.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.340
[Guest 1]: They're just deviating from the matter, spinning stories, traveling here and there, talking

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.880
[Amit Varma]: about all sorts of irrelevant nonsense.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.720
[Amit Varma]: But Shruti, to sort of go back to the question of the prime minister's vision and concurrent

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.120
[Amit Varma]: lists and so on, the fact of the matter is that Mr. Modi boasted recently about how the

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.480
[Amit Varma]: BJP today rules more states than Indira Gandhi did.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, the BJP is in power at the center and at many of the states.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, take Gujarat alone, for example, if he really had the will to make these changes

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.280
[Amit Varma]: in the conviction that they were necessary, surely he would have made more progress than

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280
[Amit Varma]: he had.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'm, you know, I totally understand that there's a lot of friction within the system,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.560
[Amit Varma]: both from inside the government in terms of the bureaucratic structures and from outside

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.840
[Amit Varma]: in terms of unions and so on.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.760
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, my sense is that the current political leadership and every single

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:11.040
[Amit Varma]: political leadership before it in the history of independent India simply doesn't understand

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.400
[Amit Varma]: what needs to be done.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.760
[Guest 1]: I'm not so, well, yes and no to your question.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.840
[Guest 1]: Yes, in the sense that I do think the current leadership and previous leaderships have been

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:28.720
[Guest 1]: extremely lacking, no, in the sense that I do think as civil society in India, we need

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:35.520
[Guest 1]: to start blaming more responsibility on different tiers of government and different individuals

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:42.000
[Guest 1]: as opposed to focusing all our attention at one tier of government and one man or woman.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.800
[Guest 1]: So I think that is one area where I might disagree.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.520
[Guest 1]: That's the reason I jumped to the prime minister's defense, not because of what's going on is

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:56.520
[Guest 1]: amazing, it's quite dismal, but I think we need to make state, you know, chief ministers,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.680
[Guest 1]: we need to make local corporators, we need to name these people, impose blame and responsibility

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.560
[Guest 1]: on them and actually hold them accountable, right?

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.200
[Guest 1]: So that is my limited point.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.560
[Amit Varma]: But my point is, the BJP is in power practically everywhere, 18 states, if I'm not mistaken,

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560
[Amit Varma]: plus the center.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.600
[Amit Varma]: So what is the philosophy of the party on all these issues?

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.840
[Amit Varma]: What are its positions?

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Not only are they not clearly articulated, the only articulations we get are populist

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.760
[Amit Varma]: articulations, which are good for optical reasons.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.200
[Amit Varma]: But not only are these kinds of reforms not articulated as something that is necessary,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.160
[Amit Varma]: that across the board, in most places, there's no effort to actually do anything.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.160
[Guest 2]: But anyway, I mean, leaving that aside.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.120
[Guest 1]: It's a longer discussion for another day.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120
[Guest 1]: It's a longer discussion.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120
[Guest 1]: It's a longer discussion.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.720
[Guest 1]: But in one sense, I don't think that is a problem or a malady that is BJP centric or

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.720
[Amit Varma]: unique.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.720
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.200
[Guest 1]: I mean, no matter which party and when you ask what is their goal or agenda, it's the

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.280
[Guest 2]: same as every party which is giving the most number of seats and hold on to the most power

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280
[Guest 2]: in most states.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280
[Guest 2]: I guess I'll summarize that.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.280
[Guest 2]: So basically, I keep this is something I keep writing on that, writing that India has only

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.760
[Guest 2]: one model of governance, and which is the Congress model of governance.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.760
[Unknown]: So which is absolutely true.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.960
[Guest 2]: As long as we, you know, keep following that model of governance, you cannot get different

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960
[Amit Varma]: results by doing the same thing over and over again.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi is in power because of all the misgovernance of the last six and a half decades.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.840
[Amit Varma]: And the fact of the matter is that every political party in India is pretty much left of center

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.760
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to economics, and doesn't believe in social freedoms.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's like for a libertarian like me, that's the worst of both worlds.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:37.120
[Guest 1]: And in one sense, I think Mr. Modi's government is the most close analogy I can find is Mrs.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi's government.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.960
[Guest 1]: There is a high degree of centralization of power, a high degree of suppression of economic

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.240
[Guest 1]: freedom, except that is the line that Mrs. Gandhi fully bought into.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.920
[Guest 1]: I think with Mr. Modi's current situation, there is a little bit of a spin.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.800
[Guest 1]: They seem to suggest that they want economic liberalization, but there's still suppression

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800
[Guest 1]: of economic freedom.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.680
[Guest 1]: And they both suppress social freedom in completely different ways.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.540
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.880
[Guest 1]: In Mr. Modi's case, what is happening right now in the country and the protests, like

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:17.440
[Guest 1]: I just saw a horrific video of kids in a school bus being targeted by some foul group or the

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440
[Guest 1]: other.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.580
[Guest 1]: And Mrs. Gandhi did it in a completely different way.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:27.080
[Guest 1]: She also hurt minorities and, you know, forcible sterilizations and all sorts of horror.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.680
[Guest 1]: So I mean, I don't think this is a BJP centric problem.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:38.560
[Guest 1]: I think this is a Indian governance model, I think it's a design flaw, like Vivek pointed

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.200
[Guest 1]: out that we have one model of governance, which is Congress, centralized power, hold

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.120
[Guest 1]: it right at the top.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.440
[Guest 1]: And you know, that's not really when we think about the structural reform that is required

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.240
[Guest 1]: in the various sectors, we're talking about occupational licensing, labor reform, industrial

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.240
[Guest 1]: reform.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.600
[Guest 1]: I don't think you're going to get that in that model.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.840
[Guest 2]: It's highly unlikely.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.680
[Guest 2]: You know, Shruti, you would have made for a very bad journalist, simply because what

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:14.040
[Guest 2]: you know, it took you so many words to basically, what you basically meant was NAR INDRA MODI,

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040
[Guest 2]: you know.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:21.920
[Guest 1]: Yeah, see, I would have made a bad journalist, but I'm a professor who needs to fill up 100

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.920
[Amit Varma]: minutes of class time.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.560
[Amit Varma]: So you need to be verbose.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Kind of now, microscoping down and moving from the sort of the large issue that we've

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.280
[Amit Varma]: been talking about and coming back to jobs.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And this is something again, Vivek, you and I have discussed on a previous podcast, we

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.920
[Amit Varma]: had a podcast just on jobs.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And given that Mr. Modi is focusing more on optics with, you know, all these fancy images

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:53.120
[Amit Varma]: of pakorawala earning 200 a day being what he's selling, you know, are you optimistic

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.040
[Amit Varma]: or pessimistic about what's going to happen in the near future?

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.800
[Guest 2]: Where is the ray of hope?

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.600
[Guest 2]: I'm extremely pessimistic.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:10.040
[Guest 2]: I, in fact, earlier in the day, I just wrote a piece which I headlined, India has lost

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.240
[Guest 2]: its bus out of poverty.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.360
[Guest 2]: Okay, so I am extremely pessimistic.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.920
[Guest 1]: I'm very pessimistic about the government and what the government can do to improve

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.560
[Guest 1]: our lot in life.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:31.800
[Guest 1]: I'm very optimistic about individual creativity and entrepreneurship and ingenuity.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.600
[Guest 1]: And Amit, you and I have had this conversation many times over, you even call it the million

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.400
[Guest 1]: mutinies after Mr. Naipaul.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.880
[Amit Varma]: Actually it's a mutual friend, Varun Mitra has, you know, invoked that Naipaul term in

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.880
[Guest 1]: this context, a million mutinies, and also credit to Varun for it.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880
[Guest 1]: Oh wonderful.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so fantastic Varun.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.400
[Guest 1]: I mean, Varun is amazing.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.960
[Guest 1]: Well, everybody should follow Varun Mitra on Twitter and in life, he is fantastic.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.320
[Guest 1]: But I think that is what I'm optimistic about.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.720
[Guest 1]: I'm still very optimistic about the average Indian.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:14.080
[Guest 1]: I mean, look at Indians, they survived a disaster like demonetization.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:21.360
[Guest 1]: Because Indians are fundamentally intelligent, entrepreneurial, try and find a way to get

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.200
[Guest 1]: by despite all the oppression of the state.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.720
[Guest 1]: And once in a way, while they are just getting by and just sort of surviving, you see the

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:38.360
[Guest 1]: incredible idea, you see the incredible entrepreneurship, you see the next hero.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.600
[Amit Varma]: So that I'm very optimistic about the Indian people.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.360
[Amit Varma]: The flip side of that might well be that they survived just by being fatalistic, not necessarily

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.360
[Amit Varma]: optimistic.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.360
[Amit Varma]: You know what?

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360
[Guest 2]: Fatalism is our optimism, you know.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:56.560
[Guest 1]: No, but what I like about India is, you know, like Mrs. Joan Robinson said that anything

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.680
[Guest 1]: you say about India, the opposite is also true.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.680
[Guest 1]: So if there is a very large group which is fatalistic, then there's a very large group

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.880
[Guest 1]: that is entrepreneurial and clever and ingenious and will come out of it also.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.760
[Guest 1]: So a large enough group of people that we're talking about, that I think that we can easily

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.680
[Guest 1]: find the million mutinies that we're looking for.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.960
[Amit Varma]: On that marvelously optimistic or pessimistic note, whichever way you look at it, for We

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Contain Multitudes, I'll thank you both for coming on the show where we agreed and disagreed

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.680
[Amit Varma]: so much because everything happened.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's always a pleasure talking to both of you guys.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.440
[Amit Varma]: And I hope we can continue to do so in future after Mr. Modi listens to this particular

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440
[Amit Varma]: episode.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440
[Guest 2]: Thanks, Amit.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440
[Guest 1]: Hi.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440
[Guest 1]: Thanks, Amit.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.520
[Guest 1]: I mean, for inviting me when I pretty much just sort of elbowed my way into this conversation.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.120
[Guest 1]: And I wanted to make two plugs.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.120
[Guest 1]: One, when you talked about Indian colors, you guys can't see it because I'm not in the

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120
[Guest 1]: studio.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:01.760
[Guest 1]: I'm actually wearing a Haren Vakil scarf with the jazz player and the other plug that everybody

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.360
[Guest 1]: should read Vivek's book.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360
[Guest 1]: It's marvelous.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.240
[Amit Varma]: If you read this book, give big government and why it's hurting you and indiancolors.com

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.640
[Amit Varma]: colors with an OU.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.960
