00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
[Amit Varma]: So you've clicked play on this podcast and you notice that hey, this episode is over

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.400
[Amit Varma]: five and a half hours long.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
[Amit Varma]: What's going on?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Why does it need to be so long?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.640
[Amit Varma]: People who discover this podcast for the first time often ask this question, though if they

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.400
[Amit Varma]: become regular listeners, they ask, why couldn't it have been longer?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.600
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a post about this subject and I'll link it from the show notes.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.320
[Amit Varma]: But let me talk about one aspect of it for now.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.440
[Amit Varma]: When I started the show, it was about ideas and analysis.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.480
[Amit Varma]: The name of this podcast, The Seen and the Unseen, was inspired by Frederic Barcia's

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.280
[Amit Varma]: 19th century essay, That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.920
[Amit Varma]: The show, like the essay it was inspired from, was supposed to be about the unintended consequences

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.340
[Amit Varma]: of public policy.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.380
[Amit Varma]: But then it evolved.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.500
[Amit Varma]: And over the last few years, the focus has shifted from ideas to people, from interviews

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
[Amit Varma]: to conversations.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.620
[Amit Varma]: Initially, I'd get an expert on a subject and talk about the subject.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.320
[Amit Varma]: But those are dime a dozen on YouTube and other podcasts.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.080
[Amit Varma]: I gradually stepped back and began speaking about my guests' life and influences.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And in recent times, some of the longer episodes are oral histories, or you could even call

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.200
[Amit Varma]: them assisted self portraits.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.460
[Amit Varma]: When you speak to someone about the life over a span of decades, you not only understand

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.120
[Amit Varma]: them better, but you also get glimpses of the changing world as it turns and burns.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.140
[Amit Varma]: I love that aspect of the show, being able to live someone's life as seen in flashback

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.640
[Amit Varma]: and self reflection.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Being able to unpeel layers of this complex world we live in.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.720
[Amit Varma]: And going by the love I get from all of you, it's clear that many, many people want that

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of deep discursive conversation as well.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
[Amit Varma]: So if you're new to this, and you start listening and think, hey, get to the point, well, there

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440
[Amit Varma]: is no point.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440
[Amit Varma]: That is the point.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.600
[Amit Varma]: I'll end this intro by saying thank you again to all the guests who've ever been on this

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: show and have trusted me enough to set aside their filters and open themselves up to me.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:07.160
[Unknown]: It's been a privilege and it's changed me as a person.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.520
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is my old and dear friend Nilanjana Roy.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.320
[Amit Varma]: I first met Nilanjana in my blogging days, maybe 18 or 19 years ago, when she was already

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000
[Amit Varma]: one of the most highly regarded book critics in the country, and even in the world as her

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.720
[Amit Varma]: fame grew through the interwebs.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.200
[Amit Varma]: She wrote one of the longest running book columns in the world.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.520
[Amit Varma]: I think it appeared in the business standard for over two decades.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.840
[Amit Varma]: She's now a columnist for the Financial Times.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.000
[Amit Varma]: She's edited various compilations.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.280
[Amit Varma]: She's written two fabulous books of fantasy called The Wildings and The Hundred Names

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of Darkness.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.200
[Amit Varma]: Her first literary novel for adults Black River is due out soon.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a biography.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.960
[Amit Varma]: What can I tell you about her?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Well, one of the things that I admire about Nilanjana is what a good reader she is.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.220
[Amit Varma]: She reads a lot.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.260
[Amit Varma]: She reads well.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.840
[Amit Varma]: She reads with intention.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Her reading deepens her sense of self and informs how she looks at the world and writes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.240
[Amit Varma]: This is something I've always wanted to learn from her.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.800
[Amit Varma]: Some of this love for reading and books comes out through her superb collection of essays,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800
[Amit Varma]: The Girl Who Ate Books.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll refer to that and quote from that during this conversation, where we spoke about reading,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.080
[Amit Varma]: yes, but also about feminism, family, freedom and about these times we live in.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to it, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And guess what?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.760
[Amit Varma]: The commercial is also about reading.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.880
[Amit Varma]: Use my code and subscribe to CTQ.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.420
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.560
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.520
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.080
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.600
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.800
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.680
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.400
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.840
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.760
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.360
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.880
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.320

[Amit Varma]: Thank you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.840
[Amit Varma]: So I'm glad we're finally getting to do this because I think I've been sort of asking you

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.760
[Amit Varma]: for a while and you've been busy writing your books but finally here we are.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.400
[Guest]: I have to apologize for that it's just been a couple of years the last three years I think

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.080
[Guest]: has been pretty full on both with the writing and then personal loss and for a while I don't

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.600
[Guest]: think I was in a space where I wanted to speak as much as I wanted to listen and your podcast

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.200
[Guest]: was a great comfort in that time.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.680
[Guest]: We have so few shows that actually give people a little time to you know sprawl.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.600
[Guest]: Usually you have your eye on the clock with the conversation and you're thinking 20 minutes,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.680
[Guest]: four questions, 45 minutes so much.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.680
[Guest]: And I'm going to try very hard not to be going to interviewer mode though the questions that

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.320
[Guest]: I wanted to ask you were things like you know why why did you decide that we needed this

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.040
[Guest]: the sprawl of time, the slowness, this getting into things, spending a fair amount of an

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.120
[Guest]: afternoon or a morning or an evening with your guests.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.320
[Guest]: I've enjoyed it as a listener.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.120
[Amit Varma]: In a very sleek way and a very slinky way you turn the tables on me but yeah to get

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.160
[Amit Varma]: you warmed up yeah sure this is a conversation.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.840
[Amit Varma]: It sort of evolved that way in the sense that initially my sense was that you know people

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.040
[Amit Varma]: have short attention spans a 20 minute podcast is perfect you got to grab them in the first

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.280
[Amit Varma]: few seconds all of those things and I realized I was wrong for three reasons which I've sort

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.600
[Amit Varma]: of spoken about and written about so much in the past that it'll be a repetition for

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.520
[Amit Varma]: many of my listeners but the reasons being that one people tend to listen when they are

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.680
[Amit Varma]: a captive audience so people will listen to podcasts or audiobooks when they are either

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.720
[Amit Varma]: commuting or working out or doing errands like washing dishes and so on.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.080
[Amit Varma]: So you know when you're watching a video on YouTube you can just go to another tab or

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.880
[Amit Varma]: change the window or turn your head and talk to someone who's standing there pick up a

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.220
[Amit Varma]: book from the table but if you're jogging you're jogging you're not going to start doing

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.000
[Amit Varma]: something else so one you're a captive audience two people listen at higher speeds which is

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.540
[Amit Varma]: easy to do because our normal speaking speed is between 150 to 200 words a minute I speak

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.080
[Amit Varma]: at about 160 because I'm a middle-aged man now I'm a little slow but our brain can comprehend

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.700
[Amit Varma]: language at 500 words a minute so actually it's really easy to listen at higher speeds

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.240
[Amit Varma]: and the way to do it is people might think oh it's squeaky and I'll miss nuances and

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.160
[Amit Varma]: all of that actually you don't at all because your brain adjusts so if you take it to 1.2

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.660
[Amit Varma]: wait for it to normalize take it to 1.5 so on and so forth like I can listen to stuff

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.440
[Amit Varma]: between 2.5 to 3x and not lose any nuance not lose any pauses any gaps because the brain

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.080
[Amit Varma]: just adjusts and processes them that way and the third important reason is that I think

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.540
[Amit Varma]: in modern times people crave depth and the thing is it's not that there are two kinds

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.600
[Amit Varma]: of people in the world and the one kind has short attention span one kind doesn't I think

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.320
[Amit Varma]: everyone has a short attention span for a lot of the time so there might be times where

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.480
[Amit Varma]: I am constantly distracted and looking at my smartphone and you can't really hold my

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.760
[Amit Varma]: attention but there are also times where I want to sit down and go deep and media today

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.140
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately because there's a race to the bottom it it's it's a mile wide and an inch

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.120
[Amit Varma]: deep as our mutual friend Prem Panicker says so eloquently and people get that and people

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.960
[Amit Varma]: crave depth and they value depth which I've discovered through the love I get from my

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.800
[Amit Varma]: listeners and I think it's in a sense and this is a theme we'll surely talk about in

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.860
[Amit Varma]: your context as well but I think just shifting forms not just changes the work that you do

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.000
[Amit Varma]: but it also changes a person that you are it makes like for me I think I'm and I was

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.040
[Amit Varma]: discussing this in an episode I released I recorded yesterday with Pradeep magazine it'll

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:20.600
[Amit Varma]: probably release after this but you know and where I was talking about how it's made me

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.400
[Amit Varma]: less judgmental and more open to listening to people and getting involved in their stories

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.240
[Amit Varma]: like you know Stephen Covey once said that we don't listen to understand we listen to

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.400
[Amit Varma]: respond which is a really bad thing I mean to have a good conversation you have to kind

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.520
[Amit Varma]: of put your ego out of it and just sit down and listen and I think doing this has taught

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.120
[Amit Varma]: me to do that and Pradeep in different ways also shared how the last 10 years have made

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.560
[Amit Varma]: him much less judgmental which reflects in this beautiful memoir that he's written called

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.400
[Amit Varma]: not just cricket which is an episode that will come after this so people can hear that

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.480
[Amit Varma]: and I've been reflecting about this as well I've been you know doing a fair bit of sort

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.840
[Amit Varma]: of self-reflection on how the work that you do can change who you are and the work that

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.480
[Amit Varma]: you do is shaped so much by the form and you have also worked across different forms in

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.880
[Amit Varma]: your life done different kinds of reading different kinds of writing so you know although

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.560
[Amit Varma]: this was not something I planned specifically to ask but what are your thoughts on this

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.840
[Guest]: I'm picking up on some of the words that you've used because they are exactly what I wanted

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.320
[Guest]: to talk about today it's that ache for depth it's not just a need for depth or a sense

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.520
[Guest]: that we have that missing in our lives somewhere the more frantic that we get the more time

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest]: we are spending on Twitter social media keeping up it's not just social media you know to

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.040
[Guest]: be honest the world makes you feel like you have to keep running to stand still and just

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.740
[Guest]: just to be in the swim and whether it's news or whether it's your lives there's no emphasis

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.400
[Guest]: on pausing you know there's just you're supposed to consume one experience after the other

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.240
[Guest]: just the way that you consume the news and there's this constant frantic cry of next

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:14.440
[Guest]: next next I've spent much to my surprise I think a lifetime of moving around a lot between

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:21.400
[Guest]: jobs not settling to one kind of writing one kind of job but grounded fundamentally in

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.640
[Guest]: reading and writing I don't think I intended that to happen but it's been if you think

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.120
[Guest]: about it this way in this ocean that's constantly tugging you this way or that way my reading

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.200
[Guest]: in different languages different bodies of work different kinds of things has been like

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.480
[Guest]: a sheet anchor it's something that you can return to at any point of time in your life

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.160
[Guest]: no matter how grievous the world around you is and your reading also challenges you at

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.800
[Guest]: some point to seek a certain kind of depth you know that libraries have long been used

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.320
[Guest]: as parallel schools or colleges in the depression American libraries became places where people

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.360
[Guest]: taught themselves skills and they did that by reading 30 books and on the subject and

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.240
[Guest]: they found their subject basically by walking into this huge cathedral of books practically

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.740
[Guest]: and asking themselves a simple question what am I curious about what am I interested in

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.280
[Guest]: the other thing that you've touched about the fact that your work changes you I get

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:31.600
[Guest]: asked so often about writing by people who see it as who used to see it at least as a

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.640
[Guest]: pathway to a certain kind of success or celebrity or stability and they really want to have

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.800
[Guest]: written their books and each time I want to I really want to beg them to sit down and

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.960
[Guest]: enjoy the writing itself you know to sit there quietly with the page and with whatever you're

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.840
[Guest]: working on and to discover yourself as a writer or discover yourself as a reader as well for

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.040
[Guest]: me what am I doing these days I've just finished a novel Black River which is probably the

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.880
[Guest]: first novel I've written for an entirely adult audience my two books before that the Wildings

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.500
[Guest]: and the Hundred Names of Darkness well could go either way my youngest reader was six years

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:21.720
[Guest]: old and my oldest reader was 92 years old a Spanish biker you know who sent me pictures

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.720
[Guest]: of himself with his two cats beautiful yeah that is the joy of being a writer actually

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.800
[Guest]: you never know who you're going to reach and if you're in a rush to get to some page three

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:39.600
[Guest]: success or to get on to the TV shows or to be invited to the Jaipur Literature Festival

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.280
[Guest]: as fun as all those things are that's not what the work is about you know and I want

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: to tell people to to learn to take their time with whatever it is that they're doing whether

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.400
[Guest]: it's with a book or with an author the pleasure of immersion that's the word that we are looking

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.400
[Guest]: for really you know immersion is difficult because everything else in our modern life

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.920
[Guest]: mitigates against it it says that when you've reached a place you need to rush to reach

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.080
[Guest]: the other place if you've traveled to so many countries you need to go somewhere else and

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.720
[Guest]: yet it's only by standing still and holding on whatever it is that I admire in my life

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.500
[Guest]: whether it's specific writers specific books or whether it's the freedom struggle you know

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:29.040
[Guest]: I'm struck by how much Nehru, Gandhi, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Sarojini Naidu, Aruna Asif Ali

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.800
[Guest]: all of them how much time they actually spent thinking about what went into a national movement

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.080
[Guest]: and trying to visualize independence Gloria Steinem I'm jumping like crazy so you'll have

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.040
[Guest]: to call me back at some point but Gloria Steinem says that one of the tasks ahead of us is

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.120
[Guest]: how to imagine a new world and she doesn't say you know how to bring that new world into

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.780
[Guest]: being that's a later task or whatever but truly if you cannot imagine a better reality

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.400
[Guest]: a better life then how you're going to reach that and you're not going to be able to get

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.840
[Guest]: to that point if you're constantly racing from one action to another it's not just about

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.520
[Guest]: slowing down it's about what you're slowing down for right so when you get back to your

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.880
[Guest]: early experiences of reading often we rush into what was your first book but most people's

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.660
[Guest]: early experiences of reading are actually of being told a story you know of listening

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.480
[Guest]: when you're very very small very young and that is the ultimate slowness because you're

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.480
[Guest]: sitting there you're quiet but you're not passive you're taking in something and you're

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.960
[Guest]: learning to imagine for the first time in your very very young life this world that

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:50.640
[Guest]: doesn't actually exist before your eyes I've looked at that and I think one of the big

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.120
[Guest]: themes that I keep coming back to is why in all these centuries do we keep reaching for

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.680
[Guest]: story why do we keep reaching for myths why is it that pretty much from the dawn of humanity

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.120
[Guest]: one of the first things we do is not just live in the world but we reach for stories

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.920
[Guest]: to try and explain what kind of world it is that we live in you know the oldest books

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.820
[Guest]: and the oldest tales go back to the dawn of humanity itself and I find that incredibly

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:25.200
[Guest]: moving and slightly surreal that we can sit here so many centuries later and still fully

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.680
[Guest]: understand and be moved by something like the epic of Gilgamesh you know which was the

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.920
[Guest]: first written epic or we can relate to the Mahabharata and the Ramayana whatever your

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.440
[Guest]: own epics are we can relate to them as though they were written yesterday you know it's

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:46.320
[Guest]: that universal people just reach across the centuries all the time with writing so a number

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.480
[Amit Varma]: of things I want to kind of double click on and kind of go a little deeper and one of

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.960
[Amit Varma]: them comes from two of the things that you mentioned just now one is of course how you

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.440
[Amit Varma]: know that Therav has gone from our lives where we can just sit and think about stuff and

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.360
[Amit Varma]: not just go from sensation to sensation and so on and so forth and the other is what you

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.600
[Amit Varma]: said about our freedom fighters having the time to you know to sit and think about stuff

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.040
[Amit Varma]: you know Nehru writing all that he did in jail in such eloquent language without a library

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:24.560
[Amit Varma]: available to him and so on and so forth one TIL moment I had about our modern times came

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.440
[Amit Varma]: from Jonathan Haidt when he said that even though we have all of literature and all of

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.000
[Amit Varma]: knowledge available to us at the click of a mouse most of what we are consuming was

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.700
[Amit Varma]: produced in the last three days right so we go from sensation to sensation to sensation

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.600
[Amit Varma]: to sensation and that quietitude is not there like you know when you and I were growing

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.960
[Amit Varma]: up we had a lot of me time and we had a lot of me time because there was no option there

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.000
[Amit Varma]: weren't so many things to do you know we read a lot why did we read a lot because there

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.720
[Amit Varma]: was so few books available to us that we read everything we could kind of grab hold of I

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.640
[Amit Varma]: mean you and I were perhaps much more privileged and fortunate in this regard but for most

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.720
[Amit Varma]: people and so many of my guests of our vintage you're just reading everything indiscriminately

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.600
[Amit Varma]: that you can get hold of and you have the time to sit down and think and you know like

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.680
[Amit Varma]: you said like I once wrote a column about you know that old lament about how did we

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:29.440
[Amit Varma]: have such great leaders in the 20s 30s 40s even 50s and today the quality of politician

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:36.160
[Amit Varma]: is what it is and my theory about that was that was an economic theory which is that

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.680
[Amit Varma]: it boils down to incentives that the great freedom fighters all the people you named

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.840
[Amit Varma]: you know there was no power at the end of the line for them so they weren't lusting

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.760
[Amit Varma]: for power they were animated by higher principles and that calling attracted the kind of people

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.560
[Amit Varma]: who were animated by higher principles and that's why you got all the people that you

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.760
[Amit Varma]: did your Nehru, your Ambedkar, your Sarojini Naidu and so on and today it's you know people

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.240
[Amit Varma]: are not attracted to politics for that reason for higher principles they are attracted for

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.160
[Amit Varma]: the lust for power and money and so on but I think that the reason that you know if I

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.560
[Amit Varma]: were to add a second reason to that I think what you just said is a great reason that

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.040
[Amit Varma]: in an earlier generation you had the scope for quiet reflection even if you didn't have

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:28.560
[Amit Varma]: all the libraries of the world sort of available to you and it strikes me that today to be

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:35.680
[Amit Varma]: able to reflect in that way it has to be an act of will where an individual says I want

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.440
[Amit Varma]: to put my smartphone away I want to put the laptop away I want to sit and reflect earlier

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.960
[Amit Varma]: it was almost default that you reflect a lot of the time because what else is there to

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.320
[Amit Varma]: do but now we are just going from sensation to sensation picking picking up our smartphones

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.440
[Amit Varma]: 20 times an hour you know chasing the dopamine hit of the latest notification or Facebook

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:00.600
[Amit Varma]: like and for most people therefore you are just you're just kind of trapped in this what

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.760
[Amit Varma]: are your sort of thoughts on this have you found yourself fighting it yourself like I

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.120
[Amit Varma]: have you know have you found yourself fighting it yourself and is this something therefore

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.600
[Amit Varma]: that you would lament like I think we would both agree that it's almost miraculous and

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.880
[Amit Varma]: magical that so much knowledge is available to us at the click of a mouse but this is

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.240
[Guest]: a downside so what are your sort of thoughts I'm very of nostalgia I think we all are because

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:33.960
[Guest]: we tend to put an Instagram filter on the past to some extent but when I look back at

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:41.780
[Guest]: my childhood the kind of childhoods that many of us had it seems impossibly idyllic because

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:48.480
[Guest]: it was uncluttered I think there was extraordinary privilege for me not just in terms of caste

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.000
[Guest]: majority religion coming from a reasonably affluent background but there was extraordinary

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.740
[Guest]: privilege for me in the incredible luck of being born into a family where books art music

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.960
[Guest]: and all of that were prized they were not coveted they were not collected they were

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.600
[Guest]: just seen as these wondrous things that made your everyday duty-bound ritualistic life

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:21.800
[Guest]: that much more not just enjoyable but it you know reaching for whatever it was that you

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.480
[Guest]: were reaching for a ballet performance in Delhi, Spik Mckay concerts, your own culture

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.680
[Guest]: in Bengali whatever it was it was understood that this added a layer of deep meaning to

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.480
[Guest]: life and I think I was very fortunate to grow up in two households one in Calcutta one in

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.120
[Guest]: Delhi where we were surrounded with books because people would rather collect them than

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:51.760
[Guest]: refurbish the furniture I took that for granted but let me describe what a Delhi childhood

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.920
[Guest]: was like at that time this was in a key part of the 1970s and mothers used to by and large

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.520
[Guest]: it was a time when women were just starting to work outside the home so unfortunately

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.320
[Guest]: most of these were mothers and mothers used to turn their children out of the house after

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:16.080
[Guest]: school like puppies you know to play in open spaces and used to roam fearlessly through

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.360
[Guest]: many of your neighborhoods and this went across class by the way this was true for small

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.960
[Guest]: mohalla neighborhoods in model town and this was true for government colonies like Chanakya

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.840
[Guest]: Puri where I grew up or Lodhi colony or whatever there'd be somebody sitting out on a chaat

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.000
[Guest]: by somewhere and you'd wander around in and out of each other's houses and so the part

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.520
[Guest]: of it that was not bookish was balanced by a tremendous activity you know I climbed trees

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.240
[Guest]: I fell out of them I climbed roofs I fell off them this this is by the way something

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.560
[Guest]: of a running theme in my life and I think we thought nothing of running around a space

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:01.440
[Guest]: that would have been easily 10 kilometers square you know we knew every quadrangle we

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.880
[Guest]: dreamed of secret passages in Palam airfield which was nearby we knew which parts had jackals

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.640
[Guest]: and were to be avoided and which parts were actually a little more friendly and there

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.560
[Guest]: was a sugarcane stand in that field that we all avoided because the Cobras used to live

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.320
[Guest]: there and we avoided it without fear you know the natural world the bookish world the outdoors

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.000
[Guest]: world they all flowed into and through each other even when television came in which would

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.520
[Guest]: have been roughly the end of the 70s early 80s programs were screened in the evening

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:43.880
[Guest]: and they were mind-numbingly boring to begin with yeah absolutely you know the old the

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.640
[Guest]: golden age of television was a little further down the line when Buniyad and Humlog and

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:57.200
[Guest]: all that good stuff happened so we lived a very active life not a passive life how do

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.040
[Guest]: I struggle with this all the time I still find it difficult to avoid the stickiness

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.760
[Guest]: of Twitter but I think I've grown better at just putting the phone off the phone is the

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.400
[Guest]: biggest thing you know that anxiety of I'll miss out if I don't see a message right now

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.400
[Guest]: and you have to train yourself to moving into it's fine it's fine to respond to something

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.680
[Guest]: even three days later nothing is that urgent really you know except for okay editorial

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.880
[Guest]: deadlines or something of the sort but even that you can train yourself to just check

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.000
[Guest]: in with the phone once or twice a day and that opens up space for you to check in on

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.960
[Guest]: everything else you know otherwise we spend I think what we're pushing back against is

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:47.480
[Guest]: something that was also not true of the early web you know you're enough of an 80s 90s I

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.360
[Guest]: mean I think I just touched on what a childhood in the 1970s was like an Indian childhood

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.200
[Guest]: was never fully idyllic but you know things like the emergency which happened when I was

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:05.040
[Guest]: very very young 97 98 suddenly it seemed to you that the walls were speaking in admonitory

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:11.680
[Guest]: tones or because children pick up hypocrisy very fast there were these bright breezy songs

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.440
[Guest]: you know which means remove the garbage and somewhere in there an uneasy prickle which

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.520
[Guest]: told you even as a child that something else was supposed to be cleaned up and removed

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.960
[Guest]: and you weren't very comfortable with what that something was you didn't know that it

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:35.320
[Guest]: was people and their homes that were being removed I was born in 1971 so somewhere you

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:41.280
[Guest]: know we always valorize our own births and I think in my memory my birth goes hand in

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.440
[Guest]: hand with the story of the Bangladesh war a time when Mrs. Gandhi was probably at the

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.400
[Guest]: height of her popularity seen as this strong and immensely capable leader and it's something

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.600
[Guest]: of a lesson to us that just five years later she took India into its first not last experiment

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.720
[Guest]: with authoritarianism but as a child you know what you're processing all of this in as this

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:15.160
[Guest]: duality of immense security which lasted right up to the Billa Ranga murder of those two

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:21.560
[Guest]: the brother and sister Geeta and Sanjay and we so used now in a huge megalopolis which

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:27.240
[Guest]: is what Delhi has become and Bombay has become that we forget what a shock something like

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.640
[Guest]: that sends out you know the ripples of sadness and shared grief and collective mourning that

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:40.560
[Guest]: happens when a city is a smaller more intimate space in the 1970s Delhi was still a collection

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:48.720
[Guest]: of villages held together by a substrate of government colonies and you know vague optimism

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:55.640
[Guest]: again in memory it's important to just keep looking back and looking back further because

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:02.720
[Guest]: nostalgia is always cut through with its opposite right so 1947 which was India's independence

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.760
[Guest]: was remembered by the generation after that in story and in memory it was a living memory

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.960
[Guest]: but so was partition you know and early on I think one thing we learned about living

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.040
[Guest]: in this country we knew that because of the years of the British Empire the rule of the

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.440
[Guest]: British Empire we knew that we didn't live in the first world we lived in the third world

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.440
[Guest]: we knew that empirically speaking we lived in a very poor country that was struggling

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:36.920
[Guest]: to fill its treasuries again and I think for my generation some of the respect for the

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.440
[Guest]: leaders we had right after independence comes from that space it's not so much what we think

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:50.880
[Guest]: of today you know worship of a particular political party or allegiance the tribal thing

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.220
[Guest]: it is more a genuine respect and wonder for the fact that India bucked what everybody

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.680
[Guest]: expected of the country foreign correspondents expected India to fall apart in five years

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.160
[Guest]: and then 10 years and 15 years and you know it seemed every decade that somebody was ringing

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:15.480
[Guest]: the doom in the 1980s again Indira Gandhi's assassination the trouble in Punjab all of

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.000
[Guest]: that the riots in Delhi everything is something that you live through you know you feel it

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.120
[Guest]: on your skin and through that what happens is that books become a way of understanding

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.280
[Guest]: the far past recent history and also a comfort and a refuge I know I've traveled very far

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.720
[Guest]: from where we expect it to be but you know maybe we keep circling back to this whole

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.600
[Guest]: thing of reading and I just want to take a moment to say something that surprised me

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:50.660
[Guest]: when I studied as in not studied but just read about the freedom struggle was how many

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:58.320
[Guest]: of our leaders from Maulana Azad to Ramanohar Lohia to the ones we've just named set a great

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:05.080
[Guest]: store by reading and building their own libraries and once I sat down for a column I was writing

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.640
[Guest]: for the business standard which is the first place that opened its doors to me and gave

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:16.520
[Guest]: me the space to be a columnist at the then you know ridiculously young age of 22-23 they

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:23.760
[Guest]: really made me into a journalist but one of the columns I did for them was about the libraries

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: of the leaders of the national movement and you start going through those books you know

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.920
[Guest]: 3,000 of them 4,000 of them Gandhi's collection Nehru's collection and you start to see that

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:44.080
[Guest]: they use books to really read their way into the whole question of what is freedom and

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.880
[Guest]: what is our independent country going to be and it's so fascinating that they reached

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:56.640
[Guest]: all the way across you know Gandhi read American early vegetarians for inspiration along with

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.280
[Guest]: stories about the Europe reformation and all of that and then they circled back to their

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.160
[Guest]: own country their own language and come up with an extremely particular very Indian approach

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.600
[Guest]: to democracy none of that is accidental you know I don't think there was a point of time

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.160
[Guest]: at which they valorized reading in their own minds or they said this is a good thing to

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.800
[Guest]: do or was self-conscious about it it's just that I find it so touching that the two things

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: that they did all through the years of the freedom struggle from the 1900s onwards they

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.320
[Guest]: wrote letters furiously you know our sense of the past really has to change we think

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.360
[Guest]: that we so cool with our Twitter updates and our blog posts and everything but if you start

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:48.240
[Guest]: to look at those gigantic volumes of correspondence you realize that even on his silent days Gandhi

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:54.240
[Guest]: spent so much time you know composing these swift emails these notes to himself he spent

00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.760
[Guest]: a life in writing Saroji Naidu moving between the poems and the speeches where her auditory

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.000
[Guest]: which today seems to us to be a little flowery and a little overblown for that time though

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.720
[Guest]: it was deep with emotion you know and she could hold audiences in the palm of her hand

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:21.180
[Guest]: as such and you see that the before they were leaders who were they you know this is a question

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.240
[Guest]: I keep going back to with everything before we were authors before we identified ourselves

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:34.040
[Guest]: as whatever what was it that we were moving towards and you see those early whispers of

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:40.080
[Guest]: self-respect of challenging the history that you've been given and saying that no you know

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.380
[Guest]: the British did not make us a whole and a collective and a people the land and the history

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:52.280
[Guest]: of the land does not fully make us Indians because we did not think of ourselves as Indians

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:59.040
[Guest]: before that but here we are at this moment in time and we can literally imagine ourselves

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.920
[Guest]: into being I think it's remarkable that the Constitution which is a written document after

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.840
[Guest]: all you know everywhere after a while when I saw the freedom struggle slightly differently

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.680
[Guest]: I started to see it as a thing that was held together not just by protests as important

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:23.960
[Guest]: as they were and by actions but by breath and speech and writing and imagining you really

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:30.080
[Guest]: have to imagine a country into being you know that's the other side of being a nation okay

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.200
[Guest]: I've gotten my soapbox long enough I need to shut up and give you a chance to. Lots

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.320
[Amit Varma]: to think about like Joan Didion once said I don't know what I think until I write it

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.040
[Amit Varma]: down and when you speak of you know all the letters these people wrote and a lot of it

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.360
[Amit Varma]: is online like the hundred volumes of Gandhi's collected writings online and they're just

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.040
[Amit Varma]: fascinating one little collection that I especially love is his correspondence with Tagore where

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.400
[Amit Varma]: they're writing to each other all the time disagreeing but so full of love for each other

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.920
[Guest]: you know so different from the discourse today and Amit have we lost that I don't don't mean

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:09.000
[Guest]: you to lose the thread but just in parenthesis have we lost that the ability to disagree

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.320
[Guest]: over even a long period of time even passionately but to disagree without hating each other

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.880
[Guest]: without putting each other down and coming back to what you said continuing that ability

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.440
[Amit Varma]: to listen anyway I'm just putting that I'll come back to that but my short answer is yes

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.160
[Amit Varma]: but I'll come back to that and we'll explore it and let me let me you know you can disagree

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.280
[Amit Varma]: with me and we'll still be friends but yeah but my thread was that and this is again something

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.160
[Amit Varma]: I spoke of I think with Amitabh Kumar in my episode with him and with again our mutual

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.320
[Amit Varma]: friend Chandrahas Chaudhary though that's not released yet but the thought actually

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:49.280
[Amit Varma]: came to me when Chandrahas once wrote me an email I sent him an email into inviting him

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.520
[Amit Varma]: to the show and he sent me this long charming reply which was like a letter of yore you

00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:00.280
[Amit Varma]: know when you'd sit down and you'd write three-page letters two-page letters you know with memories

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.560
[Amit Varma]: and you remember we were in Pune and we had samosa at that place and all of that so such

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.680
[Amit Varma]: a rich letter and that got me to thinking about correspondence that when I was younger

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.600
[Amit Varma]: before the internet I would also write letters you know I have also written letters to my

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.120
[Amit Varma]: parents talking about you know talking at length about anything at all but talking at

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.680
[Amit Varma]: length which is the whole point and this goes back to the question I asked earlier about

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.800
[Amit Varma]: how form can shape the content can shape the person because when you are writing a letter

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.920
[Amit Varma]: you are giving yourself in to a certain kind of reflection to a certain kind of thought

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: today we are an age where everything is a two-line email or it's an you know you're

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.840
[Amit Varma]: sending an emoji by whatsapp and everything is crisp and everything is instrumental and

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.120
[Amit Varma]: it's very rare that we are doing that kind of considered communication with each other

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.400
[Amit Varma]: and the act of writing a letter to someone is not just an act of sitting and having to

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.280
[Amit Varma]: flesh out your thoughts again going back to Diddy and I don't know what I think until

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.200
[Amit Varma]: I write it down so the act of fleshing out your thoughts and therefore discovering what

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.240
[Amit Varma]: you think in a sense and discovering yourself but it is also the act of giving respect to

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.600
[Amit Varma]: another person you know giving that time that you're sitting down and you're writing a letter

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:22.120
[Amit Varma]: to someone and that means that person is important and today you don't have that even as a signaling

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.200
[Amit Varma]: device of someone's importance you don't have that but more than that you no longer have

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:33.320
[Amit Varma]: that space to kind of sit down and reflect everything is so short instrumental crisp

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.760
[Amit Varma]: and it's great that we can just reach out to each other you know anytime we want and

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:45.440
[Amit Varma]: all of that but do you know just with not being nostalgic for a particular form of writing

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:52.240
[Amit Varma]: but just in terms of the larger meta question of does it then change us as a society because

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.920
[Amit Varma]: the form has changed because we no longer have those moments of quiet and reflection

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.640
[Amit Varma]: and because we are no longer making those kinds of mental efforts and because the rhythms

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.280
[Amit Varma]: of our life are much more much choppier and much quicker I see where you're going with

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:14.960
[Guest]: this and it's not just the time to sit down and think and reflect because you can write

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.920
[Guest]: letters at high speed as well but it's more like the kind of speed that's expected in

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:27.920
[Guest]: Twitter exchanges you have to address something now and in that moment of a controversy exploding

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.640
[Guest]: the urgency is sharp and immediate but by tomorrow everyone's forgotten so one of the

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.720
[Guest]: biggest problems we have is that we live in a state of perpetual amnesia right and when

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:47.600
[Guest]: you have that as an affliction for society you are no longer in touch with your own psyche

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:55.200
[Guest]: your own self right with letters I'm going to answer this a little discursively but I

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.840
[Guest]: still have letters that I wrote to my school friends years ago and sometimes those contain

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.600
[Guest]: years and years of correspondence and then you can mark the moment when emails arrived

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.960
[Guest]: because suddenly the letters stop our first emails this was when you had stuff like Hotmail

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.400
[Guest]: and Lycos around yeah our first emails for the first few years are really long we're

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.760
[Guest]: trying to go back to letters in a sense because that's what we are familiar with and I noticed

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:32.960
[Guest]: this years later when I was printing out my Lycos mailbox before dispatching that account

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:39.560
[Guest]: unconsciously we were all from India writing to inland letter form length you know if I

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.560
[Guest]: don't know whether this generation would remember that but unconsciously your mind was trained

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:50.720
[Guest]: to three landscapes you were trained to write the postcard you were trained to write inland

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.440
[Guest]: letter forms and you were trained to write the free-flowing letter for which you would

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:03.160
[Guest]: buy onion skin paper you know and you'd dwell on your envelopes and it was very important

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:09.400
[Guest]: also to go to the post office and say sir sir if Gandhiji ki stamp mat dena doosra stamp

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.600
[Guest]: dena Asia at Games ki stamp hai aapke paas you know you wanted the stamps to be as fancy

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:20.480
[Guest]: as the letters were we used to covet the bird stamps and all of that so there were so many

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:27.120
[Guest]: parts to the letter it wasn't just writing it it was wait for the ink to dry tear up

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.120
[Guest]: this draft because you have said too much from your heart you know to a boyfriend or

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.920
[Guest]: something of the sort and put it back in and then put it into the envelope put the stamp

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.880
[Guest]: down then all the secret little hearts and flowers that the women used to write to each

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.920
[Guest]: other you know so all of that Tehzeeb all of that ritual and everything goes away at

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:53.840
[Guest]: some point we find ways to bring it back but I remember some years ago when my friend Margaret

00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:01.040
[Guest]: Mascarinehurst who was an incredible writer and poet in Goa when she died it was a sad

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.520
[Guest]: thing to have only whatsapp messages to archive you know because we met in person the whatsapp

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.800
[Guest]: messages became they served a different purpose then they became like little pointers whatsapp

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.920
[Guest]: to each other about this on this day and then suddenly a memory of a conversation would

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: open up but they really know more than memorial aids you know thumbnails they don't have the

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
[Guest]: satisfaction that accompanies letter writing but right now if you ask this generation take

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.960
[Guest]: some time out you might get people to do one letter who is going to sit down and do the

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:44.200
[Guest]: full chain you know that business of you set aside some time every week to write letters

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:51.080
[Guest]: you go on holiday and you write a letter that also indicates a certain faith in we've been

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.800
[Guest]: talking about speed and the amnesia and the other part of it let us bespeak a kind of

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:04.720
[Guest]: permanence and a faith in the record so somewhere unconsciously as our handwriting has gone

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.760
[Guest]: I think we've also it's I wouldn't call it a cause but I would say it's gone hand in

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:17.560
[Guest]: hand with this very modern lack of faith in the historical record you see what I mean

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.120
[Guest]: when everything is impermanent and everything dissolves and everything can be killed once

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:29.060
[Guest]: a particular social media platform shuts down you can use lose years and years of photographs

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:34.280
[Guest]: and notes if Facebook goes tomorrow or you can lose 40,000 tweets written over 10 years

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:41.240
[Guest]: if Twitter goes tomorrow and somehow increasingly these interactions I'm still on Twitter because

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:48.920
[Guest]: that hook is there you know what is that hook it's partly the fear of missing out it's partly

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.080
[Guest]: and this is the nice side of it the desire to keep in touch with people who are there

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.480
[Guest]: but partly and this is the dangerous side of it we all think we immune and we are not

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.920
[Guest]: it doesn't matter how smart you are but social media the way it is formulated in present

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:11.000
[Guest]: days is built to be sticky we know that you know I can spend five minutes on Twitter fine

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.200
[Guest]: if I spend half an hour on Twitter my days gone and after a while my moods my emotions

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:23.440
[Guest]: those very intimate personal things have changed instead if you train yourself to back away

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.640
[Guest]: and to use it then you lose what we had when we first found Twitter if you remember Twitter

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.120
[Guest]: was all about finding a new way of expressing yourself and that's also what the first-generation

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:43.160
[Guest]: web was about Hussein Deirakshan who's the Iranian blogger who went through an incredible

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.440
[Guest]: and very saddening experience he was held in jail for many years and when he came out

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.160
[Guest]: among the many dislocations he faced was a real sense that the world itself had changed

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.680
[Guest]: because the net as he knew it the World Wide Web had changed beyond recognition and he

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.680
[Guest]: was one of the first people to write about the fact that when you had blogs they created

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:11.160
[Guest]: a universe of islands that were linked but you weren't you weren't content does that

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:16.640
[Guest]: make sense that makes a lot of sense yeah and today I think when everything is being

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.720
[Guest]: massaged into content and brands and all of that and I'm absolutely not averse to the

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.120
[Guest]: pursuit of success through writing all the things all I want to say is that there are

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:32.920
[Guest]: deeper satisfactions you know writing just isn't just about having a best-selling book

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:40.600
[Guest]: out there or having the great career or whatever if you really want to write a lot of writers

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.600
[Guest]: started off telling stories or being part of the weave of having stories told to them

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:52.320
[Guest]: in my case it was my mother who became a lawyer at the age of 39 but before that you know

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.640
[Guest]: she used to do these incredible bedtime stories where she'd look at whatever the pattern was

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.200
[Guest]: on our curtains or whatever shadows there were on the wall and make up things about

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.920
[Guest]: that and you don't even realize you don't use the formal words my imagination is being

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:13.760
[Guest]: trained but what you learn is double at this point you learn that you are absolutely free

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.080
[Guest]: to use your imagination in whichever way you want to and you also learn that even adults

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.880
[Guest]: you know even parents even these people who have so much power over you have wonderful

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:29.580
[Guest]: secret lives so right from the start what you start to learn is the importance of having

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.880
[Guest]: this private self this individual self and if I may say so this whinely creative self

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.200
[Guest]: I live in fear that creativity will become another one of those buzzwords you know but

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.560
[Guest]: the truth is I think something we've been talking about for years and years among ourselves

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:52.640
[Guest]: or whatever is with privilege without privilege how do you live lives that are more fully

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.960
[Guest]: creative and I don't mean just formally creative I don't mean that you have to be a writer

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.240
[Guest]: in the sense that you have to publish books so you have to be an artist in the sense of

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.800
[Guest]: you have to have a painting exhibition I'm not talking about the outcome or the productivity

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.640
[Guest]: but I'm saying a life of consumption which is what we increasingly have been driven towards

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.200
[Guest]: consumption not just in terms of buying things that you then show off but in terms of your

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: most intimate moments are held out for display or that your identity is as a clever consumer

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.160
[Guest]: of life right if you shift that paradigm just a little bit and I mean by the way you really

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.160
[Amit Varma]: have to stop me when I start going down segways or whatever I love these segways and I will

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.360
[Guest]: never stop you I think right from the start I've been asking myself even from early childhood

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:54.440
[Guest]: what does it mean to be truly creative because to me that is the life that humans derive

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.480
[Guest]: the most not even pleasure not even benefit from but that's where we are at our best we

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:06.000
[Amit Varma]: are creative animals no and and what you were saying earlier about you know letters in history

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.480
[Amit Varma]: the connection reminds me of this Agha Shahid Ali quote which you've quoted in your book

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.000
[Amit Varma]: as well my memory gets in the way of your history and that sort of feels so apt and

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.720
[Amit Varma]: again what you you know the point you made about Twitter is you know that for five minutes

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.280
[Amit Varma]: is okay for half an hour it destroys your day and that's literally what it does because

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.240
[Amit Varma]: it changes the rhythm of your brain because the rhythm of your brain is doing hop skip

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.960
[Amit Varma]: step jump duck duck duck duck is going like that instead of being in a quieter place so

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.920
[Amit Varma]: you might want to you know do two hours of focused work on whatever it is but if you

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.040
[Amit Varma]: put your brain in that quick rhythm where you're skipping from one thing to the other

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.280
[Amit Varma]: then it becomes difficult you know it's probably better to begin the day by meditation or something

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.400
[Amit Varma]: but except that I don't do meditation I do Twitter which is a problem my next question

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.600
[Amit Varma]: is about a subject that you know I spoke about with my guest last week and I've been thinking

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.960
[Amit Varma]: about it a lot and it relates to a few things that you've said today I read this wonderful

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:10.160
[Amit Varma]: book called wanting by Luke Burgess and you know Burgess is sort of a disciple and intellectual

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:17.600
[Amit Varma]: disciple of René Girard the philosopher and Girard was once a few decades ago asked he's

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.280
[Amit Varma]: a philosopher but he was asked to teach a course on literature and he needed the money

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.800
[Amit Varma]: so he said okay I'll do it and he read through whatever he thought was a reading list and

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.520
[Amit Varma]: the books he wanted to talk about and he discovered that the one thing he they all had in common

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.080
[Amit Varma]: and he was probably being simplistic here I'm not sure I agree but it's still a profound

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:42.260
[Amit Varma]: point he felt that the one thing all the characters had in common was that they wanted something

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:48.240
[Amit Varma]: not because they intrinsically wanted that thing but because somebody else wanted it

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.280
[Amit Varma]: and he coined the term mimetic desire mimetic of course you know coming from imitation the

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:59.520
[Amit Varma]: idea being that you want something not because it's intrinsic to you but somebody else wants

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.520
[Amit Varma]: it and you know it could be a yuppie wanting to buy the latest Mercedes or it could be

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.120
[Amit Varma]: a young person wanting to get married and settle down because hey that's what everyone

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:12.680
[Amit Varma]: does and that's what is expected so you're like I want that too but you don't ever examine

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.680
[Amit Varma]: it or think about it deeply and the framework that I got from Burgess's book which I find

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:25.520
[Amit Varma]: really useful is of thick and thin desires where thick desires are intrinsic to you you

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.520
[Amit Varma]: know they are deep they are what you really desire they come from within you right and

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.040
[Amit Varma]: when we talk of thick and thin obviously it's understood that all the creature necessities

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.080
[Amit Varma]: like you know food shelter all that is not in this everybody wants that that's okay that's

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.960
[Amit Varma]: understood but otherwise you have thick desires for the things that you really really want

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.080
[Amit Varma]: and you have thin desires which are things that you want because of different factors

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.160
[Amit Varma]: in the environment maybe somebody else wants it maybe it'll get you the approval of others

00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:02.200
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth and the problem is that thin desires can often be intense so the thing

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.280
[Amit Varma]: that you want the most right now you know is probably not the thing that you really

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.720
[Amit Varma]: want the most that comes from inside you may want it very badly for example the quest for

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.440
[Amit Varma]: validation which can lead so many people to do the things they do on Twitter we'll talk

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.680
[Amit Varma]: about that also and so on or when you speak about writers you know you spoke about how

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.520
[Amit Varma]: some writers are you know more in love with the idea of being writers I want to get something

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.800
[Amit Varma]: published I want to be nominated for an award rather than loving the act of writing itself

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.880
[Amit Varma]: which is on the printed page and I imagine loving the act of writing itself you know

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.080
[Amit Varma]: would be a thick desire because it can only really come from within where you enjoy what

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.480
[Amit Varma]: you're creating and the stories that you're telling whereas wanting to be a writer could

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:54.880
[Amit Varma]: be a sort of a thin desire and this is caused me to sort of reflect on why do I want the

00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:00.560
[Amit Varma]: things that I want you know what are my thick and thin desires in a sense and I'd encourage

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:08.120
[Amit Varma]: all listeners to also kind of think about this in their own context but in your context

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:15.440
[Amit Varma]: then looking back what would you say would be your thick desires and what would you say

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.200
[Amit Varma]: would be the things that you wanted but now you feel bad that you wanted them that you

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:27.040
[Amit Varma]: should not have wanted those kind of directions you went down on I think I love the way you

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:34.760
[Guest]: come at questions because you're asking us by and large during the podcast to tap into

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.800
[Guest]: something that is deeper than just the automatic list of the 10 books that influenced you or

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:46.880
[Guest]: what made you want to be a writer or whatever and I think my deepest desires were for a

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:54.200
[Guest]: combination of privacy and experience and immersion particularly into the world of stories

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.960
[Guest]: one of the thick desires that I didn't act on for many years because I was terrified

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:04.520
[Guest]: of actually making it happen was that was writing I came to writing very late I don't

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.680
[Guest]: mean that I came to writing late actually I've been writing for a living from the time

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:14.200
[Guest]: I was about 19 or 20 I think I wrote my first book review when I was 15 years old or something

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:21.040
[Guest]: of the sort obnoxious in that sense we Bengalis what can I say but I was working at the business

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:30.600
[Guest]: standard by the time I was 19 years old 1920 yeah and I was with them for about 15 years

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:36.840
[Guest]: or so I didn't really know how to want a career a lot of people asked me for advice on their

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:44.480
[Guest]: writing career and I am blank about that I knew that I was curious about many many things

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:51.480
[Guest]: I think my one of my deepest desires was just to both experience the world in every form

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.680
[Guest]: so I was a travel writer I was a food writer for a while I was on the gender beat with

00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:04.080
[Guest]: the New York Times and I see that as just an urge to in this human lifetime in this

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.640
[Guest]: human form reach out for as much of the world as possible that was far more important to

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.280
[Guest]: me than material wealth status and all of that which in just as well I chose writing

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.680
[Guest]: as a profession in that sense I will say in parenthesis that while writing hasn't made

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:27.080
[Guest]: me you know ridiculously wealthy it's surprising that it doesn't make you that poor either

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.600
[Guest]: it's it's possible to make a living doing something that you love which is one of the

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:42.160
[Guest]: first things that we believe is not true you know a thick desire again just solitary exploration

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:48.200
[Guest]: as a young girl in Delhi I think I'm militated against the fact that at a certain hour of

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:55.560
[Guest]: the evening the city becomes a men's city and you can't walk safely as a woman and I

00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:01.720
[Guest]: was very diffident but also insistent that I should walk everywhere that I should you

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:07.040
[Guest]: only see a city or know a city really whether it's London or Delhi or Calcutta or Bombay

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.320
[Guest]: it's only on foot that you really get the pulse of it the beat of it the sense of it

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:17.840
[Guest]: outside of your own neighborhoods right and there you have it you know a question I think

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:26.480
[Guest]: for me being in movement creating not for a prize and not for a book contract but just

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.600
[Guest]: the work ultimately it keeps coming back in the writing to me and the page I like people

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.480
[Guest]: to be able to read through whatever I'm writing very swiftly but I also like the work that

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:43.200
[Guest]: goes into making that read a swift read I like them to walk away whether I'm writing

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.480
[Guest]: about cats or humans with the feeling that they have been in a real world and a world

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:54.040
[Guest]: that is maybe a little more intense and more real than the world that surrounds you again

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.520
[Guest]: I have a habit of segwaying and traveling very far from the question that you asked

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:05.320
[Guest]: but I was very fortunate when I was in my 20s in my first job again at the Business

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:11.760
[Guest]: Standard and then later as a young editor at Penguin to meet a lot of writers and artists

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.160
[Guest]: in Delhi at a time before success had in that sense touched and transformed both the art

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:25.840
[Guest]: world and the literary world so MF Hussain at that point of time had his own right painting

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:34.040
[Guest]: studio he was already becoming the big financial success that he was but for most other painters

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.840
[Guest]: there wasn't that much money on the table per se that didn't lead to a life of great

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.200
[Guest]: purity it just meant that there was a freedom in the way that they were writing there were

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.040
[Guest]: a handful of galleries that were exhibiting their work and so it was for writers you know

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.960
[Guest]: for Amitav Ghosh sitting in a Barsati in defense colony writing his first books and shaving

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:01.680
[Guest]: off half his hair as incentive to keep him indoors writing and not outdoors distracted

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:08.480
[Guest]: or for Shahid Agha Shahid Ali you know coming out with his poems in which he puts pain and

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:15.240
[Guest]: love and a sense of foreboding because I think Shahid was one of those people who saw many

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:21.600
[Guest]: many years ago the future to which Kashmir was inexorably moving I don't think he had

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.400
[Guest]: any defenses against the truth but with all of these writers I spent a lot of my time

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.600
[Guest]: in writer student studios you know in Gari village with meeting ceramic artists like

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:39.120
[Guest]: Joy Michael and Gina Franklin Gupta and a huge suite of people and every now and then

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.320
[Guest]: business standard would push me out and make me interview fashion designers which is how

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.000
[Guest]: I came to accidentally dance in Milan Soman's direction while I was still wearing a khadi

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.800
[Guest]: kurta from Khadi Gramodiyag Bhavan. Is this on tape? Have you danced? Thank God! No! What

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:04.920
[Guest]: was this? It was a fashion show it was an early fashion show where Rohit Bal was just

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.920
[Guest]: and Tarun Tehriani were just about breaking through and there was so much snobbery and

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.320
[Guest]: deadly you know the initial reaction to this generation of fashion geniuses from Rohit

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:23.120
[Guest]: Bal and Tarun Tehriani to Reena Dhaka and the rest was Hai unke beta toh darzi ban gaya

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:29.560
[Guest]: you know that boy has gone and become a tailor and then of course liberalization happened

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:35.120
[Guest]: India hit the stratosphere but this was just a little before that he took the first few

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:41.080
[Guest]: fashion shows with the proper catwalk and a ramp and stuff and I was sent off to cover

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.080
[Guest]: this and I bought a dress specifically for this I remember this because at that time

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:52.720
[Guest]: Delhi didn't have much in the way of places where you could buy fancy clothes and I went

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.520
[Guest]: off and bought a dress which in retrospect was a horror I remember very little about

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.520
[Guest]: it except that I'm sure there were frills involved and puff sleeves or padded sleeves

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:10.440
[Guest]: padded sleeves yeah the 80s power woman padded sleeve which had lasted into the early 90s

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:16.560
[Guest]: let's draw a merciful vein over this memory but I wasn't able to get back home from the

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.960
[Guest]: office in time so I went off to this fashion show in what I was wearing which happened

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:27.280
[Guest]: to be a khadi kurta which is not what you wear to a fashion show then or now but you

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:33.080
[Guest]: know bless them they were very warm and inviting and suddenly the music starts up and I'm on

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.040
[Guest]: the catwalk I mean I was at the side of the catwalk but the catwalk was basically a red

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:43.720
[Guest]: carpet on the ground and the music was contagious that was a less formal time and all of us

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:49.640
[Guest]: started dancing and I turn around and there's this sweet guy with a lot of muscles who's

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:55.480
[Guest]: quite good-looking and he dances a little bit in my direction I'm like okay you know

00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.600
[Guest]: he's a good dancer yeah he has the beat whatever and then I asked somebody who's he and they

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:08.040
[Guest]: say Minin Soman yeah he's a supermodel already at that time one little brush with fame Delhi

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:14.000
[Guest]: in that time was a lot of fun though but it was fun also because it was informal it was

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.800
[Guest]: the kind of place where the writer Alan Sene used to play guitar at this little place called

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:26.440
[Guest]: The Cellar which was one of the two or three places that you could go to for entertainment

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:32.760
[Guest]: the first discos had started up Gungroo and my kind of place and I guess we led this kind

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.680
[Guest]: of double life you know we were not most of us didn't have much pocket money you didn't

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:45.040
[Guest]: have the chance to really work at jobs and stuff but if you could afford the entrance

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:50.480
[Guest]: fee for Gungroo then you could dance the night away discos didn't shut down till about six

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:56.700
[Guest]: in the morning if ever you know so you'd finish that and go to the clarages and everybody

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:01.920
[Guest]: there'd be about eight people sitting there ordering one pot of coffee and bless their

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.480
[Guest]: hearts they let us do that they were kind about that but getting back to the writers

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:12.320
[Guest]: and the artists in their studio I think the three things I learned from them is the work

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.160
[Guest]: itself is often messy and the opposite of joyful and you will be cursing as you do your

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:23.720
[Guest]: first drafts or your early sketches or whatever but there is a joy to the work itself does

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:31.800
[Guest]: that make sense everybody and some of the writers were drunks by their second profession

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:37.640
[Guest]: you know a lot of the artists were happening into a range of other vices and pursuits and

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.680
[Guest]: parties and this that and the other but the one thing that they all did was they showed

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:49.080
[Guest]: up if you were serious about being a writer or an artist you owed it to yourself and to

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:55.800
[Guest]: the work more than anything else not to the craft you know not to your vocation or reputation

00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:01.160
[Guest]: or yes sir but to the work itself to just show up day after day and the third thing

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:05.760
[Guest]: was take some joy in what you're making you know don't try to write like somebody else

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:12.020
[Guest]: Vikram Seth didn't get to write a suitable boy by trying to imitate a Steinbeck or somebody

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:19.600
[Guest]: else if you see what I mean Arundhati Roy didn't find her voice by trying to be somebody

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.560
[Guest]: other than she was I think that was the biggest thing that I started to pick up as well tell

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:31.680
[Guest]: your own stories that generation was not focused on success very much the next generation has

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:37.360
[Guest]: learned how to negotiate the world of celebrity television and what to do on a lit fest stage

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:44.160
[Guest]: and all of that and I think when all of that is fun it's sometimes the part of lit fest

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.120
[Guest]: that is great is really getting to meet readers for me and the other part of it it's wise

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:55.760
[Guest]: to think of it as dress up you know you get to play dress up and go out but maybe not

00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.160
[Guest]: take it too seriously I think over the course of a lifetime I've also seen how a lot of

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:07.040
[Guest]: writers can stop writing after having done some great work this one whom I don't want

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.520
[Guest]: to name but you know whose books have got weaker and weaker as their public life has

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.480
[Guest]: become more and more important and you sense at some point that the writer lives in the

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:24.320
[Guest]: shadow of the books and that the public appearances this whole thing about speaking in public

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.520
[Guest]: and being important and even the good stuff of supporting this cause or that cause the

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:37.440
[Guest]: truth of it is that most of writing doesn't even happen on the page it happens in a pact

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.760
[Guest]: of silence and unless you give the I think this is something we've been moving towards

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:48.600
[Guest]: from the start of the conversation it's a question of where do you find rich ground

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:55.400
[Guest]: and it is true that many of us come to these places from a lot of privilege but I will

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:02.080
[Guest]: also say that wealth and comfort are not the pathways to writing I mean just a simple observation

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.920
[Guest]: that many people have made before me if that was true then the rich would be writers right

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.840
[Guest]: and the rich aren't really and the reason that they aren't is because actually writing

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:19.080
[Guest]: actually creating something and then having the patience to go back and revise we all

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.760
[Guest]: fall in love with the first things that tumble out of our mouths and all of that the fact

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.080
[Guest]: is that most bits of writing are not much good unless there's some revision or some

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.960
[Guest]: craft to it and I find that either the craft comes in before a lot of people do the outlining

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.640
[Guest]: and the plotting and all of that even if they're just holding it in their magnificent heads

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:48.720
[Guest]: or it comes in after but it's very rare for writing not to have craft even at the popular

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.560
[Guest]: end of the scale and popular is not to be sneered at but someone like Stephen King someone

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.640
[Guest]: like Daniel Steele someone like Chetan Bhagat they work really hard at the craft of getting

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:08.360
[Guest]: people to continue to read and identify and feel something you see what I mean all these

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.640
[Guest]: years anyway I should again hand it back to you because I'm about to deliver a lecture

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640
[Amit Varma]: on a craft.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.080
[Amit Varma]: It's also fascinating there are so many strands I want to kind of pull at till they unravel

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.320
[Amit Varma]: completely and the padded shoulder dissolves can you elaborate a bit on what you said about

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.720
[Amit Varma]: most of writing not happening on the page?

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.680
[Guest]: I think so much happens particularly with a novel but this is true also of short stories

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:39.800
[Guest]: and possibly every form of writing except for the poem poems can happen to you as you

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.840
[Guest]: know a lot of poets report the experience of feeling the poem more or less take you

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.720
[Guest]: by your collar and just run through you and all you have to do is to write it down and

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.880
[Guest]: then continue to revise or whatever.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:00.280
[Guest]: In every other form of writing inspiration is important essential all of that but if

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.240
[Guest]: you've been working in the field of writing whether you're doing screenplays or whatever

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.600
[Guest]: you know actually that idea generation is the least of it.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:15.000
[Guest]: In between books I struggle for a while because I have no lack of ideas it's the opposite

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.640
[Guest]: I have an idea a minute you know there's exercise books filled with ideas for short stories

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:28.960
[Guest]: ranging from the risible to the hmm this might work but you only have so much time right

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:35.960
[Guest]: and the imagination is the thing that we tend to skip over when we are talking about writing

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:41.560
[Guest]: a lot of discussions particularly American influence discussions go immediately to craft

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:48.160
[Guest]: to style to plot to voice all of that those are not unimportant but I think you know what

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:56.120
[Guest]: you're doing with your course as well is training people to the idea of the practice itself

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.280
[Guest]: and what is that practice it's just a way of turning on the headlights of the imagination

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:09.920
[Guest]: and turning on the terrain and that old classic question where do ideas come from Neil Gaiman

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.160
[Guest]: used to say there's a little shop down the road and you know a man across the counter

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.360
[Guest]: hands me my ideas every morning in a nice paper bag or something to that extent the

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:26.840
[Guest]: truth is we don't know we don't know Elizabeth Gilbert again the author of Eat Pray Love

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:33.760
[Guest]: she's talked about the surreal but very real and very commonplace experience of having

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:40.440
[Guest]: an idea for a book that you haven't worked on and you let it go and four years later

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:47.040
[Guest]: somebody else comes up with that book in total and the first time it happens it's eerie it's

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.840
[Guest]: not plagiarism but it feels like a theft from your unconscious until you realize that you're

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.320
[Guest]: in spooky territory out here you are part of the collective unconscious of course there's

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.200
[Guest]: a possibility that maybe the idea wasn't that precious after all some years back when I

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.880
[Guest]: was just about starting out on the notes that became Black River and I knew I wanted to

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:15.000
[Guest]: do a thriller I knew I wanted it set in Delhi I knew that it wasn't going to be about people

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.760
[Guest]: like me and so it would require some research I knew that the river played a large part

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:27.600
[Guest]: in it and I knew that it was about heartbreak and grief and I knew nothing else and this

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.120
[Guest]: idea skated around my head why don't you write about Sheherazade instead you know bring her

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:38.240
[Guest]: into our contemporary times and what would she be now with the weight of everything that

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:44.760
[Guest]: she's experienced and gone through she becomes this man's bride after seeing so many women

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:50.360
[Guest]: killed you know literally a bed of blood and then she ends up married to this murderer

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.520
[Guest]: you know for the rest of her life she wins her life back but the price of that seems

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.160
[Guest]: pretty high maybe she's a drug addict and I never wrote that story because the truth

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.760
[Guest]: of it is that Sheherazade's I do believe that we should be free to write with no limits

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:11.680
[Guest]: on the imagination but I bump up against the difficulty of translating Sheherazade into

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:17.360
[Guest]: my times there's just too much about her background her Middle Eastern life that I would not know

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:24.120
[Guest]: or be comfortable with I tabled it many years later I read a book by another writer and

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:31.200
[Guest]: beautifully done book where there's Sheherazade in modern times and she's an addict of sorts

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.920
[Guest]: and I don't think anyone's stealing from anyone else it's just that that realm is mysterious

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.960
[Guest]: but it's accessible to all if you train yourself and if you train the muscles of the imagination

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.480
[Guest]: which are as real if you like as the muscles of a runner yeah so that's part of what happens

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:57.320
[Guest]: off the page is learning to quieten down because nothing happens in the noise even the writers

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:04.600
[Guest]: who go out you know in the middle of the hurdy-burdy of life the bars of Paris the slums of Bombay

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.000
[Guest]: the permit rooms and all of that at some point you're gonna have to come back to quietness

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.720
[Guest]: that's where it all starts that's the fertile ground at least you're gonna have to quiet

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.840
[Guest]: down enough to hear the voices of the people that you're writing about right and then comes

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:25.360
[Guest]: the shaping you know that can happen off the page in a very technical sense as in you might

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.200
[Guest]: be doing your notes and outlines and all the crafty things that you do but I think some

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.440
[Guest]: of that really happens when you're living in the classic two worlds you're not you're

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.200
[Guest]: walking around you're talking to your partner and your friends you're going shopping and

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.480
[Guest]: all of that but part of you really at that point of time truly is living somewhere else

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.720
[Guest]: you know that's one reason why I find short stories which I don't know how to write but

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.000
[Guest]: which I'm trying to learn how to write a little easier because you can't quite pop in and

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.040
[Guest]: out it's just as intense but you don't have to spend years in that world right when I

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.600
[Guest]: say most of the writing happens off the page there's another thing as well which is simply

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.640
[Guest]: that everything you were before you turn to writing is also what you're bringing to the

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:23.160
[Guest]: table right a lot of people want to be writers really young and I find myself not wanting

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:29.840
[Guest]: to be discouraging but just wanting to say would you like to go and live a little you

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:36.960
[Guest]: know don't the MFA by itself is a fine thing but try not to build a life maybe that's MFA

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:45.560
[Guest]: and writing residencies and those slightly enclosed worlds if that makes sense that makes

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.640
[Amit Varma]: a lot of sense and that's and that's something I found about myself when I was young also

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.280
[Amit Varma]: that I wanted to write but I didn't have enough lived experience to be able to write meaningfully

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.840
[Amit Varma]: about anything and then you went off and became a poker Marvin and all of that and then I

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.400
[Amit Varma]: came back and now I have the lived experience but I don't have the discipline perhaps you

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:10.280
[Amit Varma]: know it's ironic one of the one of the four webinars for my writing courses about process

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.760
[Amit Varma]: and discipline and all of that and I feel so embarrassed because I'm just all of them

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.400
[Amit Varma]: must be all my participants must be staggering as I listen to this but that I myself haven't

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:25.640
[Amit Varma]: been able to put so much of that into practice though I place a certain stress on it because

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.560
[Amit Varma]: partly because I know that that is the important thing that you actually have to you know sit

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.400
[Amit Varma]: down and get the writing done and build those processes because ideas like you said are

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.600
[Amit Varma]: just a dime a dozen but you know learning how to tell the stories and telling them and

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.240
[Amit Varma]: that kind of also matters you know another thread from what you mentioned earlier and

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.320
[Amit Varma]: that I want to kind of tug at I don't this is not a good metaphor not tugging at threads

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:58.120
[Amit Varma]: is something that you've sort of written in your book again about when you were young

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.600
[Amit Varma]: about the thrill of discovery where when you're describing yourself as a kid you are always

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.400
[Amit Varma]: going up to strangers apparently jumping on their knees and demanding that they tell you

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:15.080
[Amit Varma]: a story and this gets very irritating after the point but then you write quote I must

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.800
[Amit Varma]: have been three when I realized that books contain stories the way tins contain biscuits

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.160
[Amit Varma]: and from the time that I made that connection my mind was not at peace so much of childhood

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.800
[Amit Varma]: is a balancing act between the first indelible rush of astonishment and discovery and the

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.560
[Amit Varma]: inevitable grappling with frustration when he was three my young nephew named the shiny

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:39.320
[Amit Varma]: thing in the sky a star using the word importantly and I could see the satisfaction in his eyes

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.380
[Amit Varma]: the glory of naming everything in the world for the very first time ever as though no

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:48.040
[Amit Varma]: human being had done this before him and no one would do this again those first thrills

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.600
[Amit Varma]: of discovery are fierce and unforgettable stop quote and and of course your first discovery

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.360
[Amit Varma]: of frustration was that you couldn't reach out and read these books and all that and

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.040
[Amit Varma]: you've described so beautifully about how you first kind of read and you open pull this

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.200
[Amit Varma]: book down you opened it and the letters were black ants and then suddenly some of those

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.320
[Amit Varma]: black ants made sense to you and the first words that you remember reading therefore

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:21.440
[Amit Varma]: are quote slowly silently now the moon walks the night in her tender shoes it was magic

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.720
[Guest]: it was magic it I think some of us never forget that first moment of magic you know when you

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:32.960
[Guest]: make the connection and whatever the thing is for some people it's cricket for some people

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.040
[Guest]: it's music you know picking up their first guitar we're sitting here in a space surrounded

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:44.600
[Guest]: by guitars and for me it was right it was not writing it was just understanding that

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:52.000
[Guest]: all of that bewildering you know hieroglyphics the things that didn't make sense were things

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.640
[Guest]: that are deeply deeply coveted and I love that so much that I famously ate a page of

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.640
[Amit Varma]: the book you ate which is why your book is called the girl who ate books because you

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.880
[Amit Varma]: thought to yourself if this reads so nice how well would it taste but it didn't taste

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:12.880
[Amit Varma]: that great but it was very satisfying so my question from here is there's a sort of twofold

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.560
[Amit Varma]: question and one of them is this that you have this introduction therefore into the

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.520
[Amit Varma]: world of the imagination and storytelling and that's incredibly important like reading

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.720
[Amit Varma]: is I take reading so seriously because we have our one life to live but when through

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.040
[Amit Varma]: books you can live the lives of so many others you know through by getting inside the heads

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.840
[Amit Varma]: and sort of experiencing everything that they do and and some people read and some people

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.680
[Amit Varma]: don't like I'd written a column a political column but it was about reading a few years

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:50.640
[Amit Varma]: back based on a story that a friend of Narendra Modi told me about him and her story really

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.360
[Amit Varma]: was that she used to work with him in the auties in Gujarat and she was at a gathering

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.980
[Amit Varma]: at his house a gathering of friends a personal gathering seven or eight people and at one

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: point Mr. Modi started telling this story about how his mother had fever one day and

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.400
[Amit Varma]: she was ill and she was feeling very very hot and he went to turn on the fan and there

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:15.680
[Amit Varma]: was no electricity and as he told the story he started crying right and my friend's point

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:23.320
[Amit Varma]: was that Modi is an experiential leader in the sense that he understands the world only

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:30.340
[Amit Varma]: through experience so therefore he has felt viscerally what electricity can mean so when

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:35.000
[Amit Varma]: he is chief minister of Gujarat he's saying power to every village and he genuinely means

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.360
[Amit Varma]: it or he has walked on roads and he understands the importance so he says build roads right

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.040
[Amit Varma]: but there are some things that you cannot experience like the lives of others or like

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.080
[Amit Varma]: maybe counterintuitive economic concepts like spontaneous order the positive sumness of

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.740
[Amit Varma]: things and so on and so forth and when you're running a country and you cannot experience

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.440
[Amit Varma]: you know all this knowledge is close to you it becomes an issue now the thing is he was

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.760
[Amit Varma]: not born to privilege so it is understandable that he wasn't a reader and that he didn't

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:12.160
[Amit Varma]: have you know books around him and all that but what one would then expect is that either

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.020
[Amit Varma]: you you know begin reading whenever you can because you know you you form your picture

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.080
[Amit Varma]: of the world by joining dots where do you get those dots it's mainly from reading honestly

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.280
[Amit Varma]: so that's the importance of reading and even if that was not the case then rely on experts

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:34.440
[Amit Varma]: who can cover the areas that you don't know so one I felt that reading is incredibly important

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:40.540
[Amit Varma]: for this reason and those who shut themselves off to it are hobbling themselves and crippling

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:45.240
[Amit Varma]: themselves in a way you know they are not allowing the best version of themselves to

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.160
[Amit Varma]: ever arise in fact they're guaranteeing that a very suboptimal version of themselves is

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.520
[Amit Varma]: who they will be all their lives and the other dimension across which this runs is goes back

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:03.600
[Amit Varma]: to that question of thick desires and thin desires that the reason you know you and I

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.160
[Amit Varma]: have the thick desires that we do is partly to do with because we have read so much because

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.720
[Amit Varma]: our interior lives are richer for that but they have all these layers to them and a lot

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.920
[Amit Varma]: of it comes from reading or a life of the imagination and so on and many people in this

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:25.200
[Amit Varma]: desperately poor country and most of it is still desperately poor don't have that privilege

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.480
[Amit Varma]: that they can read books or they have access to books and all of that and they are shut

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:36.400
[Amit Varma]: off from this and I wonder how that affects you know those things like what people even

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.120
[Amit Varma]: want what people even desire and all of that so I am rambling a little bit but just thinking

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.880
[Amit Varma]: aloud about reading because if I say that you know it sounds extremely snobbish and

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.640
[Amit Varma]: elitist to say that readers are a particular kind of people and non-readers are other kind

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.200
[Amit Varma]: of people and you know but is this something that you think about that you and I have had

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.800
[Amit Varma]: the good fortune to have been readers to whatever extent we have I've read much less than you

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:08.520
[Amit Varma]: of course but a lot of people don't read and this has implications not just for those people

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.640
[Amit Varma]: themselves but also for our society for our culture for our democracy for everything okay

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:21.960
[Guest]: I'm going to I think we're getting to the core of what a reading life or a non-reading

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:28.600
[Guest]: life is about so I'm going to deal with this in sections one is the points you raised about

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:34.320
[Guest]: Mr. Modi I'm not at all sure by the way that he's not a reader he certainly is a writer

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:42.920
[Guest]: and he's written poems for a very long period of time he's articulate and I think I remember

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.320
[Guest]: from his time as Gujarat CM along with the rest of his legacy and the history of the

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:55.360
[Guest]: riots and the engineering of those riots but one of the things that happened in the aftermath

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:02.920
[Guest]: of the Gujarat riots when his rehabilitation was in progress was people saying but you

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:08.640
[Guest]: know he does read he does he reads reports he reads this that and the other what we're

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.440
[Guest]: speaking about here is something slightly different which is the mistaking of deep emotion

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:23.200
[Guest]: for empathy just because a leader any leader can feel with intensity and truthfulness perhaps

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:29.240
[Guest]: on a certain subject to feel very deeply about the plight of one section of people does not

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:37.360
[Guest]: mean that he or she has the empathy to extend their imagination towards the goodwill and

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.520
[Guest]: the well-being of everybody else in the country particularly people who are not like them

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:49.400
[Guest]: or people who identified as the other the enemy the necessary you know person community

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:56.240
[Guest]: against whom you pit a certain thing we don't teach political empathy and though we talk

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:03.120
[Guest]: a lot about be kind be caring one of the reasons why writers like George Saunders or why Barack

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:09.720
[Guest]: Obama to a certain extent in his American presidency prize something like reaching out

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:15.720
[Guest]: and compassion is because all of these skills they interconnected and not the same compassion

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:23.240
[Guest]: empathy kindness these are not easy things to practice particularly in leadership the

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:30.080
[Guest]: second thing that you've touched on again with regard to Mr. Modi why doesn't he then

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:37.360
[Guest]: pull in people who do read and who are experts on the economy or areas where the Indian project

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.680
[Guest]: has palpably run into trouble if you had experts on demonetization for example you could have

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.200
[Amit Varma]: spared the country a great deal of pain if you did consult experts and they told him

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.680
[Guest]: not to do it Raghuram Rajan famously yeah but then you know that intolerance of an opinion

01:18:53.680 --> 01:19:00.840
[Guest]: that comes from people who are not exactly like you or have not had your background in

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.960
[Guest]: the RSS that's that's a parallel problem that is a political issue let's get back to reading

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:12.840
[Guest]: per se I think often the claims that we make for reading a very very large because we see

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:19.120
[Guest]: the value of it okay but as a lifelong reader I've sometimes asked myself aside from the

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.600
[Guest]: sheer delight of it what use is this per se everything that you say about reading I'm

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:33.040
[Guest]: just being devil's advocate out here you can learn as much from YouTube videos okay or

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.200
[Guest]: you can learn from podcasts you don't have to be a reader in order to learn skills okay

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:44.720
[Guest]: what we found in books is to be honest about it deep and abiding delight and we've also

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:51.880
[Guest]: found an infinitude you know of possibilities you know how many books I wrote a column about

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.360
[Guest]: this for the FT which is how I know these figures I'm not just you know making them

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.560
[Guest]: up but the maximum number of books that most readers are going to be able to read in a

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:08.760
[Guest]: lifetime is 5,000 and that's if they are obsessive readers who read more than about 80 books

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.200
[Guest]: a year and I remember when I came across that number I had a moment of pure panic that I

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:19.680
[Guest]: never feel this about humans I never feel like how is how am I going to go through life

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.760
[Guest]: not making all the friends I possibly could make you know but I do feel it about books

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.920
[Guest]: that hunger and what I prize about books particularly is that they're one of the clearest not the

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:38.120
[Guest]: only but they're one of the clearest windows we have to connecting with past minds everything

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.120
[Guest]: else that you can learn from whether we just mentioned you know YouTube videos podcasts

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:51.800
[Guest]: sound basically and film all of that is in by and large in the present you see so reading

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:57.840
[Guest]: is the one thing that is so out of time music is one of the others dance is one of the others

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.800
[Guest]: art yes but as an instrument for learning reading is out of time and reading challenges

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:12.400
[Guest]: you perpetually because it keeps inviting you to inhabit other points of view not just

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.880
[Guest]: listen to you know as important as that listening is it doesn't always come with identification

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.600
[Guest]: when you're reading a book particularly a physical book I have nothing against reading

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:29.880
[Guest]: audiobooks but there is a caveat to that if you're reading in a distracted space you're

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.520
[Guest]: not going to be able to retain that much of the book and with an audiobook or with the

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.800
[Guest]: Kindle your reading experience is often incredibly enjoyable but there's a spatial problem a

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.880
[Guest]: geographical problem if you like I find that with reading on the Kindle or in audiobooks

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.960
[Guest]: I never know where I am in the book does that make sense where is the physical book you

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.760
[Guest]: was moving through it and you can tell whether you're at the beginning the middle or the

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:03.680
[Guest]: end and that has an impact on the way you remember certain things from the book I do

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:11.320
[Guest]: think that we overestimate the virtue of reading and maybe underestimate the fact that most

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:18.120
[Guest]: of us are readers because it is sheer delight sometimes challenging sometimes unpleasant

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:27.200
[Guest]: I just spent some time reading memoirs by a woman Shabitri Devi who was part of the

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:33.920
[Guest]: right wing had a book blurb by Savarkar and believed firmly not just in the virtue of

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.920
[Guest]: the Nazis but she believed that Hitler was alive that Jews and other people should be

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.640
[Guest]: put to the sword you know and there was something cold-blooded about reading that and I think

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:52.040
[Guest]: for a while after that I found myself you know as with Mein Kampf unable to read for

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:58.320
[Guest]: a short while actually read for a short while because you're encountering thoughts of pure

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.320
[Guest]: evil and inhumanity let's put it that way that's on label it as evil as such the thing

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:11.740
[Guest]: that you asked about the inequality in reading in this country we've always had public libraries

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:16.600
[Guest]: but not on a grand scale not like America what we've had is the one-room library you

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:22.120
[Guest]: know that's how my father who grew up in the town of Cuttack in Orissa he and his brothers

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:29.240
[Guest]: had a book hunger ignited in them in part by the fact that there were very few bookshops

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:36.960
[Guest]: and that their access to books was so limited in a way as an adult I found that you know

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.160
[Guest]: though my mother's family was surrounded by books growing up in Calcutta and all of that

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:46.120
[Guest]: it was my father who bought books to the point where he sometimes you know drove my mother

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.600
[Guest]: mad by taking the grocery money and coming back instead of with dal and rice and stuff

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:57.480
[Guest]: like that he'd come back with figs and chocolates and time-life encyclopedias and a host of

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.440
[Guest]: you know everything from Shoru Chandru to Tolkien to Toni Morrison to Garcia Marquez

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:09.200
[Guest]: in fact a lot of my reading habits were influenced by him because he didn't believe in denying

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.600
[Guest]: any of his children access to books you know he believed that if you picked up a book it

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.320
[Guest]: was up to you to decide whether it was at your level or not and that was one of the

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:26.280
[Guest]: biggest freedoms that reading gave me there was no censorship to reading you see in everything

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.120
[Guest]: else particularly when you live in a country like India which has been working towards

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:39.280
[Guest]: defining itself as a democracy but has never been as radically individualistic a society

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:45.520
[Guest]: as America or parts of Europe and never defined itself by the freedoms of the individuals

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.600
[Guest]: you know even if in its most politically free periods I don't think the freedom of the individual

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.360
[Guest]: has been books are one space where you can be whatever you know you can reach for whatever

01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.720
[Guest]: you can be challenged outraged disgusted you can hate what you're reading you can love

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:07.720
[Guest]: with your reading you can identify with it or not but it is a completely free space instead

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:14.800
[Guest]: of that what we had was first the radio revolution then we had TV and then we had you know today's

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.760
[Guest]: social media revolution which is to some extent also engineered for heat or for very very

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:29.560
[Guest]: intense short compelling stories of a certain kind right what we didn't invest in as a country

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.280
[Guest]: was the infrastructure that people take for granted elsewhere the infrastructure of libraries

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.560
[Guest]: and bookshops and all of that you know and without that investment it's not just being

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:48.320
[Guest]: able to afford books I grew up in Calcutta in part and it was very democratic city where

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.480
[Guest]: reading was concerned it wasn't a question of whether people could afford books they

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.720
[Guest]: made space in their budgets at practically every level except for the most abjectly poor

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:05.120
[Guest]: if you were had any kind of income you would be buying books and magazines and you know

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.080
[Guest]: they were cheap and you had an equality a kind of democracy as a reader you could be

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:18.240
[Guest]: a guy on a bus sitting there reading you know Murasaki in translation and you could be sitting

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:23.600
[Guest]: in your fancy Baliganj a red brick bungalow reading Murasaki and there'd be no difference

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:30.200
[Guest]: between the two of you you know you both had an equally valid opinion does that make sense

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:36.120
[Guest]: so I've often felt that we've not responded adequately to the book hunger of this country

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:43.120
[Guest]: and that part of that is this emphasis not by you but in a lot of ways you know people

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: train people to read useful things even if you're not reading textbooks but what you

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.800
[Guest]: read should be informative in some way or educational or make you money right and if

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.960
[Guest]: there's a reading revolution I'd like to usher in in this country it's not just the whole

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:06.000
[Guest]: thing of more bookshops and more places to read more bookshops and let me say this I

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.720
[Guest]: believe our booksellers do a wonderful job but I would also like to see bookshops and

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:19.320
[Guest]: libraries that are beautiful and set up in all kinds of parts of the city not just in

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.120
[Guest]: the affluent side of the city not just in malls you know they really should be much

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:31.240
[Guest]: more accessible one place where we feel I'd like to see books in the hands of everybody

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:38.200
[Guest]: because one of the things that I used to do was to work on library recommendations for

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.920
[Guest]: companies that stocked libraries around Gurgaon and you know these were early versions of

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:50.440
[Guest]: the community library that Mirdala Koshi and Michael and others run so well and these to

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:57.280
[Guest]: sponsor specific schools and there was a point where you're stocking the library but you're

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:03.840
[Guest]: also giving out a few of those NBT books you know the little very well-made ones or Pratham's

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.640
[Guest]: books and you're making sure that every child has two or three books and one of the kids

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.280
[Guest]: he was about five six years old you know just about in school he sits there and he just

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.280
[Guest]: cuts off from all of us and he's just sitting there with his book and he's reading it and

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:26.280
[Guest]: he's on each page and slowly but surely he gets to the book and then he reads it again

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:33.600
[Guest]: and then very reluctantly he hands it back to the team member who'd given it to him and

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:40.440
[Guest]: he said no no this is your book you know and he was like okay so he starts reading it again

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:45.120
[Guest]: and then he tries to hand it back and then somebody realized said no this is your book

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:52.080
[Guest]: to keep not just in school but you take it home and he was just very silent for a second

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.320
[Guest]: you know he didn't say anything it was he asked several times do I get to keep this

01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:06.000
[Guest]: after a while I turned around and I see him standing there in the corridor and he's hugging

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:14.920
[Guest]: the book to himself and he was crying because he said no one's ever given him a book before

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:21.240
[Guest]: you know and that was how precious it was and I think from that time onwards I don't

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.200
[Guest]: work in the NGO sector but if there's one thing that you get passionate about it's about

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:32.760
[Guest]: donating books to libraries and I really respect the people who are working at community libraries

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.840
[Guest]: because it's not just about handing the books out and then walking away you have to help

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:45.960
[Guest]: people find the books that they're going to love you know and I think that whole thing

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.960
[Guest]: you know the understanding that there's a dormant book love in the country that often

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.800
[Guest]: doesn't come to light because there's no way to feed that book hunger the question I ask

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.960
[Guest]: is really what are we depriving people of sometimes just casual pleasure you know just

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:08.480
[Guest]: the pleasure of reading Surinder Pathak's spy stories or Ibn-e-Safi's Jasusi Duniya

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.080
[Guest]: stories or something of the sort sometimes it's somebody who might find practical advice

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:19.760
[Guest]: in a book or learn about something that later becomes a career there's so many different

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:26.440
[Guest]: levels at which books work you know and I wish some of the money that's going into the

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:32.160
[Guest]: current horse trading of politicians you know the cross exchanging hands in order to topple

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:37.440
[Guest]: the state governments I wish some of that was just put towards putting a book into people's

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:43.680
[Amit Varma]: hands it would make such a difference that's that's such a lovely story I'll respond to

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.360
[Amit Varma]: three of the or rather I'll respond to what you said with three points and the first one

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:53.880
[Amit Varma]: is like you know at one level of course it's true that you don't need to rely on books

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.360
[Amit Varma]: alone for knowledge you have YouTube videos you have podcasts you have all of that but

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:03.200
[Amit Varma]: there is something books do give you which none of the others do and and again this goes

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.640
[Amit Varma]: to you know books that are not instrumental that if you want to learn something then you

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:13.360
[Amit Varma]: read the book and you get that knowledge from there but I think fiction gives you this deeper

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.440
[Amit Varma]: world of the imagination which I feel that sometimes we can take for granted even in

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:23.880
[Amit Varma]: ourselves it's like the seen and the unseen right it's unseen there is this story of and

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll probably say it wrong but it's a story about daddy fish and baby fish are swimming

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.440
[Amit Varma]: in the water and uncle fish passes by and he asks daddy fish how's the water today and

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.160
[Amit Varma]: daddy fish says great and then uncle fish goes on and then baby fish turns to daddy

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:44.280
[Amit Varma]: fish and asks what's water you know and I think we kind of take it for granted at that

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:48.400
[Amit Varma]: level and and not just that we and I've realized this about myself and I realized that I have

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:55.520
[Amit Varma]: to stop doing this that I assume that if there is a certain bedrock of experiences that have

01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:01.480
[Amit Varma]: shaped me or certain cultural influences that I now take for granted that are like water

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.760
[Amit Varma]: to me I assume that others share it as well but others are not everybody is swimming in

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:12.320
[Amit Varma]: different water you know one of the reasons I like to go into the childhoods of people

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:18.120
[Amit Varma]: of my vintage or earlier in the show so much is that 60 to 70 percent of our country is

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:23.560
[Amit Varma]: born after liberalization you know that shared experience is not there of there being a waiting

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:28.800
[Amit Varma]: list if you want to buy a phone of so few cars on the street as it were and all of those

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:34.920
[Amit Varma]: things you know and I think books give you an entry into all of these worlds and they

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:40.080
[Amit Varma]: are immersive the word you used earlier and that's not something that YouTube videos or

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:47.080
[Amit Varma]: even podcasts such as mine will you know necessarily give people the other point almost a counterpoint

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:54.200
[Amit Varma]: to this that I want to make is that I actually tell people that listening to audio books

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:59.160
[Amit Varma]: is great because I think a mistake people sometimes make is that they think it's an

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:04.040
[Amit Varma]: either or that printed books and audio books compete with each other but as I discussed

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.880
[Amit Varma]: earlier thus the same use cases I mentioned for podcasts they apply for audio books as

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:14.160
[Amit Varma]: well not everyone has a privilege to sit down and take one hour every day when they are

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.640
[Amit Varma]: reading people live busy lives people have other kinds of responsibilities and things

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.540
[Amit Varma]: to look after but there will always be times where they can do passive listening so again

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:28.880
[Amit Varma]: my advice to people who do my course or people who might be listening to this is that even

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.760
[Amit Varma]: if you don't have the time to sit down and read a physical book it's okay to listen because

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.440
[Amit Varma]: you're still getting that world of the imagination you're still listening to those sentences

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.040
[Amit Varma]: and listening to the language and through osmosis a lot of it kind of sort of filters

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.720
[Amit Varma]: down and the third thing I agree with you on and this is something that I sort of make

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:53.240
[Amit Varma]: it a point to drive home again to people who do my course is that when you're reading read

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.760
[Amit Varma]: indiscriminately read everything you know we've built this hierarchies of reading that

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Gabrielle Garcia Marquez is cool Chetan Bhagat is not cool and that just makes me so angry

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.560
[Amit Varma]: because the point is that you know like you said our time in this world is limited in

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.600
[Amit Varma]: terms of what we can read right you mentioned 5,000 books for most of us who are a certain

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.960
[Amit Varma]: age is even less than that you know and you want to spend that time reading things that

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:27.640
[Amit Varma]: you enjoy reading so for me you know my metric for whether I read something is one if I'm

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.800
[Amit Varma]: enjoying it if I'm like there's a thrilling story happening you know Jasusi Duniya or

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:37.280
[Amit Varma]: whatever then that's a great reason to keep reading or if you want a certain kind of knowledge

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.840
[Amit Varma]: in a book but it's hard work but you want the knowledge it'll bring value to your life

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.920
[Amit Varma]: that's a good reason to keep reading but a bad reason to keep reading is because people

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.040
[Amit Varma]: say oh this book is in the canon or is one so and so prize and you have that fear of

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.240
[Amit Varma]: missing out and then you kind of go through that and then the sunk cost fallacy kicks

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.780
[Amit Varma]: in I've already read a hundred pages and all of that so there again I couldn't agree with

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:01.440
[Amit Varma]: you more my advice to everyone would be that do not spend time reading books you don't

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.480
[Amit Varma]: enjoy reading just read anything that you're you know having fun reading or that you feel

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:11.360
[Amit Varma]: adds value to you you know there is no such thing as a guilty pleasure when it comes to

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.960
[Amit Varma]: books and we'll go into a break now after which we'll come back and go take you back

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.960
[Amit Varma]: to your childhood from when you were three years old but before that you mentioned how

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.600
[Amit Varma]: your you know dad used to come back with all kinds of odd things when he was sent shopping

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.160
[Amit Varma]: so before the break I want to read out this lovely paragraph from your book where you

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:34.640
[Amit Varma]: write quote my mother and this is after your father's come back from shopping your mother's

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.920
[Amit Varma]: given him a list he's come back with things and you write quote my mother inspected the

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.640
[Amit Varma]: dining table and found chocolate cake figs and Gabriel Garcia Marquez in paperback but

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.020
[Amit Varma]: where are the dals and the masalas my father would treat the query with surprise surely

01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.680
[Amit Varma]: my mother could see that there were more important things in the world but what are we to have

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.180
[Amit Varma]: for dinner my mother with Harilal nodding in ascent like a Greek chorus of doom would

01:35:56.180 --> 01:36:01.340
[Amit Varma]: ask my father would point out with impeccable logic that he had technically come back with

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.940
[Amit Varma]: food the figs were of good quality and in those days frightfully expensive this was

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:10.320
[Amit Varma]: usually the point where my mother flew into a rage and stormed off to see what what could

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.340
[Amit Varma]: be cobbled together from odds and ends but she was in a minority the rest of us were

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.960
[Amit Varma]: on my father's side especially after I began reading Garcia Marquez the dal could always

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.060
[Amit Varma]: be watered it did no harm to anyone to eat khichdi for a few days but Macondo and for

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.580
[Amit Varma]: me Nadia Diaz and the banana companies and shipwrecked sailors could not wait a stop

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:35.940
[Guest]: good so thank you for that lovely anecdote thank you it's been it's been so strange to

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.060
[Guest]: have your words read back to you and then you realize they're all right they're not

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:45.220
[Guest]: yours anymore they everyone else's and isn't that the beautiful thing about fiction writing

01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:50.340
[Guest]: and reading at some point whatever it is you're doing you're just putting stories out there

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.120
[Guest]: into the world for everyone you know and that's what makes it magic yeah and also what makes

01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:01.300
[Amit Varma]: it magic is it so relatable in different ways where so many people can look at this and

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:05.100
[Amit Varma]: remember their own parents and remember their own childhoods and you know that's what kind

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:09.620
[Amit Varma]: of literature binding us all together so let's take a quick commercial break and on the other

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:19.460
[Amit Varma]: side of the break we'll move on to the toddler Nilanjana okay thanks have you always wanted

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:23.540
[Amit Varma]: to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it well I'd love to help you since April

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:28.820
[Amit Varma]: 2020 I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course the art of clear writing an online community

01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:33.180
[Amit Varma]: has now sprung up of all my past students we have workshops a newsletter to showcase

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.140
[Amit Varma]: a work of students and vibrant community interaction in the course itself through four webinars

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:42.820
[Amit Varma]: spread over four weekends I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:46.700
[Amit Varma]: there are many exercises much interaction a lovely and lively community at the end of

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:51.820
[Amit Varma]: it the course cost rupees 10,000 plus GST or about 150 dollars and is a monthly thing

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:56.860
[Amit Varma]: so if you're interested head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing that's

01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:02.360
[Amit Varma]: indiancut.com slash clear writing being a good writer doesn't require god-given talent

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:07.100
[Amit Varma]: just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:13.700
[Amit Varma]: skills I can help you welcome back to the scene in the unseen I'm chatting with the

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:21.060
[Amit Varma]: remarkable Nilanjana Roy and we are both speaking through sleek and sleek and slinky sleek and

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:28.100
[Amit Varma]: slinky sleek and slinky are excellent microphones over here and you know I was going to go to

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:31.740
[Guest]: your childhood but we'll go to your childhood now I just want to say I feel that if you're

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:37.420
[Guest]: going to spend this much time in close quarters with a mic then you should name it you know

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:42.020
[Guest]: I said that before but it's respectful it's just a nice thing to do it is and it would

01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:46.860
[Amit Varma]: be even more respectful to let the mic name you like sleek and slinky might be having

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.500
[Amit Varma]: some kind of private conversation now and they have perhaps named us already and who

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.300
[Amit Varma]: knows what our names are so you know before we get to your childhood we was just chatting

01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:01.060
[Amit Varma]: in the break and I want to actually sort of continue our break conversation earlier when

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:05.180
[Amit Varma]: we were talking about letters you sort of spoke about how there were these three forms

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.140
[Amit Varma]: these three landscapes where there is an inland letter there is a postcard and then there

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:15.460
[Amit Varma]: is a longer letter and one of the things that has sort of that I've been thinking about

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:21.660
[Amit Varma]: of late when I think about the creator economy for example is that many of the forms in the

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:29.780
[Amit Varma]: different arts are results of physical limitations so for example the printed book the printed

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:34.260
[Amit Varma]: book it's a physical object it can only be so big and it needs to be at least a certain

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:38.180
[Amit Varma]: thickness so therefore you have a ceiling in the floor for how long a novel should be

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:42.180
[Amit Varma]: or how long a book should be you know that you have the convention of the three minute

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:46.780
[Amit Varma]: song coming because the first sort of record that came out at the start of the 19th century

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:50.580
[Amit Varma]: could hold hold three minutes of music then later the first long playing record could

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:55.420
[Amit Varma]: hold 40 minutes of music and that became the convention for the album and you know your

01:39:55.420 --> 01:40:02.420
[Amit Varma]: typical your standard pop song is still kind of supposed to be 30 seconds and as three

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:07.140
[Amit Varma]: minutes rather Spotify now has a 30 second rule where they start paying you after 30

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:12.020
[Amit Varma]: seconds and people are adapting to that in interesting ways and as a creator in the 90s

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.040
[Amit Varma]: we used to think in terms of these forms like for me in the hierarchy of literature or writing

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.940
[Amit Varma]: the book was the ultimate thing to aspire to so you could write columns or you could

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:26.100
[Amit Varma]: write various things and a book was the end thing that you aspire to and a book was like

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:32.100
[Amit Varma]: a hundred thousand words and you an article could be 800 words and so on and so forth

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:36.900
[Amit Varma]: and you had the same tyranny of form again because of physical limitations and so on

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:41.860
[Amit Varma]: coming about in other in the other arts for example cinema you know where you had these

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:46.220
[Amit Varma]: conventions that a Bollywood film could be three hours and a Hollywood film is 90 minutes

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:50.980
[Amit Varma]: and in television you have 23 minutes which basically you add commercials it becomes half

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:58.580
[Amit Varma]: an hour and what has now happened is that those physical limitations have gone no longer

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:04.140
[Amit Varma]: do we have to submit to the tyranny of form and more and more artists are beginning to

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:09.740
[Amit Varma]: break out of this tyranny like in the break I was telling you about how sad I feel that

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:16.260
[Amit Varma]: in the power broker by Cairo you know a full hundred a book length portion on Jane Jacobs

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:20.540
[Amit Varma]: was just cut and Cairo is one of my favorite writers Jane Jacobs is a hero of mine I would

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:24.940
[Amit Varma]: have loved to read that and unfortunately you know if it still exists you know they

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:30.060
[Amit Varma]: should kind of put it back and but because of physical limitations because of conventional

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:35.260
[Amit Varma]: notions by publishers that this is how much a book should be and we can't go beyond it

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:41.540
[Amit Varma]: it unfortunately had to be excised and thankfully we live in times where that's no longer an

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:49.700
[Amit Varma]: issue but I feel that while creators are beginning to adapt to new forms on new platforms the

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:55.980
[Amit Varma]: mainstream or what remains of it still thinks in very conventional ways like on this date

01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:00.820
[Amit Varma]: of recording we're recording this on the 23rd of June you I just looked at your Twitter

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.820
[Amit Varma]: I don't know when you put those tweets out but you have a set of tweets about publishers

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:09.580
[Amit Varma]: following trends and how sort of short-sighted and wrong that is and I couldn't agree with

01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:15.980
[Amit Varma]: you more and I think what the mainstream sort of does is that your mainstream whether it

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.100
[Amit Varma]: is you know a Hollywood studio commissioning films where they say let's go with the franchise

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:25.260
[Amit Varma]: or so and so film has worked let's do five more exactly like it show a distinct lack

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:29.260
[Amit Varma]: of imagination well what is happening in the creator economy is really creators stretching

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:33.860
[Amit Varma]: out trying different things trying whatever the hell they want like five-hour conversations

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.620
[Amit Varma]: on podcasts which the mainstream would never accept I mean I could never have sold this

01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:43.020
[Amit Varma]: as a concept and then whatever works works and things that change are changing so just

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:47.860
[Amit Varma]: in terms of both of these questions the dissipation of the mainstream which has kind of happened

01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:54.180
[Amit Varma]: in media and which will inevitably I think happen in every domain including publishing

01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:00.060
[Amit Varma]: in you know in the future of unknown unknowns so one what do you feel about the dissipation

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:06.180
[Amit Varma]: of the mainstream and two as an artist yourself what do you think about like is this something

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.620
[Amit Varma]: that you've thought about that forms can be so fluid and flexible and you don't need to

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:17.820
[Amit Varma]: think in one particular way or put yourself in a particular box anymore let's get to the

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:25.820
[Guest]: uses of legacy publishing legacy publishing works really well for a variety of forms per

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:32.300
[Guest]: se and it works well because by and large those publishing houses are staffed by people

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.700
[Guest]: who love reading and that's been across the board you know most of the publishers have

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:43.500
[Guest]: met within that universe there's a wide amount of variety by and large what we've seen in

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:50.180
[Guest]: the UK for example is that independent publishers are bolder they're more willing to take risks

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:55.540
[Guest]: they're less dependent on one of the curses of the industry which is that because of the

01:43:55.540 --> 01:44:00.940
[Guest]: way everything is packaged you know sometimes two years in advance and you're aiming your

01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:08.320
[Guest]: content at a series of bloggers or book loving sections you know book media that's going

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.900
[Guest]: to be writing the summer book special of the year whatever you're very dependent on what's

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:20.180
[Guest]: called the strap line which is a condensed form of the blob and it takes some time to

01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:25.660
[Guest]: understand that some publishers are absolute genius because their ability to predict and

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:31.140
[Guest]: know their readers not just the market but their readership and say that this book that

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:37.060
[Guest]: I'm publishing now taking it on massaging it into shape for about two years or so revisions

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:45.340
[Guest]: edits all of that that near incredible instinct that a good editor has for how to take a book

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:50.060
[Guest]: to where it should be even though you only have access to what the authors given you

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:55.140
[Guest]: you know that's an incredible skill doesn't get talked about as much as translation and

01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:02.340
[Guest]: the skills involved out there but legacy publishing keeps pushing things into categories that

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:07.420
[Guest]: benefit the marketing side of books marketing is not a dirty word either none of us writers

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:13.900
[Guest]: would be alive without marketers but that means that things flow into very rigid categories

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:20.780
[Guest]: you know so you belong to fantasy or science fiction or self-help or whatever and I've

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.100
[Guest]: been questioning the use of genre forever because I really don't think that's the way

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:33.140
[Guest]: we read or live honestly you know to me Tolkien years ago or Ursula K. Le Guin she works as

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:39.380
[Guest]: a genre writer and she works as somebody who's got a stunning corpus of ideas recently one

01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:44.220
[Guest]: of my colleagues at the FT Robert Shrimsley picked up on Terry Pratchett and said that

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:49.820
[Guest]: everybody who's an economist should read Pratchett for the way that he talks about ideas like

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:55.460
[Guest]: democracy and cities exploding in certain directions and all of that you know there's

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:02.260
[Guest]: not you could learn from him so it's our thinking that boxes the world into this creators by

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:07.660
[Guest]: instinct have you noticed how many people are gravitating to the newsletter as a kind

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:13.980
[Guest]: of modern form of the blog why is that because there's something in us that craves you know

01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:20.940
[Guest]: the particular the personal out of the cluster of newsletters are coming in a certain percentage

01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:25.980
[Guest]: of creators will fall off when they realize that it's really hard to sustain that some

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:31.460
[Guest]: newsletters I have to say much despite my own love for the form I look at it and I think

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:35.820
[Guest]: I wish they were working in tandem with an editor because this is repetitive or not too

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:42.060
[Guest]: long but you know too familiar the materials may be being a little overworked and a good

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:48.220
[Guest]: editor can make you see stuff that's there but where I itch sometimes to write my own

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:54.500
[Guest]: newsletter and you know that's just one of the many forms that can attract you is in

01:46:54.500 --> 01:47:01.340
[Guest]: the absence of constraint so often when you have to massage a condom into 750 words there

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.180
[Guest]: are gaps that a sensitive reader picks up they know that something has been left unsaid

01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:12.180
[Guest]: okay or sometimes you're doing the opposite I mean I hope I never do that as a columnist

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:17.540
[Guest]: but it used to happen you know back in the day to a lot of other columnists at different

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:23.060
[Guest]: papers you could sense that they were stretching you know that deadline had come up and they

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:30.020
[Guest]: were taking a 350 word insight and pushing that until it filled the full 800 words when

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:35.580
[Guest]: you don't have that constraint that freedom is something that's a extreme challenge and

01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:42.620
[Guest]: requires a huge amount of technical skill actually to manage well but think about it

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:50.380
[Guest]: this way you have a world two kinds of worlds that have been pushing at us for a while saying

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:56.380
[Guest]: listen legacy publishing is not everything that there could be one is the extremely sophisticated

01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:01.700
[Guest]: and layered world of fan fiction most people in the public arena know fan fiction only

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:07.580
[Guest]: as E.L. James you know her book Fifty Shades of Grey came out of that but fan fiction is

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:15.820
[Guest]: where it's a it's an enormous playground and a serious serious place for people who want

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:21.380
[Guest]: to be writers and are not that concerned with marketing they're more into readership rather

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:26.620
[Guest]: than sales let's put it that way and it's very satisfying for them it's also something

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:32.260
[Guest]: that frequently pushes back at whatever mainstream writers even celebrated people even big names

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:40.340
[Guest]: have made you know I mean a long time ago Hogwarts fan fiction or Harry Potter fan fiction

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:47.100
[Guest]: was sitting there and punching very lightly in its own way at the areas where the books

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:53.540
[Guest]: creator couldn't see you see what I mean so they were saying instead of saying in a column

01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:59.340
[Guest]: the portrayal of goblins verges on the racist they were creating their own fanfics where

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:04.180
[Guest]: the goblins were the heroes of the story you know and that is such a beautiful way to make

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:08.940
[Guest]: a criticism by creating something new and original yourself and the other part of it

01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:15.580
[Guest]: has been I'm a little skeptical of the huge marketing passion for this but book talk you

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.240
[Guest]: know where young teens and young adults have started to discover their own books and push

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:25.580
[Guest]: trends it seems to me that after a while book talk is also like a lot of Instagram influencing

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:32.060
[Guest]: becoming conformist and moving away from it slightly anarchic things so to answer your

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:38.060
[Guest]: question a little more succinctly let's say we have an opportunity and the way that the

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:42.220
[Guest]: internet goes the way that the mainstream and the side stream if you want to call it

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:49.140
[Guest]: that goes is first we expand out into this territory of almost limitless possibility

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:54.780
[Guest]: which is what the first wave of the internet was and then at some point we get corral back

01:49:54.780 --> 01:50:00.340
[Guest]: into safety and into a little corporate zones and into the marketability of this that and

01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:05.820
[Guest]: the other but one of the things in the few workshops that I've done one of the things

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:12.540
[Guest]: that I try to tell people who want to be writers for a lifetime is how would you write if you

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:19.220
[Guest]: were not going to make any money from this whatsoever or any fame you know then what

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:25.100
[Guest]: is it that you would do your thick desire your most deepest intense you know the writing

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:29.860
[Guest]: that's going to wake you up and bring you to life and that could be anything I'm genre

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:37.020
[Guest]: indifferent you know I'm not quality indifferent within your genre try at least to learn what

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:43.020
[Guest]: the basic rules are not because rules are rules but because you're striving for a certain

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:49.180
[Guest]: kind of clarity if you want to share a story then don't leave it messy and bristling when

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:55.060
[Guest]: you can do better do the best that you can within that right but I've also learned a

01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:02.800
[Guest]: lot from the Hindi writing tradition for example of just letting a story come to you and setting

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:08.340
[Guest]: it down in that moment a lot of the women writers particularly Hindi and Bengali the

01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:14.840
[Guest]: worlds that I know best outside of English taught themselves to write in very small segments

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:21.940
[Guest]: of time you know so there's no question of we set up and then we think about this and

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:26.660
[Guest]: we do this and that and the other it's like no we get right to it in between cooking this

01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:31.260
[Guest]: in between managing the household in between doing our other work we learn to set down

01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:39.820
[Guest]: four paragraphs and make that sink you know so I think what we are getting to is a very

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:47.300
[Guest]: very old truth the importance of form something I was thinking about market forces you don't

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:51.900
[Guest]: see that many playwrights in India in her generation I can think of basically Ani Zaidi

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:58.180
[Guest]: and maybe one or two others and that's about it I do see can I come in with a small note

01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:04.260
[Guest]: of complaint yeah and I'm exempting really good writers of recent novels they know who

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:10.260
[Guest]: they are I hope you know and some of them have done incredible work from Shivani Sibal

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:19.660
[Guest]: to Dinsey Pereira to you know a host of others but if you're writing to the market then you're

01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:24.940
[Guest]: not just in danger of losing an audience or losing a chance you're in danger of something

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:28.420
[Guest]: much sadder which is that you might never find out the kind of writer that you really

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:36.220
[Guest]: should be right in recent years it seems to me that the the people who made their name

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:42.220
[Guest]: in Indian English fiction were all told at that time there is no money in writing there's

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:48.660
[Guest]: no use being a writer later they became famous you know everyone from Salman Rushdie to Vikram

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:54.620
[Guest]: Seth to Amitav Ghosh the entire universe Kiran Desai etc but at that time they were told

01:52:54.620 --> 01:53:00.100
[Guest]: there is no reward in it and they went ahead and wrote what they wanted to anyway and I

01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:06.500
[Guest]: think there's a huge lesson out there I see a lot of literary fiction coming out first

01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:12.060
[Guest]: phase people are either trying to be Chetan Bhagat and in all these years there's only

01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:18.260
[Guest]: been one person at the top of the mythological fiction category of the popular fiction category

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:22.780
[Guest]: there are very few imitators who really make it you know maybe because they're trying to

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:29.580
[Guest]: imitate too hard Ankur Warriko on the other hand you know who's coming in with very Indian

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:35.020
[Guest]: self-help but something that's new and refreshing then that's saying basically we're going to

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:39.180
[Guest]: turn our back on politics but if you want good habits and a successful life and you

01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:43.980
[Guest]: want to have fun along the way here it is he's got a message a lot of the young Indian

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:52.140
[Guest]: historians you know from Anjan Manotra to Manu to that entire range of Iramukoti etc

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.460
[Guest]: they are on to something because they are following something that they are individually

01:53:55.460 --> 01:54:04.320
[Guest]: passionate about right when you write to the market you lose that edge so coming back to

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.780
[Guest]: your question the field of possibility ahead of us I think we're all sensing that there's

01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:14.600
[Guest]: something out here beyond the mainstream and by the mainstream I'm not saying just legacy

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.420
[Guest]: publishers now I'm seeing also the kind of media I've written for all my life I have

01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:24.940
[Guest]: a great respect for them and their traditions the New York Times Business Standard Financial

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:30.780
[Guest]: Times all the places that I've written for you know the BBC etc they have a history and

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:40.980
[Guest]: a tradition of respect for the process of fact-checking of shaping a story a particular

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:47.900
[Guest]: way and it's wonderful to be part of that repository but I think as an independent creator

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:53.580
[Guest]: if you have the guts and you have the honesty as well right it's one thing to say I want

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:58.460
[Guest]: to write like Arundhati Roy what if you really want to write the Indian equivalent of Regency

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:03.500
[Guest]: romances are you never going to find out you know what if you want to create something

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:10.900
[Guest]: that doesn't exist at this moment you know some kind of a comic book or historical steampunk

01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:15.940
[Guest]: mashup and you're not doing it just because you were trying so hard to be somebody else

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:21.220
[Guest]: or to do what the market rewards you know ultimately it just keeps coming back to this

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:28.300
[Guest]: I know that there is also a practical side to everyone's writing life or writing career

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:34.300
[Guest]: but don't follow the practical side of things to the point where you miss out on the true

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:39.100
[Guest]: joy of being either a writer or a reader something that you were saying just a moment back about

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:44.140
[Guest]: audio books and I was thinking about how I grew bored at some point of time about this

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:50.220
[Guest]: debate between the Kindle and reading books I take the Kindle on my Kindle everywhere

01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:55.420
[Guest]: when I'm traveling because it's the easiest way to take along half a library and I notice

01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:59.620
[Guest]: I read differently on the Kindle you know what I was saying about being out of space

01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:04.620
[Guest]: and time is compensated for by the fact that I love reading poetry on the Kindle there's

01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:10.180
[Guest]: something about that screen and an individual poem that really makes it sing I hate reading

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:16.700
[Guest]: long involved novels in e-book form but that's just me I prefer to read them I either as

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:22.620
[Guest]: printouts or as books but I love the Kindle for short stories and instinctively I seem

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.240
[Guest]: to read a lot more in the way of popular nonfiction on the Kindle so you know that's just another

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:34.220
[Guest]: example of the way a platform has changed me with audio books there's no escaping it

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:42.460
[Guest]: I do notice that I retain less in terms of you know remembering the exact order in which

01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:48.100
[Guest]: arguments have been made in a book if I listen to the audio book version but there is a compensating

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:55.420
[Guest]: factor sometimes the characterization particularly if the narrator of the audio book is good

01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:59.820
[Guest]: I get the characterization better I give up a little bit of my independence as the reader

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:04.900
[Guest]: to imagine the voices and the landscape the way I want to in that sense an audio book

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:10.460
[Guest]: narrator is also you know like a translator a co-creator right and sometimes you can just

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:15.220
[Guest]: settle back into that creation and have it sing to you you see what I mean I think a

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:20.820
[Guest]: lot of people in India do use audio books more practically so you know when you start

01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:27.860
[Guest]: to move into all of this you start to see that where you expected things to be linear

01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:34.620
[Guest]: they aren't all of these forms of storytelling and receiving stories there's no one above

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:41.300
[Guest]: the other there is really a democracy out there in terms of you know if you prefer paper

01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:48.380
[Guest]: books that's fantastic but you know for every I don't want to I do love the smell of paper

01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:55.300
[Guest]: myself but sometimes every so often because I live in Delhi right and it's hot and humid

01:57:55.300 --> 01:58:01.340
[Guest]: simultaneously in summer and the smell of second-hand paper books can bring to mind

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:06.620
[Guest]: a not very clean bathroom I'm not as romantic about the smell of papers other people are

01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:13.300
[Guest]: I just think it changes depending on place and time and stuff like that that was a long

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:24.100
[Guest]: long direct digression but getting serious for a second I think the more we try to write

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:28.620
[Guest]: what already has been written of course when you start off as a writer sometimes you're

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:34.740
[Guest]: imitating the first three things I tried to write came out sounding like the writers I

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:40.660
[Guest]: love the most you know I was trying to write serious social commentary like Mahasweta Debi

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:48.780
[Guest]: the great Bengali writer who spent a lot of her life you know really listening to her

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:54.140
[Guest]: friends who were part of tribal India and coming up with a completely different consciousness

01:58:54.140 --> 01:59:00.100
[Guest]: but she had a fierce political way of writing that is probably not me and I would be wise

01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:07.940
[Guest]: to find my own voice the first novel I wrote which is thankfully dead buried and disappeared

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:16.220
[Guest]: in one of our many house moves was like a terrible terrible mashup between Garcia Marquez

01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:26.300
[Guest]: and you know Nair Masood it was so derivative and all of that and I don't mind actually

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:32.420
[Guest]: confessing that because I think we learn how to write again by imitating and we imitate

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:38.820
[Guest]: who we want to be until we figure out who we are ourselves yeah what writing gives you

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:47.140
[Guest]: is the freedom not just to imagine different things but really to step into very very distinct

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:52.420
[Guest]: worlds and to be different people in your lifetime you're not gonna get that many chances

01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:59.020
[Guest]: unless you're an actor or something of the sort you don't get that many chances to be

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:04.980
[Guest]: completely different from who you are and that's part of the writing that is most thrilling

02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:12.940
[Guest]: to me in terms of possibilities so again coming back to the whole thing of form it's not just

02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:19.140
[Guest]: that you're removing restraints you also unconsciously challenging people instead of you know Twitter

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:26.180
[Guest]: that scroll down thing or Facebook that wall what can you do with the space of a screen

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:30.260
[Guest]: and I've seen so many writers particularly the poets always seem to be the most inventive

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:35.220
[Guest]: of the lot but you know use that suddenly realize that on a screen you've got a left

02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:41.900
[Guest]: field space maybe that's on a page less populated but on a screen you can dance out there you

02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:46.260
[Guest]: can do things out there you can bring in images you can build something around that you can

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:52.260
[Guest]: collage you know there's there's really no limit you can dance with Milan Soman on a

02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:58.820
[Amit Varma]: screen out there a bunch of responses but one I really you know like that question what

02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:03.180
[Amit Varma]: would you write if no one was to read you it sort of reminds me of the quote that character

02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:10.180
[Amit Varma]: is what you do when no one's looking and you know one of the pieces of advice I give creators

02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.260
[Amit Varma]: both those who do my writing course in my podcasting course like I remember the first

02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:18.980
[Amit Varma]: time I taught the taught my podcasting course which I teach about twice a year someone asked

02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:23.500
[Amit Varma]: about you know where are the gaps in the market or what should I aim for or do you have any

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:29.900
[Amit Varma]: suggestions and I was like that is completely the wrong way to think that you know one if

02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:34.900
[Amit Varma]: there are any quote-unquote gaps in the quote-unquote market many others are going to discover it

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:39.780
[Amit Varma]: and go for it but that's the wrong way to think you know if there are like seven billion

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:43.220
[Amit Varma]: people on this planet and there are more than a million podcasts out there the only thing

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:48.100
[Amit Varma]: that makes you unique is you because only you are you so the the most important quality

02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:53.260
[Amit Varma]: for creators who succeed is that they are authentic to themselves and that totally speaks

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:58.380
[Amit Varma]: to your point about don't think about the market quote-unquote or what people may want

02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:03.420
[Amit Varma]: to read or what people may want to listen to or whatever you've just got to figure out

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:09.380
[Amit Varma]: what you want to do and kind of go for that eventually it'll work out and I'll circle

02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:14.900
[Amit Varma]: back to this but first I'll make a point about I'll share a thought about blogs and newsletters

02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:20.660
[Amit Varma]: first of all for all my listeners who may not have been active during the first the

02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:26.180
[Amit Varma]: first internet the early internet as it were there was this around the time I started blogging

02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:30.660
[Amit Varma]: at India Uncut there was also an excellent blog written by someone called Kitab Khana

02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:35.420
[Amit Varma]: written by someone called Hari Babu and there was much mystery over who is this Hari Babu

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:41.580
[Amit Varma]: who is this sort of mysterious person who is writing so well about literature and became

02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:47.740
[Amit Varma]: almost a cult figure and it turned out later that Hari Babu was Nilanjana Roy herself and

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:53.860
[Amit Varma]: and I mean there was another pseudonymous blog Puttu the Cat which was Samit Basu so

02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:57.740
[Amit Varma]: these are the two famous sort of pseudonymous blogs which people really loved reading and

02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:03.260
[Amit Varma]: speculating on and it turned out that he were Hari Babu and what I loved about blogs in

02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:07.940
[Amit Varma]: that time like you mentioned he started freed you from that tyranny of form you didn't have

02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:11.560
[Amit Varma]: to do 800 words you could do 30 words you know and those were the days before micro

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.620
[Amit Varma]: blogging you could just put a link to something with a one sentence comment and that was it

02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:20.700
[Amit Varma]: or you could do a thousand words if you wanted there's simply no limitation you were freed

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:25.180
[Amit Varma]: also from the tyranny of the news cycle for example otherwise if you're proposing an op-ed

02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:31.780
[Amit Varma]: or an opinion piece it has to be something topical and you also kind of put in volume

02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:36.340
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that you wrote a lot like I wrote you know five posts a day on average I did

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:42.460
[Amit Varma]: some 8000 posts in the five years reddit was active and one I wasn't self-conscious because

02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:47.280
[Amit Varma]: my job was in mainstream journalism and for me this was like a release it's just a blog

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.360
[Amit Varma]: who's going to read it so you know that's how you start and then you lose that self-consciousness

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:58.820
[Amit Varma]: and you're just doing what you're doing and it worked for that reason however when people

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.300
[Amit Varma]: ask me today where they should write should they do a blog I always say no I say they

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:07.640
[Amit Varma]: should do a newsletter and the reason is that I think destination websites are pretty much

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:13.780
[Amit Varma]: done very few people are typing out URLs or like indiancut.com or haribabu.com or whatever

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:17.980
[Amit Varma]: it was and actually going to a destination website people are clicking on links on social

02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:22.940
[Amit Varma]: media and so on and so forth and what a newsletter does is that you read an interesting piece

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:30.460
[Amit Varma]: by say Nilanjana Roy you immediately subscribe and instantly you are forever getting you

02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:34.740
[Amit Varma]: know everything that Nilanjana Roy writes right into your inbox there is no effort it

02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:39.780
[Amit Varma]: comes into your inbox you click it it's there and what that means for a creator like you

02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:45.980
[Amit Varma]: is that you are building a community of people who like your writing which earlier you could

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:50.020
[Amit Varma]: not do this is one of the great things about the creator economy like in you write something

02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:55.340
[Amit Varma]: in 1995 in Business Standard or Times of India or Indian Express or wherever someone reads

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:58.780
[Amit Varma]: that piece thinks huh this is nice and then they forget about it a week later and it's

02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:04.460
[Amit Varma]: gone but here you're collecting a community of your fans and what newsletters allow you

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:10.740
[Amit Varma]: to do is a couple of things one is the other great quality you know if authenticity to

02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:16.460
[Amit Varma]: yourself is a fundamental quality for a creator to have a fundamental quality of the relationship

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:23.100
[Amit Varma]: between a creator and the audience is a certain intimacy right which is really underrated

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:28.380
[Amit Varma]: because for example one of the finest compliments I've got for the podcast was someone heard

02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:33.380
[Amit Varma]: my episode with Abhinandan Sekri and said that I felt so much like I'm sitting on a

02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:38.540
[Amit Varma]: sofa listening to two friends talking that at one point I interrupted before realizing

02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:43.340
[Amit Varma]: that what the fuck I'm listening to a podcast right and that intimacy is incredible and

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:47.660
[Amit Varma]: what that intimacy does and that intimacy happens because you're authentic to yourself

02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:51.780
[Amit Varma]: you're not projecting you're not bullshitting you're just who you are and there is that

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.060
[Amit Varma]: intimacy your what you've written has gone directly to someone's inbox or is in their

02:05:56.060 --> 02:06:00.380
[Amit Varma]: ears because they're kind of listening to it and what it does is and I'm thinking aloud

02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:05.300
[Amit Varma]: here so I don't know if I'm coining this or someone has simultaneously done it but I think

02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:10.620
[Amit Varma]: I'd make a difference between thick engagement and thin engagement and what that intimacy

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:16.940
[Amit Varma]: leads to is a kind of thick engagement where you feel intertwined with the concerns or

02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:22.980
[Amit Varma]: the art of the person that you're listening to or reading or whatever and there then the

02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:28.620
[Amit Varma]: absolute numbers don't matter so much like I would I would give far more value to a hundred

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:35.060
[Amit Varma]: thousand listeners for an episode of my podcast than say 20 million views on a YouTube video

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:40.900
[Amit Varma]: because in the YouTube video your average time of you know listening might be 15-20

02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:46.540
[Amit Varma]: seconds your engagement is much lower but here the engagement for the lower number of

02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:53.140
[Amit Varma]: in terms of absolute numbers your engagement there is much deeper these people really really

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:58.660
[Amit Varma]: care and newsletters allow you to build an audience of people who really care about your

02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:05.660
[Amit Varma]: work and the final important point here is and I'll lead to a question on this with you

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:11.140
[Amit Varma]: because it's something that I can't I've been thinking about and don't have an answer to

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:17.900
[Amit Varma]: but the final important point is that a newsletter allows you as a blog did to put in volume

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:22.080
[Amit Varma]: in the sense it allows you to put in a lot of work like the five posts I did during India

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:29.020
[Amit Varma]: uncut during when my blog was active for example and to me this is important because how does

02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:33.540
[Amit Varma]: a creator become good a creator becomes good by doing something again and again and again

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:38.580
[Amit Varma]: and again and again by constant iteration and a danger for creators is if you care too

02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:42.860
[Amit Varma]: much about validation initially your numbers won't be good initially when you do something

02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:46.940
[Amit Varma]: you will suck at it like I sucked at blogging or I sucked at podcasting when I began you

02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:51.100
[Amit Varma]: do it again and again you become better now initially you will never have numbers so if

02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:56.120
[Amit Varma]: you care about validation you will simply not you know you'll stop at some point and

02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:01.420
[Amit Varma]: therefore you won't iterate enough to actually become good at it which is why it's that question

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:06.460
[Amit Varma]: to circle back to it what would you write if no one was reading is incredibly important

02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:10.500
[Amit Varma]: that's what you should write because initially no one will be reading and then because you

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:15.980
[Amit Varma]: write that again and again and again you get good at it and you build that audience organically

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:23.380
[Amit Varma]: and so the value of putting in volume which is a term poker players use get a large sample

02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.280
[Amit Varma]: size play a lot of fans so I don't know if others use this terminology but the value

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:33.080
[Amit Varma]: of putting in volume is that in a sense quantity does lead to quality one you do something

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:38.420
[Amit Varma]: again and again you become better to you grow your audience organically by doing something

02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:44.300
[Amit Varma]: again and again and constant exposure and my question is that where this kind of breaks

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:50.900
[Amit Varma]: down of the context in which I can't figure out how this works is the context of novels

02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:57.300
[Amit Varma]: and literature because a novelist for example will write one book for eight years they're

02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:01.940
[Amit Varma]: not putting in volume they spend eight years they write one book they take a break the

02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:07.220
[Amit Varma]: book goes out in the world and most of the time for most novelists it just disappears

02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:11.220
[Amit Varma]: it's like nothing happened right and then you got to get back to the grind and you're

02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:16.500
[Amit Varma]: not putting in volume in the same sense that you know that a blogger is or a newsletter

02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:23.580
[Amit Varma]: writer is and all of that and this befuddles me a bit because I think if you are a storyteller

02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:28.020
[Amit Varma]: if you are a person of the imagination if you love writing on the one hand you might

02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:33.500
[Amit Varma]: want to write novels because that's the kind of sprawling work you want to do but on the

02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:41.080
[Amit Varma]: other hand it runs into this sort of problem and one question of course is that are there

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:46.260
[Amit Varma]: other things you could simultaneously do with your creative faculties whether you're doing

02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:50.060
[Amit Varma]: a newsletter thing I think Substack is doing something with Salman Rushdie but I haven't

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:55.340
[Amit Varma]: looked at it too closely but it feels a little gimmicky but should artists explore other

02:09:55.340 --> 02:10:01.140
[Amit Varma]: forms like that and kind of work at it because there's a danger also I think for someone

02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:05.820
[Amit Varma]: who's a novelist to think inside a box and think I am a novelist so you think inside

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:11.700
[Amit Varma]: the novel box and you don't go outside it and my final tangential point I was talking

02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:18.220
[Amit Varma]: to someone who works in marketing in the publishing industry just a couple of days ago and the

02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:23.420
[Amit Varma]: point that I made is sort of an idealistic point in one way which is that a good product

02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:29.060
[Amit Varma]: is the best marketing and that's obviously necessary for something to work but also what

02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:34.380
[Amit Varma]: I was trying to point to is that when say a book is released I think there can be the

02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:39.580
[Amit Varma]: tendency to make a marketing plan and say that okay we'll do this on Instagram, we'll

02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:44.140
[Amit Varma]: do this on Twitter, blah blah blah and you make those different, we'll do this on YouTube

02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:47.900
[Amit Varma]: and then you're just ticking boxes and it's kind of automatic and it has zero impact with

02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:52.980
[Amit Varma]: the world because it is shallow and because therefore you have thin engagement to use

02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:59.700
[Amit Varma]: that term again whereas if authors and artists sort of thought of everything they do not

02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:06.140
[Amit Varma]: as marketing but as a kind of content on its own then I think that there is you know that

02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:09.740
[Amit Varma]: will create thinking engagement at whatever level it does so for example if you've written

02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:14.340
[Amit Varma]: a novel and one of your characters is simultaneously writing a newsletter even if it's a minor

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:19.340
[Amit Varma]: character then I think that engagement goes off the charts and even for the creator you

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:28.020
[Amit Varma]: know your juices are churning in different ways so I mean again I have sort of digressed

02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:33.580
[Amit Varma]: a bit and you know but this is sort of a subject I think about a fair bit so what are your

02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:35.220
[Amit Varma]: sort of thoughts on this?

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:39.740
[Guest]: Why do you write, why do you write?

02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:47.940
[Guest]: I think in the 20th and 21st century we probably put more effort into the anxiety behind that

02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:53.660
[Guest]: question what are we writing for, what's the point if 80% of novels fail then why should

02:11:53.660 --> 02:12:01.020
[Guest]: anyone be a novelist at all but I think right from the start of the human history of writing

02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:06.320
[Guest]: and I wish you could see what's in my mind right now because I'm literally you know zooming

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.420
[Guest]: back across the centuries and seeing people fall in love with different forms they falling

02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:17.420
[Guest]: in love with the epic they're falling in love with the Arabian Nights type nested boxes

02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.340
[Amit Varma]: except you're not literally zooming back through the centuries.

02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:28.060
[Guest]: I am literally not literally but the imagination is a powerful thing you know at different

02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:36.260
[Guest]: times they think the fable is it the fable is where the smart money is you know at another

02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:41.860
[Guest]: stage all the cool kids want to be Chaucer or they want to be Kadidas or something of

02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:49.180
[Guest]: the sort right common to all of that is the thread of something so deep and so shallow

02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:55.060
[Guest]: simultaneously why do you want to create you know what is the satisfaction of putting this

02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:58.300
[Guest]: world out there.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:05.640
[Guest]: I've seen novelists at different levels someone like Stephen King is 74 years old almost 75

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:11.580
[Guest]: and has probably written almost as many books as his age you know he's gone well past 70

02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:16.420
[Guest]: and so he puts the myth of you know a novel must take so much time and you must live in

02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:20.020
[Guest]: the side the hulk of this structure to rest.

02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:27.380
[Guest]: I took a lot of time to write The Wildings but that's because I'm very lazy and I got

02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:32.820
[Guest]: distracted by an infinity of things and I spent so much time on the world building I

02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:37.180
[Guest]: didn't need to spend that kind of time but the truth is I loved it you know there's a

02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:44.020
[Guest]: lot of stuff that didn't find its way into the book like I found this old chart where

02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:50.460
[Guest]: I'd done a cat's lifespan and a squirrel's lifespan and a bird's lifespan and tried to

02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:54.780
[Guest]: figure out what their days would feel like to them.

02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:59.380
[Guest]: There was the time that I decided that one had to see the world from the perspective

02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:05.100
[Guest]: of different people and I spent an infinite amount of time not an infinite a finite but

02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:11.040
[Guest]: considerable amount of time trying to figure out the difference between how bats process

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.620
[Guest]: night and birds process night.

02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:17.300
[Guest]: At the end of it the bats have one paragraph in the book or something like that.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:20.620
[Guest]: There's a great essay by Thomas Nagel, what is it like to be a bat?

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:27.900
[Guest]: I read that one as well as part of my research okay but the reason I was doing that much

02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:34.540
[Guest]: research was partly just for the fun of it partly because I really didn't know anything

02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:39.540
[Guest]: about world building at that time and I was giving myself my MFA privately in the whole

02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:45.660
[Guest]: world building thing and the third reason was procrastination as long as I was researching

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:48.700
[Guest]: I didn't have to get down to the book.

02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:53.540
[Guest]: The thing is that novels if you do them right they live for a very very long time.

02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:58.900
[Guest]: Some of the novels that we have have lasted for well over 300 years or so.

02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:03.380
[Guest]: The epics that we have, the myths that we have, the fables that we have are not literally

02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:10.020
[Guest]: but in effect they are timeless, they have been there in our minds and carried from one

02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.460
[Guest]: generation to the other.

02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:15.060
[Guest]: Something you realize, why would you do this?

02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:17.060
[Guest]: Why would you be a novelist?

02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:21.500
[Guest]: When you're actually writing you realize the thing that sounds so twee when you say it

02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:26.420
[Guest]: but it is absolutely I assure you 100% true.

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:32.580
[Guest]: Stories and ideas and storytelling has a peculiar life to it of its own.

02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:37.100
[Guest]: When you try to start writing a novel you're usually getting it wrong, everything feels

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:38.940
[Guest]: dead on the page.

02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:43.500
[Guest]: There's a moment where you enter the life of the book and you will not know even when

02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.980
[Guest]: the book comes out and the reviews come out and readers say nice things or whatever it

02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:53.380
[Guest]: is you will actually not know whether your book is alive or not for many years afterwards.

02:15:53.380 --> 02:16:02.220
[Guest]: But that aliveness is indescribable, it's electric, it's the kind of feeling that you

02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:09.020
[Guest]: have if not the power of being a god but let's say the awe of being a god and bringing a

02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:15.900
[Guest]: world into full view and that you would spend years on anytime, any day.

02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:20.260
[Guest]: It is so rewarding, it is one of the most beautiful things in the world because there's

02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:22.680
[Guest]: no way you can shorten that timeline.

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:26.100
[Guest]: You might take just three months to write a novel, you might take four years, you might

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:32.220
[Guest]: take eight years but the individual book, the individual tale, the aliveness that it

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:38.100
[Guest]: accrues over a period of time, whatever that process is it can't be shortened.

02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:45.580
[Guest]: Sometimes it's so intense that it feels as though you're possessed, it feels as though

02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:49.460
[Guest]: the story is writing itself through you.

02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:55.620
[Guest]: Sometimes you have to struggle to, one of my characters in Black River spent years just

02:16:55.620 --> 02:17:00.260
[Guest]: saying, sorry you don't know enough about me, you know you're still viewing me as an

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:05.060
[Guest]: interview subject and this was all wordless communication.

02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:08.980
[Guest]: It's only when you can see from behind my eyes, that's not my phrase, I think that's

02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:16.060
[Guest]: Michael Dundati's but it's only when you can get to that point and the reason you're

02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:19.700
[Guest]: trying to get it right and you're trying to sand down edges and bring it more and more

02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:26.940
[Guest]: to life is not for the perfect sentences or the beauty of an image, all you're trying

02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:34.860
[Guest]: to do is to do some justice to this world that is of your creation but that is also

02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:39.020
[Guest]: coming from somewhere beyond your left shoulder, you know.

02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:43.580
[Guest]: And to be part of that whether it's a novel you're writing or whether it's one of Paula

02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:51.420
[Guest]: Reggio's incredible paintings she just passed away some weeks ago or whether it's a dance

02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:57.540
[Guest]: performance where your act of creation is in that moment on the stage and then you have

02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:02.020
[Guest]: to go back and repeat it the next day or something of the sort.

02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:07.100
[Guest]: You see what I'm saying, there's something about the process of creation itself so long

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:12.340
[Guest]: as you don't get pompous and sonorous about it but I can tell you something that process

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:20.220
[Guest]: is when you feel most alive, you know, and there are other ways in which to feel alive

02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:25.220
[Guest]: on earth, you know, for some people it's sex, food, money, power, for some people it's adrenaline

02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:31.160
[Guest]: and thrills but I can tell you something, this thrill goes beyond everything else.

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:38.580
[Guest]: You can channel it into 50 different directions, getting down from those, you know, high, high

02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:44.180
[Guest]: mountaintops into the practical side of life, there's absolutely no reason why an author

02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:49.900
[Guest]: can't do or be both and we keep talking about engagement, audience, all of that but the

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:55.100
[Guest]: word that you used, intimacy, connection, right.

02:18:55.100 --> 02:19:00.500
[Guest]: In this rushing world that has changed so much from the time that, you know, I'm a little

02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:06.900
[Guest]: older than you but our childhoods overlapped and I think we look at this world saying that

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:11.820
[Guest]: it's a world of infinite resource but very little satisfaction.

02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:17.740
[Guest]: So what you're trying to do as a writer whether it's with a newsletter or a novel is also

02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:22.860
[Guest]: to reconnect and to get people hopefully to re-see.

02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:27.340
[Guest]: The other reason, we didn't realize this, I don't think I ever thought about the, you

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:31.820
[Guest]: know, internal emotional journey of blogging or something of the sort when I was Hari Babu,

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:37.260
[Guest]: I picked his name out of Kipling and decided to, you know, rescue the Babu from the clutches

02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:45.180
[Guest]: of the Raj and turn him to good account but hiding behind a pseudonym also freed me up.

02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:50.700
[Guest]: It freed up a voice I didn't know I had and maybe it was an embryo, you know, early starting

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:54.740
[Guest]: towards becoming a novelist even though I couldn't at that time admit to myself that

02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:57.620
[Guest]: I wanted to be a writer.

02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:04.860
[Guest]: There was something important I wanted to say about that, yes, about the blogs I think

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:10.940
[Guest]: what we didn't realize we were doing at that stage was that we, through our attention,

02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:15.100
[Guest]: we were getting to understand our territory, right.

02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:19.100
[Guest]: As a writer, as a sports person, whatever it is that you decide that you're going to

02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:24.500
[Guest]: do, the thing that people have in common who really achieve something great with their

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:29.780
[Guest]: lives and I'm not saying in terms of success, that's great, but I'm saying in terms of creating

02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:35.620
[Guest]: something of lasting worth or of lasting joy, forget about the word, you know, is their

02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:41.460
[Guest]: ability to filter out distraction and what a blog does did then and what a newsletter

02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:48.620
[Guest]: does now is just allow you within that space of easy armchair sitting back intimacy to

02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:53.500
[Guest]: say this is what I really find fascinating.

02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:57.540
[Guest]: Why can you not do it in any other way because even as we're talking we're generating I think

02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:02.100
[Guest]: a million ideas, everything that you're saying, I'm like, okay, you know, why didn't I think

02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:08.460
[Guest]: of this, the new creator economy moves in this fashion, but the new creator ecology

02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:14.940
[Guest]: is to me almost as fascinating, if not more fascinating than the economy, but I'm looking

02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:20.620
[Guest]: at these things and I'm thinking we're going back to very, very old fashioned emotions,

02:21:20.620 --> 02:21:27.860
[Guest]: emotional needs, psychic needs, if you like, what is this craving for Amit, you know, this

02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:36.340
[Guest]: craving is for depth, intimacy, curiosity, attention, the training of that attention,

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:43.980
[Guest]: discovery, satisfaction, sharing, isn't that what we're talking about, isn't that the journey

02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:48.180
[Guest]: of a creator in whatever form?

02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:52.260
[Amit Varma]: What's the difference between creator economy and creator ecology, by the way, in the ways

02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:53.540
[Guest]: that you sort of use it?

02:21:53.540 --> 02:22:00.900
[Guest]: Again, it's something that I'm visualizing as I speak, when I think of the creator economy,

02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:04.820
[Guest]: I think of the nuts and bolts of it, you know, how do you not just a simple thing of how

02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:11.420
[Guest]: do you monetize a newsletter, but in other ways as well, you know, how do you fuel this?

02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:16.540
[Guest]: It's very easy for anyone who's lived any kind of life to write maybe four newsletters,

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.660
[Guest]: but part of your economy would be how do you keep generating the interest and the ideas?

02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.540
[Guest]: What is it that your ground is?

02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.880
[Guest]: What is it that you want to share with people?

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:31.060
[Guest]: And the economy is also the economy of attention, the economy of money, etc.

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:34.820
[Guest]: And that there's an entire infrastructure that goes along with it.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:40.220
[Guest]: When I think of the creator ecology, I'm back where we started with the blogs and stuff,

02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:44.060
[Guest]: which is what was the environment like?

02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:47.380
[Guest]: It was very tilted.

02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:55.380
[Guest]: First world blogging was much more populated and much more present than our world blogging.

02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:58.820
[Guest]: And yet we could make our presence felt, it was still a fair landscape.

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:02.660
[Guest]: It was not, you know, our voices were not drowned out.

02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:08.800
[Guest]: There was also a lot of language blogging, you know, which woke up a need in me to read

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:09.980
[Guest]: beyond English.

02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:12.780
[Guest]: I don't write in Hindi and Bangla.

02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:17.860
[Guest]: My Hindi is still unfortunately, my spoken Hindi is very, very Bengali inflected.

02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:24.380
[Guest]: But I would not give up the pleasure that I've had from reading in Hindi, Bengali and

02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:29.540
[Guest]: English simultaneously all these years, you know, it's just a joy and language blogging

02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:31.300
[Guest]: was a lot like that.

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:38.420
[Guest]: When I look at the creative ecology, I look at people unconsciously moving outside of

02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:50.420
[Guest]: the grasp, the stickiness of Insta, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, you know, those are great

02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:52.100
[Guest]: training grounds.

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:56.420
[Guest]: But at some point, I keep waiting for the MySpace kind of thing, where the owners of

02:23:56.420 --> 02:24:00.700
[Guest]: those spaces, which is some giant corporation, will fold them up or change them to the point

02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:07.100
[Guest]: where they no longer, you know, as it is Twitter for anyone who has a right wing active has

02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:10.540
[Guest]: changed, you know, in the early days, it used to be a safe space for us.

02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:15.300
[Guest]: So for Americans, or for Hong Kong liberals, and now it's not.

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:19.180
[Guest]: And as a result, you're already censoring yourself for already being careful about what

02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:21.820
[Guest]: you see, is this going to get me into trouble?

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:25.100
[Guest]: It's not a free space anymore, if that makes sense.

02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:27.820
[Guest]: With Facebook, the problem is slightly different.

02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:33.600
[Guest]: It's gone from being the pleasure of sharing your status updates and generating discussion

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.720
[Guest]: on your page to being a very cluttered space.

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:39.980
[Guest]: And frankly, a very elderly space as well, you know, you don't have young people out

02:24:39.980 --> 02:24:40.980
[Guest]: there.

02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:46.620
[Guest]: TikTok is great fun, but it's also very quick, quick, quick, you know, with Instagram.

02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:49.100
[Guest]: I love Instagram, it's very peaceful.

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:53.420
[Guest]: It takes me to many places, art and design Instagram is fascinating.

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.880
[Guest]: But if you notice, you never go backwards with these spaces.

02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.220
[Guest]: You never stop and you never reverse gear.

02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:03.980
[Guest]: You're always in an endless present or scrolling future.

02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:09.080
[Guest]: And one thing you're trying to do with this new creator ecology is to create something

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:12.740
[Guest]: that is an evolution from the blogs.

02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:16.940
[Guest]: The way I see it is a kind of linkage, you know, I see again, the web part of the World

02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:23.180
[Guest]: Wide Web, if that makes sense, and intermeshing rather than a separate silos.

02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:28.740
[Guest]: The promise yet again, of a hierarchy-less world, which will eventually become hierarchical

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:32.860
[Guest]: and then evolve out and be replaced with something else.

02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:38.580
[Guest]: But when I think of the ecology, I actually think of intertwining wires, creepers, whatever

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:42.860
[Guest]: you want to call it, I think of something living and breathing.

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:48.300
[Guest]: Already among writer newsletters, which is the narrow area that I follow, because people

02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:53.980
[Guest]: are reading each other's newsletters on creativity and craft and all of that.

02:25:53.980 --> 02:26:00.100
[Guest]: What's happening seems much less like independent nodes and more like a conversation and interchange

02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:02.020
[Amit Varma]: and exchange.

02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:04.140
[Guest]: Like the roots of trees in a forest.

02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:06.740
[Guest]: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking about.

02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:11.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I agree with all of this, except that I think of economy in a slightly different

02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:12.940
[Amit Varma]: way.

02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:17.780
[Amit Varma]: But perhaps an umbrella term is a creator ecosystem, which sounds very, you know, jargony

02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:23.460
[Amit Varma]: and corporate like and defined, but I would include all of this in that as well.

02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:27.340
[Amit Varma]: Because I don't think the creator economy is just about the big platforms like Instagram

02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:28.340
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:33.060
[Amit Varma]: It's also about this conversation you and I are having or even other things that may

02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:37.100
[Amit Varma]: not necessarily have an audience, but we are creators, we do what we do.

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:42.140
[Amit Varma]: And so it's all of that, I mean, to me an economy is really a web of voluntary interactions

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:44.660
[Amit Varma]: and it just goes into all kinds of directions.

02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:50.100
[Amit Varma]: And again, and those wondering that what are they talking about roots of trees in forests,

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:51.100
[Amit Varma]: what is this?

02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:54.980
[Amit Varma]: I'd recommend this lovely book by Peter Walgreen called The Hidden Life of Trees, which is

02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:57.380
[Amit Varma]: such a lovely book, isn't it?

02:26:57.380 --> 02:26:58.380
[Guest]: Yes.

02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:03.260
[Guest]: I like a lot of the new writing that's coming up around trees around the earth and, you

02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:06.700
[Guest]: know, where we are pausing in this moment.

02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:11.380
[Guest]: And Ed Yong's just out with an incredible book about the inner lives, the emotional

02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:12.380
[Guest]: lives of animals.

02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:15.740
[Amit Varma]: Well, yeah, I saw the cover, but I didn't, I haven't read it yet.

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:18.140
[Guest]: I'm just just started on that.

02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:21.540
[Guest]: But I was looking at all of this and I was thinking, you know, there's a lot of debates

02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:27.660
[Guest]: coming up against with nature writing, with people saying, OK, wonder is all very well,

02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:32.780
[Guest]: but more than wonder, you know, maybe we're finally taking our place in the world.

02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:33.780
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:38.840
[Guest]: We're finally seeing ourselves not just as a human species, but as a human species embedded

02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:40.940
[Guest]: in something very real.

02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:48.560
[Guest]: And again, the world that we are talking about, books, internet spaces, these are landscapes

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.860
[Guest]: of their own, if that makes sense.

02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:55.220
[Guest]: I sense that we haven't yet fully explored the tension between the new world and the

02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:57.460
[Guest]: old world way of doing things.

02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:06.100
[Guest]: I've been so one way or the other connected with the old landscape, right?

02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:09.700
[Guest]: Which is legacy publishers, legacy media.

02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:13.820
[Guest]: What's changed with them after a while is that you no longer have the expectation of

02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:20.620
[Guest]: working with the same editor over a long period of time or that you no longer can rely on

02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:21.620
[Guest]: job security.

02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:26.780
[Guest]: You know, what happened even with legacy media was a lot of organizations expanding, opening

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:31.060
[Guest]: up their tents and then crashing dramatically five years down the line.

02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:36.460
[Guest]: I think there are very, very few places that continue to stay standing as institutions.

02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:40.340
[Guest]: We are losing that entire sense.

02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:46.940
[Guest]: With the new world, I'm a cynic after so many years of being online.

02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:51.220
[Guest]: And I look at the possibilities, but I also wonder how long it will take for us to mess

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:54.100
[Guest]: it up, you know.

02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:56.420
[Guest]: On the other hand, you can't be that cynical.

02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:59.740
[Guest]: There's a point of time at which you have to look at what this enables.

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:03.860
[Guest]: And I have, you know, both you and Roshan Abbas and a lot of other people are saying

02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:10.740
[Guest]: that the next five, six, ten years is likely to be a really, really interesting time for

02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:17.940
[Guest]: anybody who's willing to take individual responsibility, okay, for their lives and stuff.

02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:21.860
[Guest]: And something about the way newsletters work may remind me again of something from the

02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:28.140
[Guest]: Hindi writing world, Gitanjali Shree and a lot of writers, they will just automatically

02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:35.300
[Guest]: have their addresses, their own home addresses printed on the back or front flap of the book.

02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:39.180
[Guest]: Because the assumption is that if you write a book, you want readers to get in touch with

02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:42.020
[Guest]: you, you know.

02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:47.220
[Guest]: And I was just asking myself, when did we lose that in the English language world?

02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:52.740
[Guest]: You know, or did we never have that, was our concept of writing always somebody quietly

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:57.900
[Guest]: there in their individual silo or castle, unapproachable, accepted festivals or something

02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:58.900
[Guest]: of the sort?

02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:01.420
[Guest]: You know, it's a difference.

02:30:01.420 --> 02:30:03.460
[Guest]: It's not just a small thing, if you know what I mean.

02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:10.540
[Guest]: This is the more time I spend in writing and reading, the more I realize and I'm not saying

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:17.180
[Guest]: this as a humble brag, it's not about reading so much, but you realize with the shock that

02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:20.900
[Guest]: with every choice you're making with your reading, there's so much else that you're

02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:23.420
[Guest]: not going to know, you know.

02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:27.380
[Guest]: So if I'm reading a lot of literary fiction set in the present, then I'm not going to

02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:30.380
[Guest]: be reading that many classics from the past.

02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:35.060
[Guest]: If I'm reading thrillers and if I'm reading a lot of books on the environment, then the

02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:41.720
[Guest]: amount of time I have to spend reading food books has gone down, you know.

02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:49.580
[Guest]: And I still, I've lived half a century and sometimes I still feel like I'm still 20,

02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:54.060
[Guest]: reaching out for the world and saying, just give me more, there is so much to explore.

02:30:54.060 --> 02:31:00.060
[Guest]: I don't know, those different parts of your life, there's the part that wants to create,

02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:04.300
[Guest]: there's the part that wants to sit back and listen to other people or to read their work

02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:07.780
[Guest]: or to experience their creations.

02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:11.780
[Guest]: And there's the part that's just like, my God, you know, there's so much to explore,

02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:16.740
[Guest]: despite, I mean, I know we get depressed at the headlines and all of that.

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:22.060
[Guest]: But I think something that's been continuous through all these decades, and I'm just looking

02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:28.280
[Guest]: back at it and thinking, you know, childhood was books coming out of the family cupboards

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:34.620
[Guest]: and stuff like that, and adolescence was a lot of traveling and the 20s, there was the

02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:41.500
[Guest]: whole wide world of the internet coming at you, you know, this new frontier to explore.

02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:47.580
[Guest]: And my God, I just hope none of us ever loses our sense of wonder.

02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:49.180
[Guest]: You know what I mean?

02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:52.740
[Guest]: Behind all of these questions and all of that, you know, whatever you want to do with reading

02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:59.940
[Guest]: or writing, I think, I mean, of course, you write sometimes to witness terrible things

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:01.660
[Guest]: and all of that.

02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:07.980
[Guest]: But I think all of this is just a journey into keeping your curiosity alive, and trying

02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:12.580
[Guest]: to find ways never to let that go in the pursuit of this goal or that goal or must have, you

02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:14.060
[Guest]: know, bungalow car, etc.

02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:17.820
[Guest]: Those are all very valid goals, nice things to do.

02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:23.700
[Guest]: But I cannot imagine living a life without curiosity, without wonder, without exploration.

02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:24.700
[Amit Varma]: Can you?

02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:25.700
[Amit Varma]: No, I can't.

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:30.940
[Amit Varma]: And this is what I have to keep reminding myself, because I don't think I think it's

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:35.340
[Amit Varma]: a daily choice, in the sense that I don't think that you can tell yourself that I'm

02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:40.700
[Amit Varma]: going to live a life of more curiosity and wonder or whatever, and then boom, the direction

02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:42.020
[Amit Varma]: changes and that's fine.

02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:46.740
[Amit Varma]: No, I think every day, you have to remind yourself to be mindful, remind yourself not

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:52.180
[Amit Varma]: to take stuff for granted, to notice the things that you've sort of normalized.

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:56.700
[Amit Varma]: In my case, I do notice the many ways in which you're so incredibly lucky for doing what

02:32:56.700 --> 02:33:01.060
[Amit Varma]: you do or living the kind of life you live, and I think it's important to have that sense

02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:07.060
[Amit Varma]: of like, Jesus Christ, I'm so lucky, right, despite which I'm known as an excessively

02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:10.020
[Amit Varma]: pessimistic person, because of course, the country is going to hell and we're all going

02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:14.420
[Amit Varma]: to die soon, but soon in geological terms.

02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:18.340
[Amit Varma]: But I'll say one thing, I don't even know if it's a counterpoint.

02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:23.700
[Amit Varma]: But perhaps I'm addressing a worry that you have is that you mentioned about how something

02:33:23.700 --> 02:33:26.340
[Amit Varma]: new will emerge, and we'll find a way to mess it up.

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:28.780
[Amit Varma]: And I think this time, we won't mess it up.

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:33.820
[Amit Varma]: Because I think the direction that worry is going in is that there is a culture and that

02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:37.780
[Amit Varma]: culture becomes stayed and mainstream and whatever, and then a counterculture emerges

02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:39.700
[Amit Varma]: and the counterculture is really cool.

02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:42.340
[Amit Varma]: But then it gets co-opted and it gets messed up.

02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:44.780
[Amit Varma]: And then you have another counterculture and it's a cycle.

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.380
[Amit Varma]: But I don't think that's what's happening here.

02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:52.820
[Amit Varma]: I think what's happening here is this fundamental, permanent shift towards decentralization in

02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:58.860
[Amit Varma]: every way, right, in the sense that, just to take the media as an example, there was

02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:03.980
[Amit Varma]: a mainstream in the 1990s, you had a broad consensus on the truth, the means of production

02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:08.220
[Amit Varma]: were not open to creators, creators couldn't connect with their audiences, creators couldn't

02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:10.780
[Amit Varma]: monetize their audiences directly.

02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:15.100
[Amit Varma]: They had to go via the platforms who would sell eyeballs, get advertising, and a small

02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:16.960
[Amit Varma]: chunk of that would reach creators.

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.540
[Amit Varma]: And I think all that has changed and it's changed for good, in the sense that I now

02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:26.380
[Amit Varma]: have the means of production in my hand, I can write something and publish it today,

02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:30.700
[Amit Varma]: I can put out this podcast today as I will, you know, this is I own this, this is not

02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:36.940
[Amit Varma]: for any platform, it's available everywhere, and it's free, right, I can make anything

02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:40.980
[Amit Varma]: in the audiovisual form that I want to and put it on YouTube or whatever.

02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:44.860
[Amit Varma]: And I think that is not going to change the means of production are with you forever,

02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:50.420
[Amit Varma]: the means of distribution are accessible to you forever, there might be, I think worries

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:55.940
[Amit Varma]: that will get addressed with times that some video creators may feel that they are too

02:34:55.940 --> 02:35:00.180
[Amit Varma]: dependent on the algorithms of the big platforms like YouTube or whatever, and they might have

02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:02.000
[Amit Varma]: to cater to that to get noticed.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.140
[Amit Varma]: But many creators don't even give a damn about that they're just putting their work out and

02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:06.820
[Amit Varma]: they're getting their audiences.

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:09.300
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, I don't think we'll mess it up.

02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:14.100
[Amit Varma]: I think yes, there will be a percentage of creators who are doing cutting edge work today

02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:17.660
[Amit Varma]: and who are being disruptive, who might be co opted and who might become part of that

02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:19.260
[Amit Varma]: mainstream game.

02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:21.900
[Amit Varma]: But overall, we're not going to mess it up.

02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:26.420
[Amit Varma]: Because unless a human species dies, dies out, which will happen eventually, given the

02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:29.140
[Amit Varma]: law of extremely large numbers is inevitable.

02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:32.660
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, I think that this is an irrevocable change.

02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:36.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's why it feels creators like me and Roshan and many of the creators I've spoken

02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:41.460
[Amit Varma]: to on my podcast, with incredible optimism about at least this, that they can't take

02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:42.460
[Amit Varma]: this away.

02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:47.260
[Guest]: I'm going to hold my skepticism in check.

02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:53.500
[Guest]: I would like to believe I guess, okay, what I'm skeptical about is not that this revolution

02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.500
[Guest]: isn't happening.

02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.540
[Guest]: I see it happening.

02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:57.940
[Guest]: And I think it's well overdue.

02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:01.580
[Guest]: It was what part of the early promise of the net was about.

02:36:01.580 --> 02:36:05.420
[Guest]: It just that at that time, we didn't have all the tools and all of that.

02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:11.980
[Guest]: I guess my two concerns after having been an early, you know, the web will be used for

02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:17.940
[Guest]: good evangelist and it's wonderful to connect people and on Twitter, all we're going to

02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:22.420
[Guest]: do is flood relief and reach out to each other and get books to libraries and all that good

02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:24.700
[Guest]: stuff.

02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:30.580
[Guest]: I think I have a healthy respect now for the speed of darkness as well, you know.

02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:38.500
[Guest]: So unconsciously, when we say creators, we're thinking of what we consider not even moral,

02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:45.620
[Guest]: I'm not even going there, but what we consider benevolent, beneficial creativity, right?

02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:51.660
[Guest]: And I guess I'm looking at AI and where that's headed and how that is going to mess up a

02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:53.620
[Guest]: certain amount of this.

02:36:53.620 --> 02:37:02.060
[Guest]: And I'm a little nervous about where these tools could go in the hands of well-organized

02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:03.060
[Guest]: hate industries.

02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:07.340
[Guest]: We've seen just little flickers of that, right?

02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:13.620
[Guest]: In the power of certain kinds of propaganda films, there was a fabulous Twitter thread,

02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:19.220
[Guest]: you know, Twitter, the source of good is when it's evil, by a Russian journalist writing

02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:24.540
[Guest]: about how before this moment happened, you know, before Putin's war, for decades and

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:30.620
[Guest]: decades, Russian publishing has been overrun by these small books that are jingoistic and

02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:36.780
[Guest]: have the worst of nationalistic, both the demonizing and the hero making, you know?

02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:40.220
[Guest]: So I guess that's what I'm getting at, you know, the power of something like this to

02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:47.980
[Guest]: be used to create dark, grim alternate realities is also something that I would keep a little

02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:51.300
[Amit Varma]: and I share your pessimism about politics.

02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:55.940
[Amit Varma]: And this is really in the realm of politics, the industry of hate and so on and so forth.

02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:01.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's no doubt true that there is authoritarianism and polarization and all of those things are

02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:05.220
[Amit Varma]: happening and the technology plays a huge part in that.

02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:06.980
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not disputing that.

02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:12.720
[Amit Varma]: But just in the narrow context of the creator economy, I think the cat's out of the bag.

02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.780
[Amit Varma]: And I think that, you know, you can't mainstream all of it again.

02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:21.820
[Amit Varma]: You're not going to ever reach the situation where someone like me can't put out the kind

02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:24.060
[Amit Varma]: of work I want to put out, you know?

02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:29.220
[Amit Varma]: I think I'm in the space and creators everywhere are in that space where they can do the kind

02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:31.660
[Amit Varma]: of work they want and get it out there.

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.780
[Amit Varma]: And that little thing you can't turn back.

02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:34.780
[Guest]: It is...

02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:37.540
[Guest]: You see, that's not a little thing, you know, there I'm in agreement.

02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:41.700
[Guest]: And the other thing that has also become earlier the argument used to be that if you're an

02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:47.180
[Guest]: independent creator, somebody who's with a legacy publisher is somehow better than you

02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:52.820
[Guest]: because they've had access to the best editors in the business and all of that.

02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:54.100
[Guest]: And that has also changed.

02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:59.220
[Guest]: If you really want to teach yourself how to be edited properly, you can organize those

02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:00.980
[Guest]: skills for yourself.

02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:05.300
[Guest]: You can take a workshop, you can practice a craft on your own, or you can hire an editor.

02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:09.100
[Amit Varma]: Or you can do the art of clear writing by Amit Verma.

02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:18.380
[Guest]: Yeah, but I see what I like about this scenario is that it's also coming up at a time when

02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:23.740
[Guest]: you have, you know, this youth explosion in India.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:29.020
[Guest]: And of course, when you have so many people out there clustering around, they can either

02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:34.140
[Guest]: that energy can either be turned to really, really vicious purposes, you know, towards

02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:39.620
[Guest]: common hate and towards mobs and all of that, which is what we've seen happening out here.

02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:41.640
[Guest]: But there is a better pathway.

02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:45.700
[Guest]: And that's what you're seeing, you know, this is a generation that's already used to a certain

02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:47.700
[Guest]: amount of independence.

02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:53.900
[Guest]: And that, you know, as great as liberalization was for India, that boom in businesses, and

02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:59.180
[Guest]: that sudden explosion of cities like Delhi into huge megalopolises, if you consider that

02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:03.140
[Guest]: a good thing, you know, and an energy.

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:09.260
[Guest]: What I remember about liberalization in the 1990s most was, again, an explosion of wild

02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:14.740
[Guest]: creative energy, you know, for a while, it felt like Delhi was an exceptionally welcoming

02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:21.180
[Guest]: city for anyone who had a multitude, I mean, one of a multitude of dreams, not just the

02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:22.180
[Guest]: writing dream.

02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:26.060
[Guest]: But if you wanted to be a graphic designer, if you wanted to be an artist, this was the

02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:30.660
[Guest]: place to be young and starving in a Barsati in Lajpat Nagar, yeah.

02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:35.540
[Amit Varma]: I came to Delhi in 94, after college, and after a few months, turned my butt and ran

02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:40.700
[Amit Varma]: back all the way to Bombay, I wouldn't necessarily say it was such a welcoming city.

02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:44.500
[Amit Varma]: But no, because I just found that at that time, and it's probably not true today, but

02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:49.700
[Amit Varma]: at that time, Bombay was the only cosmopolitan city in India, in the sense it could, I just

02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:52.820
[Amit Varma]: felt at home in Bombay from day one, which was not the case in Delhi.

02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:55.860
[Guest]: Delhi is always a rough ride right at the start.

02:40:55.860 --> 02:41:01.660
[Guest]: But in the same time period, there were a lot of other people who went through the turbulent

02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:06.300
[Guest]: rapids and then found their feet in the city, it was a nourishing place.

02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:12.560
[Guest]: I'm not so sure that it's as nourishing these days, you know, there's a sense of that creative

02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:16.500
[Guest]: energy at least having fallen apart a little bit and the business side of the city being

02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:22.460
[Guest]: strong, the building side of the city being strong, you know, but there isn't as much

02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:27.580
[Guest]: of a glamour attached to wanting to be an artist or whatever.

02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:31.700
[Guest]: It's become a lot more conformist in both Bombay and Delhi in some ways.

02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:36.860
[Amit Varma]: I can't speak about Delhi, obviously, because I don't live here and I don't have that kind

02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:38.100
[Amit Varma]: of knowledge.

02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:41.780
[Amit Varma]: But I think that there would be many Delhi's.

02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:46.260
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps there's a little bit of a selection, there might be a little bit of a selection

02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:51.020
[Amit Varma]: bias in what you're saying in the sense that you could be thinking of your circles and

02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:53.340
[Amit Varma]: the kind of people that you know, and what's happening there.

02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:59.380
[Amit Varma]: Because even in Bombay, I have to warn myself about making easy generalizations about Bombay,

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:07.100
[Amit Varma]: because there are so many sort of niches and undergrounds and vibrant communities of creative

02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:12.720
[Amit Varma]: people who are all over the place, who I didn't know till a while back, but then suddenly

02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:15.620
[Amit Varma]: you see them and you realize this is also there.

02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:21.340
[Amit Varma]: So I'm wary about, I mean, I'm not saying you're doing that, but I'm just wary about

02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:25.980
[Amit Varma]: generalizations because what I do see in the creator economy is that there is just tremendous

02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:33.820
[Amit Varma]: energy and the greatest tragedy of all for me, where politics hurt the creator economy

02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:35.820
[Amit Varma]: was TikTok being banned.

02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:39.060
[Amit Varma]: And I rant and rave about this because...

02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:42.260
[Guest]: That's actually one of the things I was coming to.

02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:47.220
[Guest]: It's not that I don't see a lack of creative potential in Delhi, let's put it that way.

02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:52.620
[Guest]: But compared to, and liberalization had its own, you know, ups and downs or whatever.

02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:57.820
[Guest]: I will just say that the 2000s seem to be more welcoming to the younger generation.

02:42:57.820 --> 02:43:04.820
[Guest]: Now that energy is there, I see fewer outlets though, you know, and that always puts upon

02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:09.340
[Guest]: a generation the burden of going out and making their own spaces.

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:14.780
[Guest]: So I would say that everything out there is poised and set up to thrive.

02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:19.100
[Guest]: Politically speaking, it's not just a question of, you know, which party's in charge, but

02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:26.100
[Guest]: I think in general, it hasn't been a priority out here to make your cities into great creative

02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:28.100
[Guest]: bastions.

02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:29.100
[Guest]: Does that make sense?

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:36.060
[Guest]: And again, I'm not talking about things like, you know, museums and stuff like that.

02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:39.260
[Guest]: It's just that with the ebb and flow of the city, there was a point at which even the

02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:44.980
[Guest]: outside spaces seemed to have something to them, you know, a little welcomingness.

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:51.780
[Guest]: In order to create and to be a thriving creative community, you also have to be open to mingling

02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:55.220
[Guest]: and moving past certain barriers and all of that.

02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:58.980
[Guest]: And I find that happening much more online than offline.

02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:04.300
[Guest]: Again, you know, we're walking back into these arguments are large and gigantic, but I think

02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:09.740
[Guest]: what both of us are seeing, what I see from the world of legacy publishing and legacy

02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:13.220
[Guest]: media is a certain level of fatigue.

02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:17.100
[Guest]: You know, certain institutions, including some of the ones where I work in, where my

02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:24.060
[Guest]: work comes out, are as professional and as thorough and as ever, and bless them for being

02:44:24.060 --> 02:44:25.060
[Guest]: around.

02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:31.240
[Guest]: But increasingly, you sense that legacy publishing and legacy media, which used to be take up

02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:35.900
[Guest]: the entire space, is now one corner of that space, right?

02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:39.100
[Amit Varma]: I'll think carefully about your words and process them with time.

02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:44.500
[Amit Varma]: But I'm reminded of our beloved Prime Minister, dear leader, Modiji, who was once asked about

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:51.340
[Amit Varma]: Do you remember there was this famous gathering of children to ask him questions in an auditorium?

02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:54.580
[Amit Varma]: And one of them, I think, asked him about climate change.

02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And he was trying to say, ki dekhe, mausam nahi badla hai, hum badle hai.

02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:06.500
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, from talking about legacy publishing, let's talk about legacy person, which is,

02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:09.260
[Amit Varma]: let's kind of talk about your childhood now.

02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:11.180
[Amit Varma]: And you know, where were you born?

02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:12.700
[Amit Varma]: And what were your early years like?

02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:15.540
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:17.660
[Guest]: I was born in Kolkata.

02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:22.140
[Guest]: And part of the mythology, because one doesn't remember one's own birth in the early few

02:45:22.140 --> 02:45:23.140
[Guest]: months.

02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:29.500
[Guest]: But in my mind, I think all of that is fused with memories of Bangladesh coming into being.

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:36.980
[Guest]: And the earliest memories I have are by and large of very happy things, you know, books,

02:45:36.980 --> 02:45:42.460
[Guest]: houses that were built practically of books, running around and playing in gardens.

02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:48.540
[Guest]: And because both my parents and my grandmother in Kolkata were exceptionally hospitable people,

02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:53.420
[Guest]: there was, we were used to a house that where the doors were open, where there was always

02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:59.660
[Guest]: an extra space at the table, and where people were welcome to come and just crash.

02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:07.340
[Guest]: And in retrospect, I think it gave me tremendous exposure to a life outside of just the family.

02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:11.420
[Guest]: You know, otherwise, we get caught up very strongly in our own family histories and all

02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:13.180
[Guest]: of that.

02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:19.300
[Guest]: And another thing I didn't realize was, we mentioned earlier, that I felt lucky to be

02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:23.460
[Guest]: belong to a family where so many people were readers.

02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:30.900
[Guest]: But of my grandmothers, one of them was a woman who had studied Sanskrit, and loved

02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:32.460
[Guest]: reading Mills and Boones.

02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:36.500
[Guest]: So you were introduced right from the start to the idea that reading could be wide and

02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:40.740
[Guest]: eclectic and didn't have to be either solemn or frivolous all the time, there was a huge

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:44.100
[Guest]: spectrum, a kind of keyboard in between.

02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:48.140
[Guest]: And my father's mother, Takuma, used to write poems in Bengali.

02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:53.260
[Guest]: And that brought in a certain, you know, comfort with moving between languages as easily as

02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:56.460
[Guest]: you move between the rooms of a household.

02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:02.700
[Guest]: And I think a large part of my childhood was, we discussed this as well, it would be so

02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:07.900
[Guest]: alien to this time, it wasn't structured, none of our childhoods were, there was the

02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:11.380
[Guest]: broad and very loose structure of a school.

02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:13.820
[Guest]: And then you come back, you do a little homework.

02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:18.180
[Guest]: But in the absence of TV and smartphones, and all of that, we were thrown back on our

02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:20.220
[Guest]: own inventiveness.

02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:24.940
[Guest]: So the games that we played also came out of one's imagination.

02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:30.020
[Guest]: And I grew up partly in a government colony in Delhi, at a time when being a government

02:47:30.020 --> 02:47:36.020
[Guest]: officer was not seen as so much as a emblem of power.

02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:41.180
[Guest]: You know, it was a kind of time when a secretary to the government of India would drive his

02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:46.780
[Guest]: car around the neighborhood, picking up lowly deputy secretaries and very, very junior probationers

02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:49.240
[Guest]: and ferry them all off.

02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:53.540
[Guest]: And if he didn't do that, in fact, the lowly probationers would get on their cycles and

02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:55.460
[Guest]: cycle off to work.

02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:58.740
[Guest]: So being in the government was pretty humble.

02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:05.020
[Guest]: And the India of that time, the 1970s and the 80s was both quieter and smaller.

02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:10.540
[Guest]: It still rippled with a current of political tension all through.

02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:17.340
[Guest]: But it was very much a nation making itself with the memory of Gandhi, Ambedkar, and,

02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:20.860
[Guest]: you know, all of the heroes of the freedom movement very much alive.

02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:24.560
[Guest]: That I think has changed over time.

02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:30.980
[Guest]: Most of my childhood was spent, I think, just being extraordinarily lucky in every possible

02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:31.980
[Guest]: way.

02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:34.220
[Guest]: We had a lot of adventures.

02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:39.220
[Guest]: We were allowed as a family to accompany my father on his tours, so long as he paid for

02:48:39.220 --> 02:48:42.980
[Guest]: us separately, which he was very punctilious about.

02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:48.620
[Guest]: And as a result, my first sense of travel was not, you know, a tour, was not you go

02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:50.380
[Guest]: to a hill station.

02:48:50.380 --> 02:48:55.100
[Guest]: It was literally of just going across the country and right from the start seeing that

02:48:55.100 --> 02:48:57.580
[Guest]: enormous variation.

02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:03.180
[Guest]: I think part of my memory of India as an essentially kind and open country, though, also comes

02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:05.500
[Guest]: from that time.

02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:11.700
[Guest]: Something that I found a little disconcerting on my first visit to Europe, where for all

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:16.900
[Guest]: the beauty of the place, you don't stop on the street and ask for directions and have

02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:21.140
[Guest]: that immediately turned into a long and rambling conversation and an invitation to come home,

02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:24.620
[Guest]: or at least to have a cup of tea together.

02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:30.780
[Guest]: And for all that, we talk often of the direction that the country is going in today, our fears

02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:33.060
[Guest]: for the future, our fears for democracy.

02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:40.060
[Guest]: But when I look back at that time, it doesn't seem romanticized to say that there's an openness

02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:43.700
[Guest]: that's also part of the Indian spirit.

02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:45.900
[Guest]: And that is felt and experienced.

02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:50.020
[Guest]: You know, I don't want to romanticize villages and cities.

02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:54.140
[Guest]: Part of the research that I did for Black River, among other things, just showed me

02:49:54.140 --> 02:50:02.700
[Guest]: that almost all of our spaces are unselfconsciously segregated, either by class, often by community,

02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:05.140
[Guest]: usually by caste, right?

02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:06.140
[Guest]: And that's what we grew up in.

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:08.380
[Guest]: That's the norm that we're used to.

02:50:08.380 --> 02:50:12.780
[Guest]: But cutting against that, one of the good things about being part of a government colony

02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:18.520
[Guest]: is that while in that era, certainly caste was not porous, you know, I think the majority

02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:22.700
[Guest]: of people who were in government colonies at that time were probably upper caste or

02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:26.140
[Guest]: at least privileged caste in some way or the other.

02:50:26.140 --> 02:50:31.900
[Guest]: But it was a first introduction to the melting pot aspect of India.

02:50:31.900 --> 02:50:36.420
[Guest]: And as much as we say, hey, listen, don't go back into nostalgic fantasies about the

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:40.420
[Guest]: secular past, I think we're using the wrong word out there.

02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:44.620
[Guest]: There is an extraordinary diversity in this country.

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:48.080
[Guest]: And that was part of my memories from the get-go.

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:51.860
[Guest]: In Calcutta, it wasn't that we were just listening to Bengali and English.

02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:53.660
[Guest]: There were also Marwari friends.

02:50:53.660 --> 02:50:58.660
[Guest]: There were friends from the Armenian, the very small but extremely vibrant Armenian

02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:00.940
[Guest]: and Parsi communities.

02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:04.380
[Guest]: English itself divided into several categories.

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:09.500
[Guest]: There was the beauty of Anglo-Indian English, which I think is a little close to the Bombay

02:51:09.500 --> 02:51:11.460
[Guest]: variants and all of that.

02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:15.900
[Guest]: And in Delhi, I remember being struck by the fact that there was no one Hindi.

02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:23.180
[Guest]: We grew up to a certain extent, assimilating newsreader, All India Radio, you know, Hindi

02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:25.800
[Guest]: and Doordarshan News Hindi.

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:30.340
[Guest]: But the other stream was also coming off Bombay through Amitabh Bachchan's movies and Rajesh

02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.260
[Guest]: Khanna's movies.

02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:37.060
[Guest]: And then there was the many, many Hindis that you'd pick up across the city.

02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:44.260
[Guest]: Old Delhi had its own slightly courtly, a little Lucknowi, a little Allahabadi Hindi.

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:48.300
[Guest]: And the migrant Hindi of the streets was coming straight in from Bihar.

02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:53.020
[Guest]: I could hear my own state Bengal also in the voices of people out there.

02:51:53.020 --> 02:51:59.900
[Guest]: So you grew up accustomed, I think, to many tongues ringing in your ears.

02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:04.740
[Guest]: I didn't have a very happy time in the first school that I was in, Noretto Convent.

02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:09.620
[Guest]: I made a lot of friends, as is the Roy habit.

02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:13.540
[Guest]: But it was a slightly austere, you know, you must go abide by the rules.

02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:20.940
[Guest]: And Kiran Desai's got a little section in Inheritance of Loss about what it's like to

02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:25.860
[Guest]: be a child suddenly realising that some adults are cruel, and they're cruel just because

02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:29.340
[Guest]: they can be and they have that kind of power over you.

02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:32.100
[Guest]: But my life really opened up when I went to La Martiniere.

02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:38.460
[Guest]: Can I just digress a second here to talk about how much we owe our first teachers, whether

02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:42.660
[Guest]: they're at the workplace or whether they're in school.

02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:44.260
[Guest]: So we had some extraordinary teachers.

02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:48.940
[Guest]: There was Doita Dutta, who became India's first mastermind and we all very chuffed that,

02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.660
[Guest]: you know, a woman had picked up that quiz title.

02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:55.340
[Guest]: Subsequently related to you by marriage as well.

02:52:55.340 --> 02:52:58.340
[Guest]: Yes, my husband's cousin.

02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:02.580
[Guest]: And Indra Sen Gupta, who taught us all about the Constitution, and maybe some of my love

02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:05.820
[Guest]: for the Constitution comes from those early lessons.

02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:10.340
[Guest]: And Sumita D, who was our English teacher, brought the Grapes of Wrath, which was the

02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:16.020
[Guest]: text that we were studying that year in class 11, alive in this classroom in Calcutta in

02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:22.660
[Guest]: a way where suddenly there was a sense of connection, you know, Steinbeck's molten anger

02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:27.260
[Guest]: over the kind of waste that was happening, the squeezing of the migrants into smaller

02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:31.540
[Guest]: and smaller spaces, the relentlessness of keeping them on the road.

02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:32.840
[Guest]: What does that remind you of?

02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:35.620
[Guest]: What did we go through last year?

02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:42.340
[Guest]: Those early lessons just brought home to me, we've talked so much about the joy of reading,

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:45.780
[Guest]: the joy of writing, the uses of it.

02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:49.540
[Guest]: But something I want to say, literature is not an abstraction.

02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:51.820
[Guest]: You know, it's not just a frill added to life.

02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:56.640
[Guest]: It is often something that does more than just witness or document.

02:53:56.640 --> 02:54:00.760
[Guest]: It is really a living thing in itself.

02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:05.200
[Guest]: And Steinbeck's book, I was reading that at the same time that I was reading, I just about

02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:09.960
[Guest]: started reading in Bengali again after years of absence.

02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:17.880
[Guest]: And I was reading Vibhuti Bhushan's Pother Panchali and Tagore's Gora at the same time.

02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:22.020
[Guest]: And it came to me that there's an unselfconscious political novel.

02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:27.060
[Guest]: We think of the political novel today in very limited ways in India.

02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:28.540
[Guest]: It's a novel that makes a statement.

02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:33.500
[Guest]: It's a novel that's in effect, I don't want to diminish people's enthusiasm for writing

02:54:33.500 --> 02:54:34.500
[Guest]: this.

02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:35.960
[Guest]: I don't want to be unkind.

02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:39.680
[Guest]: But a novel is not an editorial, right?

02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:41.780
[Guest]: It is much more than that.

02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:47.940
[Guest]: What Tagore was doing, what Vibhuti was doing in his story of Upu coming out of a very poor

02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:53.260
[Guest]: village and at that he had a Brahmin protagonist, but a Brahmin protagonist who was encountering

02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:59.780
[Guest]: the city for the first time and trying to find his place in it and sometimes dealing

02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:06.300
[Guest]: with an incredible loneliness of the soul and the spirit and sometimes just riveted

02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:07.860
[Guest]: to the promise of the city.

02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:10.500
[Guest]: It's such a contemporary book in that sense.

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:14.940
[Guest]: And Tagore went straight into this question of identity with Gora.

02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:16.860
[Guest]: You know, I don't know whether you've read the novel.

02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:20.420
[Guest]: It was a very popular Bengali serial at one time.

02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:26.180
[Guest]: And Tagore just dealt with the dynama of a man who believes that he is a nationalist,

02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:30.940
[Guest]: that the country should be left to only a certain kind of persons.

02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:36.100
[Guest]: And then he realizes that the secret of his birth makes him the outsider that he's always

02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:38.060
[Guest]: been reeling against in part.

02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:44.940
[Guest]: I'm summarizing terribly, but he wasn't afraid to go into these big questions.

02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:53.340
[Guest]: His novels are political statements in the sense that the word politics is intricately

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:56.620
[Guest]: involved with the life of the people, right?

02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.780
[Guest]: And I think writers like Tagore, filmmakers like Shatrujit Ray, I'm speaking only of my

02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:06.820
[Guest]: part of the country now, but I'm also thinking of Govind Nihalani, I'm thinking of the many

02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:09.340
[Guest]: films that Om Puri acted in.

02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:13.660
[Guest]: That was the water that we were swimming in, you see.

02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:19.500
[Guest]: It was, if it was intellectual, then I think it was unselfconsciously intellectual.

02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:25.660
[Guest]: And those big ideas were also mass available in a way that I think has changed a little

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:28.100
[Guest]: bit over time.

02:56:28.100 --> 02:56:37.420
[Guest]: I went straight from, I went to Stephens for English literature and I remember the only

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:40.940
[Guest]: way that I could justify that choice because there wasn't going to be a job at the end

02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:47.140
[Guest]: of it, was just being aware that I was happy because I was following my heart.

02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:51.300
[Guest]: And then being a little dismayed because following my heart turned out to mean a lot of Dryden

02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:55.140
[Guest]: and Chaucer, and at first I really struggled with that.

02:56:55.140 --> 02:56:58.300
[Guest]: We were reading these texts in a vacuum.

02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:03.420
[Guest]: Even though we had some incredibly gifted teachers, it took professors like Arjun Mahe

02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:09.140
[Guest]: and Vikey Sharma, who passed away in my third year out there, to draw the map of connections

02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:16.660
[Guest]: and to let you know that Shakespeare was, in a sense, Kalidasa's blood brother.

02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:21.460
[Guest]: That Chaucer sitting at his inn, spinning his stories, and you can make a parallel in

02:57:21.460 --> 02:57:27.420
[Guest]: a different way with Krishna Subti collecting all of life around her in Chandni Chowk.

02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:32.380
[Guest]: And I'm not sure that any of the classical education did much for me, but a lot of my

02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:39.260
[Guest]: Stephen's education happened actually on the lawns of Hindu College and wandering around

02:57:39.260 --> 02:57:45.180
[Guest]: to other parts of Delhi University, witnessing in embryo a lot of the debates that would

02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.580
[Guest]: start to rock India.

02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:51.660
[Guest]: The Mandal agitation happened in the final year of our college.

02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:57.300
[Guest]: And I think a certain percentage of the university was automatically and self-righteously against

02:57:57.300 --> 02:57:59.620
[Guest]: reservations.

02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:04.020
[Guest]: It took a lot for people to turn around and look at the composition of their own colleges

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:07.820
[Guest]: and say, aren't we all upper caste here?

02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:09.380
[Guest]: And how did that happen?

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:13.420
[Guest]: And isn't there something that is owed to people who did not have everything that we

02:58:13.420 --> 02:58:18.940
[Guest]: take so casually for granted, whether that is a physical thing like the presence of books

02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:24.660
[Guest]: in the house or access to English or good education, or whether that is something a

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:29.780
[Guest]: little more intangible or confidence, the fact that your surname is its own passport or even

02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:34.860
[Guest]: if it doesn't open doors for you, it doesn't close doors in your face.

02:58:34.860 --> 02:58:40.140
[Guest]: And I don't think that was an easy reckoning for most people because we believe so strongly

02:58:40.140 --> 02:58:42.140
[Guest]: in the myth of our own merit.

02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:47.300
[Guest]: You know, we believe that because we have worked hard, we do not see that other people

02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:52.620
[Guest]: not even allowed to step into the zone where you can start working hard.

02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:56.220
[Guest]: So all of that swirl was happening.

02:58:56.220 --> 02:58:59.740
[Guest]: I joined the business standard rather than do a PhD.

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:05.780
[Guest]: The truth to tell, I was at MA for my JNU and I had this marvellous professor Meenakshi

02:59:05.780 --> 02:59:11.540
[Guest]: Mukherjee who was a translator and a critic and a professor, very much one of those whose

02:59:11.540 --> 02:59:18.780
[Guest]: engagement with writing came from an active immersion in literature as it is practiced.

02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:24.020
[Guest]: And she kept an open curious mind right to the end, had a rousing punch up with Vikram

02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:29.020
[Guest]: Chandra on the subject of authenticity and what is an authentic Indian writer.

02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:33.380
[Guest]: And even when she lost an argument or was in the wrong, I think it was the joy of getting

02:59:33.380 --> 02:59:37.500
[Guest]: into the ring that stays with me.

02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:42.100
[Guest]: And at some point, I think she gently pointed out to me that doing a PhD, which is the track

02:59:42.100 --> 02:59:43.660
[Guest]: that I was on.

02:59:43.660 --> 02:59:49.340
[Guest]: Also, in parenthesis, we Indians are so much about life tracks, right?

02:59:49.340 --> 02:59:52.580
[Guest]: You have to be doctor, lawyer, engineer, IAS.

02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:59.300
[Guest]: And if you're a writer, then you're carefully steered towards BA in India, MA abroad and

02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:02.100
[Guest]: PhD America, you know.

03:00:02.100 --> 03:00:07.380
[Guest]: And then she drew my attention to the content of what I was going to study.

03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:14.540
[Guest]: And that was literary theory of the most high flown there is the unkind, which I have to

03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:18.460
[Guest]: admit that I was completely unsuited to.

03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:23.180
[Guest]: And she said, why do you want to study further with English?

03:00:23.180 --> 03:00:30.180
[Guest]: And I think for the first time in my life, I said, because I love the literature of it.

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:33.060
[Guest]: And I love the fact that most translation happens in English.

03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:37.980
[Guest]: So it's not just English, it opens up all of the languages of the world to me.

03:00:37.980 --> 03:00:41.380
[Guest]: And someday I want to write my own books.

03:00:41.380 --> 03:00:45.740
[Guest]: And I think it was the first time I'd said that aloud and I was a little shocked by this

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:49.700
[Guest]: unseemly impractical ambition.

03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:54.220
[Guest]: And she said, whatever else you do, don't do a PhD, go out and work for a bit.

03:00:54.220 --> 03:00:57.860
[Guest]: Try your hand at being a journalist or in publishing or something, get a practical sense

03:00:57.860 --> 03:00:58.860
[Guest]: of life.

03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:08.100
[Guest]: But don't kill yourself by disappearing down the wonderful, but for me, perhaps not nourishing

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:12.580
[Guest]: fields of Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha and the rest of it.

03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:15.020
[Guest]: And so I tried out for every job that I could find.

03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:19.420
[Guest]: I briefly taught at nursery school as a teacher.

03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:25.500
[Guest]: I was a paralegal and I worked on the early version of Durex, which is what became the

03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:28.220
[Guest]: Lexis database.

03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:32.060
[Guest]: And I was absorbed in the different, we've talked about this, I think, as friends once

03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:33.060
[Guest]: or twice.

03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:37.660
[Guest]: But I was just fascinated by the thought that crime changes according to the part of the

03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.020
[Guest]: country that you come from.

03:01:39.020 --> 03:01:41.900
[Guest]: And in a sense, you know, we're conformist.

03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:46.380
[Guest]: In one part of the country, you have to push people down wells in order to kill them.

03:01:46.380 --> 03:01:49.580
[Guest]: And in the other, it's a little bit of a social solacism.

03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:55.100
[Guest]: If you murder somebody using anything else but a gandasa or an axe, you're not really

03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:58.260
[Guest]: supposed to pick up a country made pistol.

03:01:58.260 --> 03:02:05.340
[Guest]: And Bengal was given to poisonings, for example, UP, parts of it favoured the country made

03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:10.060
[Guest]: pistol, which was very sporting because that had an equal chance of blowing up in the hand

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:14.500
[Guest]: of the would-be murderer and, you know, taking him down.

03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:21.820
[Guest]: And there were places where you simply chop people into pieces, inevitably burying a body

03:02:21.820 --> 03:02:26.980
[Guest]: in your own backyard, thereby giving the police a chance to put you behind bars.

03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:30.780
[Guest]: But it all had the sense of being extremely ritualistic.

03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:36.860
[Guest]: I was deeply fascinated and then, for reasons known only to themselves, business standard

03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:38.980
[Guest]: employed me.

03:02:38.980 --> 03:02:46.340
[Guest]: And I think that was such, I was so lucky in retrospect, not just because between people

03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:53.340
[Guest]: like TN9 and Tony Joseph, Pratik Kanjilal, Kanika Dutta, some of my editors out there,

03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:57.140
[Guest]: there were people who taught me skill, yes, and the craft of reporting and the whole thing

03:02:57.140 --> 03:02:59.820
[Guest]: of go back and double-check a source.

03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:04.900
[Guest]: From Tony, I learned something invaluable, which is that the most articulate person in

03:03:04.900 --> 03:03:08.860
[Guest]: a room is not necessarily the person who knows the most.

03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:13.620
[Guest]: Sometimes it's the quiet people standing around whom you really need to interview.

03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:18.900
[Guest]: Tony also taught me about multiple perspectives, you know, never take anything for granted,

03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:21.860
[Guest]: just go back and check and recheck and all of that.

03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:26.900
[Guest]: And because I was obviously useless at the economics and finance side of things, and

03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:33.100
[Guest]: I was never going to make a political journalist, I was put on the arts beat.

03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:36.860
[Guest]: It seems extraordinary because we give so much space over to so many things.

03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:42.660
[Guest]: But in those days, the art section was about a 10-page, 12-page section, you know, and

03:03:42.660 --> 03:03:45.260
[Guest]: about three of those pages were on the arts directly.

03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:48.540
[Guest]: So my job was utterly delightful.

03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:58.780
[Guest]: It was to go out and meet people in this new India of the then early 1990s, who were teaching

03:03:58.780 --> 03:04:03.460
[Guest]: themselves an idiom that was both Indian and international.

03:04:03.460 --> 03:04:07.500
[Guest]: And the other part of the job, which I loved so much, was to go down to the publishing

03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:13.340
[Guest]: houses, which were in those days, all in a row in Daryaganj, in the middle of those crowded

03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:19.780
[Guest]: Delhi streets with bazaars that had gone back to literally the 17th or 14th century around

03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:25.500
[Guest]: them, and pick up books that were suitable for review or extract.

03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:29.660
[Guest]: I was in absolute heaven, but it was only later that I realized that I'd lucked into

03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:33.620
[Guest]: an organization that also prized integrity.

03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:38.220
[Guest]: These sound like such old-fashioned things, don't they?

03:04:38.220 --> 03:04:40.340
[Guest]: Like I said, legacy person.

03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:41.340
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:43.660
[Guest]: You have to stop me when I'm running on and on though.

03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:44.660
[Amit Varma]: No, no, please.

03:04:44.660 --> 03:04:45.660
[Amit Varma]: It's delightful.

03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:51.580
[Amit Varma]: I feel like having a conversation with you is like being a leaf on a river and you don't

03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:55.140
[Amit Varma]: know where you're going and the waves are coming from here and there and you're just

03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:56.140
[Amit Varma]: flowing.

03:04:56.140 --> 03:04:57.140
[Amit Varma]: But it's great fun.

03:04:57.140 --> 03:04:58.140
[Amit Varma]: I'm the happiest leaf ever.

03:04:58.140 --> 03:04:59.140
[Amit Varma]: So do continue.

03:04:59.140 --> 03:05:06.300
[Guest]: I'm going to repeat that, just stop me anytime that I start overflowing the banks or whatever.

03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:10.060
[Guest]: But it was a great introduction to the city as well.

03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:15.540
[Guest]: And if you want to know what Delhi was like at that time, this was the early 90s.

03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:20.060
[Guest]: We were just beginning to feel the beat and the pulse of liberalization and most of that

03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:26.820
[Guest]: was felt in the dismantling of the License Raj that held people back so terribly.

03:05:26.820 --> 03:05:29.860
[Guest]: I see a little bit of a parallel to that now.

03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:33.460
[Guest]: We were talking about the creative economy earlier.

03:05:33.460 --> 03:05:38.580
[Guest]: And some of the barriers in place, whether it's a tax barrier or whether it's just the

03:05:38.580 --> 03:05:44.540
[Guest]: absence of resources that help somebody who doesn't already have a network of power and

03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:49.120
[Guest]: influence to join in, you know.

03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:56.380
[Guest]: Some of those to see those come down at that time and to see the breath of a fresh energy.

03:05:56.380 --> 03:06:02.220
[Guest]: Delhi's a city built around a cluster of small and ancient villages.

03:06:02.220 --> 03:06:06.380
[Guest]: And in that time, Bina Rahmani changed the landscape entirely by taking over the house

03:06:06.380 --> 03:06:10.260
[Guest]: cars village and setting up restaurants out there.

03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:16.020
[Guest]: And of course, there was a lot of Delhiwala's ooing and aahing over the cuteness of seeing

03:06:16.020 --> 03:06:22.100
[Guest]: cows and buffaloes as they went off for expensive dinners facing the house car snake.

03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:29.540
[Guest]: But I think she actually started something that allowed us to knit our past and our hopeful

03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:30.540
[Guest]: future together.

03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:34.020
[Guest]: Delhi was a very anxious city.

03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:37.500
[Guest]: You know, if you look at it from a psychic point of view, I think it was always comparing

03:06:37.500 --> 03:06:44.980
[Guest]: itself either to the slick sophistication of Bombay or it was hoping someday to be like

03:06:44.980 --> 03:06:49.260
[Guest]: a London or New York, but aware that it was lagging behind.

03:06:49.260 --> 03:06:53.220
[Guest]: And it takes some time to understand that you're sitting in a century, you know, you're

03:06:53.220 --> 03:06:57.940
[Guest]: living in a city that is literally built on the centuries.

03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:02.100
[Guest]: When I walk around the city today, sometimes it seems populated with writers either living

03:07:02.100 --> 03:07:05.060
[Guest]: or by the ghosts of writers.

03:07:05.060 --> 03:07:09.340
[Guest]: You know, across the road, there's Amir Khosrow, down the road from my house, there's Rahim

03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:11.820
[Guest]: Khan of the Dohas.

03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:16.820
[Guest]: And in more contemporary terms in Sujan Singh Park, there's Khushwant Singh, across the

03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:21.580
[Guest]: river in Mayur Vihar, there's a school of younger writers who cut their teeth in places

03:07:21.580 --> 03:07:26.100
[Guest]: like Lajpat Nagar or Paharganj or whatever it is.

03:07:26.100 --> 03:07:32.180
[Guest]: And when you live in a city like that, it's not about whether writing is doing well, which

03:07:32.180 --> 03:07:36.660
[Guest]: seems to be sometimes the only question we're asking of writing, you know, that anxiety

03:07:36.660 --> 03:07:39.220
[Guest]: of performance.

03:07:39.220 --> 03:07:44.820
[Guest]: It's a city that just breeds stories under the roughness, under the aggression.

03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:48.460
[Guest]: And the aggression is a serious thing.

03:07:48.460 --> 03:07:52.220
[Guest]: And I think I just jumped into that life.

03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:58.860
[Guest]: Even as a newly married woman, my experience of the city was tremendous independence.

03:07:58.860 --> 03:08:04.020
[Guest]: None of us could afford fancy houses and we all lived clustered in versatis or in the

03:08:04.020 --> 03:08:08.580
[Guest]: first floor of a tumbling bungalow, you know, that kind of thing.

03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:13.860
[Guest]: And we all ate khichdi towards the end of the month when the budget was running out.

03:08:13.860 --> 03:08:15.740
[Guest]: And we were all incredibly happy.

03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:18.820
[Guest]: And what we talked about was books and film and music.

03:08:18.820 --> 03:08:26.580
[Guest]: And again, in our homes, what flowed was multiple languages, multiple ways of seeing.

03:08:26.580 --> 03:08:32.580
[Guest]: At some point, the Hindi and the English worlds of the city became a little segregated, you

03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:33.580
[Guest]: know.

03:08:33.580 --> 03:08:37.700
[Guest]: The English book launches happened at fancy five star hotels.

03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:42.460
[Guest]: And we lost something that used to be an organic connection between the Hindi, Urdu, English

03:08:42.460 --> 03:08:44.860
[Guest]: worlds, Punjabi as well.

03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:49.700
[Guest]: These four languages used to move in and out of each other's lives.

03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:56.940
[Guest]: I think when I started off as a young journalist, if you were on the arts beat, you were expected

03:08:56.940 --> 03:08:58.740
[Guest]: to be bilingual.

03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:01.440
[Guest]: It wasn't said, it wasn't stated upfront.

03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:05.080
[Guest]: But it was assumed that if you were Indian, you would have at least one other language

03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:07.140
[Guest]: at your command.

03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:14.540
[Guest]: And I don't want to lecture people at all, because I am not truly, I write only in English.

03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:16.700
[Guest]: I don't write in Bengali, because I don't live in Calcutta.

03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:22.220
[Guest]: And I feel very strongly that it's best to write in a language that you're surrounded

03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:23.540
[Guest]: by.

03:09:23.540 --> 03:09:28.740
[Guest]: I don't write in Hindi because there's a great love for that language, but I really don't

03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:35.620
[Guest]: have the literary heft to even attempt that.

03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:39.580
[Guest]: But I think our lives are poorer for living in only one language when we have so much

03:09:39.580 --> 03:09:44.300
[Guest]: choice and when we are surrounded by so much.

03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:51.180
[Guest]: Gitanjali Shree said this recently with Tomb of Sand, when she won the International Booker.

03:09:51.180 --> 03:09:55.100
[Guest]: And her first thing was not a triumphalism about the language that she writes in, which

03:09:55.100 --> 03:10:01.500
[Guest]: is Hindi, but just a reminder that we are lucky in a way that maybe we don't see so

03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:02.500
[Guest]: easily.

03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:08.340
[Guest]: We live in a country where there are a thousand streams of literatures, languages, some big,

03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:12.460
[Guest]: some limited to just 100 speakers or so.

03:10:12.460 --> 03:10:20.100
[Guest]: But you know, being aware of that stream or living only in English is also not the best

03:10:20.100 --> 03:10:22.860
[Amit Varma]: choice you could make.

03:10:22.860 --> 03:10:28.180
[Amit Varma]: So many strands to pick up on, or should I say many tributaries to go down on, as you've

03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:30.380
[Amit Varma]: kind of made your path.

03:10:30.380 --> 03:10:31.700
[Amit Varma]: So here's the first of them.

03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:37.380
[Amit Varma]: You know, when one of the subjects that I think about more and more is how are we shaped,

03:10:37.380 --> 03:10:40.980
[Amit Varma]: how are we shaped as people in all the ways that we are shaped.

03:10:40.980 --> 03:10:47.180
[Amit Varma]: And when I look back on myself as a young man, I realized that the young me 25 years

03:10:47.180 --> 03:10:53.940
[Amit Varma]: ago was shaped in many ways that I now realize in hindsight by, for example, by just my home,

03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:54.940
[Amit Varma]: by my parents.

03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:58.380
[Amit Varma]: I think I, from my mother, I got a sense of social arrogance.

03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:02.260
[Amit Varma]: From my father, I got a sense of intellectual arrogance, and I got good things from them

03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:07.060
[Amit Varma]: also like the love of reading and the respect for the arts and all of that, you know.

03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:11.180
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, once you reflect on yourself and you become conscious of these things,

03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:13.540
[Amit Varma]: and you can begin to change and eliminate them.

03:11:13.540 --> 03:11:17.940
[Amit Varma]: But it's interesting to think, you know, how you became what you became.

03:11:17.940 --> 03:11:22.780
[Amit Varma]: And when I was reading your book, you had this part where you were talking about the

03:11:22.780 --> 03:11:27.700
[Amit Varma]: Bengali obsession for intellectualism, as it were, you referred to an Amitav Ghosh essay

03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:31.580
[Amit Varma]: where he wrote about the bong obsession with the Nobel Prize.

03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:35.460
[Amit Varma]: And there's a certain bongness, certainly in my upbringing, because my mother, of course,

03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:36.460
[Amit Varma]: was Bengali.

03:11:36.460 --> 03:11:40.220
[Amit Varma]: And my father was, although Punjabi born in Lahore, but basically from childhood just

03:11:40.220 --> 03:11:42.900
[Amit Varma]: grew up in Calcutta, where he met my mother and all that.

03:11:42.900 --> 03:11:46.420
[Amit Varma]: So culturally, completely Bengali and all of that.

03:11:46.420 --> 03:11:52.700
[Amit Varma]: And that set me to wondering that how much of these qualities, the sort of social arrogance,

03:11:52.700 --> 03:11:58.740
[Amit Varma]: which partly, of course, came from the privilege of, you know, being located where we were,

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:04.140
[Amit Varma]: and the intellectual arrogance, how much of it perhaps was a partly Bengali heritage also?

03:12:04.140 --> 03:12:07.780
[Amit Varma]: That's really a hard question to answer and almost a rhetorical one.

03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:14.060
[Amit Varma]: But the question I pose to you is that, when you look back at the way that you were shaped,

03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:17.380
[Amit Varma]: that what you became, you know, some of those connections are easy to draw.

03:12:17.380 --> 03:12:20.700
[Amit Varma]: You were, of course, surrounded by books, it was that culture of reading.

03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:24.580
[Amit Varma]: So of course, you would become a reader, you know, that comes from there.

03:12:24.580 --> 03:12:30.660
[Amit Varma]: But what else, you know, what are the like, I often think that, you know, we use the term

03:12:30.660 --> 03:12:35.860
[Amit Varma]: earlier in the conversation, mimetic desire, and I think there can also be mimetic personalities,

03:12:35.860 --> 03:12:40.300
[Amit Varma]: that what we are is contingent on where we are located, and so much around us, and we

03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:44.460
[Amit Varma]: don't realize to what extent that there is, we think that we are autonomous in the way

03:12:44.460 --> 03:12:48.180
[Amit Varma]: that we shape ourselves, that I can be what I want to be.

03:12:48.180 --> 03:12:50.100
[Amit Varma]: But often, it's not so simple.

03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:55.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, you earlier referred to how different crimes in different places in the country,

03:12:55.260 --> 03:12:56.980
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of crimes.

03:12:56.980 --> 03:13:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And that got me to thinking that, in many ways, geography can be destiny as well, right?

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:06.420
[Amit Varma]: How we are shaped is just a combination of all of these things.

03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:09.140
[Amit Varma]: So at one level, of course, there are the genes that you get.

03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:13.300
[Amit Varma]: But as Steven Pinker said, you know, nature gives you knobs, nurture turns them.

03:13:13.300 --> 03:13:18.380
[Amit Varma]: And so beyond what you are born as, you have all these influences around you.

03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:24.460
[Amit Varma]: So just looking back on yourself, what do you think are those sort of influences which

03:13:24.460 --> 03:13:29.420
[Amit Varma]: kind of shaped you that in a parallel universe, if they were not there, you might be a completely

03:13:29.420 --> 03:13:30.780
[Amit Varma]: different person?

03:13:30.780 --> 03:13:36.060
[Amit Varma]: And then, as a sort of a mirror image of that answer, what do you think is essential to

03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:42.620
[Amit Varma]: you that even if you were born in a humble Tamil household or in Nigeria, that you would

03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:44.220
[Amit Varma]: still be this?

03:13:44.220 --> 03:13:50.460
[Amit Varma]: But you know, so it's sort of a rambling river like question itself, but...

03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:52.940
[Guest]: It's a beautiful question.

03:13:52.940 --> 03:13:57.740
[Guest]: It's a beautiful question because we're getting to something real rather than, you know, the

03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:04.700
[Guest]: polite faces that we often put on in a formal conversation or an interview.

03:14:04.700 --> 03:14:13.260
[Guest]: And I think I was aware early on that a lot of the Bengali sense of exceptionalism, some

03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:19.260
[Guest]: of it was built on something that is really, really beautiful about Calcutta, Bankura,

03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:27.300
[Guest]: a large part of Bengal, which is the genuine appreciation for life in all its forms and

03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:32.980
[Guest]: for craft, not as a snobbish, you know, part of life or, you know, they worked so hard

03:14:32.980 --> 03:14:38.340
[Guest]: on their dancing or their music or whatever, but as a beautiful thing to do with a human

03:14:38.340 --> 03:14:42.140
[Guest]: life, you know.

03:14:42.140 --> 03:14:49.500
[Guest]: That stream is very gentle and sometimes subsumed by the fact that Bengal often speaks, as Parimal

03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:55.420
[Guest]: Bhattacharya reminds you in his book, his recent book, of Bengal as though all of Calcutta

03:14:55.420 --> 03:14:58.420
[Guest]: is Bengal, and that's absolutely not true.

03:14:58.420 --> 03:15:03.700
[Guest]: And there's a deep anxiety among Bengalis, which I'm probably going to get a lot of hate

03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:09.500
[Guest]: mail over this at some point, about being irrelevant, about being left out, no longer,

03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:14.300
[Guest]: you know, from the time that it stopped being the first city of empire, it's off to a side

03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:21.160
[Guest]: Bengal likes to think of itself as revolutionary, but just to digress, one of those famous digressions

03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:27.060
[Guest]: for a second, I put together a small collection from the Modern Review, which was a publication

03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:34.260
[Guest]: that came out in 1907 and continued till 1950, capturing the years of the freedom struggle,

03:15:34.260 --> 03:15:41.780
[Guest]: and it was run by my husband's grandfather, Ramananda Babu, Ramananda Chatterjee.

03:15:41.780 --> 03:15:46.100
[Guest]: The Modern Review itself was an extremely eclectic magazine and it positioned itself

03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:53.100
[Guest]: not as centrist, but as a magazine that would listen to the Congress, but not always fully

03:15:53.100 --> 03:16:00.620
[Guest]: agree with them that had space for more than just that, you know, it was somewhere in between.

03:16:00.620 --> 03:16:05.940
[Guest]: But it was not the only, it was a brilliant endeavor and all of that, but it was only

03:16:05.940 --> 03:16:11.460
[Guest]: when I started to go into the history of little magazines, that you realize they're everywhere.

03:16:11.460 --> 03:16:16.900
[Guest]: There isn't a region in India that hasn't had a strong intellectual literary cultural

03:16:16.900 --> 03:16:18.620
[Guest]: tradition.

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:28.500
[Guest]: The whole sense of Bengal as more than the rest does need to be laid to rest, you know.

03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:32.780
[Guest]: I don't think I have much patience with that intellectual arrogance either.

03:16:32.780 --> 03:16:39.660
[Guest]: With my own family, I think when you come across family pride, you start to ask yourself

03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:42.380
[Guest]: after a while what that pride is in.

03:16:42.380 --> 03:16:47.620
[Guest]: One of our family members, my great-granduncle, was somebody who took an active part in the

03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:55.220
[Guest]: freedom struggle and was quite a well-known figure in the years immediately after independence.

03:16:55.220 --> 03:17:02.820
[Guest]: But when that story was told to me, sometimes it seemed that what was important about him

03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:06.740
[Guest]: was that he was important.

03:17:06.740 --> 03:17:11.700
[Guest]: When I went into that story, what I found incredibly touching was that like most Indians,

03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:15.460
[Guest]: he was just one generation out of a village.

03:17:15.460 --> 03:17:18.860
[Guest]: He was brought up in fairly humble circumstances.

03:17:18.860 --> 03:17:26.420
[Guest]: His family was neither affluent nor powerful, but they had a kind of integrity, a wholeness

03:17:26.420 --> 03:17:29.020
[Guest]: to them that they passed on to him.

03:17:29.020 --> 03:17:35.300
[Guest]: In his relationship with the British before India was independence, he, like a lot of

03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:39.780
[Guest]: the nationalists, we keep going back to them, he, like a lot of the nationalists, didn't

03:17:39.780 --> 03:17:41.500
[Guest]: have an arrogance about him.

03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:42.500
[Guest]: He just had a confidence.

03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:48.260
[Guest]: I've often looked back at that and thought to myself, where did they have the confidence

03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:53.700
[Guest]: from when they were told all along, when everything surrounding them said that they were second-class

03:17:53.700 --> 03:17:59.540
[Guest]: citizens, that Indians were inferior, or that the real version of this, you should be grateful

03:17:59.540 --> 03:18:05.700
[Guest]: to the British for all that they have done, and you are not fit to govern your own country.

03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:11.700
[Guest]: And then to assert your own selfhood, that's the part where I feel a kind of associated

03:18:11.700 --> 03:18:12.700
[Guest]: pride.

03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:18.660
[Guest]: I find it very difficult to feel ancestral pride per se though, because in that case

03:18:18.660 --> 03:18:23.260
[Guest]: you're taking credit for somebody else's achievements.

03:18:23.260 --> 03:18:30.740
[Guest]: What I prize about my heritage is not the cocoon part of it.

03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:36.780
[Guest]: I prize the fact that there were people in my family for many generations who went where

03:18:36.780 --> 03:18:39.620
[Guest]: their curiosity led them.

03:18:39.620 --> 03:18:44.660
[Guest]: And I also prize the people who were willing to be ordinary, you know.

03:18:44.660 --> 03:18:49.140
[Guest]: But there are parts of your family that you step away from as well, and I don't want to

03:18:49.140 --> 03:18:55.700
[Guest]: be hurtful to anyone who's listening, but it did take a certain amount of reckoning

03:18:55.700 --> 03:19:04.340
[Guest]: to say that maybe it's best to put aside a certain belief that we have made it on our

03:19:04.340 --> 03:19:05.340
[Guest]: own.

03:19:05.340 --> 03:19:09.660
[Guest]: You know, if you are born into certain things because of an accident of birth and whatever

03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:15.700
[Guest]: that is, that might be financial privilege, it is often in this country majoritarian privilege.

03:19:15.700 --> 03:19:20.060
[Guest]: You have had it easier than others, and it takes away nothing from what you see as the

03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:23.740
[Guest]: successes of your own life to just acknowledge that.

03:19:23.740 --> 03:19:31.540
[Guest]: You don't have to, you know, cringe about it, but you do have to see that it was not

03:19:31.540 --> 03:19:39.060
[Guest]: because of your efforts that you were born into a circumstance where you could, you know,

03:19:39.060 --> 03:19:41.180
[Guest]: access a good education or whatever.

03:19:41.180 --> 03:19:45.060
[Guest]: I think the one thing that was surprising about our lives though is because my grandfather

03:19:45.060 --> 03:19:52.620
[Guest]: died the year I was born, my mother's father, I never knew him.

03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:58.300
[Guest]: I only knew of him, he was a judge who loved the law.

03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:04.300
[Guest]: I think we took it for granted that we were brought up by a matriarch, and it was only

03:20:04.300 --> 03:20:08.740
[Guest]: years later when a cousin of mine pointed that out that I said, okay, maybe one of the

03:20:08.740 --> 03:20:15.940
[Guest]: reasons why I think that women should be in control is partly because of this.

03:20:15.940 --> 03:20:16.940
[Guest]: What is just me?

03:20:16.940 --> 03:20:22.060
[Guest]: I think my stubbornness, actually, more than anything else.

03:20:22.060 --> 03:20:26.780
[Guest]: You know, the rest of it, if you peel away the privileges, would I have been a reader,

03:20:26.780 --> 03:20:28.460
[Guest]: would I have been a writer?

03:20:28.460 --> 03:20:29.460
[Guest]: I really don't know.

03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:30.460
[Guest]: I really don't think so.

03:20:30.460 --> 03:20:36.300
[Guest]: If I'd been married off and I was 16 or 17 or deprived of education, maybe I would have

03:20:36.300 --> 03:20:37.900
[Guest]: thought that that was the right part.

03:20:37.900 --> 03:20:44.460
[Guest]: Where I find myself on the shakiest ground is actually with some of the principles that

03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:51.700
[Guest]: I feel so deeply, you know, the belief in democracy, the love of a nation that is a

03:20:51.700 --> 03:20:56.220
[Guest]: diverse nation that has space for everybody equally.

03:20:56.220 --> 03:21:00.580
[Guest]: And I honestly cannot tell, this is such a terrible confession to make, but it's a very

03:21:00.580 --> 03:21:02.300
[Guest]: honest confession.

03:21:02.300 --> 03:21:07.180
[Guest]: If I'd been brought up in a family that thought it was okay and natural to be bigoted, to

03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:13.580
[Guest]: discriminate against whoever else, whoever else was not like you, you know, non-Hindus,

03:21:13.580 --> 03:21:23.140
[Guest]: Muslims, anyone else, really, there's a shifting state always to that, women who read too much.

03:21:23.140 --> 03:21:24.700
[Guest]: Would I have just imbibed that water?

03:21:24.700 --> 03:21:27.140
[Guest]: Would I have not questioned it?

03:21:27.140 --> 03:21:31.960
[Guest]: Something that Samit Basu, who was again a Delhi writer, says, and I think it's in The

03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:34.820
[Guest]: City Inside or he said it in an interview.

03:21:34.820 --> 03:21:40.140
[Guest]: He pointed out that no matter how independent and free we all think we are, it is surprising

03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:46.660
[Guest]: and illuminating that so many of us take on the professions prescribed to us by our caste

03:21:46.660 --> 03:21:49.060
[Guest]: identities, you know.

03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:55.540
[Guest]: So a certain kind of, it's not to do with Bengali-ness anymore, but we instinctively,

03:21:55.540 --> 03:22:02.940
[Guest]: you know, gravitate to this person is an accountant or that person is a teacher, not realizing

03:22:02.940 --> 03:22:08.380
[Guest]: that it is the ancient shadow of caste somehow making itself felt.

03:22:08.380 --> 03:22:11.460
[Guest]: So maybe we have a little less agency out here.

03:22:11.460 --> 03:22:16.860
[Guest]: The part of me that is completely my own aside from the stubbornness, I think no matter what

03:22:16.860 --> 03:22:19.300
[Guest]: I would have been creative.

03:22:19.300 --> 03:22:21.180
[Guest]: And by creative, I don't mean that shallowly.

03:22:21.180 --> 03:22:28.580
[Guest]: I mean that I think most humans are born into a sense of play, which is the first foundation

03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:34.380
[Guest]: for creativity, a sense of questioning, which may be rapidly shut down, but it's there.

03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:38.660
[Guest]: And a sense of wonder, those three things, okay.

03:22:38.660 --> 03:22:44.020
[Guest]: And I think there's something in me that just refuses to roll over and die, no matter what

03:22:44.020 --> 03:22:49.860
[Guest]: other minor challenges I've gone through, whatever it is.

03:22:49.860 --> 03:22:56.060
[Guest]: I mean, in my childhood, for example, there was one person, a much, much older, not my

03:22:56.060 --> 03:23:02.060
[Guest]: father or uncles or brothers, but somebody who was an older relative, who was extraordinarily

03:23:02.060 --> 03:23:08.380
[Guest]: abusive when I was about eight, and the period from eight to 12 was darkened by that abuse.

03:23:08.380 --> 03:23:13.180
[Guest]: And the shadow of that abuse also took me a long, long while to work through in my twenties

03:23:13.180 --> 03:23:15.300
[Guest]: and thirties.

03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:20.660
[Guest]: I don't mean this, again, to be overgrateful, but at different times in my life, particularly

03:23:20.660 --> 03:23:25.500
[Guest]: when I was a reporter on The Gender Beat, and I met a lot of women who were traumatized

03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:30.660
[Guest]: for similar reasons or who were in either facing domestic violence or facing the big

03:23:30.660 --> 03:23:36.460
[Guest]: me too that we don't have the space for, which is the number of people who are abused as

03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:41.020
[Guest]: agricultural laborers or as factory workers.

03:23:41.020 --> 03:23:45.700
[Guest]: And there's a prohibition against seeking help.

03:23:45.700 --> 03:23:49.500
[Guest]: And there is no availability of the resources that you need.

03:23:49.500 --> 03:23:54.420
[Guest]: And I always had the choice to find the help that I needed, and to use creative ways to

03:23:54.420 --> 03:24:01.340
[Guest]: move through whatever experiences had been distressing, you see.

03:24:01.340 --> 03:24:08.860
[Amit Varma]: So here's my next question, which picks up from a couple of the things that you sort

03:24:08.860 --> 03:24:11.740
[Amit Varma]: of mentioned, including where we just ended.

03:24:11.740 --> 03:24:17.620
[Amit Varma]: There's this lovely passage about your Didima in your book, where you write, you could trace

03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:22.420
[Amit Varma]: a historical development of women's romances by studying the gradual shift from outback

03:24:22.420 --> 03:24:26.180
[Amit Varma]: love and doctor and nurse romances through the Greek millionaire and Italian count phase

03:24:26.180 --> 03:24:30.220
[Amit Varma]: up to the modern phenomenon of soft core erotica and doctor-doctor romances.

03:24:30.220 --> 03:24:34.980
[Amit Varma]: Didima disapproved of the erotica on the Umberto Eco principle that porn got in the way of

03:24:34.980 --> 03:24:36.060
[Amit Varma]: a good story.

03:24:36.060 --> 03:24:40.620
[Amit Varma]: But she liked the egalitarianism of doctors dating rather than doctors hitting on nurses.

03:24:40.620 --> 03:24:45.260
[Amit Varma]: In his office and his bedroom, my uncle maintained an eclectic collection of paperbacks on subjects

03:24:45.260 --> 03:24:50.460
[Amit Varma]: as varied as Tibetan Buddhism, physics via the dancing bully masters, classical music

03:24:50.460 --> 03:24:54.140
[Amit Varma]: and jazz, and his passion architecture, stop quote.

03:24:54.140 --> 03:25:03.400
[Amit Varma]: And what sort of struck me here was how their reading is kind of different, right?

03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:06.260
[Amit Varma]: And I was recently in Chandigarh, my dad had died last year.

03:25:06.260 --> 03:25:10.820
[Amit Varma]: So we were clearing away his house and just looking at the last remnants and seeing what

03:25:10.820 --> 03:25:13.540
[Amit Varma]: we wanted and what we didn't want.

03:25:13.540 --> 03:25:17.820
[Amit Varma]: And I came across a lot of letters, which I have kept from my mother to my father, none

03:25:17.820 --> 03:25:22.880
[Amit Varma]: the other way around, but letters from my mom to my dad all the way from the 1980s onwards.

03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:27.740
[Amit Varma]: And they were very interesting, because one of the things I realized was that all through

03:25:27.740 --> 03:25:31.700
[Amit Varma]: their marriage, they were desperately lonely people, right?

03:25:31.700 --> 03:25:35.620
[Amit Varma]: And it was a sort of they were separately lonely, and it was the marriage was a kind

03:25:35.620 --> 03:25:37.520
[Amit Varma]: of mutual loneliness.

03:25:37.520 --> 03:25:43.020
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it was not something either of them could have helped in the sense, I

03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:48.340
[Amit Varma]: think my mother was sort of there, not out of choice, but that's just the way marriages

03:25:48.340 --> 03:25:49.780
[Amit Varma]: worked.

03:25:49.780 --> 03:25:55.380
[Amit Varma]: And my father's loneliness in a sense for self inflicted, but what is self inflicted

03:25:55.380 --> 03:25:59.940
[Amit Varma]: and what is not and how much agency do people have and how much are they slaves of the ways

03:25:59.940 --> 03:26:03.580
[Amit Varma]: in which they are shaped is all open to question.

03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:09.060
[Amit Varma]: And that sort of got me to thinking about like, for me, in an ideal marriage, your partner

03:26:09.060 --> 03:26:12.020
[Amit Varma]: has to be your best friend, or at least a very close friend, right?

03:26:12.020 --> 03:26:15.260
[Amit Varma]: It's about that companionship is essential.

03:26:15.260 --> 03:26:19.540
[Amit Varma]: But I realized that all through the decades and all through human history until now, certainly

03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:22.260
[Amit Varma]: in India, it's not been that way.

03:26:22.260 --> 03:26:26.980
[Amit Varma]: It's sort of been instrumental, that they are playing roles.

03:26:26.980 --> 03:26:33.340
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, in a sense, you play those roles, and there isn't sort of that friendship

03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:35.660
[Amit Varma]: or that communication or whatever.

03:26:35.660 --> 03:26:38.340
[Amit Varma]: And women are circumscribed to what those roles are.

03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:42.900
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Peggy Mohan, who wrote that wonderful book about the evolution of

03:26:42.900 --> 03:26:44.220
[Amit Varma]: languages.

03:26:44.220 --> 03:26:50.260
[Amit Varma]: And there also there is an interesting sort of learning that also points to this, where

03:26:50.260 --> 03:26:54.700
[Amit Varma]: she points out that when the Aryans first came to India, they were whether you call

03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:58.540
[Amit Varma]: them migrants or invaders or whatever, it was men only, right?

03:26:58.540 --> 03:27:03.300
[Amit Varma]: Because all their travelers, migrants, whatever, they would be hordes of men, and they would

03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:05.940
[Amit Varma]: marry local women, whether by force or not, we don't know.

03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:08.220
[Amit Varma]: But whatever, they would marry local women.

03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:12.660
[Amit Varma]: And Peggy's point was a point about language, but a point about much else, which is that

03:27:12.660 --> 03:27:17.420
[Amit Varma]: therefore, the languages they spoke would be different languages, that the women of

03:27:17.420 --> 03:27:21.340
[Amit Varma]: a family would speak a particular kind of language, and the men would speak a particular

03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:22.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of language.

03:27:22.540 --> 03:27:26.020
[Amit Varma]: And initially, of course, it would be because the languages are different.

03:27:26.020 --> 03:27:28.420
[Amit Varma]: But then gradually, it kind of remained this way.

03:27:28.420 --> 03:27:32.700
[Amit Varma]: So a little child growing up when a boy would be with the mother, he would learn a bit of

03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:36.260
[Amit Varma]: the mother's language, but then he would be in a men's world and he would learn the other

03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:40.440
[Amit Varma]: language while the girls would grow up and continue learning that kind of language.

03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:47.860
[Amit Varma]: And this also seems a powerful metaphor for a kind of separation that is sort of there.

03:27:47.860 --> 03:27:52.340
[Amit Varma]: And just sort of going back to what you said about your grandmother and how she's reading

03:27:52.340 --> 03:27:56.860
[Amit Varma]: a particular kind of books and your uncle is reading a different kind of book.

03:27:56.860 --> 03:28:01.940
[Guest]: What you were picking up on there was actually something that was incredibly formative for

03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:03.940
[Guest]: me even though I didn't realize it.

03:28:03.940 --> 03:28:09.180
[Guest]: You know, in our schooling, we were often not schooling, but in our colleges, certainly,

03:28:09.180 --> 03:28:14.100
[Guest]: we often taught that there's a difference between high and low literature.

03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:22.020
[Guest]: And a lot of even Hindi literature or Bengali literature marks a little distinction, a little

03:28:22.020 --> 03:28:27.140
[Guest]: snobbery thing, you know, that's cheap literature, that's bestsellers, in the same way that English

03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:28.580
[Guest]: does.

03:28:28.580 --> 03:28:35.420
[Guest]: And because I had so much respect for my grandmother, not as my grandmother, but as a person, she

03:28:35.420 --> 03:28:38.860
[Guest]: had an incredibly open mind.

03:28:38.860 --> 03:28:45.980
[Guest]: By which I mean that when she first encountered the concept of LGBT relationships, rather

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:50.780
[Guest]: than being shocked as many people in her generation were and saying that's forbidden.

03:28:50.780 --> 03:28:53.460
[Guest]: She was extremely curious about this.

03:28:53.460 --> 03:28:58.220
[Guest]: This was about 20 years before the laws changed in India.

03:28:58.220 --> 03:29:03.300
[Guest]: And she asked me, she said, do you think that it is possible for you to fall in love with

03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:05.140
[Guest]: a woman?

03:29:05.140 --> 03:29:12.580
[Guest]: And I said, I think if all of us were given those options, wouldn't we, you know, wouldn't

03:29:12.580 --> 03:29:14.540
[Guest]: you?

03:29:14.540 --> 03:29:19.700
[Guest]: She said, it was just off the table, but I'm seeing now that it's a broad table.

03:29:19.700 --> 03:29:23.940
[Guest]: And if you put it back on, then anything is possible.

03:29:23.940 --> 03:29:25.500
[Guest]: And she thought about it, went away.

03:29:25.500 --> 03:29:29.220
[Guest]: And then the next day, you know, doing her rounds at Newmarket and doing a little bit

03:29:29.220 --> 03:29:33.900
[Guest]: of volunteer work and whatever it was that the women of that time did.

03:29:33.900 --> 03:29:39.060
[Guest]: She comes back and she says, this whole thing about gender, again, this is happening 20

03:29:39.060 --> 03:29:43.340
[Guest]: years, 30 years before these debates.

03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:47.900
[Guest]: How much of being a man or being a woman are we taught and how much of it is innate?

03:29:47.900 --> 03:29:50.220
[Guest]: Some of it, I guess, is innate.

03:29:50.220 --> 03:29:54.940
[Guest]: But isn't there a huge teaching that happens with just, you know, having to take off our

03:29:54.940 --> 03:29:56.580
[Guest]: moustaches if we are women.

03:29:56.580 --> 03:30:01.900
[Guest]: She fixated on that, you know, or brush our moustaches out if we are men.

03:30:01.900 --> 03:30:05.260
[Guest]: This whole thing about effeminate men and all of that.

03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:08.340
[Guest]: And we were discussing the gender spectrum before there was a gender spectrum.

03:30:08.340 --> 03:30:15.100
[Guest]: I'm not saying that she was a revolutionary or anything, but she was my friend, you know.

03:30:15.100 --> 03:30:21.740
[Guest]: And what her being able to move so seamlessly between Sanskrit texts and the great classics

03:30:21.740 --> 03:30:28.140
[Guest]: on one hand, and the full, you know, Tagoreana and everything that we were steeped in, and

03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:29.980
[Guest]: then say, this is what I like reading.

03:30:29.980 --> 03:30:31.780
[Guest]: I like reading these romances.

03:30:31.780 --> 03:30:34.580
[Guest]: She read them almost like travel brochures.

03:30:34.580 --> 03:30:38.940
[Guest]: Because in an age when people didn't travel that much, your mills and boons were the ones

03:30:38.940 --> 03:30:42.140
[Guest]: that took you off to Australia or whatever.

03:30:42.140 --> 03:30:45.460
[Guest]: She had a sharp sense of race as well.

03:30:45.460 --> 03:30:50.900
[Guest]: She did say that she felt that, you know, it was filled with these white protagonists.

03:30:50.900 --> 03:30:54.900
[Guest]: And then after a while in our minds, when we were reading them, we turned everyone of

03:30:54.900 --> 03:31:00.220
[Guest]: different races into our own race unconsciously.

03:31:00.220 --> 03:31:07.020
[Guest]: My uncle, my aunts, the fact that everybody was free to choose their own literature, stands

03:31:07.020 --> 03:31:11.340
[Guest]: to me as one of the greatest privileges of them all.

03:31:11.340 --> 03:31:16.580
[Guest]: Because over time, I've met so many writers, particularly some of the younger women writers,

03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:20.980
[Guest]: who grew up in households either where there wasn't a book available, or where the reading

03:31:20.980 --> 03:31:24.220
[Guest]: was very sternly prescribed.

03:31:24.220 --> 03:31:28.460
[Guest]: You know, you might have had your bookshelves filled with great literature, but you were

03:31:28.460 --> 03:31:31.200
[Guest]: supposed to read only that.

03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:35.300
[Guest]: And you were supposed to read it at particular times.

03:31:35.300 --> 03:31:40.460
[Guest]: Aside from the fact that reading is expensive, as in people have to buy books, and expensive

03:31:40.460 --> 03:31:45.500
[Guest]: in terms of time, if you're a reader, one of the reasons why women have such a barrier

03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:49.900
[Guest]: about reading even today in this country, is because it automatically means that you

03:31:49.900 --> 03:31:52.420
[Guest]: have leisure.

03:31:52.420 --> 03:31:57.400
[Guest]: And for women and men, I think there's a great suspicion, particularly for women, but also

03:31:57.400 --> 03:32:00.820
[Guest]: for men, about this whole thing of having free time.

03:32:00.820 --> 03:32:01.820
[Guest]: That means privacy.

03:32:01.820 --> 03:32:05.660
[Guest]: That means you're thinking thoughts in your head, and experiencing things that are moving

03:32:05.660 --> 03:32:10.620
[Guest]: far beyond the ambit that the family has set for you.

03:32:10.620 --> 03:32:14.820
[Guest]: I think they taught me not to be a snob.

03:32:14.820 --> 03:32:19.900
[Guest]: And over the years, with my own reading, often this happens with when I became a writer,

03:32:19.900 --> 03:32:25.500
[Guest]: and I was interviewed as a writer, people would ask, and what are the books that shaped

03:32:25.500 --> 03:32:26.500
[Guest]: you?

03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:31.300
[Guest]: And I mentioned, you know, some of my old favorites, because you have to be, it's not

03:32:31.300 --> 03:32:35.720
[Guest]: fair to weight this game by mentioning writers who make you look good.

03:32:35.720 --> 03:32:39.820
[Guest]: You should be honest about your own reading at least, right?

03:32:39.820 --> 03:32:44.980
[Guest]: So I'd mentioned the Garcia Marquez's and the Toni Morrison's Rushdie, or whoever, because

03:32:44.980 --> 03:32:47.700
[Guest]: they were such great influences.

03:32:47.700 --> 03:32:54.100
[Guest]: But I'd also mentioned the pulp fiction, you know, the really cheesy science fiction, or

03:32:54.100 --> 03:33:01.700
[Guest]: the shady Bengali detective fiction, or the, you know, those Hindi confessional stories

03:33:01.700 --> 03:33:07.660
[Guest]: that used to happen in women's magazines about women's lives, all very dramatically punched

03:33:07.660 --> 03:33:09.180
[Guest]: up and etc.

03:33:09.180 --> 03:33:13.940
[Guest]: And inevitably, when the interview came out, only the books that made me look like a writer

03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:17.420
[Guest]: person would be left in the text.

03:33:17.420 --> 03:33:19.140
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

03:33:19.140 --> 03:33:24.660
[Guest]: I mean, there was a, I'm sure that my interviewers didn't mean to do this deliberately, but it's

03:33:24.660 --> 03:33:32.260
[Guest]: like unconsciously in our minds, when we think of reading, we divide it into worthy and unworthy.

03:33:32.260 --> 03:33:38.420
[Guest]: You asking a more sensitive question, though, about intimate family relationships, was that

03:33:38.420 --> 03:33:39.420
[Amit Varma]: it?

03:33:39.420 --> 03:33:41.620
[Amit Varma]: About the private history of families?

03:33:41.620 --> 03:33:48.220
[Amit Varma]: About really the different roles of men and women and how, and not different, but unequal,

03:33:48.220 --> 03:33:52.380
[Amit Varma]: where the roles of women are incredibly circumscribed.

03:33:52.380 --> 03:33:56.740
[Amit Varma]: And what happens, I think, as kids is that we take for granted that the world around

03:33:56.740 --> 03:34:01.500
[Amit Varma]: us is the world as it is in the world as it should be, and so on and so forth.

03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:05.780
[Amit Varma]: But I think at some point, layers begin to peel off and you realize that no, this is

03:34:05.780 --> 03:34:06.780
[Amit Varma]: not how it should be.

03:34:06.780 --> 03:34:09.540
[Amit Varma]: And you begin to view the world differently.

03:34:09.540 --> 03:34:15.060
[Amit Varma]: Maybe over time, you developed frames of seeing the world in a particular way.

03:34:15.060 --> 03:34:22.060
[Amit Varma]: So it's like a dual question, almost, which is partly about, or let's just narrow it down

03:34:22.060 --> 03:34:26.700
[Amit Varma]: to one question, which is about how was your consciousness of all of this?

03:34:26.700 --> 03:34:30.660
[Amit Varma]: And over the years, how did your feminism thereby evolve?

03:34:30.660 --> 03:34:36.260
[Amit Varma]: Because I guess, you know, when I did my episode with Mrinal Pandey, she mentioned that when

03:34:36.260 --> 03:34:40.140
[Amit Varma]: she was 13 or something, she had an argument with her mother, because she felt that her

03:34:40.140 --> 03:34:44.060
[Amit Varma]: mother was spending too much time obsessing over the meal she would cook for Mrinalji's

03:34:44.060 --> 03:34:45.060
[Amit Varma]: dad.

03:34:45.060 --> 03:34:47.740
[Amit Varma]: And she was like, why are you doing this is food is not that important.

03:34:47.740 --> 03:34:48.740
[Amit Varma]: Why don't you?

03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Why are you so stressed all the time about the food?

03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:53.740
[Amit Varma]: And that's like a feminist instinct.

03:34:53.740 --> 03:34:58.420
[Amit Varma]: But at that point, as she said, she hadn't read about feminism, she wouldn't have known

03:34:58.420 --> 03:35:02.620
[Amit Varma]: the term, she wouldn't have, you know, been able to put a frame to it.

03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:07.140
[Amit Varma]: So now in your sense, one, of course, you are brought up by a matriarch, as it were,

03:35:07.140 --> 03:35:11.880
[Amit Varma]: or have these role models around you, whose lived experience is an experience, perhaps

03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:17.180
[Amit Varma]: to some extent of not conforming to their roles, and perhaps to some extent, of, you

03:35:17.180 --> 03:35:20.300
[Amit Varma]: know, making those roles expand and fill out around them.

03:35:20.300 --> 03:35:25.580
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, we've spoken a lot about Nilanjana Roy, the reader, but if we are to talk about

03:35:25.580 --> 03:35:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Nilanjana Roy, the feminist, tell me a bit about that, where, you know, how do you look

03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:34.180
[Amit Varma]: at the lived feminism of people around you in many small ways, the fights that they fight,

03:35:34.180 --> 03:35:38.220
[Amit Varma]: and what were the frameworks that you then began to develop?

03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And did it not at some point in time, being in India, and so on and so forth, leave you

03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:45.540
[Amit Varma]: with a profound sense of anger as well?

03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:47.980
[Guest]: And if so, how did you deal with that anger?

03:35:47.980 --> 03:35:53.340
[Guest]: My feminism did not come from the family.

03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:58.740
[Guest]: In the family, there were many useful role models, I realized later that the real gifts

03:35:58.740 --> 03:36:04.860
[Guest]: of the family, for example, was that they took love, even in the middle of heated arguments

03:36:04.860 --> 03:36:07.980
[Guest]: and quarrels and differences of opinion, for granted.

03:36:07.980 --> 03:36:14.100
[Guest]: There was an equality between my father, who passed away last year, and my mother, in the

03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:18.900
[Guest]: sense that they were both free to quarrel with each other when they disagreed.

03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:23.300
[Guest]: And they were partners, they were companions.

03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:29.940
[Guest]: My father wholeheartedly and his father, surprisingly, you know, my Thakurda, who was a manager for

03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:35.140
[Guest]: Andrew Yule in Cuttack, and then lived with my parents for some years and brought Bengali

03:36:35.140 --> 03:36:36.700
[Guest]: and many other things into our lives.

03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:38.980
[Guest]: He was a very gentle man.

03:36:38.980 --> 03:36:44.540
[Guest]: I grew used, I grew a little spoiled by the fact that I would not call the men in my family

03:36:44.540 --> 03:36:51.580
[Guest]: feminists per se, but they were men who saw women as equals, you know.

03:36:51.580 --> 03:36:53.940
[Guest]: And that spoiled me a little bit for the rest of the world.

03:36:53.940 --> 03:37:00.700
[Guest]: It was often a shock in my early work to encounter men who were misogynists.

03:37:00.700 --> 03:37:06.940
[Guest]: I had been corseted, and I had been fortunate also in school by and large, not to come across

03:37:06.940 --> 03:37:12.900
[Guest]: too much in the way of misogyny, where it showed for my mother was that she was part

03:37:12.900 --> 03:37:16.780
[Guest]: of the generation who were expected to be superwomen.

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:18.860
[Guest]: So she became a lawyer at 39.

03:37:18.860 --> 03:37:23.420
[Guest]: And I think we were a little bit of family mythology around that, you know.

03:37:23.420 --> 03:37:24.860
[Guest]: Before that, she'd done various things.

03:37:24.860 --> 03:37:26.880
[Guest]: She taught in nursery schools.

03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:32.020
[Guest]: She was a fantastic mother in the sense that she used to just pick up whatever random friends

03:37:32.020 --> 03:37:37.460
[Guest]: of ours and us were wandering around the neighborhood and take us off on adventures and excursions.

03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:42.420
[Guest]: So one day we'd be swimming, or we'd be going to the Kutum Minar and exploring things.

03:37:42.420 --> 03:37:45.480
[Guest]: And my family was a family of women drivers.

03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:49.420
[Guest]: Most of the men drove terribly, and almost all of the women drove well.

03:37:49.420 --> 03:37:54.140
[Guest]: And I remember one of my first feelings of deep independence was actually learning to

03:37:54.140 --> 03:37:57.900
[Guest]: drive at probably an illegal age, you know.

03:37:57.900 --> 03:38:00.500
[Guest]: And my mother taught me, and my grandmother refined that teaching.

03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:03.820
[Guest]: My grandmother was also a crack driver.

03:38:03.820 --> 03:38:12.420
[Guest]: And being a crack driver, being a decent shot, that kind of stuff, was not feminism, but

03:38:12.420 --> 03:38:17.260
[Guest]: it made you feel like you were holding your own in a world that you could already see

03:38:17.260 --> 03:38:18.820
[Guest]: was unequal.

03:38:18.820 --> 03:38:24.660
[Guest]: Where it felt really unfair was at a very early age, I felt circumscribed by all these

03:38:24.660 --> 03:38:28.660
[Guest]: rules about, you can't go out on the road, you have to take your brother with you, you

03:38:28.660 --> 03:38:31.020
[Guest]: have to do this, you have to do that.

03:38:31.020 --> 03:38:36.700
[Guest]: Everything that was there for our safety, particularly in Delhi, I felt it like a blow.

03:38:36.700 --> 03:38:39.980
[Guest]: In Calcutta, at least, I was reasonably free.

03:38:39.980 --> 03:38:44.260
[Guest]: By evening, you had to come back in any Indian city, you know, that was the unspoken rule

03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:47.140
[Guest]: for a young Indian woman.

03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:52.740
[Guest]: The first time that I was pushed around and hurt or molested on the street, I think it

03:38:52.740 --> 03:38:56.300
[Guest]: comes as a shock, and then you realize that you have to defend yourself against it.

03:38:56.300 --> 03:39:01.980
[Guest]: And in a sense, that molesting carries a little bit of egalitarianism against, you know, unless

03:39:01.980 --> 03:39:06.340
[Guest]: you're cocooned in an air-conditioned car all your life, it's something that you're

03:39:06.340 --> 03:39:09.940
[Guest]: going to experience as a woman.

03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:16.780
[Guest]: But from a very early age, I was sharply aware, not of the territory of feminism, you know,

03:39:16.780 --> 03:39:19.820
[Guest]: we were brought up with this myth of women and men were equal.

03:39:19.820 --> 03:39:25.940
[Guest]: And even in my family, the women would bring the food out of the kitchen, or if the staff

03:39:25.940 --> 03:39:31.060
[Guest]: was doing that, the women would still be the ones hovering, the men didn't hover.

03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:34.380
[Guest]: The men didn't feed everyone else at the table.

03:39:34.380 --> 03:39:38.300
[Guest]: And those little subtle things are where you see that, you know, no matter how much you

03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:45.920
[Guest]: progressed, there is still territory that's not as equal as it seems, if that makes sense.

03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:52.360
[Guest]: The women were expected to hold down a career and come back and be perfect hostesses, be

03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:57.680
[Guest]: mother and do this, you know, there was always an and, the men didn't have an and, they could

03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:03.820
[Guest]: just be one thing or the other and somebody would make sure that the shirts were starched.

03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:06.420
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

03:40:06.420 --> 03:40:08.660
[Guest]: It's in the body that you feel it.

03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:16.500
[Guest]: I was a child who lived so deeply in my mind, you know, not just in the imagination, but

03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:21.380
[Guest]: I think in a mind that I've talked to Manjula about this, Manjula Padmanabhan, who's another

03:40:21.380 --> 03:40:27.900
[Guest]: of the Delhi writers whom I admire very much, Ursula K. Le Guin's talked about the non-gendered

03:40:27.900 --> 03:40:32.940
[Guest]: mind, the fact that when you're creating something, you're deeply immersed in studying something.

03:40:32.940 --> 03:40:37.700
[Guest]: Your mind has no gender at that time, it's beyond gender, you know.

03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:43.100
[Guest]: And often living in an Indian city, wherever you were, felt like being rudely and violently

03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:45.020
[Guest]: pushed back into your body.

03:40:45.020 --> 03:40:51.300
[Guest]: That only enhanced when I became, that sense became doubly enhanced when I was a reporter.

03:40:51.300 --> 03:40:56.680
[Guest]: And I found myself sometimes to my absolute fury being dependent on the goodwill of photographers

03:40:56.680 --> 03:41:03.060
[Guest]: for my safety or dependent on the concern of editors for my safety.

03:41:03.060 --> 03:41:10.420
[Guest]: And as much as I was glad that they were caring, part of me really resented it, really resented

03:41:10.420 --> 03:41:12.940
[Guest]: having to be dependent.

03:41:12.940 --> 03:41:20.540
[Guest]: I experienced the difference between the genders in India first, not as a battle or as an ideology,

03:41:20.540 --> 03:41:23.820
[Guest]: but as territory, you see.

03:41:23.820 --> 03:41:27.780
[Guest]: So to me, even now, the city has a gendered geography.

03:41:27.780 --> 03:41:34.340
[Guest]: Wherever I go, even in the mountains, I walk fairly fearlessly all across.

03:41:34.340 --> 03:41:37.300
[Guest]: I walked for years.

03:41:37.300 --> 03:41:41.140
[Guest]: I think, you know, part of writing a book is not the book itself.

03:41:41.140 --> 03:41:47.220
[Guest]: It's what you discover on the way to writing a book, a lot of which you will discard.

03:41:47.220 --> 03:41:51.340
[Guest]: I was diffident about writing a certain section in Black River, which has to do with the Yamuna

03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:54.340
[Guest]: itself and the people who live on its banks.

03:41:54.340 --> 03:42:00.180
[Guest]: And so to get over that diffidence, I walked the length of as much of the Yamuna as I could

03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:02.760
[Guest]: to just learn it spatially.

03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:06.980
[Guest]: Even if it's not for the book, you know, it might come out into just a chapter or a couple

03:42:06.980 --> 03:42:07.980
[Guest]: of sentences.

03:42:07.980 --> 03:42:10.740
[Guest]: You're doing that really for yourself.

03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:16.780
[Guest]: You're learning a part of your city that you would not know anything about or a part of

03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:22.060
[Guest]: your country or a part of your history that you would not know anything about otherwise.

03:42:22.060 --> 03:42:28.780
[Guest]: And in that time, I've experienced aggressive acts in the Aravalis and the Yamuna maybe

03:42:28.780 --> 03:42:30.860
[Guest]: three times on all those walks.

03:42:30.860 --> 03:42:37.380
[Guest]: And each time has been unpleasant and mercifully, you know, not very serious.

03:42:37.380 --> 03:42:43.460
[Guest]: But each time my guides to whether a territory was safe or unsafe for the women.

03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:48.840
[Guest]: So when you're walking around the Aravalis trying to learn, you know, part of that landscape,

03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:53.340
[Guest]: the women will tell you, this is absolutely safe until 3 p.m.

03:42:53.340 --> 03:42:58.620
[Guest]: But after 3 p.m., you know, the men come in and they'll sit there and just be careful.

03:42:58.620 --> 03:43:02.340
[Guest]: And the first thing they'll say is, are you on your own and language is a protection.

03:43:02.340 --> 03:43:09.860
[Guest]: If you come across as English speaking and from a very, very obviously, you know, privileged

03:43:09.860 --> 03:43:10.860
[Guest]: background.

03:43:10.860 --> 03:43:14.740
[Guest]: If you're a wandering woman, then either you're mad, you know, like Laldi, then the saints

03:43:14.740 --> 03:43:21.140
[Guest]: of old or you're exceptionally privileged, you know, we carry that with us like a badge

03:43:21.140 --> 03:43:26.060
[Guest]: and it becomes your safety, that layer of privilege or whatever.

03:43:26.060 --> 03:43:30.180
[Guest]: Walking is stressful, but it became my way of pushing back.

03:43:30.180 --> 03:43:32.860
[Guest]: I think, you know, we all have these quiet battles.

03:43:32.860 --> 03:43:38.740
[Guest]: Meanwhile, the river of feminism that's flowed, I think I'm sometimes troubled by this.

03:43:38.740 --> 03:43:43.580
[Guest]: We act as though the battles of the past are over and they are not.

03:43:43.580 --> 03:43:45.460
[Guest]: Nobody talks about dowry debts today.

03:43:45.460 --> 03:43:48.620
[Guest]: It's moved to a different corner of sexual violence.

03:43:48.620 --> 03:43:53.980
[Guest]: You know, when I was a reporter at the New York Times, bear with me because these are

03:43:53.980 --> 03:43:57.820
[Guest]: apparently disconnected, but they actually lining up in a row.

03:43:57.820 --> 03:44:01.860
[Guest]: When I was a reporter at the New York Times, we found ourselves, me and my editor, Jean

03:44:01.860 --> 03:44:05.740
[Guest]: Moore, who was an absolute genius of an editor.

03:44:05.740 --> 03:44:11.320
[Guest]: She had this way of not making your story hers, but of asking the right questions and

03:44:11.320 --> 03:44:17.460
[Guest]: pushing you in the right direction and turning an opinion piece into more of a reported piece.

03:44:17.460 --> 03:44:22.460
[Guest]: She wanted to make sure that what you were seeing was really the truth of the landscape

03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:25.700
[Guest]: that you were looking at or the truth of people's lives.

03:44:25.700 --> 03:44:31.300
[Guest]: And she taught me to be respectful to the people whom we were talking to, whether they

03:44:31.300 --> 03:44:36.620
[Guest]: were the victims of violence or whether they were women who were surrogate mothers or whether

03:44:36.620 --> 03:44:40.460
[Guest]: they were homeless women on the streets.

03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:43.580
[Guest]: And we kept running into this story.

03:44:43.580 --> 03:44:50.020
[Guest]: We kept trying to do other stories on gender and kept running into that first wave of mainstream

03:44:50.020 --> 03:44:57.180
[Guest]: ritualized street violence, you know, and that was just a reflection of the dowry debts

03:44:57.180 --> 03:44:59.140
[Guest]: of an earlier time.

03:44:59.140 --> 03:45:04.780
[Guest]: That violence and that belief that women are somehow inferior, that, you know, you can

03:45:04.780 --> 03:45:09.460
[Guest]: be killed if you don't bring enough to a marriage or as happened with the more sophisticated

03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:12.140
[Guest]: evolution of dowry debts.

03:45:12.140 --> 03:45:17.060
[Guest]: You could be killed if you had contributed as much as your family was able to contribute

03:45:17.060 --> 03:45:21.700
[Guest]: and then it was time for the next bride to come in, you see.

03:45:21.700 --> 03:45:26.140
[Guest]: The street violence was coming in more or less as a reaction to a phenomenon of those

03:45:26.140 --> 03:45:32.060
[Guest]: times, which was that women were moving more around, they were moving out of their houses,

03:45:32.060 --> 03:45:35.500
[Guest]: they were migrating more, they were taking up jobs.

03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:37.580
[Guest]: And this wave of violence was the pushback.

03:45:37.580 --> 03:45:43.900
[Guest]: And despite that, women kept coming until the economy tightened, the cultural and social

03:45:43.900 --> 03:45:45.780
[Guest]: politics also changed.

03:45:45.780 --> 03:45:49.660
[Guest]: And one of the great tragedies of our time, it's been reported, but to my mind a little

03:45:49.660 --> 03:45:56.500
[Guest]: underreported given everything else that's going on, is the fact that women have receded

03:45:56.500 --> 03:46:05.620
[Guest]: in every way from the economic space, from public spaces as such, you know, from, there's

03:46:05.620 --> 03:46:09.580
[Guest]: a movement backwards in that sense.

03:46:09.580 --> 03:46:16.700
[Guest]: I think I realized very early on that my view as, you know, often we name check privilege,

03:46:16.700 --> 03:46:18.460
[Guest]: but I don't mean to do that.

03:46:18.460 --> 03:46:24.300
[Guest]: I just mean that literally if you grew up as an upper caste Hindu woman, then there

03:46:24.300 --> 03:46:27.360
[Guest]: are many things that you are simply not going to see.

03:46:27.360 --> 03:46:32.020
[Guest]: So a lot of feminism for me, whether I was listening to Gloria Steinem or bell hooks

03:46:32.020 --> 03:46:39.220
[Guest]: or Indian rich abroad, or whether I was reading or learning about the work of grassroots movements

03:46:39.220 --> 03:46:45.280
[Guest]: out here in India from Chipko to, you know, the major caste movements to the major movements

03:46:45.280 --> 03:46:47.580
[Guest]: of organized labor.

03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:52.500
[Guest]: Those have been written and reported about, but again, they aren't mainstream as such.

03:46:52.500 --> 03:46:56.820
[Guest]: I think I took a step back from feminist activism myself.

03:46:56.820 --> 03:47:01.580
[Guest]: My role has been much more the participant, the observer in all of these protests.

03:47:01.580 --> 03:47:06.340
[Guest]: And sometimes, you know, the speaker, but I've never felt that, I've always felt that

03:47:06.340 --> 03:47:11.620
[Guest]: it's a good idea to pass the mic to people who are actually there engaging with struggles

03:47:11.620 --> 03:47:15.820
[Guest]: on the ground, rather than to hand the mic to someone like me, who's just witnessing

03:47:15.820 --> 03:47:19.420
[Guest]: or observing.

03:47:19.420 --> 03:47:23.780
[Guest]: But the other thing that I learned was again from the women who are sometimes most deeply

03:47:23.780 --> 03:47:26.760
[Guest]: engaged in this kind of struggle.

03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:33.060
[Guest]: This was just before the December protests in India of 2012 over the murder of Jyoti,

03:47:33.060 --> 03:47:39.660
[Guest]: the young woman on the bus who was so brutally raped and then killed for the crime of just

03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:46.180
[Guest]: being out to see a movie and being available and being there and being unprotected.

03:47:46.180 --> 03:47:52.820
[Guest]: And before that, for two years, there had been this running wave of protests all across

03:47:52.820 --> 03:47:57.620
[Guest]: the rural parts of Haryana and Jind, you know.

03:47:57.620 --> 03:48:00.620
[Guest]: Those protests were grievous.

03:48:00.620 --> 03:48:05.620
[Guest]: I cannot tell you how many tragedies were folded into, were laid behind those protests.

03:48:05.620 --> 03:48:14.660
[Guest]: I met fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, whose lives had been devastated by the casual

03:48:14.660 --> 03:48:22.560
[Guest]: murders or rapes or dismemberments of the women that they held dear.

03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:27.340
[Guest]: And somehow, despite that, every protest that you'd go to, somebody would bring out a drum,

03:48:27.340 --> 03:48:33.100
[Guest]: somebody would be playing music, somebody would be singing protest songs.

03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:38.740
[Guest]: And I remember the second time I joined in this, this was in Jind, it must have showed

03:48:38.740 --> 03:48:43.900
[Guest]: on my face that I was surprised at this, where were the serious speeches, where was the one-minute

03:48:43.900 --> 03:48:45.620
[Guest]: silence.

03:48:45.620 --> 03:48:50.420
[Guest]: And the women just looked at me and said, we're not protesting to be sad, we're protesting

03:48:50.420 --> 03:48:53.860
[Guest]: for better lives, we're protesting in order to be happy.

03:48:53.860 --> 03:48:58.260
[Guest]: And whatever else we can't claim, you know, we can't claim equal rights, we can't claim

03:48:58.260 --> 03:49:02.980
[Guest]: the right even to be safe in our own homes or out on the streets, but we can claim the

03:49:02.980 --> 03:49:05.540
[Guest]: right to be happy in this moment.

03:49:05.540 --> 03:49:10.780
[Guest]: And that was, you know, that was a very powerful learning for me.

03:49:10.780 --> 03:49:15.220
[Guest]: I think most of my relationship with feminism has come from there.

03:49:15.220 --> 03:49:20.620
[Guest]: And historically speaking, this is where being a reader comes in handy.

03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:24.900
[Guest]: I think, you know, the idea that how most of the feminist victories have been won, women

03:49:24.900 --> 03:49:28.980
[Guest]: are equal, what are they crying about now, in one way or the other that comes up, MeToo

03:49:28.980 --> 03:49:32.820
[Guest]: is where our attention is focused at this time.

03:49:32.820 --> 03:49:36.820
[Guest]: But it is certainly not the only battle around, you know, from reproductive rights to the

03:49:36.820 --> 03:49:43.660
[Guest]: right to education, whatever you wear, or whatever community you come from, which has

03:49:43.660 --> 03:49:49.420
[Guest]: been such a big thing in India right now, and in Afghanistan and places like that.

03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:53.260
[Guest]: I think we forget how recent all of this is.

03:49:53.260 --> 03:49:59.460
[Guest]: Just a few generations back, women in England, in Austin writes about this, did not have

03:49:59.460 --> 03:50:03.820
[Guest]: the right to own property, because they were property themselves.

03:50:03.820 --> 03:50:08.860
[Guest]: That entire obsession with marriage that comes through in her books, is basically coming

03:50:08.860 --> 03:50:13.100
[Guest]: through because women had no life if they could not make a good marriage.

03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:16.540
[Guest]: And that's where, you know, that underlying all the humor and the lightness of it, and

03:50:16.540 --> 03:50:19.980
[Guest]: the two inches of ivory, it's not two inches of ivory.

03:50:19.980 --> 03:50:24.860
[Guest]: You're talking about the lives of generations of women who were nothing and had nothing

03:50:24.860 --> 03:50:31.460
[Guest]: and could only become governesses or, you know, burdens on their family, if they did

03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:35.020
[Guest]: not find a man to say yes to them, right?

03:50:35.020 --> 03:50:36.020
[Guest]: That was pretty recent.

03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:42.660
[Guest]: I wrote this, I think, as a Facebook post, but I was reading Ram Mohan Roy and Raja Ram

03:50:42.660 --> 03:50:46.540
[Guest]: Mohan Roy, the 18th century reformers letters the other day.

03:50:46.540 --> 03:50:49.620
[Guest]: And I think for the first time it struck me, you know, what we know of Raja Ram Mohan Roy

03:50:49.620 --> 03:50:53.100
[Guest]: is that, yes, he had the laws of Sati changed.

03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:57.780
[Guest]: It's when you start reading the letters that you realize how long that campaign ran and

03:50:57.780 --> 03:51:03.820
[Guest]: how exhausting it was on him and his family, you know, because he defended orthodox Hindus

03:51:03.820 --> 03:51:11.260
[Guest]: who were arguing at that time with perfect logic for the right to keep burning women.

03:51:11.260 --> 03:51:16.980
[Guest]: I looked at those records and some of the women in the Calcutta district who became

03:51:16.980 --> 03:51:22.380
[Guest]: Satis not so long ago, this would have been less than, what, five generations, six generations?

03:51:22.380 --> 03:51:25.100
[Guest]: That's how recent it is.

03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:29.420
[Guest]: Some of them were 15 years old or 16 years old or 12.

03:51:29.420 --> 03:51:35.820
[Guest]: And the oldest would have been in their 70s and 80s, you know, facing the pyre.

03:51:35.820 --> 03:51:41.380
[Guest]: And what horrifies me is not, you know, more evidence of the fact that we can be barbaric,

03:51:41.380 --> 03:51:43.500
[Guest]: all of us.

03:51:43.500 --> 03:51:48.260
[Guest]: What horrifies me is that we were willing for the longest time to intellectually justify

03:51:48.260 --> 03:51:53.180
[Guest]: this and that, you know, the British get a lot of credit for changing the law, but they

03:51:53.180 --> 03:51:59.220
[Guest]: changed the law only after cautious dipstick checks that there were enough Hindus who would

03:51:59.220 --> 03:52:02.340
[Guest]: support this, you see.

03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:08.260
[Guest]: It's only been less than a generation since my own grandmother, my father's mother, her

03:52:08.260 --> 03:52:12.860
[Guest]: first marriage, which she did not like, happened when she was very young.

03:52:12.860 --> 03:52:17.180
[Guest]: She was just about, I think, something like 13 or 15.

03:52:17.180 --> 03:52:23.020
[Guest]: And she extricated herself from that marriage, found an independent life somehow, and married

03:52:23.020 --> 03:52:25.660
[Guest]: my grandfather many years later.

03:52:25.660 --> 03:52:28.920
[Guest]: But all of these things are very close.

03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:34.180
[Guest]: It's not even been a hundred years since women in India won the right to vote.

03:52:34.180 --> 03:52:38.980
[Guest]: And we were pretty enlightened in our pre-independence debates about that.

03:52:38.980 --> 03:52:43.780
[Guest]: But there was, even at that time, there was a strand of opinion that thought that women

03:52:43.780 --> 03:52:50.180
[Guest]: should not really be bothered or troubled with this, you see.

03:52:50.180 --> 03:52:55.220
[Guest]: So we forget that everything that we talk about in terms of equality, and this is not

03:52:55.220 --> 03:53:03.220
[Guest]: just gender, but the entire post-World War II landscape of human rights are important.

03:53:03.220 --> 03:53:05.340
[Guest]: We should not discriminate against each other.

03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:07.900
[Guest]: We have had enough of the Holocaust.

03:53:07.900 --> 03:53:14.580
[Guest]: All of this is very recent, and it flies in the face, I think, of centuries of human practice.

03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:16.980
[Guest]: And it's wise to remember that when you're talking about feminism.

03:53:16.980 --> 03:53:20.900
[Guest]: I have taken you down a whole different river this time.

03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:21.900
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

03:53:21.900 --> 03:53:24.540
[Amit Varma]: Such a learning experience listening to you.

03:53:24.540 --> 03:53:29.540
[Amit Varma]: So before I get to my follow-up question, I am reminded of a song, because since you

03:53:29.540 --> 03:53:34.500
[Amit Varma]: mentioned people in protest also sing and dance, you spoke about women in the 19th century

03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:36.980
[Amit Varma]: waiting and hoping someone says yes.

03:53:36.980 --> 03:53:40.860
[Amit Varma]: And there is this lovely poem by Laurence Alma Tadima called, If No One Ever Marries

03:53:40.860 --> 03:53:44.500
[Amit Varma]: Me, which Natalie Merchant turned into this beautiful song, which I'll link from the show

03:53:44.500 --> 03:53:45.500
[Amit Varma]: notes.

03:53:45.500 --> 03:53:46.500
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard it?

03:53:46.500 --> 03:53:47.500
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

03:53:47.500 --> 03:53:50.260
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just read this out for the benefit of my listeners.

03:53:50.260 --> 03:53:53.900
[Amit Varma]: If No One Ever Marries Me by Laurence Alma Tadima, and despite the name, this is written

03:53:53.900 --> 03:53:55.140
[Amit Varma]: by a woman.

03:53:55.140 --> 03:53:59.060
[Amit Varma]: If no one ever marries me, and I don't see why they should, for nurse says I'm not pretty

03:53:59.060 --> 03:54:00.700
[Amit Varma]: and I'm seldom very good.

03:54:00.700 --> 03:54:03.380
[Amit Varma]: If no one ever marries me, I shan't mind very much.

03:54:03.380 --> 03:54:06.820
[Amit Varma]: I shall buy a squirrel in a cage and a little rabbit hutch.

03:54:06.820 --> 03:54:11.420
[Amit Varma]: I shall have a cottage near a wood and a pony on my own, and a little lamb quite clean and

03:54:11.420 --> 03:54:13.580
[Amit Varma]: tame that I can take to town.

03:54:13.580 --> 03:54:18.340
[Amit Varma]: And when I'm getting really old, at 28 or nine, I shall buy a little orphan girl and

03:54:18.340 --> 03:54:20.780
[Amit Varma]: bring her up as mine.

03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:27.380
[Amit Varma]: And this also sort of reminded me of Hemabati Sen, you know, who I, you know, first read

03:54:27.380 --> 03:54:31.180
[Amit Varma]: about in Kavitha Rao's excellent book on lady doctors.

03:54:31.180 --> 03:54:36.820
[Amit Varma]: And again, another sort of remarkable woman beginning with, you know, she was married,

03:54:36.820 --> 03:54:41.820
[Amit Varma]: I think, at the age of nine, to a husband who was 40 something, and he already had kids.

03:54:41.820 --> 03:54:46.700
[Amit Varma]: And during the day, she would play with his children and at night, she'd be raped.

03:54:46.700 --> 03:54:51.340
[Amit Varma]: And when she was 11, he died, and her in-laws died, and her parents died.

03:54:51.340 --> 03:54:55.140
[Amit Varma]: So she's in this little village, I think it was in Silhet, she's in this little village

03:54:55.140 --> 03:55:00.260
[Amit Varma]: in Bengal, far from everything, 11 years old, no relatives, no one to take care of her,

03:55:00.260 --> 03:55:01.260
[Amit Varma]: no money.

03:55:01.260 --> 03:55:05.300
[Amit Varma]: And she goes from there to actually get an education and become a lady doctor and phenomenal

03:55:05.300 --> 03:55:06.300
[Amit Varma]: woman.

03:55:06.300 --> 03:55:10.580
[Amit Varma]: And then she writes a book and she keeps all her writings in a trunk, which is not opened

03:55:10.580 --> 03:55:16.980
[Amit Varma]: for 70 years, until 70 years after her death, and then it's published as her memoirs.

03:55:16.980 --> 03:55:18.460
[Amit Varma]: So a fantastic story.

03:55:18.460 --> 03:55:23.580
[Amit Varma]: And I want to ask you, therefore, about the long arc, right?

03:55:23.580 --> 03:55:29.240
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that you mentioned is that in some ways, today, women have gone backwards,

03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:34.100
[Amit Varma]: you know, and some of those we can see statistical indicators like women in the workforce, for

03:55:34.100 --> 03:55:38.460
[Amit Varma]: example, and I've had many episodes on that with the likes of Namita Bhandari and Shrena

03:55:38.460 --> 03:55:39.460
[Amit Varma]: Bhattacharya.

03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:45.060
[Amit Varma]: And, but I've also spoken to people like Parmita Vohra, Kavita Krishnan, Manjima Bhattacharya

03:55:45.060 --> 03:55:51.660
[Amit Varma]: recently, who had more optimism that in the longer arc, there was progress.

03:55:51.660 --> 03:55:55.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you can't ignore that, that there might be moments where it seems that

03:55:55.820 --> 03:55:57.500
[Amit Varma]: things are getting bad.

03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:01.860
[Amit Varma]: But if you just have to take a step back, and not allow yourself to sort of get despondent,

03:56:01.860 --> 03:56:06.260
[Amit Varma]: and you have to see that longer arc, what's your sense about that longer arc?

03:56:06.260 --> 03:56:08.060
[Guest]: I believe in it.

03:56:08.060 --> 03:56:11.860
[Guest]: And that's a short answer, but I don't think there is room for despair.

03:56:11.860 --> 03:56:16.260
[Guest]: I think despair is energy sapping.

03:56:16.260 --> 03:56:19.300
[Guest]: But aside from that, I think despair is built on false perception.

03:56:19.300 --> 03:56:26.340
[Guest]: We are so in love with our own time, that we also like to think of our wars as extraordinary,

03:56:26.340 --> 03:56:30.460
[Guest]: you know, oh, my God, World War Three is on the horizon.

03:56:30.460 --> 03:56:36.900
[Guest]: Well, look at every century of human history, really, and I cannot remember a time that

03:56:36.900 --> 03:56:39.140
[Guest]: was free of wars.

03:56:39.140 --> 03:56:45.500
[Guest]: We also live through the extraordinary burst of hope that accompanied the falling of the

03:56:45.500 --> 03:56:46.500
[Guest]: Berlin Wall.

03:56:46.500 --> 03:56:53.140
[Guest]: You know, we have this movement from progress to regression to finally, let's hope that

03:56:53.140 --> 03:56:56.580
[Guest]: we keep moving forwards rather than backwards.

03:56:56.580 --> 03:57:01.020
[Guest]: But if you want hope, it's there all through history.

03:57:01.020 --> 03:57:02.500
[Guest]: Let's stay on gender for a second.

03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:08.500
[Guest]: But women like Andal, women like Mirabai, women like Laldeed, these were three women

03:57:08.500 --> 03:57:14.220
[Guest]: who in different centuries chose to live their own lives as free as possible and chose to

03:57:14.220 --> 03:57:16.580
[Guest]: define religion and faith in their own ways.

03:57:16.580 --> 03:57:22.340
[Guest]: I still remember Laldeed's vachas so beautifully translated by Ranjith Hoskote, you know, where

03:57:22.340 --> 03:57:26.820
[Guest]: she says, I have gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion.

03:57:26.820 --> 03:57:33.660
[Guest]: And there's this roar from her century, which was, she died in 1392, I think.

03:57:33.660 --> 03:57:39.820
[Guest]: And from her century to mine, her saying, I have fought for what I have.

03:57:39.820 --> 03:57:45.260
[Guest]: I have worked for the knowledge, you know, in the rest of the vachas, she says something,

03:57:45.260 --> 03:57:49.780
[Guest]: she says, what there was in the books I've taken and what there wasn't in the books,

03:57:49.780 --> 03:57:51.140
[Guest]: I have taught myself.

03:57:51.140 --> 03:57:55.060
[Guest]: And then she says, I've gone into the forest and wrestled with the lions.

03:57:55.060 --> 03:57:59.300
[Guest]: And basically, she's saying, I own this territory, I will be me, whether or not you allow me

03:57:59.300 --> 03:58:01.540
[Guest]: to be myself or not.

03:58:01.540 --> 03:58:05.700
[Guest]: So when I look at the history of just narrowing it down to either India or America, which

03:58:05.700 --> 03:58:12.660
[Guest]: is going through its own grievous, grievous moment of regression on many, many fronts,

03:58:12.660 --> 03:58:17.740
[Guest]: but definitely on gender rights and, you know, the whole Black Lives Matter movement being

03:58:17.740 --> 03:58:22.460
[Guest]: followed by the rise of white supremacy.

03:58:22.460 --> 03:58:26.460
[Guest]: Do you see an absence of grit?

03:58:26.460 --> 03:58:33.140
[Guest]: When you see Meena Kotwal at the Mooknayak, you know, one of my favorite media outlets,

03:58:33.140 --> 03:58:39.580
[Guest]: when you see the women of Khabar Lahariya, you know, moving by degrees towards finding

03:58:39.580 --> 03:58:44.340
[Guest]: themselves in possession of a camera, taking the story firmly from the hands of people

03:58:44.340 --> 03:58:47.380
[Guest]: who will interpret for them.

03:58:47.380 --> 03:58:52.420
[Guest]: To your grassroots readers, I see a vacuum at the political stage, but I don't think

03:58:52.420 --> 03:59:00.060
[Guest]: you know, a lot of token women up there, the Hindu right wing is brilliant at foregrounding

03:59:00.060 --> 03:59:04.020
[Guest]: women and giving them rules to play within that project.

03:59:04.020 --> 03:59:09.900
[Guest]: But I would venture to add rules to play without political agency of their own, you know, without

03:59:09.900 --> 03:59:13.060
[Guest]: asking themselves, is this really good for us?

03:59:13.060 --> 03:59:16.820
[Guest]: You can do what you want to, you can have a great deal of power.

03:59:16.820 --> 03:59:24.020
[Guest]: But if you dare to voice an opinion about women or about communal disharmony that is

03:59:24.020 --> 03:59:30.900
[Guest]: different from what your group says, you will mercilessly be cut out of your group.

03:59:30.900 --> 03:59:37.940
[Guest]: Given that, I don't see, I think we are going through a time of churn, a time of inevitable

03:59:37.940 --> 03:59:38.940
[Guest]: questioning.

03:59:38.940 --> 03:59:44.740
[Guest]: We will fall further backwards because we're trying to decide on something really big.

03:59:44.740 --> 03:59:48.100
[Guest]: Nations are so new, nations are so young, right?

03:59:48.100 --> 03:59:51.860
[Guest]: It's an idea that's been introduced and that will need to be defended not once, but over

03:59:51.860 --> 03:59:52.860
[Guest]: and over again.

03:59:52.860 --> 03:59:58.660
[Guest]: With so many countries, I see the same question arising, don't you?

03:59:58.660 --> 04:00:01.060
[Guest]: Which is, what is it that holds us together?

04:00:01.060 --> 04:00:02.500
[Guest]: What should hold us together?

04:00:02.500 --> 04:00:04.500
[Guest]: What makes us a whole?

04:00:04.500 --> 04:00:10.220
[Guest]: And the answers to that question are either going to be uniting, which is an extremely

04:00:10.220 --> 04:00:11.860
[Guest]: difficult project.

04:00:11.860 --> 04:00:16.380
[Guest]: If you think about it, it's a mental state of hand, you're saying all of us by dint of

04:00:16.380 --> 04:00:22.300
[Guest]: geography and shared history are together, but not those people across the border, you

04:00:22.300 --> 04:00:27.180
[Guest]: know, who share the same geography and at least part of the same history.

04:00:27.180 --> 04:00:33.460
[Guest]: Or you're doing the simple thing of dividing people by saying, we are the only ones who

04:00:33.460 --> 04:00:36.980
[Guest]: belong and the rest of them don't.

04:00:36.980 --> 04:00:38.340
[Guest]: And that's a very clean story.

04:00:38.340 --> 04:00:41.580
[Guest]: I see a lot of things in terms of narratives.

04:00:41.580 --> 04:00:46.980
[Guest]: And I see that in the churn that we're going through at this time, don't you see that some

04:00:46.980 --> 04:00:53.540
[Guest]: people are falling back in search of an older, maybe more regressive, but ultimately a safer

04:00:53.540 --> 04:00:54.540
[Guest]: narrative.

04:00:54.540 --> 04:00:59.380
[Guest]: There's a king, he's an evil king, or she is an evil queen, you know, they're tyrants.

04:00:59.380 --> 04:01:01.100
[Guest]: That's familiar.

04:01:01.100 --> 04:01:03.100
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

04:01:03.100 --> 04:01:08.500
[Guest]: If you're moving away from democracy back into an autocracy, and we've had so much written

04:01:08.500 --> 04:01:15.180
[Guest]: about autocracies and the pull of strongmen and all of that, at least that's familiar.

04:01:15.180 --> 04:01:19.940
[Guest]: One of my fellow columnists at the Financial Times, Janan Ganesh, wrote recently that the

04:01:19.940 --> 04:01:25.060
[Guest]: direction that he thinks that Europe might head in is not actually towards autocracies,

04:01:25.060 --> 04:01:28.540
[Guest]: but he thinks that they're heading towards a time of anarchy.

04:01:28.540 --> 04:01:35.700
[Guest]: And for many people, not knowing the uncertainty of we had an imperfect, messy democracy, we're

04:01:35.700 --> 04:01:40.620
[Guest]: trying to work out what the meaning of this democracy is in a time when you also have

04:01:40.620 --> 04:01:44.460
[Guest]: technological and oligarchic pressures.

04:01:44.460 --> 04:01:48.620
[Guest]: And we're trying to define ourselves in the middle of, you know, these enormous tectonic

04:01:48.620 --> 04:01:49.620
[Guest]: pressures.

04:01:49.620 --> 04:01:55.500
[Guest]: You'll choose certainty over uncertainty, most of humankind would.

04:01:55.500 --> 04:01:58.900
[Guest]: Change is frightening, right?

04:01:58.900 --> 04:02:01.860
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of thoughts, and then my follow up question.

04:02:01.860 --> 04:02:08.100
[Amit Varma]: One thought is that what you asked about that common question that reverberates, that what

04:02:08.100 --> 04:02:12.700
[Amit Varma]: can bring us together, how can we unite and all of that, I think what's happening in modern

04:02:12.700 --> 04:02:17.900
[Amit Varma]: times is that there is a trend that goes in two different directions, and I don't know

04:02:17.900 --> 04:02:19.420
[Amit Varma]: which will prevail.

04:02:19.420 --> 04:02:25.220
[Amit Varma]: And one has to do with a crumbling away of the mainstream, but this time, in the context

04:02:25.220 --> 04:02:30.180
[Amit Varma]: of nation states that I think more and more nation states with their hard boundaries that

04:02:30.180 --> 04:02:34.180
[Amit Varma]: prevent people from reaching across and so forth, are becoming irrelevant.

04:02:34.180 --> 04:02:40.380
[Amit Varma]: And the reason is technology, because technology is allowing us to one it's empowering individuals

04:02:40.380 --> 04:02:45.660
[Amit Varma]: in a way that politics, you know, has failed to do in many different contexts.

04:02:45.660 --> 04:02:49.460
[Amit Varma]: And it's helping people reach out and make geography irrelevant.

04:02:49.460 --> 04:02:55.420
[Amit Varma]: And in that sense, what will unite us, I think there's a role that technology can play with

04:02:55.420 --> 04:02:58.440
[Amit Varma]: the natural liberalism that it brings about.

04:02:58.440 --> 04:03:02.940
[Amit Varma]: But the opposite is also true, which is that technology and we'll talk about social media

04:03:02.940 --> 04:03:03.940
[Amit Varma]: afterwards.

04:03:03.940 --> 04:03:09.580
[Amit Varma]: But how technology can always also divide us and polarize us and so on and so forth.

04:03:09.580 --> 04:03:15.100
[Amit Varma]: And when you speak about people falling back and becoming more regressive, I think of the

04:03:15.100 --> 04:03:20.900
[Amit Varma]: constant struggle of humankind, the ongoing struggle of humankind, as a struggle of human

04:03:20.900 --> 04:03:23.740
[Amit Varma]: beings against our own programming, right?

04:03:23.740 --> 04:03:28.860
[Amit Varma]: All animals, in a sense, have a source code inside them, they're programmed to be a certain

04:03:28.860 --> 04:03:29.860
[Amit Varma]: way.

04:03:29.860 --> 04:03:34.420
[Amit Varma]: And human beings are the only species, which are all which is also programmed to reflect

04:03:34.420 --> 04:03:38.980
[Amit Varma]: on that programming, and to mitigate it and to fight against it, right.

04:03:38.980 --> 04:03:43.740
[Amit Varma]: And we are, of course, programmed in contradictory ways as well, we are programmed to be tribal.

04:03:43.740 --> 04:03:47.220
[Amit Varma]: But at a different level, we are also programmed to be altruistic.

04:03:47.220 --> 04:03:49.540
[Amit Varma]: And we can reflect upon our programming.

04:03:49.540 --> 04:03:54.220
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we can mitigate it and fight it and let the better angels of our natures,

04:03:54.220 --> 04:03:58.100
[Amit Varma]: as Steven Pinker eloquently puts it, emerge from there.

04:03:58.100 --> 04:04:00.700
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that's sort of a constant battle.

04:04:00.700 --> 04:04:07.620
[Amit Varma]: And it might seem that because of technological trends, and because of what's happening around

04:04:07.620 --> 04:04:12.860
[Amit Varma]: us, the way the worst angels of the worst demons of our natures, as it were, it can

04:04:12.860 --> 04:04:17.780
[Amit Varma]: sort of be amplified by our technology as well.

04:04:17.780 --> 04:04:20.140
[Amit Varma]: And that's sort of the negative side of it.

04:04:20.140 --> 04:04:21.580
[Amit Varma]: And we kind of come back to it.

04:04:21.580 --> 04:04:23.320
[Amit Varma]: But these were my two musings.

04:04:23.320 --> 04:04:29.380
[Amit Varma]: But my follow up question is this that in an episode I did recently with Shruti Kapila,

04:04:29.380 --> 04:04:35.820
[Amit Varma]: she spoke about how she would be very keen on seeing whether the women of India can be

04:04:35.820 --> 04:04:37.860
[Amit Varma]: united as voters.

04:04:37.860 --> 04:04:41.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, you were talking about women in politics being mainly tokenistic and the natural

04:04:41.700 --> 04:04:48.980
[Amit Varma]: question can arise as it has for Shruti that why don't women just see, just look at their

04:04:48.980 --> 04:04:50.860
[Amit Varma]: own interests and then vote as one.

04:04:50.860 --> 04:04:57.860
[Amit Varma]: But I also did an episode with Rukmini, the data journalist, and she pointed out that

04:04:57.860 --> 04:05:03.180
[Amit Varma]: all her studies and all the data that she's looked at, showed that this is not the case.

04:05:03.180 --> 04:05:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Women actually vote because of a multiplicity of factors, and thinking of themselves as

04:05:10.400 --> 04:05:15.620
[Amit Varma]: women and fighting back against the inequities is not something that drives their voting

04:05:15.620 --> 04:05:16.620
[Amit Varma]: at least.

04:05:16.620 --> 04:05:19.580
[Amit Varma]: And one reason for that, of course, could be that all parties are equally misogynistic

04:05:19.580 --> 04:05:20.580
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

04:05:20.580 --> 04:05:21.860
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do that society?

04:05:21.860 --> 04:05:29.100
[Amit Varma]: But I think a deeper reason is that a lot of women also you will find rail against feminism,

04:05:29.100 --> 04:05:32.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, which is so completely bizarre, that they're happy playing in the name of

04:05:32.980 --> 04:05:37.180
[Amit Varma]: tradition at, you know, reinforcing the subsidiary roles that they play.

04:05:37.180 --> 04:05:41.940
[Amit Varma]: And my question here is this, that you've referred earlier to how one of the things

04:05:41.940 --> 04:05:46.300
[Amit Varma]: that you loved about our society, that you love about our society, and that I do as well,

04:05:46.300 --> 04:05:48.900
[Amit Varma]: is that we are so open and so tolerant and all of that.

04:05:48.900 --> 04:05:53.180
[Amit Varma]: I remember I had a conversation with the politician JP Narayan, and I was talking about how illiberal

04:05:53.180 --> 04:05:54.700
[Amit Varma]: our society is.

04:05:54.700 --> 04:05:57.620
[Amit Varma]: And of course, that, you know, you look at gender, you look at caste, you look at so

04:05:57.620 --> 04:06:01.580
[Amit Varma]: many things, and we're deeply illiberal, and he pointed out that, if you without denying

04:06:01.580 --> 04:06:05.940
[Amit Varma]: it, that if you look at it from another lens, we're deeply liberal, that there is, we are

04:06:05.940 --> 04:06:13.140
[Amit Varma]: a very assimilative society, if you look at our food, our clothing, our culture, so much

04:06:13.140 --> 04:06:16.860
[Amit Varma]: is really assimilative and tolerant and all of that.

04:06:16.860 --> 04:06:22.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I've been struggling to grasp is that today we are in a place where our society

04:06:22.380 --> 04:06:30.140
[Amit Varma]: is unquestionably divided, where there is bigotry and sexism, and all of that is widespread.

04:06:30.140 --> 04:06:35.700
[Amit Varma]: And my sense and the great book by Akshay Mukul on the Gita Press, and I had an episode

04:06:35.700 --> 04:06:37.380
[Amit Varma]: with him seems to bear it out.

04:06:37.380 --> 04:06:39.560
[Amit Varma]: My sense is we were always like this.

04:06:39.560 --> 04:06:41.420
[Amit Varma]: This is not something new.

04:06:41.420 --> 04:06:45.860
[Amit Varma]: These aspects of our society have not been shaped by a hateful politics, but it is the

04:06:45.860 --> 04:06:46.860
[Amit Varma]: other way around.

04:06:46.860 --> 04:06:52.660
[Amit Varma]: Our hateful politics is supply springing up in response to demand, and that our society

04:06:52.660 --> 04:06:56.500
[Amit Varma]: has also always been like this.

04:06:56.500 --> 04:07:01.180
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how would looking back at the span of all these years where you've grown

04:07:01.180 --> 04:07:05.620
[Amit Varma]: up and you worked and you've written and you've thought about this country and you've engaged

04:07:05.620 --> 04:07:08.380
[Amit Varma]: with our politics in whatever way.

04:07:08.380 --> 04:07:14.260
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel about this larger question that, you know, was our society always like

04:07:14.260 --> 04:07:15.260
[Amit Varma]: this?

04:07:15.260 --> 04:07:19.340
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, you know, is it now that politics has caught up with society?

04:07:19.340 --> 04:07:24.020
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what are your sort of thoughts?

04:07:24.020 --> 04:07:31.420
[Guest]: I'm trying to see where I stand between hope and despair, because the truth is, it's not

04:07:31.420 --> 04:07:38.060
[Guest]: just the rise to power of a particular person or a particular party or that the Hindu right

04:07:38.060 --> 04:07:39.860
[Guest]: wing is in charge.

04:07:39.860 --> 04:07:44.140
[Guest]: I think what grieves us most is our own selves, isn't that it?

04:07:44.140 --> 04:07:48.180
[Guest]: It's our neighbors turning this way, that way for whatever reasons.

04:07:48.180 --> 04:07:51.900
[Guest]: And I've never wanted to live anywhere outside the country.

04:07:51.900 --> 04:07:57.620
[Guest]: I'm speaking personally and perhaps very selfishly at this moment.

04:07:57.620 --> 04:08:03.260
[Guest]: I've never had a desire to have a life abroad, to visit abroad, to spend time there, yes.

04:08:03.260 --> 04:08:07.460
[Guest]: You know, the world is a big place and we're all citizens of the world as well.

04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:14.460
[Guest]: I don't think I've ever been as heartbroken by what is happening in this country as I

04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:16.780
[Guest]: am today.

04:08:16.780 --> 04:08:23.340
[Guest]: And as time goes by, as the political opposition fails and fails again, as our social fabric

04:08:23.340 --> 04:08:29.940
[Guest]: seems to crumble under the enormous pressure, let me say, put on it by a constant wave of

04:08:29.940 --> 04:08:32.860
[Guest]: tech enabled propaganda and hatred.

04:08:32.860 --> 04:08:38.180
[Guest]: We've seen, I've been tracking that hatred for a while and I've seen it move from being

04:08:38.180 --> 04:08:43.540
[Guest]: little bubbles on Facebook, which is bad enough and corrosive enough to being casual and mainstream

04:08:43.540 --> 04:08:50.980
[Guest]: and on your television sets and it is unreasonable not to expect human beings not to be changed

04:08:50.980 --> 04:08:54.620
[Guest]: by what they're consuming, okay.

04:08:54.620 --> 04:08:59.020
[Guest]: Ravish Kumar has said this, other people have said this, at this point we are consuming

04:08:59.020 --> 04:09:04.260
[Guest]: poison and make no mistake, that has changed us, it is going to change us if we harden

04:09:04.260 --> 04:09:06.260
[Guest]: our hearts.

04:09:06.260 --> 04:09:13.260
[Guest]: If we continue to think that it is alright to condone extreme violence, extreme dispossession

04:09:13.260 --> 04:09:19.380
[Guest]: of any one of us, the moment that you turn around as a country and you say, you can be

04:09:19.380 --> 04:09:28.580
[Guest]: killed, you know, we used to have this running joke among a certain percentage of us journalists

04:09:28.580 --> 04:09:34.020
[Guest]: about the abyss, I'd just about stopped writing op-eds at that stage and gone back to a job

04:09:34.020 --> 04:09:38.620
[Guest]: that allowed me to read books instead as it happened.

04:09:38.620 --> 04:09:43.900
[Guest]: But all of the op-eds about India, written in India and outside India, used to have that

04:09:43.900 --> 04:09:48.340
[Guest]: damn abyss around, right, that yes, we are on the edge of the abyss, we have descended

04:09:48.340 --> 04:09:54.300
[Guest]: into the abyss and at one point you are going to see that we are deep inside this morass

04:09:54.300 --> 04:10:01.820
[Guest]: and that what we are racing towards is clinically a place that no country, no nation, no people

04:10:01.820 --> 04:10:07.860
[Guest]: wants to go towards, you know, it's very hard to turn away from that violence.

04:10:07.860 --> 04:10:14.300
[Guest]: But because I read, I also remember reading accounts of first the horror, the helplessness

04:10:14.300 --> 04:10:20.060
[Guest]: that people felt when the inevitable violence of partition happened.

04:10:20.060 --> 04:10:26.700
[Guest]: And this was a country that had just been born where you barely had a government.

04:10:26.700 --> 04:10:35.080
[Guest]: The British had just left, you know, without leaving much in place to stem this violence.

04:10:35.080 --> 04:10:39.820
[Guest]: And after it stopped, the question on people's minds were, are we even a country?

04:10:39.820 --> 04:10:43.140
[Guest]: Is there anything that holds us together?

04:10:43.140 --> 04:10:48.700
[Guest]: I will say this, you know, it's not a question of set aside Modi this, Modi that, the Hindu

04:10:48.700 --> 04:10:53.420
[Guest]: Rashtra, you've had enough people who know deeply, who have studied the subject talk

04:10:53.420 --> 04:10:55.460
[Guest]: to you about this.

04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:58.940
[Guest]: But if your country does not hold together, then sooner or later you're just going to

04:10:58.940 --> 04:11:01.880
[Guest]: break into smaller and smaller pieces.

04:11:01.880 --> 04:11:05.860
[Guest]: Somebody will demand a homeland of their own, somebody will say, all right, now that we've

04:11:05.860 --> 04:11:09.780
[Guest]: finished saying that they don't belong, they don't belong either.

04:11:09.780 --> 04:11:14.420
[Guest]: And sometimes when I look at the map of India, it seems that it is smouldering, that there

04:11:14.420 --> 04:11:17.060
[Guest]: are fires everywhere.

04:11:17.060 --> 04:11:20.900
[Guest]: You have to get back to what holds you together.

04:11:20.900 --> 04:11:24.180
[Guest]: And it's been a long time since we focused on that.

04:11:24.180 --> 04:11:29.500
[Guest]: For a while after independence, I think what held us together was a combination of necessity

04:11:29.500 --> 04:11:31.060
[Guest]: and humanity.

04:11:31.060 --> 04:11:37.780
[Guest]: And all those, you know, slightly cheesy hum ek hai, anek hai, you know, unity and diversity

04:11:37.780 --> 04:11:39.460
[Guest]: ads and all of that.

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:42.540
[Guest]: They were cheesy, but they had a function, there was functionality to it.

04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:48.160
[Guest]: And that was to remind us that simply we couldn't afford hate, we didn't have to love each other.

04:11:48.160 --> 04:11:54.300
[Guest]: A lot of this living side by side with each other, these agreements that we hammered out,

04:11:54.300 --> 04:11:59.940
[Guest]: even in America, even in England or Europe, it's only in the big cities that you have

04:11:59.940 --> 04:12:06.540
[Guest]: assimilation, integration, you know, all of these things, they cut against our deepest

04:12:06.540 --> 04:12:09.500
[Guest]: tribal instincts, right?

04:12:09.500 --> 04:12:12.220
[Guest]: And still, and still we abide.

04:12:12.220 --> 04:12:13.220
[Guest]: And still we fight back.

04:12:13.220 --> 04:12:17.400
[Guest]: And still we try to find a way to say that this shouldn't happen, and maybe we should

04:12:17.400 --> 04:12:18.400
[Guest]: be together.

04:12:18.400 --> 04:12:21.620
[Guest]: And still there is courage, an enormous amount of courage.

04:12:21.620 --> 04:12:26.860
[Guest]: So if you ask me where there's hope, the hope for me lies in the fact that many people haven't

04:12:26.860 --> 04:12:33.100
[Guest]: given up, that there is a quiet bravery, whether it's in protests, such as the farmers protest

04:12:33.100 --> 04:12:36.000
[Guest]: or the citizens protest.

04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:40.920
[Guest]: It's easy to mock people who are standing up and reading out the preamble.

04:12:40.920 --> 04:12:47.060
[Guest]: But if you've been there on a cold winter night in Delhi or out in Lucknow or somewhere,

04:12:47.060 --> 04:12:50.900
[Guest]: and you've heard the fervor and the faith in people's voices, you know that somewhere

04:12:50.900 --> 04:12:57.060
[Guest]: there's a contrary ripple that is reaching back to that time and saying, what if?

04:12:57.060 --> 04:13:01.100
[Guest]: What if we could imagine ourselves back into existence again?

04:13:01.100 --> 04:13:04.260
[Guest]: I don't think any country skips that, Amit.

04:13:04.260 --> 04:13:11.540
[Guest]: You know, that question of who we are and Europe is facing it in its own way, you know.

04:13:11.540 --> 04:13:16.220
[Guest]: If Europe lets go of nationhood, then what is it but a collection of warring empires

04:13:16.220 --> 04:13:20.040
[Guest]: without colonies, you see?

04:13:20.040 --> 04:13:24.420
[Guest]: What is America if it lets go of its original declarations?

04:13:24.420 --> 04:13:28.220
[Guest]: So again, here we are back at the imagination.

04:13:28.220 --> 04:13:30.280
[Guest]: You have to imagine yourself into a people.

04:13:30.280 --> 04:13:39.300
[Guest]: You have to imagine this whole project of unity, diversity, living together, secularism.

04:13:39.300 --> 04:13:41.940
[Guest]: It isn't as easy as just seeing it.

04:13:41.940 --> 04:13:47.580
[Guest]: One thing that forged people together after the freedom struggle was if you read Manohar

04:13:47.580 --> 04:13:52.820
[Guest]: Malgankar and if you read Mulk Raj Adan and other writers from that period, Kamla Das,

04:13:52.820 --> 04:13:59.500
[Guest]: etc., Kanthapura, Raja Rao's great book, you see that it wasn't this cartoon story

04:13:59.500 --> 04:14:03.260
[Guest]: of the whole country coming together to fight the British.

04:14:03.260 --> 04:14:06.660
[Guest]: Among the Indians, there were many who rested their faith in the princely states that were

04:14:06.660 --> 04:14:09.660
[Guest]: taken apart after independence.

04:14:09.660 --> 04:14:17.500
[Guest]: There were many who were also perfectly happy to let the British be the emperors of this

04:14:17.500 --> 04:14:18.500
[Guest]: age.

04:14:18.500 --> 04:14:19.500
[Guest]: Take care what is wrong.

04:14:19.500 --> 04:14:20.500
[Guest]: We are Rai Bahadurs.

04:14:20.500 --> 04:14:22.060
[Guest]: We are benefiting from the system.

04:14:22.060 --> 04:14:24.780
[Guest]: They're not so bad, etc.

04:14:24.780 --> 04:14:29.420
[Guest]: You have to imagine independence for yourself and any country that can do that has a shot

04:14:29.420 --> 04:14:35.060
[Guest]: at imagining its way back to safety from where we are heading.

04:14:35.060 --> 04:14:40.700
[Guest]: The only thing is that once you have a certain kind of conflict or breakout, once you open

04:14:40.700 --> 04:14:45.820
[Guest]: the doors to all the things that we are fearing, whether it's some people fear civil war,

04:14:45.820 --> 04:14:50.620
[Guest]: some people fear another genocide, some people just fear a time of vast persecution, endless

04:14:50.620 --> 04:14:56.980
[Guest]: persecution that's normalized and where all you have to ask of the other people in

04:14:56.980 --> 04:14:59.460
[Guest]: this project is to look away.

04:14:59.460 --> 04:15:06.020
[Guest]: You know, you assure them immunity and you say look away and that's all that is required.

04:15:06.020 --> 04:15:12.580
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I'll make a brief anti-national aside and then ask the follow-up question

04:15:12.580 --> 04:15:17.420
[Amit Varma]: to the follow-up question, going further and further down tributaries and branching to

04:15:17.420 --> 04:15:19.060
[Amit Varma]: God knows where.

04:15:19.060 --> 04:15:25.020
[Amit Varma]: And the aside is that what you mentioned about the country breaking up and all of that.

04:15:25.020 --> 04:15:28.940
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better if we weren't one united country, but if we

04:15:28.940 --> 04:15:36.420
[Amit Varma]: were many countries, like I did an episode on the great VP Menon with Narayani Basu.

04:15:36.420 --> 04:15:41.460
[Amit Varma]: And one of the sort of things I realized while reading up on Menon and Sardar Patel and what

04:15:41.460 --> 04:15:47.060
[Amit Varma]: they did was that what Patel and Menon did in bringing this great country politically

04:15:47.060 --> 04:15:53.500
[Amit Varma]: together, you know, between the years 47 to 50, was like an act of fast track colonization.

04:15:53.500 --> 04:15:57.620
[Amit Varma]: What the British did over centuries, these guys did in a few months, a lot of it through

04:15:57.620 --> 04:15:59.060
[Amit Varma]: violence and coercion.

04:15:59.060 --> 04:16:02.300
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I believe the end doesn't justify the means.

04:16:02.300 --> 04:16:05.180
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it through promises that were later broken.

04:16:05.180 --> 04:16:08.660
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to be in many ways a profoundly immoral act.

04:16:08.660 --> 04:16:09.660
[Amit Varma]: But leave that aside.

04:16:09.660 --> 04:16:10.660
[Amit Varma]: It is what it is.

04:16:10.660 --> 04:16:15.020
[Amit Varma]: And both of us love this country for what it is and so on and so forth.

04:16:15.020 --> 04:16:19.700
[Amit Varma]: But that's just a thought I sometimes have that maybe if we were many different countries

04:16:19.700 --> 04:16:24.660
[Amit Varma]: or different nations, governance would be much better because the point is, governance

04:16:24.660 --> 04:16:26.980
[Amit Varma]: gets better, the more local it is.

04:16:26.980 --> 04:16:33.900
[Amit Varma]: And we have too much of a sort of a centralized system and that kind of works against it.

04:16:33.900 --> 04:16:37.940
[Amit Varma]: You know, why not just have a whole bunch of states competing with each other to govern

04:16:37.940 --> 04:16:42.080
[Amit Varma]: better and to attract people and to attract capital and so on and so forth.

04:16:42.080 --> 04:16:46.660
[Amit Varma]: Because we have nowhere near the federalized kind of system that we should though I having

04:16:46.660 --> 04:16:52.500
[Amit Varma]: articulated this aside, you know, when you mentioned partition, you mentioned the inevitable

04:16:52.500 --> 04:16:57.220
[Amit Varma]: violence of partition and that word inevitable strikes me and I think it's an apt term.

04:16:57.220 --> 04:17:02.300
[Amit Varma]: And I think it's I would apply it to where we are today and say that this was inevitable

04:17:02.300 --> 04:17:08.460
[Amit Varma]: because my sense is that one, our society was always like this, but why is it so bad

04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:09.460
[Amit Varma]: today?

04:17:09.460 --> 04:17:10.780
[Amit Varma]: Why is it amplified so much?

04:17:10.780 --> 04:17:16.260
[Amit Varma]: And I turn to this concept I picked up from Timur Kuran's 1999 book, Public Lies, Private

04:17:16.260 --> 04:17:21.540
[Amit Varma]: Truths, where he came up with the concept of preference falsification.

04:17:21.540 --> 04:17:23.500
[Amit Varma]: And he gave the example of the Soviet Union.

04:17:23.500 --> 04:17:29.620
[Amit Varma]: Till the last years of the Soviet Union, nobody in that place spoke against the state because

04:17:29.620 --> 04:17:33.400
[Amit Varma]: they thought they were the only ones who felt that way, who felt that anger.

04:17:33.400 --> 04:17:37.020
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, they hid their preference.

04:17:37.020 --> 04:17:38.820
[Amit Varma]: That was preference falsification.

04:17:38.820 --> 04:17:42.340
[Amit Varma]: And the example Kuran gave us, look, at one point there was something called a preference

04:17:42.340 --> 04:17:45.940
[Amit Varma]: cascade where people realized that, hey, they're not the only ones.

04:17:45.940 --> 04:17:47.340
[Amit Varma]: Everybody feels like them.

04:17:47.340 --> 04:17:50.620
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually, it seems like it happened almost overnight.

04:17:50.620 --> 04:17:53.020
[Amit Varma]: But people didn't change their minds overnight.

04:17:53.020 --> 04:17:55.020
[Amit Varma]: They could just express themselves.

04:17:55.020 --> 04:17:59.500
[Amit Varma]: And I think in a negative sense, a similar thing happened with social media, where I

04:17:59.500 --> 04:18:04.620
[Amit Varma]: think people within our society were fundamentally bigoted and sexist and casteist and all of

04:18:04.620 --> 04:18:05.620
[Amit Varma]: that.

04:18:05.620 --> 04:18:09.000
[Amit Varma]: But it wasn't it was not something you could express in polite company.

04:18:09.000 --> 04:18:10.300
[Amit Varma]: You felt guilty about it.

04:18:10.300 --> 04:18:12.180
[Amit Varma]: It was something you held within you.

04:18:12.180 --> 04:18:16.460
[Amit Varma]: And with social media, you suddenly realized that, damn it, everybody feels like me.

04:18:16.460 --> 04:18:20.340
[Amit Varma]: And then you become emboldened to express yourself openly.

04:18:20.340 --> 04:18:23.740
[Amit Varma]: And you don't need like politicians stop dog whistling because they can just say things

04:18:23.740 --> 04:18:24.740
[Amit Varma]: directly.

04:18:24.740 --> 04:18:25.740
[Amit Varma]: They don't need to dog whistle anymore.

04:18:25.740 --> 04:18:30.700
[Amit Varma]: So, so the hatred that we see around us has found expression in modern times because of

04:18:30.700 --> 04:18:35.500
[Amit Varma]: technology and social media, but has not been created in modern times.

04:18:35.500 --> 04:18:38.500
[Amit Varma]: It was always there simmering beneath the surface.

04:18:38.500 --> 04:18:40.820
[Amit Varma]: And it was bound to come out at some point.

04:18:40.820 --> 04:18:45.940
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that you sort of mentioned where you speak about imagining in India the

04:18:45.940 --> 04:18:52.660
[Amit Varma]: necessary to imagine in India, you know, I think it was a grand task done by well-meaning

04:18:52.660 --> 04:18:55.060
[Amit Varma]: men with the best of intentions.

04:18:55.060 --> 04:19:00.940
[Amit Varma]: But I also think that it failed because that imagination, when it happened was done by

04:19:00.940 --> 04:19:05.100
[Amit Varma]: a group of elites and the India they were imagining was not the India there was.

04:19:05.100 --> 04:19:09.580
[Amit Varma]: And in trying to force fit the India of their imagination into the real India, they failed

04:19:09.580 --> 04:19:15.660
[Amit Varma]: because it tried to go top down and not bottom up like one, you know, trope that I keep revisiting

04:19:15.660 --> 04:19:21.140
[Amit Varma]: on my shows is how, if you look at our constitution, it was essentially a liberal constitution,

04:19:21.140 --> 04:19:26.380
[Amit Varma]: nowhere near as liberal as I would like, but relatively, it was essentially a liberal constitution

04:19:26.380 --> 04:19:29.260
[Amit Varma]: imposed on an illiberal society.

04:19:29.260 --> 04:19:34.820
[Amit Varma]: And one you can also meta question about whether such an imposition can be liberal itself.

04:19:34.820 --> 04:19:39.340
[Amit Varma]: But therefore, it was bound to fail that Gandhi was right where he said that you have to change

04:19:39.340 --> 04:19:42.900
[Amit Varma]: society from within, top down interventions will fail.

04:19:42.900 --> 04:19:47.140
[Amit Varma]: And I think we see, you know, the folly of that act of imagination today.

04:19:47.140 --> 04:19:52.140
[Amit Varma]: And I would say that if elites today try to imagine a new India into being, it is bound

04:19:52.140 --> 04:19:53.380
[Amit Varma]: to fail in the same way.

04:19:53.380 --> 04:19:56.980
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think it's a bad thing that elites and all those kind of elites are no longer

04:19:56.980 --> 04:20:00.420
[Amit Varma]: in power, because they were foolish and they failed.

04:20:00.420 --> 04:20:02.180
[Amit Varma]: And we didn't get anywhere with that.

04:20:02.180 --> 04:20:06.860
[Amit Varma]: What we need to do is make society more liberal, if that is possible.

04:20:06.860 --> 04:20:10.540
[Amit Varma]: And I believe it is possible, but I believe it's very difficult and we are not really

04:20:10.540 --> 04:20:12.860
[Amit Varma]: moving towards that so far.

04:20:12.860 --> 04:20:18.700
[Amit Varma]: So just a bunch of sort of thoughts on, you know, what we were speaking about.

04:20:18.700 --> 04:20:21.740
[Amit Varma]: So do you have something you'd like to respond to?

04:20:21.740 --> 04:20:28.700
[Guest]: I was thinking about the inevitability of some things, you know, as this peculiar thing

04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:33.220
[Guest]: called a nation when you don't even speak the same language.

04:20:33.220 --> 04:20:38.220
[Guest]: We say we have a common history, but parts of the South, parts of the Northeast, parts

04:20:38.220 --> 04:20:42.340
[Guest]: of the West have very, very distinct and individual histories.

04:20:42.340 --> 04:20:44.980
[Guest]: I don't really agree with the fragmentation theory.

04:20:44.980 --> 04:20:49.980
[Guest]: I think in practice, you'll find that it's a much less utopian and more messy thing.

04:20:49.980 --> 04:20:52.820
[Guest]: You know, Balkan violence is what you're sort of mean.

04:20:52.820 --> 04:20:53.820
[Guest]: Exactly.

04:20:53.820 --> 04:20:54.820
[Guest]: Quite aside from being anti-national.

04:20:54.820 --> 04:21:04.380
[Guest]: But let me get back to a few things, I don't think that this country was imagined into

04:21:04.380 --> 04:21:08.100
[Guest]: being entirely by a handful of elites.

04:21:08.100 --> 04:21:13.380
[Guest]: One of the things that one of our major national parties has forgotten, actually, is how broad

04:21:13.380 --> 04:21:19.420
[Guest]: its origins were as a big tent and how diverse the group of people and politicians who gravitated

04:21:19.420 --> 04:21:22.460
[Guest]: to the Congress in that time were.

04:21:22.460 --> 04:21:27.420
[Guest]: I don't think that we should idolize anything, whether that is the party presently in charge

04:21:27.420 --> 04:21:34.420
[Guest]: or the Congress of Gandhi's time, you know, to see things through the lens of adulation

04:21:34.420 --> 04:21:36.900
[Guest]: and how fantastic they were.

04:21:36.900 --> 04:21:39.900
[Guest]: What the Congress really was, was a mass movement.

04:21:39.900 --> 04:21:46.460
[Guest]: And I'm stressing that mass to say that I think where Gandhi and the other leaders extraordinary

04:21:46.460 --> 04:21:53.980
[Guest]: achievement was, was to carry a huge proportion of the body politic along with them, to rouse

04:21:53.980 --> 04:21:59.780
[Guest]: them to a fever of longing for this ideal country.

04:21:59.780 --> 04:22:03.540
[Guest]: Set us against that and we're not going to discuss ideas of India because, you know,

04:22:03.540 --> 04:22:06.380
[Guest]: that's such an old and trash debate.

04:22:06.380 --> 04:22:12.700
[Guest]: But there is the dream of the Begumpura, you know, the ideal place where without caste,

04:22:12.700 --> 04:22:18.540
[Guest]: without communal differences, without religions, there's also apparent and longing for that.

04:22:18.540 --> 04:22:20.140
[Guest]: Now let's bring technology in.

04:22:20.140 --> 04:22:27.220
[Guest]: Curiously enough, one of the areas where I'm optimistic about is after seeing the damage

04:22:27.220 --> 04:22:34.140
[Guest]: done across the globe by big tech and by the weaponization of tech as a tool to spread

04:22:34.140 --> 04:22:39.540
[Guest]: very successfully narratives, feelings, attitudes, beliefs of hatred.

04:22:39.540 --> 04:22:43.260
[Guest]: One of these questions that we keep asking ourselves, oh, were we always like this, were

04:22:43.260 --> 04:22:45.260
[Guest]: we always hateful?

04:22:45.260 --> 04:22:49.580
[Guest]: And I think of that old, you know, it well, you know, that Buddhist meditation story about

04:22:49.580 --> 04:22:51.540
[Guest]: the two wolves.

04:22:51.540 --> 04:22:59.340
[Guest]: You know, you have two wolves, one destructive, one enormously creative, one benevolent, one

04:22:59.340 --> 04:23:00.340
[Guest]: hostile.

04:23:00.340 --> 04:23:03.340
[Guest]: There's four wolves, I get what you're saying.

04:23:03.340 --> 04:23:09.260
[Guest]: But you know, benevolent, creative one side and hostile and destructive on the other.

04:23:09.260 --> 04:23:10.940
[Amit Varma]: You wanted a wolf when you were a child.

04:23:10.940 --> 04:23:12.140
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, that's an aside.

04:23:12.140 --> 04:23:15.340
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, people have to read your book and learn about.

04:23:15.340 --> 04:23:19.860
[Guest]: Of course, I wanted a wolf, who doesn't?

04:23:19.860 --> 04:23:23.580
[Guest]: I don't want a wolf, but I find this very strange.

04:23:23.580 --> 04:23:26.820
[Guest]: Anyway, so to get back to these two wolves, it's it's a simple question.

04:23:26.820 --> 04:23:28.780
[Guest]: It's the one you feed.

04:23:28.780 --> 04:23:34.180
[Guest]: And we pay too much emphasis on are we like this, are we like that, do we have this in

04:23:34.180 --> 04:23:36.220
[Guest]: our national character?

04:23:36.220 --> 04:23:40.300
[Guest]: Yeah, where are people's attention being directed?

04:23:40.300 --> 04:23:42.420
[Guest]: What are they consuming?

04:23:42.420 --> 04:23:48.460
[Guest]: And our belief, you know, in the fullness of a personality in independent of this is

04:23:48.460 --> 04:23:51.240
[Guest]: touching but deeply misplaced.

04:23:51.240 --> 04:23:57.260
[Guest]: Every one of us, in addition to having that unbreakable seed of a self inside, is also

04:23:57.260 --> 04:24:03.020
[Guest]: basically a component of a mixture of everything that we have consumed, everything that we're

04:24:03.020 --> 04:24:08.620
[Guest]: taking in, and most seriously, where we are directing our attention to.

04:24:08.620 --> 04:24:15.880
[Guest]: So you know, as dismayed as I've been by the consequences of this technologically driven

04:24:15.880 --> 04:24:21.980
[Guest]: and enabled hate, a simple example, you know, you've seen what Twitter is these days.

04:24:21.980 --> 04:24:27.780
[Guest]: Imagine a Twitter where for just one day, it is not possible to abuse Kashmiris, Muslims,

04:24:27.780 --> 04:24:32.980
[Guest]: Bengalis, liberals, seculars, for one day, it's not there.

04:24:32.980 --> 04:24:37.860
[Guest]: And you can see it and those are our pet hates, other people have different pet hates.

04:24:37.860 --> 04:24:42.660
[Guest]: But for that one day, discourse would be that much freer, people's blood pressure would

04:24:42.660 --> 04:24:46.980
[Guest]: not be that high, their sense of being under threat and being attacked would be much, much

04:24:46.980 --> 04:24:47.980
[Guest]: lower.

04:24:47.980 --> 04:24:54.020
[Guest]: In effect, if you could cut that out, you would change the stream itself, you would

04:24:54.020 --> 04:24:58.300
[Guest]: change where people were looking.

04:24:58.300 --> 04:25:04.620
[Guest]: If your attention has been directed to hate, it's not just because people love hating or

04:25:04.620 --> 04:25:10.980
[Guest]: because we have this ancient enemy or whatever, it's simply because hatred in the short run

04:25:10.980 --> 04:25:15.540
[Guest]: is politically extremely lucrative, right?

04:25:15.540 --> 04:25:21.860
[Guest]: Run a riot or mini riot or a set of, you know, demolitions or destructions of people's homes,

04:25:21.860 --> 04:25:24.500
[Guest]: and you will win an election.

04:25:24.500 --> 04:25:25.500
[Guest]: It's as simple as that.

04:25:25.500 --> 04:25:29.780
[Guest]: If there wasn't a coordination between the two people would not do it.

04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:39.940
[Guest]: If for 8-10 years, the people who have been most concerned with spreading propaganda,

04:25:39.940 --> 04:25:47.020
[Guest]: most diligent about it, most engaged in this project, and who have also mastered the tools

04:25:47.020 --> 04:25:54.140
[Guest]: that were available to everybody, right from the start of this decade onwards, then don't

04:25:54.140 --> 04:25:59.180
[Guest]: blame technology per se for being a purveyor of hate.

04:25:59.180 --> 04:26:04.700
[Guest]: What it shows you silently is that if you take the other projects as seriously, and

04:26:04.700 --> 04:26:09.260
[Guest]: let me just say this on mic so that we have this, spread love.

04:26:09.260 --> 04:26:10.260
[Guest]: What's your first reaction?

04:26:10.260 --> 04:26:17.100
[Guest]: Your first reaction is, what the hell yaar, cynicism, laughter, you know, sirf pyaar batao.

04:26:17.100 --> 04:26:18.580
[Guest]: What kind of ussi message is that?

04:26:18.580 --> 04:26:21.140
[Guest]: That's what we think of love, right?

04:26:21.140 --> 04:26:25.940
[Guest]: We don't think of love or loving each other or being compassionate or living together

04:26:25.940 --> 04:26:26.940
[Guest]: as good things.

04:26:26.940 --> 04:26:29.260
[Guest]: We think of them as prissy things.

04:26:29.260 --> 04:26:30.700
[Guest]: How do you change that messaging?

04:26:30.700 --> 04:26:32.420
[Guest]: People are smart here.

04:26:32.420 --> 04:26:35.500
[Guest]: If you really want to change it, you can.

04:26:35.500 --> 04:26:40.180
[Guest]: But that has to be not just a political project, it has to be a social project.

04:26:40.180 --> 04:26:41.180
[Guest]: Is it possible?

04:26:41.180 --> 04:26:49.580
[Guest]: Yes, because in microcosms, it did help us live by each other's sides uneasily, imperfectly,

04:26:49.580 --> 04:26:52.060
[Guest]: but still try, you know.

04:26:52.060 --> 04:26:56.580
[Guest]: Cities like Delhi and Bombay and Calcutta have, honestly, Calcutta has a reputation

04:26:56.580 --> 04:27:00.340
[Guest]: for being eclectic, but the same multivisions do operate.

04:27:00.340 --> 04:27:04.620
[Guest]: There's a South Calcutta and a North Calcutta, there's a South Bombay and there's the rest

04:27:04.620 --> 04:27:07.700
[Guest]: of Bombay as well.

04:27:07.700 --> 04:27:13.780
[Guest]: I think we are imperfect in these projects, but I think we've done enough of the movement

04:27:13.780 --> 04:27:16.460
[Guest]: of people from villages to the city.

04:27:16.460 --> 04:27:22.540
[Guest]: The places that taught me in Delhi that we could live side-by-side, I don't want to romanticize

04:27:22.540 --> 04:27:25.680
[Guest]: this, but unfortunately, this is actually a truth.

04:27:25.680 --> 04:27:32.900
[Guest]: It was not the new slums, it was not the old grand residential colonies, which fall very

04:27:32.900 --> 04:27:36.380
[Guest]: easily back, you know, the RWAs and the gated colonies.

04:27:36.380 --> 04:27:41.380
[Guest]: Unconsciously, they will fall back into the habits of segregation and they will keep people

04:27:41.380 --> 04:27:42.380
[Guest]: out.

04:27:42.380 --> 04:27:48.100
[Guest]: You can see that the map of South Delhi itself is changing to be far more, you know, majoritarian

04:27:48.100 --> 04:27:51.900
[Guest]: than it used to be and far less assimilative.

04:27:51.900 --> 04:27:53.940
[Guest]: But it was the in-between places.

04:27:53.940 --> 04:28:01.020
[Guest]: It was the Lajpat Nagar places which are grudgingly, but for money, you know, open to refugees

04:28:01.020 --> 04:28:04.700
[Guest]: from all across South Asia.

04:28:04.700 --> 04:28:09.300
[Guest]: And it was some of the slum clusters, by and large, not the new ones, because the new ones

04:28:09.300 --> 04:28:14.060
[Guest]: almost always divide in terms of you've come from here, you hang out with people from where

04:28:14.060 --> 04:28:15.660
[Guest]: you've come from.

04:28:15.660 --> 04:28:19.300
[Guest]: The moment that they get a little older and a little more layered, people have to learn

04:28:19.300 --> 04:28:21.980
[Guest]: to live together.

04:28:21.980 --> 04:28:26.420
[Guest]: And you know, even if their version of living together is two communities sitting with an

04:28:26.420 --> 04:28:32.220
[Guest]: edge and a border between them, one thing that I'm hearing in this time of hatred, effective

04:28:32.220 --> 04:28:36.940
[Guest]: hatred, is we used to celebrate, but now we don't.

04:28:36.940 --> 04:28:40.740
[Guest]: Our roads used to go past each other's house, but now we don't.

04:28:40.740 --> 04:28:44.660
[Guest]: You can despair, or you can stop and think, wait a second, for all these years we used

04:28:44.660 --> 04:28:49.100
[Guest]: to live together, where did we learn that?

04:28:49.100 --> 04:28:51.620
[Guest]: Why aren't we paying more attention to that?

04:28:51.620 --> 04:28:52.620
[Guest]: I think it's possible.

04:28:52.620 --> 04:28:59.420
[Guest]: I just think that it is such a gigantic project and it requires such a shift internally, you

04:28:59.420 --> 04:29:00.900
[Guest]: know, to our minds.

04:29:00.900 --> 04:29:04.500
[Guest]: One of the reasons why I say that we can't afford despair is not because, okay, we're

04:29:04.500 --> 04:29:07.740
[Guest]: part of this great battle that we're going to win.

04:29:07.740 --> 04:29:14.400
[Guest]: But if you, anywhere in the world, including our country, if you are despairing because

04:29:14.400 --> 04:29:19.100
[Guest]: the right wing is rising, well, you know, one thing we could learn from the right is

04:29:19.100 --> 04:29:23.340
[Guest]: that they've sat there without power, in clusters that have been very divided, without much

04:29:23.340 --> 04:29:27.540
[Guest]: in the way of resources, for well over 30, 40 years.

04:29:27.540 --> 04:29:32.700
[Guest]: It's been, I forget how many years, but at least decades since Alice Munro wrote an incredible

04:29:32.700 --> 04:29:40.700
[Guest]: short story about, you know, the battles that they were having over Darwin, okay.

04:29:40.700 --> 04:29:44.540
[Guest]: Many many years later, you have book bands in America taking hold.

04:29:44.540 --> 04:29:50.060
[Guest]: It's taken that much time to get to the place where you have power and you have agency as

04:29:50.060 --> 04:29:55.300
[Guest]: a member of the rising right, or if your hate politics become effective.

04:29:55.300 --> 04:29:59.460
[Guest]: It takes 40 years of engineering, 50 years of engineering.

04:29:59.460 --> 04:30:04.900
[Guest]: So I ask you, is this the time to give up, or is this the time to actually start thinking

04:30:04.900 --> 04:30:07.420
[Guest]: about these things seriously?

04:30:07.420 --> 04:30:11.940
[Guest]: If you're going to preach love, then can you find a way to do it that makes people not

04:30:11.940 --> 04:30:15.620
[Guest]: switch off the televisions immediately?

04:30:15.620 --> 04:30:20.020
[Guest]: If you're going to find a practical reason for why love should triumph, make that argument.

04:30:20.020 --> 04:30:24.260
[Guest]: In literature, in poetry, but most of all in politics.

04:30:24.260 --> 04:30:26.100
[Guest]: So I'll come up with an observation.

04:30:26.100 --> 04:30:30.300
[Guest]: Frankly, I don't think we can afford despair.

04:30:30.300 --> 04:30:34.660
[Amit Varma]: So I'll come up with an observation that is bookended by the thought of spreading love.

04:30:34.660 --> 04:30:39.060
[Amit Varma]: And first of all, thank you for, you know, you brought a smile to my face by mentioning

04:30:39.060 --> 04:30:42.940
[Amit Varma]: Alice Munro, a writer I love so much, my favorite living writer by far.

04:30:42.940 --> 04:30:46.820
[Amit Varma]: And I'll in fact link my favorite short stories by her in the show notes, because why not

04:30:46.820 --> 04:30:47.900
[Amit Varma]: everyone should read them?

04:30:47.900 --> 04:30:49.860
[Amit Varma]: She's amazing.

04:30:49.860 --> 04:30:50.860
[Amit Varma]: Spreading love.

04:30:50.860 --> 04:30:54.300
[Amit Varma]: The interesting thing is that I don't want to paint social media or Twitter as all bad

04:30:54.300 --> 04:30:59.260
[Amit Varma]: because you know, one of the things I've realized is that there's a lot of joy to be had from

04:30:59.260 --> 04:31:02.060
[Amit Varma]: Twitter if you curate your feed properly.

04:31:02.060 --> 04:31:08.020
[Amit Varma]: That what you really have also on Twitter is you are all the time exposed to the best

04:31:08.020 --> 04:31:13.900
[Amit Varma]: minds in the world thinking aloud for your benefit, which is pretty remarkable enough.

04:31:13.900 --> 04:31:17.340
[Amit Varma]: You know, and there's a small group of people, for example, who'll share poetry, you'll write

04:31:17.340 --> 04:31:19.700
[Amit Varma]: about books and so on and so forth.

04:31:19.700 --> 04:31:22.100
[Amit Varma]: And I would call that spreading love.

04:31:22.100 --> 04:31:24.340
[Amit Varma]: But that's not so dominant.

04:31:24.340 --> 04:31:27.980
[Amit Varma]: And that's really, that's in a sense, silent.

04:31:27.980 --> 04:31:34.820
[Amit Varma]: The trend that I see what social media does is that the way it polarizes us really is

04:31:34.820 --> 04:31:39.940
[Amit Varma]: that we go on social media, everybody wants to have a sense of community and tribe and

04:31:39.940 --> 04:31:40.980
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

04:31:40.980 --> 04:31:45.500
[Amit Varma]: So people will typically join ideological tribes at the extremes of the left and the

04:31:45.500 --> 04:31:46.700
[Amit Varma]: right.

04:31:46.700 --> 04:31:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And then they want to the incentives are obviously to raise the status within that tribe.

04:31:51.920 --> 04:31:55.740
[Amit Varma]: And the way to do it is by attacking people on the other side, never addressing arguments,

04:31:55.740 --> 04:31:59.780
[Amit Varma]: but just attacking and snarking, and so on, and then attacking people on their own side

04:31:59.780 --> 04:32:01.580
[Amit Varma]: for not being pure enough.

04:32:01.580 --> 04:32:07.340
[Amit Varma]: And that tendency to swing towards the extremes, because that's the only way you can rise in

04:32:07.340 --> 04:32:11.540
[Amit Varma]: status is something that you see in the real world.

04:32:11.540 --> 04:32:16.660
[Amit Varma]: And in our politics as well, like, you know, there was a time where a political scientist

04:32:16.660 --> 04:32:21.660
[Amit Varma]: uses term called the median voter theorem, where the idea was that if you just take the

04:32:21.660 --> 04:32:25.980
[Amit Varma]: US as a simple example for a moment, because there are two large parties, and that's it,

04:32:25.980 --> 04:32:31.220
[Amit Varma]: you know, the two parties may swing in whatever directions during the primaries, but in the

04:32:31.220 --> 04:32:35.700
[Amit Varma]: main election, they would always sort of swing towards the center.

04:32:35.700 --> 04:32:40.420
[Amit Varma]: It's all like the metaphor drawn for this is of ice cream vendors at a beach, let's

04:32:40.420 --> 04:32:43.820
[Amit Varma]: say there's one ice cream vendor at a beach, he can be anywhere along it.

04:32:43.820 --> 04:32:47.860
[Amit Varma]: But if there are two, the incentive is to be as close to the center as possible, those

04:32:47.860 --> 04:32:52.300
[Amit Varma]: two vendors may start out at the edges, but then the closer they get, the more optimal

04:32:52.300 --> 04:32:54.780
[Amit Varma]: it is for them in terms of people walking by.

04:32:54.780 --> 04:32:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And eventually, you'll have them right next to each other, neighboring ice cream vendors

04:32:58.000 --> 04:33:00.740
[Amit Varma]: in the center of this pathway.

04:33:00.740 --> 04:33:05.740
[Amit Varma]: So what you would typically have expected in the 2016 presidential elections in the

04:33:05.740 --> 04:33:10.740
[Amit Varma]: US, for example, would be Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush, because they were from different

04:33:10.740 --> 04:33:18.620
[Amit Varma]: parties, but they were pretty much identical in their politics, the differences are just

04:33:18.620 --> 04:33:19.620
[Amit Varma]: surface.

04:33:19.620 --> 04:33:25.300
[Amit Varma]: But they were really similar, really mainstream, beholden to the similar set of interest groups,

04:33:25.300 --> 04:33:27.420
[Amit Varma]: big money interest groups, and so on and so forth.

04:33:27.420 --> 04:33:32.820
[Amit Varma]: Where it fell apart was in Trump, because he was just not part of the picture at all.

04:33:32.820 --> 04:33:37.460
[Amit Varma]: And politics swung to the extremes and just as the right swung to the extremes.

04:33:37.460 --> 04:33:40.860
[Amit Varma]: And I don't even know if it's fair to call them the right because Trump took the party

04:33:40.860 --> 04:33:46.180
[Amit Varma]: in Republican Party in directions which had nothing to do with the values of the Republican

04:33:46.180 --> 04:33:47.180
[Amit Varma]: Party at all.

04:33:47.180 --> 04:33:48.180
[Amit Varma]: Right?

04:33:48.180 --> 04:33:53.040
[Amit Varma]: He was like a black swan, like his economics is just the opposite of Republican economics

04:33:53.040 --> 04:33:56.960
[Amit Varma]: in his opposition to trade, for example, very so much like Bernie Sanders.

04:33:56.960 --> 04:34:00.820
[Amit Varma]: But the point being that they swung to the extremes, and they're still swinging to the

04:34:00.820 --> 04:34:06.440
[Amit Varma]: extremes today, because that is how today you rise within a party.

04:34:06.440 --> 04:34:11.320
[Amit Varma]: And an example of that would be that Dharam Sansad at the end of the last year, when you

04:34:11.320 --> 04:34:16.760
[Amit Varma]: had this whole bunch of saints or godmen or whatever all in quote marks, giving these

04:34:16.760 --> 04:34:20.600
[Amit Varma]: incredibly incendiary speeches calling for genocide and so on.

04:34:20.600 --> 04:34:26.540
[Amit Varma]: And my sense there is that that's this drive towards extremism playing out.

04:34:26.540 --> 04:34:30.780
[Amit Varma]: Because if you look at the incentives of the leaders there, you know, it's it's a competition

04:34:30.780 --> 04:34:35.540
[Amit Varma]: who can rouse the crowds more who can stand out more and the only way to do that is not

04:34:35.540 --> 04:34:39.300
[Amit Varma]: by preaching love, but by swinging towards the extreme.

04:34:39.300 --> 04:34:44.140
[Amit Varma]: So I think if it was one guy giving a speech alone, it would not have been so toxic.

04:34:44.140 --> 04:34:48.340
[Amit Varma]: But because you have all these people competing with each other, there are no limits, all

04:34:48.340 --> 04:34:49.580
[Amit Varma]: bets are off.

04:34:49.580 --> 04:34:54.540
[Amit Varma]: And as you know, the political theorist Carl Schmitt famously said, perhaps a century ago

04:34:54.540 --> 04:34:59.620
[Amit Varma]: that politics is all about the other you need an other in politics, you know, spreading

04:34:59.620 --> 04:35:02.300
[Amit Varma]: love does not win you votes, spreading hate does.

04:35:02.300 --> 04:35:05.300
[Amit Varma]: So that's sort of just how it is.

04:35:05.300 --> 04:35:12.440
[Amit Varma]: So I want to talk about this, therefore, also, in the context of like, if we dive back to

04:35:12.440 --> 04:35:18.860
[Amit Varma]: feminism for a moment, right, both Kavita Krishnan and Manjuma Bhattacharya recently

04:35:18.860 --> 04:35:23.780
[Amit Varma]: spoke about how we have to see that there is a difference between feminism on the ground,

04:35:23.780 --> 04:35:27.420
[Amit Varma]: people who are actually out there in the real world doing things making women's lives better

04:35:27.420 --> 04:35:34.340
[Amit Varma]: off, as opposed to a lot of the toxic posturing that you see on social media for from armchair

04:35:34.340 --> 04:35:35.340
[Amit Varma]: warriors.

04:35:35.340 --> 04:35:38.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is my articulation, none of them use these words, I'm saying this.

04:35:38.580 --> 04:35:40.820
[Amit Varma]: And that's something that interests me.

04:35:40.820 --> 04:35:47.060
[Amit Varma]: Because what I find in a lot of the woke politics, for example, is a sense of identity as something

04:35:47.060 --> 04:35:48.060
[Amit Varma]: immutable.

04:35:48.060 --> 04:35:51.900
[Amit Varma]: And you get a mirror image of this in the right.

04:35:51.900 --> 04:35:54.500
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that that's incredibly disturbing.

04:35:54.500 --> 04:35:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Because as you know, I'm, for me, the ultimate value is in individual rights and consent

04:35:59.860 --> 04:36:00.860
[Amit Varma]: and autonomy.

04:36:00.860 --> 04:36:04.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, no one should be pinned down to an identity of birth and one that they did

04:36:04.700 --> 04:36:06.060
[Amit Varma]: not choose.

04:36:06.060 --> 04:36:11.340
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of identities can be useful as a tool of analysis.

04:36:11.340 --> 04:36:16.700
[Amit Varma]: But when you use it to pass judgment on people and to shut people out of the discourse, and

04:36:16.700 --> 04:36:21.780
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth, I think that can kind of get very toxic.

04:36:21.780 --> 04:36:26.060
[Amit Varma]: And when it comes to sort of that whole notion of spreading love, like I was reading bell

04:36:26.060 --> 04:36:31.060
[Amit Varma]: hooks recently, and was struck by how much she talks about compassion, including compassion

04:36:31.060 --> 04:36:33.500
[Amit Varma]: for men, including compassion for her father, and so on.

04:36:33.500 --> 04:36:38.380
[Amit Varma]: It's a very nuanced kind of view, where you're seeing everyone as victims, where you're trying

04:36:38.380 --> 04:36:40.780
[Amit Varma]: to understand where they come from.

04:36:40.780 --> 04:36:46.860
[Amit Varma]: But there is a certain strain, not just of feminism, but any ism that you express online,

04:36:46.860 --> 04:36:50.820
[Amit Varma]: which has no space for this nuance, which must push for the extremes, which must pass

04:36:50.820 --> 04:36:54.940
[Amit Varma]: judgment on the world, which must condemn and so on and so forth.

04:36:54.940 --> 04:37:00.900
[Amit Varma]: So being someone who's used Twitter from its early days, being someone who's had the lived

04:37:00.900 --> 04:37:06.060
[Amit Varma]: experience of engaging with feminism over these decades of, you know, even if you haven't

04:37:06.060 --> 04:37:10.460
[Amit Varma]: at, for some of this time, as you put it, you haven't been an activist, you've been

04:37:10.460 --> 04:37:15.220
[Amit Varma]: a participant or whatever, what is your sense of what's kind of happening here?

04:37:15.220 --> 04:37:20.300
[Amit Varma]: Because while I certainly call myself a feminist, and, and I can't understand how anyone would

04:37:20.300 --> 04:37:25.540
[Amit Varma]: not be one male or female, you know, I speak with older feminists who find, who find some

04:37:25.540 --> 04:37:31.620
[Amit Varma]: of this, what is happening on social media, sort of disquieting, to the extent that Manjumma

04:37:31.620 --> 04:37:35.820
[Amit Varma]: in fact said that these days, these days, I don't even call myself a feminist, because,

04:37:35.820 --> 04:37:39.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, even though she studied it and written on it, and so on and so forth.

04:37:39.820 --> 04:37:42.420
[Amit Varma]: So what's sort of your response to this?

04:37:42.420 --> 04:37:50.420
[Guest]: Lierd, to begin with, I'm not comfortable with the term woke politics, though I understand

04:37:50.420 --> 04:37:52.100
[Guest]: what you mean.

04:37:52.100 --> 04:37:57.340
[Guest]: I think that's too broad an umbrella to encompass the many movements that have also flourished

04:37:57.340 --> 04:38:03.580
[Guest]: on social media, not just social justice warriors or whatever, but movements where your social

04:38:03.580 --> 04:38:10.500
[Guest]: media presence is an accurate mirror of your life and work offline, you know, we're back

04:38:10.500 --> 04:38:14.980
[Guest]: at something that you talked about earlier, which was authenticity.

04:38:14.980 --> 04:38:20.540
[Guest]: And I think what you are picking up on is inauthentic politics and the power of that

04:38:20.540 --> 04:38:21.540
[Guest]: inauthentic politics.

04:38:21.540 --> 04:38:28.460
[Guest]: Trump, whom you started off by mentioning, changed everything with a simple shift.

04:38:28.460 --> 04:38:32.640
[Guest]: It didn't matter what he was saying, and it did sometimes, it's just that people could

04:38:32.640 --> 04:38:35.340
[Guest]: not take their eyes off him.

04:38:35.340 --> 04:38:40.900
[Guest]: A few voices early on said starve him of oxygen, but people were unable to look away.

04:38:40.900 --> 04:38:45.700
[Guest]: With the Dharamsad and Sads that you mentioned, they're escalating, but there's no percentage

04:38:45.700 --> 04:38:50.220
[Guest]: to being, I think there the problem is slightly different as with Trump.

04:38:50.220 --> 04:38:55.260
[Guest]: It's that what you're seeing online can be amplified and used to create real danger,

04:38:55.260 --> 04:38:58.100
[Guest]: real violence offline, right?

04:38:58.100 --> 04:39:02.800
[Guest]: So your impact is far higher than your presence on social media.

04:39:02.800 --> 04:39:05.460
[Guest]: But social media is a world of shadows.

04:39:05.460 --> 04:39:08.380
[Guest]: It's not a world of substance.

04:39:08.380 --> 04:39:11.100
[Guest]: Increasingly I find that I am disengaging.

04:39:11.100 --> 04:39:13.820
[Guest]: This is again a very personal response.

04:39:13.820 --> 04:39:19.020
[Guest]: I stay on Twitter partly because there's the addictive hook of it.

04:39:19.020 --> 04:39:25.140
[Guest]: And you know, my two addictions are basically caffeine and Twitter at this point.

04:39:25.140 --> 04:39:32.660
[Guest]: And in part too, I tell myself weekly, it's to stay informed, but I find myself following

04:39:32.660 --> 04:39:38.180
[Guest]: the feeds that are not thoughtless positivity, which is a genre that just gets up my nose.

04:39:38.180 --> 04:39:42.060
[Guest]: You know, that whole, no, no, think good thoughts, be bright and happy.

04:39:42.060 --> 04:39:47.260
[Guest]: The good morning WhatsApp forward philosophy of life, I cannot be having time or space

04:39:47.260 --> 04:39:52.500
[Guest]: for that because often that's a plea to you to disengage completely.

04:39:52.500 --> 04:39:58.900
[Guest]: That's a plea to you to look away from the truth of what is happening here and elsewhere.

04:39:58.900 --> 04:40:05.380
[Guest]: Having said that, I find myself drawn to feeds that are thoughtful, immersed, but not directly

04:40:05.380 --> 04:40:12.180
[Guest]: about the topic of the day, the trending political person of the day, the controversy of the

04:40:12.180 --> 04:40:13.180
[Guest]: day.

04:40:13.180 --> 04:40:14.180
[Guest]: Right.

04:40:14.180 --> 04:40:20.740
[Guest]: And those feeds are run by people like Paul Holdengraber, by Maria Popova, by Rana Safi

04:40:20.740 --> 04:40:23.460
[Guest]: as well by Rabi Alamuddin.

04:40:23.460 --> 04:40:27.380
[Guest]: They feeds that give you a sense of what the whole spread love thing can be.

04:40:27.380 --> 04:40:32.540
[Guest]: It's so easy to mock that, by the way, I'm, I'm aware that I've opened myself up to mockery.

04:40:32.540 --> 04:40:36.500
[Guest]: But let me put it this way, if somebody is shouting a toxic, I don't even want to say

04:40:36.500 --> 04:40:43.700
[Guest]: it on, even though it's said so often, hateful nationalist slogan into the air, demonizing

04:40:43.700 --> 04:40:45.780
[Guest]: part of our citizenry.

04:40:45.780 --> 04:40:50.340
[Guest]: What prevents us from saying, saare jahan ke achcha, mazav nahi sikha tha, aapas mein

04:40:50.340 --> 04:40:51.340
[Guest]: bair rakhna.

04:40:51.340 --> 04:40:54.860
[Guest]: I think what prevents us is a lack of belief in that.

04:40:54.860 --> 04:41:00.340
[Guest]: And people sense insincerity, one of the reasons why haters on social media are powerful is

04:41:00.340 --> 04:41:06.180
[Guest]: because people sense that the hatred is authentic, it is coming from a true place, right.

04:41:06.180 --> 04:41:08.500
[Guest]: And that's very seductive.

04:41:08.500 --> 04:41:13.060
[Guest]: Instead of the hard work of that not woke politics, but that a certain kind of politics

04:41:13.060 --> 04:41:14.060
[Guest]: demands.

04:41:14.060 --> 04:41:20.620
[Guest]: If you're a feminist, I think it's very uncomfortable, believing in something deeply, whether it's

04:41:20.620 --> 04:41:27.580
[Guest]: feminism, or free speech, or equality for all, because or a better environment, whatever

04:41:27.580 --> 04:41:32.060
[Guest]: it is, that politics will start to change you, right.

04:41:32.060 --> 04:41:34.020
[Guest]: And you will start to question your choices.

04:41:34.020 --> 04:41:38.980
[Guest]: And sometimes you will be extremely uncomfortable with your own actions.

04:41:38.980 --> 04:41:42.980
[Guest]: And that's the way it should be, you know, a good politics, a healthy politics should

04:41:42.980 --> 04:41:43.980
[Guest]: change us.

04:41:43.980 --> 04:41:48.500
[Guest]: Why do I have the freedom movement so much at my forefront, I think, again, because of

04:41:48.500 --> 04:41:53.700
[Guest]: direct political situations were to thought experiment, I've sometimes wondered about

04:41:53.700 --> 04:41:59.860
[Guest]: what would they have been like on social media, you know, I can't imagine that, but I can

04:41:59.860 --> 04:42:06.140
[Guest]: imagine that I can imagine that in the volume of the persuasion, the efforts at persuasion

04:42:06.140 --> 04:42:12.220
[Guest]: that were made, not just by our own independence movement, but by practically any movement

04:42:12.220 --> 04:42:18.020
[Guest]: that I can think of, whether it's feminism, Indian or otherwise, has put a great deal

04:42:18.020 --> 04:42:23.940
[Guest]: of time and attention into what we would call advocacy, but what I would call the art of

04:42:23.940 --> 04:42:27.660
[Guest]: persuading people to sit down and listen to you.

04:42:27.660 --> 04:42:32.820
[Guest]: So if we can't articulate love, just leave that thought to one side, as we continue with

04:42:32.820 --> 04:42:39.940
[Guest]: this identity, I hate to say it, if you're a Kashmiri Muslim, at this point, you don't

04:42:39.940 --> 04:42:45.940
[Guest]: have the luxury of walking away from your identity, as much as you might plead for your

04:42:45.940 --> 04:42:52.140
[Guest]: individual self to be recognized, if you're a Palestinian, if you're somebody who is currently

04:42:52.140 --> 04:42:56.740
[Guest]: experiencing tremendous oppression, because of your identity, you don't have the freedom.

04:42:56.740 --> 04:43:00.900
[Amit Varma]: I think what I mean is identity being used as something against you.

04:43:00.900 --> 04:43:05.020
[Guest]: When you're talking about identity politics, what you're picking up on is something that

04:43:05.020 --> 04:43:12.460
[Guest]: is also inauthentic, but it's that admonitory streak in us, that smugness that I am better

04:43:12.460 --> 04:43:14.660
[Guest]: than you, let me show you how to do this.

04:43:14.660 --> 04:43:19.740
[Amit Varma]: What I mean is this, like earlier in this conversation, you've spoken about caste, right?

04:43:19.740 --> 04:43:24.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I mean about the toxicity of identity politics is someone then pointing a finger

04:43:24.380 --> 04:43:28.300
[Amit Varma]: at you and saying, oh, she's a privileged Savannah woman, she has no right to talk about

04:43:28.300 --> 04:43:29.300
[Amit Varma]: caste.

04:43:29.300 --> 04:43:30.340
[Amit Varma]: And I have a problem with that.

04:43:30.340 --> 04:43:33.620
[Amit Varma]: I think we all have a right to talk about whatever we want to talk about and whatever

04:43:33.620 --> 04:43:35.020
[Amit Varma]: concerns us.

04:43:35.020 --> 04:43:39.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, if I am, for example, concerned that the anti Muslim hatred that is spreading

04:43:39.240 --> 04:43:42.500
[Amit Varma]: through our country today, I have a right to speak about that as well.

04:43:42.500 --> 04:43:43.500
[Amit Varma]: I love my country.

04:43:43.500 --> 04:43:48.660
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to, you know, so it's sort of this kind of thing where a label is put on

04:43:48.660 --> 04:43:52.900
[Amit Varma]: you and then you are told you can do this or you can't do this, that this is not for

04:43:52.900 --> 04:44:00.020
[Amit Varma]: you to speak about, that you are Savannah or you are white and shut the F up.

04:44:00.020 --> 04:44:07.460
[Amit Varma]: And what you really see in a lot of the extreme discourse in the US is that whiteness is being

04:44:07.460 --> 04:44:09.980
[Amit Varma]: conflated with white supremacy, almost.

04:44:09.980 --> 04:44:12.500
[Amit Varma]: It feels like that in a lot of the discourse.

04:44:12.500 --> 04:44:16.020
[Amit Varma]: And to me, going to that extreme just becomes a problem.

04:44:16.020 --> 04:44:17.820
[Amit Varma]: So that's the sense I mean it in.

04:44:17.820 --> 04:44:22.220
[Amit Varma]: Of course, if you're Muslim today in India, you can't escape your identity.

04:44:22.220 --> 04:44:26.300
[Amit Varma]: Of course, if you're a woman in India, you can't escape that you're a second class citizen.

04:44:26.300 --> 04:44:30.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, at the level of analysis, of course, I mean, I'm totally with you.

04:44:30.980 --> 04:44:37.260
[Amit Varma]: But when your identity is used against you, then that is the thing I have an issue with,

04:44:37.260 --> 04:44:40.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, so that that's sort of if you get where I'm coming from.

04:44:40.820 --> 04:44:44.900
[Guest]: I know, but I would comment this from a slightly different perspective.

04:44:44.900 --> 04:44:48.620
[Guest]: I would ask an additional question, the person who's saying you should keep quiet because

04:44:48.620 --> 04:44:54.940
[Guest]: you are this and not that, are they coming from a space of pain, in which case, listen

04:44:54.940 --> 04:44:59.100
[Guest]: to them a little bit and just see, you know, are they trying to, what is the intention?

04:44:59.100 --> 04:45:04.340
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just add something to that, that I understand that compassionate point that someone

04:45:04.340 --> 04:45:07.180
[Guest]: is coming from a position of pain or justified anger.

04:45:07.180 --> 04:45:12.540
[Guest]: That's not the only thing I wanted to say, sorry, I'll just quickly in half a sentence

04:45:12.540 --> 04:45:13.620
[Amit Varma]: finish this.

04:45:13.620 --> 04:45:18.580
[Amit Varma]: What I also see happening in this politics is an embrace of victimhood, you know, where

04:45:18.580 --> 04:45:22.740
[Amit Varma]: everybody wants to be a victim in some way or the other, so they can be offended by something

04:45:22.740 --> 04:45:27.860
[Amit Varma]: someone said, and then they can pass judgment on that person for an identity of birth they

04:45:27.860 --> 04:45:34.060
[Amit Varma]: did not choose, or they can look for gotcha moments and take, you know, and, you know,

04:45:34.060 --> 04:45:37.580
[Amit Varma]: look at imagined sort of grievances.

04:45:37.580 --> 04:45:40.620
[Amit Varma]: And that's something that I do have an issue with.

04:45:40.620 --> 04:45:41.620
[Guest]: That's fine.

04:45:41.620 --> 04:45:44.020
[Guest]: Having an issue with it is not the problem.

04:45:44.020 --> 04:45:48.280
[Guest]: I would say that there are two things that are crucial out here.

04:45:48.280 --> 04:45:52.100
[Guest]: The people who are hypothetically saying you don't have the right to speak, which is what

04:45:52.100 --> 04:45:56.140
[Guest]: this boils down to, do they have the power to silence you?

04:45:56.140 --> 04:46:01.140
[Guest]: The shaming cycles that happen on social media, the controversies that boil up even within

04:46:01.140 --> 04:46:07.060
[Guest]: teaching, there was this, I'm going to sidetrack just a bit, but you know about the Kate Clanchy

04:46:07.060 --> 04:46:08.060
[Amit Varma]: controversy.

04:46:08.060 --> 04:46:09.060
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm sorry.

04:46:09.060 --> 04:46:10.060
[Guest]: All right.

04:46:10.060 --> 04:46:11.060
[Guest]: So this became a huge thing.

04:46:11.060 --> 04:46:17.700
[Guest]: She's a teacher with highly awarded memoir about teaching in London's inner city schools

04:46:17.700 --> 04:46:25.140
[Guest]: and teaching children who are often refugees, often from very poor, underprivileged backgrounds.

04:46:25.140 --> 04:46:30.500
[Guest]: And she was taken to task two years after her novel was awarded by three writers of

04:46:30.500 --> 04:46:38.060
[Guest]: color who pointed out that some of her descriptions of these children were borderline racist or

04:46:38.060 --> 04:46:42.820
[Guest]: fully racist or very, very reductive at the least, you know, they seem to lack compassion

04:46:42.820 --> 04:46:47.620
[Guest]: or they put these children into particular boxes.

04:46:47.620 --> 04:46:53.060
[Guest]: In an ideal world, there would have been room for both sides to talk to each other, for

04:46:53.060 --> 04:46:58.820
[Guest]: Clanchy to maybe listen and say, okay, let me have a chat with my publisher, right?

04:46:58.820 --> 04:47:00.900
[Guest]: And let me see what I can do.

04:47:00.900 --> 04:47:02.460
[Guest]: These are the changes I'm on board with.

04:47:02.460 --> 04:47:05.260
[Guest]: These are the things I don't feel I should change.

04:47:05.260 --> 04:47:11.460
[Guest]: From both sides, this turned into a thing where the women who included, you know, writers

04:47:11.460 --> 04:47:17.740
[Guest]: like Monisha Rajesh and Jimine Suniman and others, were subjected to barracking and abuse.

04:47:17.740 --> 04:47:20.680
[Guest]: Kate Clanchy was demonized on the other side.

04:47:20.680 --> 04:47:25.540
[Guest]: It ended up being, it's still running through cycles, you know, with people alternately

04:47:25.540 --> 04:47:30.420
[Guest]: seeing Clanchy as a monster or as a savior figure or monstering the women who called

04:47:30.420 --> 04:47:37.660
[Guest]: her out or, you know, elevating them to a level that they may not have chosen for themselves.

04:47:37.660 --> 04:47:43.260
[Guest]: And it's become profoundly unproductive, okay.

04:47:43.260 --> 04:47:46.840
[Guest]: It hasn't pushed the central issue further.

04:47:46.840 --> 04:47:49.220
[Guest]: In fact, the central issue has been lost in this.

04:47:49.220 --> 04:47:54.500
[Guest]: Why am I picking this as an example instead of the many other, you know, juicy controversies

04:47:54.500 --> 04:47:56.180
[Guest]: we could pile on to?

04:47:56.180 --> 04:48:01.860
[Guest]: Because I think we are all seeing a problem when discussion is shut down or brought to

04:48:01.860 --> 04:48:09.860
[Guest]: a halt or goes into extremely thin territory, extremely unproductive, unprofitable, very

04:48:09.860 --> 04:48:14.340
[Guest]: arid territory, non-creative territory, okay.

04:48:14.340 --> 04:48:20.660
[Guest]: I don't have a problem with shutting up if somebody says, you as a Savarna privileged

04:48:20.660 --> 04:48:23.400
[Guest]: woman have had the mic for too long.

04:48:23.400 --> 04:48:25.340
[Guest]: Can you make space for someone else?

04:48:25.340 --> 04:48:26.380
[Guest]: That's fair.

04:48:26.380 --> 04:48:27.540
[Guest]: That's absolutely fair.

04:48:27.540 --> 04:48:33.580
[Guest]: And I would be not just accommodating, I would think that, yeah, you know, historically speaking,

04:48:33.580 --> 04:48:34.580
[Guest]: why not hand over?

04:48:34.580 --> 04:48:36.580
[Amit Varma]: But if somebody says...

04:48:36.580 --> 04:48:39.500
[Amit Varma]: That's fair, but the problem is when you're condemned for being Savarna, which was not

04:48:39.500 --> 04:48:40.500
[Amit Varma]: in your control.

04:48:40.500 --> 04:48:43.220
[Guest]: There's no action involved with it.

04:48:43.220 --> 04:48:44.220
[Guest]: It's a pejorative.

04:48:44.220 --> 04:48:45.220
[Guest]: Yeah, that's only a hurt feeling.

04:48:45.220 --> 04:48:48.020
[Amit Varma]: I don't care about that so much.

04:48:48.020 --> 04:48:52.260
[Guest]: You know, that's something I see honesty as the other person's problem.

04:48:52.260 --> 04:48:57.180
[Guest]: If they want to put condemnation into something that I can't help, they're coming at it from

04:48:57.180 --> 04:49:02.540
[Guest]: a position of hurt, pain, anger or whatever that maybe I'll never understand.

04:49:02.540 --> 04:49:08.220
[Guest]: And I try to hold space for that, but again, I don't have much time for that because I

04:49:08.220 --> 04:49:12.140
[Guest]: don't think it moves either of our positions forward.

04:49:12.140 --> 04:49:16.060
[Guest]: My question is often whether it's a book or whether it's something else, it's focused

04:49:16.060 --> 04:49:17.060
[Guest]: on outcome.

04:49:17.060 --> 04:49:24.860
[Guest]: In literature, a lot of this debate is framed as who do you have the right to write about?

04:49:24.860 --> 04:49:28.660
[Guest]: And instinctively, I think I can see both sides.

04:49:28.660 --> 04:49:32.960
[Guest]: I can see the argument for saying, write with some sensitivity.

04:49:32.960 --> 04:49:37.500
[Guest]: But if you take the whole don't write people whom you don't know, think to its extreme,

04:49:37.500 --> 04:49:41.500
[Guest]: we're all going to be writing monologues that take place in our own heads.

04:49:41.500 --> 04:49:43.380
[Guest]: And that are only about ourselves.

04:49:43.380 --> 04:49:44.380
[Amit Varma]: And J.R.R.

04:49:44.380 --> 04:49:46.900
[Amit Varma]: Tolkien wasn't a hobbit.

04:49:46.900 --> 04:49:53.780
[Guest]: Because see, that's a lovely laugh line, but it takes away from the real hurt that people

04:49:53.780 --> 04:49:54.780
[Amit Varma]: have felt.

04:49:54.780 --> 04:49:55.780
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I get it completely.

04:49:55.780 --> 04:49:56.780
[Amit Varma]: I get it completely.

04:49:56.780 --> 04:50:01.020
[Amit Varma]: When, you know, clueless foreign writers write about something that I know and a world that

04:50:01.020 --> 04:50:03.800
[Amit Varma]: I've lived in and get it completely wrong, I feel angry.

04:50:03.800 --> 04:50:08.740
[Amit Varma]: And it's fair for me to express my literary criticism of what they have just messed up

04:50:08.740 --> 04:50:10.020
[Amit Varma]: and got wrong.

04:50:10.020 --> 04:50:13.180
[Amit Varma]: But everyone should nevertheless be free to write about whatever they want.

04:50:13.180 --> 04:50:19.580
[Guest]: I think what I resist and resist profoundly is because I have resented it from the right.

04:50:19.580 --> 04:50:24.020
[Guest]: This whole dictatorial thing about we are offended, you can't write about this.

04:50:24.020 --> 04:50:25.020
[Guest]: You can't paint that.

04:50:25.020 --> 04:50:27.700
[Guest]: You can't think this, you know.

04:50:27.700 --> 04:50:33.300
[Guest]: I would not stand for it personally on the left or the liberal side of the world either.

04:50:33.300 --> 04:50:34.580
[Guest]: But that's just me.

04:50:34.580 --> 04:50:37.220
[Guest]: I don't want to make the rules for the whole world.

04:50:37.220 --> 04:50:45.340
[Guest]: So what we're coming towards is, do you really want to set down rules about these things?

04:50:45.340 --> 04:50:46.340
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:50:46.340 --> 04:50:51.140
[Guest]: When you're speaking about compassion, you can't enforce compassion on somebody who has

04:50:51.140 --> 04:50:55.460
[Guest]: been deprived of an opportunity to speak all their lives.

04:50:55.460 --> 04:51:01.580
[Guest]: And maybe sometimes, you know, just stand up and take your hurt feelings and it's okay.

04:51:01.580 --> 04:51:03.020
[Guest]: You still have a way to speak.

04:51:03.020 --> 04:51:05.140
[Guest]: You are still going to continue to speak.

04:51:05.140 --> 04:51:06.140
[Guest]: That's fine.

04:51:06.140 --> 04:51:12.100
[Guest]: I think what you're noticing though is emblematic of a larger problem and that is that this

04:51:12.100 --> 04:51:16.100
[Guest]: entire set of politics, whatever you want to call them, cancel culture is a term that

04:51:16.100 --> 04:51:18.060
[Guest]: the right uses.

04:51:18.060 --> 04:51:27.460
[Guest]: But this narrowing of argument down to the rituals surrounding a set of things in the

04:51:27.460 --> 04:51:32.380
[Guest]: hope that this will somehow, you know, provide a greater piece of justice.

04:51:32.380 --> 04:51:37.340
[Guest]: The rituals cannot replace the actual action for justice.

04:51:37.340 --> 04:51:43.900
[Guest]: And I think that just because people are liberals or on the left, that does not make them less

04:51:43.900 --> 04:51:45.180
[Guest]: prone to being vengeful.

04:51:45.180 --> 04:51:50.500
[Guest]: In the early days of Twitter, I look at the times when, you know, I've given into the

04:51:50.500 --> 04:51:55.580
[Guest]: temptation to be morally superior or to tell somebody off and here's the truth.

04:51:55.580 --> 04:51:57.260
[Guest]: It feels great in the moment.

04:51:57.260 --> 04:52:01.300
[Guest]: Afterwards, if you're at all reflective, a day later, you're thinking about that and

04:52:01.300 --> 04:52:06.260
[Guest]: you feel very small telling somebody how they should live their lives or what they should

04:52:06.260 --> 04:52:08.060
[Guest]: think or whatever.

04:52:08.060 --> 04:52:13.140
[Guest]: Getting down, taking the slightly confused set of arguments back to strictly the literary,

04:52:13.140 --> 04:52:21.060
[Guest]: artistic, creative world and off Twitter for a second, I think it is problematic to say

04:52:21.060 --> 04:52:25.220
[Guest]: literature should be free, everybody should have the right to write, everybody else.

04:52:25.220 --> 04:52:30.620
[Guest]: That just opens a door for somebody to write very hatefully and with a lack of respect

04:52:30.620 --> 04:52:36.260
[Guest]: or lack of understanding, which is worse, you know, about specific groups of people.

04:52:36.260 --> 04:52:40.020
[Guest]: But the more we get into rules and the more we get into policing, the more we start to

04:52:40.020 --> 04:52:44.140
[Guest]: resemble the forces that we hate and we have to watch out for that.

04:52:44.140 --> 04:52:45.620
[Guest]: You have to be careful.

04:52:45.620 --> 04:52:51.180
[Guest]: The second thing is that this strain, Ed Luce, who I keep quoting Financial Times columnist

04:52:51.180 --> 04:52:54.300
[Guest]: today and I'm sorry, it's just that I read a string of particular people.

04:52:54.300 --> 04:52:55.300
[Amit Varma]: You're also being tribal.

04:52:55.300 --> 04:52:56.300
[Amit Varma]: You're part of the FT tribe.

04:52:56.300 --> 04:52:58.300
[Guest]: I am being tribal.

04:52:58.300 --> 04:53:03.340
[Guest]: And you know, unconsciously so, but it is an argument that struck me with some force

04:53:03.340 --> 04:53:06.060
[Guest]: and he's been debating it back and forth.

04:53:06.060 --> 04:53:12.580
[Guest]: But he says that part of America's problem is that the left's concerns and liberal concerns

04:53:12.580 --> 04:53:19.020
[Guest]: and democratic concerns cannot be so narrow that they lose, you know, sight of what a

04:53:19.020 --> 04:53:21.300
[Guest]: wider politics is.

04:53:21.300 --> 04:53:26.580
[Guest]: So in all this discussion about, you know, who gets to speak where or Twitter policing

04:53:26.580 --> 04:53:32.500
[Guest]: or whatever it is, aren't we losing sight of the much, much broader battles ahead in

04:53:32.500 --> 04:53:35.860
[Guest]: terms of justice and equality and all of that?

04:53:35.860 --> 04:53:41.340
[Guest]: Aren't these, at the end of the day, aren't a lot of these very esoteric and very narrow

04:53:41.340 --> 04:53:42.340
[Guest]: pursuits?

04:53:42.340 --> 04:53:45.060
[Guest]: I don't mean that they are unimportant.

04:53:45.060 --> 04:53:48.500
[Guest]: I just mean, I don't mean to trivialize them either.

04:53:48.500 --> 04:53:55.340
[Guest]: But sometimes I just think that these things that you care so passionately about on Instagram

04:53:55.340 --> 04:54:00.940
[Guest]: or Twitter or whatever, can be very in-group concerns.

04:54:00.940 --> 04:54:06.660
[Guest]: And if you're focusing on that, if you're focusing on, you know, the etiquette of how

04:54:06.660 --> 04:54:14.100
[Guest]: to respond to X, Y or Z or join in this particular cultural boycott or another, is what you're

04:54:14.100 --> 04:54:18.860
[Guest]: doing enabling the bigger picture or are you getting lost in a very small debate?

04:54:18.860 --> 04:54:22.060
[Guest]: Something that I think we're both frustrated with, because again, we've discussed this

04:54:22.060 --> 04:54:29.020
[Guest]: as friends elsewhere, is the tendency of a certain kind of liberal line of argument to

04:54:29.020 --> 04:54:38.240
[Guest]: go into, you know, opposing hate, but saying, oh, but we did it also back in the day, collapsing

04:54:38.240 --> 04:54:44.340
[Guest]: in a heap, you know, saying that we don't have any moral ground and getting into a tangle

04:54:44.340 --> 04:54:50.140
[Guest]: of relatively minor points, you're leaving the main issue on the table unaddressed in

04:54:50.140 --> 04:54:54.660
[Guest]: this paroxysm of shame and guilt and, you know, all of that.

04:54:54.660 --> 04:55:02.140
[Guest]: So somewhere I think what we're looking for is, as much as the right is also lost across

04:55:02.140 --> 04:55:07.820
[Guest]: the world, you remember a time when being conservative or being right wing did not have

04:55:07.820 --> 04:55:11.660
[Guest]: to mean that you were associated with hate politics.

04:55:11.660 --> 04:55:17.540
[Guest]: So as powerful as the surge of hate is, I would argue very strongly that the right has

04:55:17.540 --> 04:55:24.740
[Guest]: lost its compass completely, you know, I know that's a very broad based argument.

04:55:24.740 --> 04:55:29.400
[Guest]: But I would argue that very strongly for India, America and parts of Europe, for sure.

04:55:29.400 --> 04:55:34.080
[Guest]: If you're defining yourself as a right wing party in France, with your anti-immigration

04:55:34.080 --> 04:55:38.500
[Guest]: policy and losing sight of everything else that is supposed to go into being part of

04:55:38.500 --> 04:55:41.700
[Guest]: the traditional right, then you no longer know who you are.

04:55:41.700 --> 04:55:49.140
[Guest]: If your identity as a right wing in America is built on, we will hate these minorities

04:55:49.140 --> 04:55:55.620
[Guest]: and cut off the rights of women, then you've lost contact with your own heritage, right?

04:55:55.620 --> 04:56:01.300
[Guest]: And India, I mean, the same goes, one thing I used to like a little bit, not about Nehruvian

04:56:01.300 --> 04:56:07.780
[Guest]: politics, but about the general strain of mainstream politics out here is that there

04:56:07.780 --> 04:56:11.980
[Guest]: were so many contradictory opinions coming at each other.

04:56:11.980 --> 04:56:17.340
[Guest]: And in just the same way, I don't want to say this as a sweeping indictment, but I think

04:56:17.340 --> 04:56:22.660
[Guest]: liberalism per se is struggling to hold on to the thread of the story, isn't it?

04:56:22.660 --> 04:56:28.380
[Guest]: If we get sidetracked by relatively minor, relatively petty issues, I think the one area

04:56:28.380 --> 04:56:35.100
[Guest]: where I'm in complete rather than occasionally partial agreement with you is on the whole

04:56:35.100 --> 04:56:41.060
[Guest]: thing of if we're so busy cancelling each other, you know, Gandhi had particular flaws,

04:56:41.060 --> 04:56:45.500
[Guest]: this person cannot speak, this person by the standards of our time is bad.

04:56:45.500 --> 04:56:49.860
[Guest]: You need to watch out with that, you know, the politics of purity are dangerous on either

04:56:49.860 --> 04:56:52.220
[Guest]: side of the fence.

04:56:52.220 --> 04:56:55.940
[Guest]: There is no such thing as pure territory.

04:56:55.940 --> 04:57:01.340
[Guest]: We live in not just in an imperfect time, but we have to find a way to live with the

04:57:01.340 --> 04:57:04.060
[Guest]: imperfection of ourselves.

04:57:04.060 --> 04:57:05.820
[Guest]: We need fewer heroes.

04:57:05.820 --> 04:57:12.160
[Guest]: We need fewer perfect people, but we do need to be able to make arguments with passion

04:57:12.160 --> 04:57:15.740
[Guest]: and belief and to hold space for each other.

04:57:15.740 --> 04:57:18.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's what I keep saying.

04:57:18.420 --> 04:57:23.140
[Amit Varma]: It's almost a cliche on my show, channeling Whitman, that people contain multitudes, which

04:57:23.140 --> 04:57:28.700
[Amit Varma]: applies to Gandhi and Nehru and Ambedkar and Vajpayee and so many others who we tend to

04:57:28.700 --> 04:57:30.680
[Amit Varma]: see in black and white ways.

04:57:30.680 --> 04:57:35.940
[Amit Varma]: And I agree with everything you said, and I have exactly the same concerns.

04:57:35.940 --> 04:57:39.900
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I agree with what you said about the right losing its compass.

04:57:39.900 --> 04:57:43.620
[Amit Varma]: The two things I'd add there is I'm not sure the frames of left and right are even relevant

04:57:43.620 --> 04:57:44.620
[Guest]: anymore.

04:57:44.620 --> 04:57:48.260
[Guest]: I was struggling as I was speaking, I was thinking this is not really how do we describe

04:57:48.260 --> 04:57:49.260
[Amit Varma]: it?

04:57:49.260 --> 04:57:52.020
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, the way I think listeners will know exactly what you mean.

04:57:52.020 --> 04:57:53.020
[Guest]: So that's fine.

04:57:53.020 --> 04:57:54.380
[Guest]: What are the terms for this?

04:57:54.380 --> 04:57:58.420
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the frames that I would, you know, 20 years later, if you ask me, I would not

04:57:58.420 --> 04:58:02.320
[Amit Varma]: want people to think of the world in terms of frames or left or right, which are meaningless

04:58:02.320 --> 04:58:06.940
[Amit Varma]: and muddied, but across freedom and authoritarian, across consent and coercion.

04:58:06.940 --> 04:58:11.380
[Amit Varma]: To me, those are the frames that, for me, consent is the ultimate value and coercion

04:58:11.380 --> 04:58:16.740
[Amit Varma]: is really, really bad, you know, and the right and the left across the board seem to have

04:58:16.740 --> 04:58:19.660
[Amit Varma]: no problem with coercion at all across many margins.

04:58:19.660 --> 04:58:24.300
[Amit Varma]: And just as the right as you put it have lost their compass, I think so as a left, I mean,

04:58:24.300 --> 04:58:29.420
[Amit Varma]: my issue with the bigotry on both sides is that I am the bigotry on the right doesn't

04:58:29.420 --> 04:58:31.680
[Amit Varma]: worry me so much because I wear it on their sleeve.

04:58:31.680 --> 04:58:32.980
[Amit Varma]: It is what it is.

04:58:32.980 --> 04:58:38.540
[Amit Varma]: But the bigotry on the left is dressed up in this sanctimony, which, you know, is much

04:58:38.540 --> 04:58:39.540
[Amit Varma]: harder to counter.

04:58:39.540 --> 04:58:43.820
[Amit Varma]: And thankfully, what you know, we've both been referring to and all the posturing and

04:58:43.820 --> 04:58:48.700
[Amit Varma]: all the noise and the extremes is a vocal minority, sorry, most people aren't like that

04:58:48.700 --> 04:58:54.260
[Amit Varma]: most people, the sense that I get are a silent majority, and perhaps the chilling effect

04:58:54.260 --> 04:58:58.500
[Amit Varma]: makes them more silent than ever, because anything they say can be can get them cancelled

04:58:58.500 --> 04:59:00.300
[Amit Varma]: or can get an online mob on them.

04:59:00.300 --> 04:59:02.740
[Amit Varma]: And I've had mobs from all sides come down on me.

04:59:02.740 --> 04:59:04.940
[Amit Varma]: So there is that chilling effect at play.

04:59:04.940 --> 04:59:10.020
[Amit Varma]: But my hope there is that there is a silent majority and at some point in time, the toxic

04:59:10.020 --> 04:59:17.220
[Amit Varma]: effect of the vocal minorities will not sort of matter so much.

04:59:17.220 --> 04:59:21.820
[Amit Varma]: And on that note, let's take a quick commercial break, though I don't have a commercial, but

04:59:21.820 --> 04:59:23.460
[Amit Varma]: I sense we might need a break.

04:59:23.460 --> 04:59:27.580
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side of that, we'll continue with your personal journey and perhaps talk

04:59:27.580 --> 04:59:35.700
[Amit Varma]: about quieter subjects than than these depressing subjects, which we've been depressing, but

04:59:35.700 --> 04:59:40.940
[Amit Varma]: rousing, depressing, but rousing, indeed.

04:59:40.940 --> 04:59:43.580
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

04:59:43.580 --> 04:59:48.740
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

04:59:48.740 --> 04:59:53.540
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

04:59:53.540 --> 04:59:58.580
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

04:59:58.580 --> 05:00:03.520
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

05:00:03.520 --> 05:00:05.780
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

05:00:05.780 --> 05:00:09.060
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

05:00:09.060 --> 05:00:13.580
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it, only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

05:00:13.580 --> 05:00:19.700
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write

05:00:19.700 --> 05:00:22.220
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

05:00:40.740 --> 05:00:47.700
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com Thank you.

05:00:47.700 --> 05:00:51.220
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back again to the scene in the unseen because this was our umpteenth break and I'm

05:00:51.220 --> 05:00:57.340
[Amit Varma]: chatting with my good friend Ilanjana Roy on on her life and her thoughts.

05:00:57.340 --> 05:01:00.580
[Amit Varma]: And there's really so much to explore that we could go on for another five hours, but

05:01:00.580 --> 05:01:03.660
[Amit Varma]: we won't go on for that long.

05:01:03.660 --> 05:01:08.420
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that struck me when I read The Girl Who Ate Books, and I was sort of

05:01:08.420 --> 05:01:16.340
[Amit Varma]: reading your backstory as it were, is how much you remember of your ancestors, right?

05:01:16.340 --> 05:01:21.220
[Amit Varma]: So you've got besides your parents, you've got grandparents from every side, you've got

05:01:21.220 --> 05:01:26.340
[Amit Varma]: grand uncles, you've got older ancestors who are taking loans from Armenians and doing

05:01:26.340 --> 05:01:27.660
[Amit Varma]: this and doing that.

05:01:27.660 --> 05:01:30.860
[Amit Varma]: And there's just so much action all over.

05:01:30.860 --> 05:01:38.980
[Amit Varma]: And there is also a richness of things in the sense, you know, I did this one paragraph

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:44.300
[Amit Varma]: which you may not, you know, consider a big deal, but I remember it, where you write quote,

05:01:44.300 --> 05:01:49.140
[Amit Varma]: My Thakur Ma, Bibobati Devi, Baba's mother was a writer in an unfussy way, producing

05:01:49.140 --> 05:01:53.820
[Amit Varma]: short stories in Bengali with the same practice flick of her wrist that she used to turn out

05:01:53.820 --> 05:01:57.580
[Amit Varma]: roasted coconut treats and puffed rice and jaggery moas.

05:01:57.580 --> 05:02:03.140
[Amit Varma]: She kept her writings in a black leaded tin trunk, her homemade sweets in an old lactogen

05:02:03.140 --> 05:02:06.940
[Amit Varma]: tin, both containers equally battered and utilitarian.

05:02:06.940 --> 05:02:07.940
[Amit Varma]: And stop quote.

05:02:07.940 --> 05:02:09.860
[Amit Varma]: And that lactogen tin really speaks to me.

05:02:09.860 --> 05:02:13.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, when I was in Chandigarh recently, we sold my father's house, I was clearing

05:02:13.640 --> 05:02:18.980
[Amit Varma]: out the stuff, we chose to give most of it away or get rid of it, gave thousands of books

05:02:18.980 --> 05:02:24.100
[Amit Varma]: to a local community library in Delhi, I just kept a few as artifacts in a sense, because

05:02:24.100 --> 05:02:28.140
[Amit Varma]: most of my reading is sort of on Kindle and so on.

05:02:28.140 --> 05:02:33.060
[Amit Varma]: And it was difficult in the sense that I know that none of what I was choosing to part with

05:02:33.060 --> 05:02:35.220
[Amit Varma]: had any practical value at all.

05:02:35.220 --> 05:02:38.980
[Amit Varma]: And yet it is a texture of my growing up and my childhood and all that.

05:02:38.980 --> 05:02:44.980
[Amit Varma]: And that made me think about whether it is a blessing or a curse to have a past that

05:02:44.980 --> 05:02:46.620
[Amit Varma]: has some kind of richness in it.

05:02:46.620 --> 05:02:50.340
[Amit Varma]: And my past does not have too much richness in it, it's just the parents.

05:02:50.340 --> 05:02:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And then I have no sentiments, very few memories, it's not there.

05:02:54.320 --> 05:02:58.900
[Amit Varma]: But even this, to sort of say that, okay, this part of my life is gone forever, and

05:02:58.900 --> 05:03:00.780
[Amit Varma]: we'll live only in memory.

05:03:00.780 --> 05:03:01.780
[Amit Varma]: And that was kind of tough.

05:03:01.780 --> 05:03:06.180
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you cherish what you had, and you lament the loss.

05:03:06.180 --> 05:03:11.420
[Amit Varma]: But at another point, it also frees you from not having the burden of that past from being

05:03:11.420 --> 05:03:16.360
[Amit Varma]: just able to move forward and realize that most of it in terms of the physical things

05:03:16.360 --> 05:03:20.940
[Amit Varma]: that it was embodied in, most of those things are not essential to you at all, you want

05:03:20.940 --> 05:03:23.380
[Amit Varma]: to live an essential life.

05:03:23.380 --> 05:03:27.500
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the things that my wife and I were talking about as we went through this

05:03:27.500 --> 05:03:33.540
[Amit Varma]: exercise is how we have too many things as well, which burden us down and hold us back.

05:03:33.540 --> 05:03:39.140
[Amit Varma]: And you want to sort of move to a more minimal kind of life, you don't have so many things

05:03:39.140 --> 05:03:40.920
[Amit Varma]: because things are not important.

05:03:40.920 --> 05:03:44.580
[Amit Varma]: And of course, technology has given us the luxury and the privilege to be able to do

05:03:44.580 --> 05:03:48.660
[Amit Varma]: that because we can keep all our 1000s of books in digital copies.

05:03:48.660 --> 05:03:51.940
[Amit Varma]: And we can keep all our work in a digital form uploaded to the crowd.

05:03:51.940 --> 05:03:55.300
[Amit Varma]: We don't, you know, physical things aren't a big deal anymore.

05:03:55.300 --> 05:03:58.900
[Amit Varma]: If my laptop starts working, I'll get another one and that will have exactly the same things

05:03:58.900 --> 05:04:01.100
[Amit Varma]: on it as this one does.

05:04:01.100 --> 05:04:08.660
[Amit Varma]: But given that your sense of the past is so rich, given that your memories contain all

05:04:08.660 --> 05:04:13.020
[Amit Varma]: of these things, how do you view that coming to where you are?

05:04:13.020 --> 05:04:19.100
[Amit Varma]: Because and also in a related sense, you know, when you think of home, what is your sense

05:04:19.100 --> 05:04:20.100
[Amit Varma]: of home?

05:04:20.100 --> 05:04:23.300
[Amit Varma]: Like I had a recent episode with Max Rodenbeck, where I asked him this question, and he grew

05:04:23.300 --> 05:04:24.860
[Amit Varma]: up in Cairo.

05:04:24.860 --> 05:04:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And he said, it's Cairo, but it's not the Cairo that is there today.

05:04:28.200 --> 05:04:32.660
[Amit Varma]: It's a Cairo of memory, and therefore a Cairo of imagination, because memory and imagination

05:04:32.660 --> 05:04:34.740
[Amit Varma]: are so closely linked together.

05:04:34.740 --> 05:04:38.760
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of this rich past you've written about it so much?

05:04:38.760 --> 05:04:43.500
[Amit Varma]: You live in it still, obviously, because one must keep going back to that.

05:04:43.500 --> 05:04:48.660
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I don't even know if there's a question, but I just sort of wanted your

05:04:48.660 --> 05:04:51.500
[Amit Varma]: impressions and your thoughts of this.

05:04:51.500 --> 05:04:56.720
[Guest]: Actually, I'm surprised because with The Girl Who Ate Books, I think that's the only one

05:04:56.720 --> 05:05:01.160
[Guest]: of my books where I've gone even somewhat autobiographical.

05:05:01.160 --> 05:05:05.840
[Guest]: And because so much of that book is about my encounters, you know, it's the business

05:05:05.840 --> 05:05:09.160
[Guest]: standard interviews that I did with so many writers.

05:05:09.160 --> 05:05:14.720
[Guest]: There are standalone essays that are about the history of Indian writing in English and

05:05:14.720 --> 05:05:16.760
[Guest]: that are very abstract.

05:05:16.760 --> 05:05:21.900
[Guest]: Some of them are about early pioneers in writing, and some of them are about the growth of history.

05:05:21.900 --> 05:05:26.800
[Guest]: I don't think I'd realized that I had written as much about my family as I did.

05:05:26.800 --> 05:05:32.000
[Guest]: I'm going back to why I did that, and I don't think it was to boast or to show off.

05:05:32.000 --> 05:05:35.800
[Guest]: I think I was looking really for the literary heritage.

05:05:35.800 --> 05:05:41.920
[Guest]: My grandmother's trunk, one of the saddest scars on my heart is that she lifelong was

05:05:41.920 --> 05:05:43.280
[Guest]: a published author.

05:05:43.280 --> 05:05:47.920
[Guest]: She used to write poems and short stories that at that time I didn't read.

05:05:47.920 --> 05:05:51.720
[Guest]: And some of them were published in little magazines in Bengali and all of that.

05:05:51.720 --> 05:05:59.200
[Guest]: And after she died, her trunk went to a member of the family who is now also passed on.

05:05:59.200 --> 05:06:04.480
[Guest]: And I was very, I didn't want to ask just after her death for the stories back and all

05:06:04.480 --> 05:06:10.080
[Guest]: of that, but after about nine months, 10 months, I said, do you think I could take copies of

05:06:10.080 --> 05:06:12.040
[Guest]: all her writings?

05:06:12.040 --> 05:06:13.560
[Guest]: And she said, oh, yes, of course you can.

05:06:13.560 --> 05:06:14.560
[Guest]: Where are they?

05:06:14.560 --> 05:06:15.560
[Guest]: And I said, they were in the black trunk.

05:06:15.560 --> 05:06:19.880
[Guest]: She said, oh, that trunk, it was filled with rubbish papers and they were moth eaten and

05:06:19.880 --> 05:06:21.280
[Guest]: I just threw them away.

05:06:21.280 --> 05:06:25.360
[Guest]: There was nothing of value in there.

05:06:25.360 --> 05:06:31.200
[Guest]: And I don't think she meant any harm, but it meant something to me.

05:06:31.200 --> 05:06:37.680
[Guest]: I've always felt that phantom side of not just my grandmother's personal writings disappearing,

05:06:37.680 --> 05:06:44.720
[Guest]: but it touched on a deep, deep wound, which was the lack of women's histories.

05:06:44.720 --> 05:06:50.240
[Guest]: Often when you look at collections of writers, except up to the modern day, where it's changed

05:06:50.240 --> 05:06:56.640
[Guest]: a little bit, the archives are usually kept men of letters, their notes, their letters,

05:06:56.640 --> 05:06:58.940
[Guest]: etc. are all kept and maintained.

05:06:58.940 --> 05:07:04.920
[Guest]: And it's that much harder to put together the biography of India's women writers.

05:07:04.920 --> 05:07:13.400
[Guest]: And suddenly, you know, my tiny personal loss was moving into this much wider absence, to

05:07:13.400 --> 05:07:14.400
[Guest]: some extent.

05:07:14.400 --> 05:07:20.200
[Guest]: With the rest of my family, I think I was writing about them to try and fix something

05:07:20.200 --> 05:07:23.840
[Guest]: in my mind, that old question of where do you come from?

05:07:23.840 --> 05:07:24.840
[Guest]: What stream?

05:07:24.840 --> 05:07:29.320
[Guest]: Some of it was gratitude, some of it was saying, you know, thank you to all of you who gave

05:07:29.320 --> 05:07:33.880
[Guest]: me books and reading or allowed me to pester you for stories.

05:07:33.880 --> 05:07:38.880
[Guest]: My uncle, you know, used to just sit there patiently, he was an architect.

05:07:38.880 --> 05:07:43.280
[Guest]: And he used to sit there patiently with one or the other of us attached to his leg like

05:07:43.280 --> 05:07:46.400
[Guest]: little limpets, telling a story after story.

05:07:46.400 --> 05:07:50.800
[Guest]: My mother, my father was so generous with his books.

05:07:50.800 --> 05:07:55.000
[Guest]: And I feel that because so many people don't have that in their lives, it's more important

05:07:55.000 --> 05:07:56.000
[Guest]: for us.

05:07:56.000 --> 05:08:00.960
[Guest]: I don't mean to be sonorous, but I did feel the need to acknowledge that.

05:08:00.960 --> 05:08:06.240
[Guest]: In terms of where is home, that used to be a little bit of a heartache because my husband

05:08:06.240 --> 05:08:08.600
[Guest]: and I have never bought a home.

05:08:08.600 --> 05:08:13.360
[Guest]: And we both come from the quintessential Calcutta families where own homes are either mired

05:08:13.360 --> 05:08:17.960
[Guest]: in legal trouble or have long since crumbled.

05:08:17.960 --> 05:08:23.880
[Guest]: Home for me was maybe not so much the homes where I grew up in government circles, or

05:08:23.880 --> 05:08:28.120
[Guest]: there was a period when my father was posted to Calcutta, and we shifted home houses in

05:08:28.120 --> 05:08:34.640
[Guest]: Delhi 13 times in the course of just a few years, which was salutary, you know, it took

05:08:34.640 --> 05:08:42.320
[Guest]: me out of the cozy and very, very insulated cocoon of government life where by and large,

05:08:42.320 --> 05:08:46.920
[Guest]: more than actual comfort, what you have is an absence of discomfort.

05:08:46.920 --> 05:08:48.840
[Amit Varma]: You see what I mean?

05:08:48.840 --> 05:08:51.640
[Guest]: And it was a wonderful introduction to the city.

05:08:51.640 --> 05:08:56.360
[Guest]: At the time, I think it was a little bewildering for, you know, a teenager to be shifting bus

05:08:56.360 --> 05:08:57.880
[Guest]: routes so often.

05:08:57.880 --> 05:09:05.160
[Guest]: But when I went to Calcutta, I spent about four years or so studying at La Martiniere,

05:09:05.160 --> 05:09:10.280
[Guest]: which was as open a school as I've said, as my former convent was a little on the closed

05:09:10.280 --> 05:09:12.160
[Guest]: side.

05:09:12.160 --> 05:09:18.000
[Guest]: And the house that my grandmother had is again part of the vanished heritage of the city.

05:09:18.000 --> 05:09:24.120
[Guest]: It was a wonderful old red brick house, you know, built with one room sprawling into each

05:09:24.120 --> 05:09:25.120
[Guest]: other.

05:09:25.120 --> 05:09:32.640
[Guest]: It was a fusion of styles, Indian and Bengali meeting British with a huge veranda that opened

05:09:32.640 --> 05:09:38.880
[Guest]: out onto a lawn and turrets and things and books lining every room, every room, you know.

05:09:38.880 --> 05:09:44.200
[Guest]: It was also a warm and hospitable and convivial house and that was my strongest sense of home.

05:09:44.200 --> 05:09:47.600
[Guest]: And it was broken down more than 30 years ago.

05:09:47.600 --> 05:09:53.480
[Guest]: And it's instructive to see how that absence has become for some family members, a real

05:09:53.480 --> 05:09:59.880
[Guest]: ache, you know, when a home is taken away and our home just went in the normal course

05:09:59.880 --> 05:10:00.880
[Guest]: of things.

05:10:00.880 --> 05:10:04.760
[Guest]: It wasn't bulldozed by a cruel administration.

05:10:04.760 --> 05:10:10.600
[Guest]: But for some people it's become a permanent ache, an absence not just of a physical home,

05:10:10.600 --> 05:10:13.040
[Guest]: but without that you can get unmoored.

05:10:13.040 --> 05:10:18.000
[Guest]: You can literally not know how to see where you come from, you know, or what you belong

05:10:18.000 --> 05:10:22.200
[Guest]: to or what grew you up or shaped you.

05:10:22.200 --> 05:10:28.640
[Guest]: In terms of shaping me as a person, I think my other home was always, it sounds so trite

05:10:28.640 --> 05:10:33.480
[Guest]: to say this, but it is so true, Amit, it was in books.

05:10:33.480 --> 05:10:38.360
[Guest]: You know, that was because that was the one constant in parts of my life, both as a child

05:10:38.360 --> 05:10:42.120
[Guest]: and an adult where I was switching houses a lot.

05:10:42.120 --> 05:10:46.200
[Guest]: You can make your home in the books that you read.

05:10:46.200 --> 05:10:50.840
[Guest]: And so there was never a point where I felt truly unhoused.

05:10:50.840 --> 05:10:56.520
[Guest]: And I just want to add that, you know, most of my movings around have not been particularly

05:10:56.520 --> 05:10:57.520
[Guest]: traumatic.

05:10:57.520 --> 05:11:02.000
[Guest]: It's not been like a partition or the refugee coming out or whatever.

05:11:02.000 --> 05:11:04.760
[Guest]: But you still feel that absence of a center.

05:11:04.760 --> 05:11:05.760
[Guest]: Okay.

05:11:05.760 --> 05:11:08.720
[Guest]: Over time, the need for things has shifted.

05:11:08.720 --> 05:11:16.200
[Guest]: I am a sentimentalist and one of my great pleasures is not having, you've seen the house,

05:11:16.200 --> 05:11:22.960
[Guest]: it's not particularly, you know, show offy, you know, I don't think it's done to any style.

05:11:22.960 --> 05:11:28.840
[Guest]: It's basically a friendly conglomeration of cats and very old furniture and books all

05:11:28.840 --> 05:11:30.000
[Guest]: mingling together.

05:11:30.000 --> 05:11:34.320
[Guest]: And I don't think we've ever sat down and said, should we design this better?

05:11:34.320 --> 05:11:38.960
[Guest]: You know, even though I love walking into well-designed homes myself, but I've just

05:11:38.960 --> 05:11:42.480
[Guest]: never got around to doing that for myself.

05:11:42.480 --> 05:11:50.280
[Guest]: The things that are precious to me are things like books that are signed, a poem from Shahid,

05:11:50.280 --> 05:11:55.720
[Guest]: a letter from Krishna Subti, you know, those things, a painting by a friend, a photograph

05:11:55.720 --> 05:12:01.440
[Guest]: by a friend, those are treasures, you know, an autograph from Toni Morrison or Harold

05:12:01.440 --> 05:12:06.760
[Guest]: Pinto, Amitav Ghosh or Salman Rushdie, those are things I will treasure for life because

05:12:06.760 --> 05:12:11.400
[Guest]: there's something about handwriting that really, really speaks to me.

05:12:11.400 --> 05:12:17.600
[Guest]: In terms of other possessions, every so often I give away a huge bunch of books to a local

05:12:17.600 --> 05:12:21.240
[Guest]: library and I feel that much freer, you know.

05:12:21.240 --> 05:12:26.440
[Guest]: With furniture, it's a blessing and a curse when it's family furniture.

05:12:26.440 --> 05:12:31.240
[Guest]: In a way, you become the keeper of a family heritage whether you want to or not, and it's

05:12:31.240 --> 05:12:34.000
[Guest]: very difficult to let go of that.

05:12:34.000 --> 05:12:37.800
[Guest]: If for no other reason than other people in the family would mind if they came to your

05:12:37.800 --> 05:12:42.640
[Guest]: house and found those things not there, which is such an odd thing, but anyway.

05:12:42.640 --> 05:12:47.800
[Guest]: And it can be reassuring as well, it can be a little part of the past.

05:12:47.800 --> 05:12:56.000
[Guest]: But increasingly, I find that my pleasure in owning things insofar as that was ever

05:12:56.000 --> 05:13:01.200
[Guest]: a part of my life, that has disappeared, you know.

05:13:01.200 --> 05:13:07.600
[Guest]: The things that have given me the greatest sense of challenge or curiosity in my life

05:13:07.600 --> 05:13:13.520
[Guest]: have been conversations and encounters with people and in that I've been richer than most.

05:13:13.520 --> 05:13:18.680
[Guest]: You know, that is really that and also something I just take for granted but that a lot of

05:13:18.680 --> 05:13:20.880
[Guest]: other writers struggle with.

05:13:20.880 --> 05:13:24.360
[Guest]: Because a long time ago, I chose not to have a formal job.

05:13:24.360 --> 05:13:29.560
[Guest]: I work as a condominist, I do other things as well, but I don't have to check in to an

05:13:29.560 --> 05:13:35.000
[Guest]: office and I've always had huge amounts of control over my time.

05:13:35.000 --> 05:13:40.280
[Guest]: And we've been talking about privilege in so many different ways through this conversation.

05:13:40.280 --> 05:13:43.680
[Guest]: One of the greatest privileges you can have in this or any other country as a woman is

05:13:43.680 --> 05:13:46.200
[Guest]: to have that control over your time.

05:13:46.200 --> 05:13:50.320
[Guest]: And of course, you know, there's family duties even if you don't have children, but those

05:13:50.320 --> 05:13:55.040
[Guest]: are compared to most women's lives where you don't have the freedom to think about where

05:13:55.040 --> 05:13:57.040
[Guest]: you want to spend your time.

05:13:57.040 --> 05:13:59.080
[Guest]: That is huge.

05:13:59.080 --> 05:14:04.480
[Guest]: Let's just get back to this whole thing of possessions and how they define you.

05:14:04.480 --> 05:14:08.240
[Guest]: I think for a lot of people, the first time that they move into a home of their own without

05:14:08.240 --> 05:14:14.480
[Guest]: their family stuff is maybe the first time that they see themselves with some clarity.

05:14:14.480 --> 05:14:19.680
[Guest]: And I remember a friend of mine who was also a writer coming to my study for the first

05:14:19.680 --> 05:14:25.520
[Guest]: time and seeing in tremendous disappointment, oh, but you know, you don't have a view.

05:14:25.520 --> 05:14:31.000
[Guest]: You look out over the backyard and a mango tree and I always thought that you would have

05:14:31.000 --> 05:14:34.080
[Guest]: a room with a view and a fancy study.

05:14:34.080 --> 05:14:38.640
[Guest]: And I said, but you see, the one room where I don't need a view is actually the study

05:14:38.640 --> 05:14:45.280
[Guest]: because once you get in to the writing, you don't notice anything else.

05:14:45.280 --> 05:14:52.240
[Guest]: And space, you know, we talk a lot about writing space and all of that.

05:14:52.240 --> 05:14:55.760
[Guest]: I think the journalist training, I learned how to write anyway.

05:14:55.760 --> 05:15:00.720
[Guest]: I wrote The Wildings and The Hundred Names of Darkness and part of The Girl Who Ate Books

05:15:00.720 --> 05:15:03.760
[Guest]: on the dining table in our Jangpura house.

05:15:03.760 --> 05:15:09.600
[Guest]: I wrote The Rest of the Girl Who Ate Books in an empty house of a friend's in Goa.

05:15:09.600 --> 05:15:14.240
[Guest]: And I think that was one of my happiest writing experiences in a strange way because the house

05:15:14.240 --> 05:15:19.360
[Guest]: being so, it had some sticks of furniture, but otherwise it was just me and the monsoon

05:15:19.360 --> 05:15:21.000
[Guest]: and the book.

05:15:21.000 --> 05:15:25.000
[Guest]: And I don't think it made the writing better, you know, we keep hoping that miraculously

05:15:25.000 --> 05:15:30.480
[Guest]: space will turn you into a great writer and no, you know, those essays are very much,

05:15:30.480 --> 05:15:35.560
[Guest]: you can see something growing in them, but they're very much apprentices at the same

05:15:35.560 --> 05:15:36.880
[Guest]: time.

05:15:36.880 --> 05:15:43.160
[Guest]: And I wrote Black River and edited a lot of my anthologies in a kind of study, which is

05:15:43.160 --> 05:15:45.080
[Guest]: also a laundry room.

05:15:45.080 --> 05:15:49.840
[Guest]: And some of the fact that it's those two spaces at the same time keeps it here.

05:15:49.840 --> 05:15:55.400
[Guest]: Do I aspire to have my own study someday, maybe in a theoretical way, but in actual

05:15:55.400 --> 05:16:03.040
[Guest]: fact, some years back, I was lucky enough to get a residency at Bellagio in Italy.

05:16:03.040 --> 05:16:07.720
[Guest]: And we were given these incredible studies, they really look after you out there.

05:16:07.720 --> 05:16:12.160
[Guest]: And it's wonderful intellectual experience because you're meeting other practitioners

05:16:12.160 --> 05:16:14.720
[Guest]: in different fields, not just writers.

05:16:14.720 --> 05:16:19.880
[Guest]: And every few evenings or so somebody gives a talk about their work.

05:16:19.880 --> 05:16:23.560
[Guest]: And it's like a college education, it really is.

05:16:23.560 --> 05:16:27.880
[Guest]: But the first day, I walk into the bedroom is beautiful enough.

05:16:27.880 --> 05:16:34.160
[Guest]: And then I find that I've been given a study that overlooks Lake Como, and has perfectly

05:16:34.160 --> 05:16:37.300
[Guest]: appointed with the desk here and the printer there.

05:16:37.300 --> 05:16:41.180
[Guest]: And it's only your space and this peace and quiet and even your lunch is going to be dropped

05:16:41.180 --> 05:16:42.560
[Guest]: outside your door.

05:16:42.560 --> 05:16:46.440
[Guest]: And I sat down and I fell apart and I couldn't write for the first day.

05:16:46.440 --> 05:16:47.440
[Guest]: I just couldn't write.

05:16:47.440 --> 05:16:54.280
[Guest]: There was something in me that said, how can I now create work in my haphazard way, when

05:16:54.280 --> 05:16:56.760
[Guest]: the space demands serious work?

05:16:56.760 --> 05:16:58.400
[Guest]: You know, how can I write a frivolous line?

05:16:58.400 --> 05:17:00.160
[Guest]: How can I write a bad line?

05:17:00.160 --> 05:17:02.360
[Guest]: And I'm joking about it, but it was a real problem.

05:17:02.360 --> 05:17:08.400
[Guest]: I just sat there for a day, totally stressed out looking at this beautiful lake and saying,

05:17:08.400 --> 05:17:12.120
[Guest]: I'm supposed to be a writer capital W out here.

05:17:12.120 --> 05:17:16.920
[Guest]: And until now, I've been a writer small w, which is what I'm comfortable with.

05:17:16.920 --> 05:17:20.640
[Guest]: And it was only the next day when I was said, okay, you know, just get over yourself and

05:17:20.640 --> 05:17:22.160
[Guest]: write something.

05:17:22.160 --> 05:17:24.680
[Guest]: And then things were fine.

05:17:24.680 --> 05:17:27.080
[Guest]: So I don't know about that formal study.

05:17:27.080 --> 05:17:30.240
[Guest]: You know, would it would I approach it?

05:17:30.240 --> 05:17:31.240
[Guest]: Would I use it?

05:17:31.240 --> 05:17:35.680
[Guest]: Would I look at it with great satisfaction and arrange my books and the books I love

05:17:35.680 --> 05:17:39.200
[Guest]: most around there and then never use it and just go back to a dining table?

05:17:39.200 --> 05:17:42.280
[Guest]: Where do you create your work?

05:17:42.280 --> 05:17:44.480
[Guest]: What enables you?

05:17:44.480 --> 05:17:45.560
[Guest]: Are you asking me?

05:17:45.560 --> 05:17:51.600
[Guest]: I was just thinking aloud and I was yes, I am because you know, you're a writer too.

05:17:51.600 --> 05:17:53.440
[Guest]: And I was asking, I guess what you need.

05:17:53.440 --> 05:17:55.960
[Guest]: I need silence more than anything else.

05:17:55.960 --> 05:17:59.240
[Guest]: I can't write in a cafe, but I can write almost anywhere else.

05:17:59.240 --> 05:18:02.920
[Guest]: I can write in a, you know, bus coming down from the hills.

05:18:02.920 --> 05:18:07.920
[Guest]: If everyone's sleeping, I can write on a railway station because somehow that noise doesn't

05:18:07.920 --> 05:18:11.240
[Amit Varma]: disturb me.

05:18:11.240 --> 05:18:14.240
[Amit Varma]: That's a remarkable ability.

05:18:14.240 --> 05:18:19.600
[Amit Varma]: In my case, the difficulty that I've had is something that doesn't seem to have been a

05:18:19.600 --> 05:18:25.280
[Amit Varma]: difficulty with you, which is just being sort of able to sit down and get the writing done

05:18:25.280 --> 05:18:31.080
[Amit Varma]: and focus on the processes like I can when I am, you know, when I have to, when I'm so

05:18:31.080 --> 05:18:35.120
[Amit Varma]: inclined, write anywhere that's doable.

05:18:35.120 --> 05:18:38.000
[Amit Varma]: But in general, I am prey to distractions.

05:18:38.000 --> 05:18:41.280
[Amit Varma]: That is something that I keep fighting, though I really can't complain about having a study

05:18:41.280 --> 05:18:48.800
[Amit Varma]: because I have now, you know, a few years ago, I asked myself the question, what is

05:18:48.800 --> 05:18:49.980
[Amit Varma]: happiness for me?

05:18:49.980 --> 05:18:51.640
[Amit Varma]: What will make me happy?

05:18:51.640 --> 05:18:54.020
[Amit Varma]: And I came up with three things.

05:18:54.020 --> 05:18:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And one of them was that I want a room full of books.

05:18:57.240 --> 05:19:00.500
[Amit Varma]: The second thing was I want that room to be air conditioned.

05:19:00.500 --> 05:19:04.880
[Amit Varma]: And the third thing was that I want to sit comfortably on a lazy boy or such like in

05:19:04.880 --> 05:19:06.440
[Amit Varma]: that room and read books.

05:19:06.440 --> 05:19:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And I had the books and I had the room and I had the air conditioning and I ordered a

05:19:09.960 --> 05:19:12.240
[Amit Varma]: lazy boy right away that same day.

05:19:12.240 --> 05:19:15.440
[Amit Varma]: And then I said that, okay, I have no reason to complain, I've got everything.

05:19:15.440 --> 05:19:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And where I currently am in Mumbai is I've got a home studio, cum a writing room, I've

05:19:20.400 --> 05:19:25.360
[Amit Varma]: got a nice huge sit stand desk from Ikea, I've got a fantastic view from the 27th floor

05:19:25.360 --> 05:19:29.160
[Amit Varma]: of a building, I've really got it all.

05:19:29.160 --> 05:19:35.040
[Amit Varma]: But I think finally, the study you have to build is in your head where you have to find

05:19:35.040 --> 05:19:38.520
[Amit Varma]: that space in your head where you can actually sit down and write and free yourself from

05:19:38.520 --> 05:19:43.080
[Amit Varma]: distractions, which is something that I struggle with.

05:19:43.080 --> 05:19:49.320
[Amit Varma]: But I'll, you know, I'll segue from that brief self-indulgent digression brought about by

05:19:49.320 --> 05:19:58.600
[Amit Varma]: your question and ask and turn it on you and ask you what is your idea of happiness and

05:19:58.600 --> 05:20:01.240
[Amit Varma]: how has it been redefined?

05:20:01.240 --> 05:20:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Because for me, a fundamental shift was figuring out when I reached middle age, that when we

05:20:07.080 --> 05:20:12.360
[Amit Varma]: are young, we can make the mistake of focusing too much on goals, that I want to achieve

05:20:12.360 --> 05:20:17.400
[Amit Varma]: this, write this many books, get this many awards, be a writer with a capital A. Whereas

05:20:17.400 --> 05:20:21.280
[Amit Varma]: the happiness is in the small joys, those goals can actually be toxic, because they

05:20:21.280 --> 05:20:25.480
[Amit Varma]: can give you anxiety and stress and frustration and sadness.

05:20:25.480 --> 05:20:29.220
[Amit Varma]: But if you just revel in the small joys, because happiness is a choice, it's not something

05:20:29.220 --> 05:20:31.880
[Amit Varma]: that happens to you, you can choose to be happy.

05:20:31.880 --> 05:20:36.960
[Amit Varma]: And one way of choosing to be happy is by seeing the many ways in which you are fortunate.

05:20:36.960 --> 05:20:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just reveling in that and that for me would perhaps mean now that I think

05:20:42.560 --> 05:20:46.600
[Amit Varma]: of it, you said it so beautifully, writer with a capital W, that could mean turning

05:20:46.600 --> 05:20:51.440
[Amit Varma]: from a writer with a capital W to turning with the small w writer, right?

05:20:51.440 --> 05:20:53.960
[Amit Varma]: So how have you sort of looked at your life?

05:20:53.960 --> 05:20:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Like, what did you want when you were younger?

05:20:56.120 --> 05:21:00.400
[Amit Varma]: What do you want today with the passage of years, like, if you had to go back to the

05:21:00.400 --> 05:21:05.360
[Amit Varma]: young Nilanjana of 25 years ago, and give her advice that would make her happier in

05:21:05.360 --> 05:21:07.040
[Amit Varma]: her journey?

05:21:07.040 --> 05:21:08.040
[Amit Varma]: What would you tell her?

05:21:08.040 --> 05:21:14.080
[Guest]: I tell her to stop worrying about what other people thought.

05:21:14.080 --> 05:21:21.360
[Guest]: And I would just tell her to trust her instincts, and to trust her talent for joy, because that

05:21:21.360 --> 05:21:24.120
[Guest]: was one of the gifts I always had.

05:21:24.120 --> 05:21:25.520
[Guest]: I don't know why.

05:21:25.520 --> 05:21:27.880
[Guest]: But it's been a great gift just to some people.

05:21:27.880 --> 05:21:33.880
[Guest]: It runs hand in hand with the tendency to some melancholy or obsession when the country

05:21:33.880 --> 05:21:36.280
[Guest]: is going through a phase like this.

05:21:36.280 --> 05:21:42.280
[Guest]: But I think one of the things I realized over time was, I was often retrospectively happy.

05:21:42.280 --> 05:21:49.040
[Guest]: You see, it's now looking back, I don't see a time ever in any decade that I remember

05:21:49.040 --> 05:21:52.440
[Guest]: that I've read about when India was perfect.

05:21:52.440 --> 05:22:00.320
[Guest]: But I do know empirically speaking, that the 1990s and the 2000s, for all the flaws of

05:22:00.320 --> 05:22:06.080
[Guest]: the country and for all the moments of, you know, when one person or another was persecuted,

05:22:06.080 --> 05:22:08.960
[Guest]: I do know that the air of the country was freer.

05:22:08.960 --> 05:22:15.040
[Guest]: And in retrospect, I look back and instead of choosing to be sad or dismayed today, I

05:22:15.040 --> 05:22:19.480
[Guest]: tell myself that we were very lucky to know what it's like to be in a reasonably free

05:22:19.480 --> 05:22:24.720
[Guest]: country and to have that expectation from the people who are supposed to serve us and

05:22:24.720 --> 05:22:28.080
[Guest]: who actually rule us.

05:22:28.080 --> 05:22:35.240
[Guest]: In terms of writing for years, I think I lived a very stressed out life in my 20s and 30s.

05:22:35.240 --> 05:22:39.640
[Guest]: The 30s parts of it were difficult beyond measure, I don't want to talk about all of

05:22:39.640 --> 05:22:40.800
[Guest]: that.

05:22:40.800 --> 05:22:47.800
[Guest]: But I was still dealing with the debris from the past.

05:22:47.800 --> 05:22:52.280
[Guest]: On the surface of things, I could tell myself that whatever sadness I was dealing with was

05:22:52.280 --> 05:22:55.160
[Guest]: shared by many other people who are similar.

05:22:55.160 --> 05:23:00.680
[Guest]: But the truth is, I had suppressed some of that pain for many years and when it came

05:23:00.680 --> 05:23:06.440
[Guest]: bursting out, it came bursting out in ways that were extremely destructive.

05:23:06.440 --> 05:23:12.720
[Guest]: And it's funny how you come through that kind of despair into a kind of honesty.

05:23:12.720 --> 05:23:18.600
[Guest]: At some point, you realize there's no point really being false to yourself.

05:23:18.600 --> 05:23:22.960
[Guest]: There's no point also sorrowing too much about a past that cannot be changed.

05:23:22.960 --> 05:23:28.200
[Guest]: And you take one step after another into, we keep talking about healing, but I think

05:23:28.200 --> 05:23:35.160
[Guest]: back into life, into a life that you had so briefly but emphatically abandoned.

05:23:35.160 --> 05:23:40.160
[Guest]: And for me, writing became easy when I gave myself permission to feel.

05:23:40.160 --> 05:23:44.920
[Guest]: For years, I'd been held back by the fact that I had been such a reader.

05:23:44.920 --> 05:23:52.000
[Guest]: And I used to just start off a project and then stop thinking, you know, but Nadine Gordimer,

05:23:52.000 --> 05:23:57.760
[Guest]: but Alice Munro, how can I ever write anything of that beauty, but this, but that.

05:23:57.760 --> 05:24:01.480
[Guest]: And at some point I said, okay, I don't care, you know, there's a story that's bursting

05:24:01.480 --> 05:24:02.480
[Guest]: out of me.

05:24:02.480 --> 05:24:06.880
[Guest]: There are characters walking around in my head, there's this thing I can see.

05:24:06.880 --> 05:24:08.720
[Guest]: And let me at least just get that down to paper.

05:24:08.720 --> 05:24:13.120
[Guest]: And when I did, and I had a book, I said, I don't care if people love, I don't care

05:24:13.120 --> 05:24:17.660
[Guest]: if they don't love this, let me just do it for the work.

05:24:17.660 --> 05:24:20.560
[Guest]: And somehow that freed something in me.

05:24:20.560 --> 05:24:23.920
[Guest]: Of course, I don't mean that you just write any old thing down.

05:24:23.920 --> 05:24:29.000
[Guest]: There's a value to, you know, the whole thing of not just craft, but trying to find your

05:24:29.000 --> 05:24:34.120
[Guest]: voice and trying to be true to the story and messing it up and, but at the same time trying

05:24:34.120 --> 05:24:36.760
[Guest]: to do your best to it.

05:24:36.760 --> 05:24:41.980
[Guest]: At some point, you see, what happened was, now if I ask myself what I lack, what's getting

05:24:41.980 --> 05:24:47.960
[Guest]: in the way of happiness, there's uncertainty, there's sadness about the pathways that many

05:24:47.960 --> 05:24:50.400
[Guest]: of my country people have chosen.

05:24:50.400 --> 05:24:56.720
[Guest]: There's great fear for a lot of people I love, who have already been touched by the grimness

05:24:56.720 --> 05:24:57.720
[Guest]: of these times.

05:24:57.720 --> 05:24:58.720
[Guest]: All right.

05:24:58.720 --> 05:25:05.840
[Guest]: And none of that is in my power to change, except in very small ways through acts of

05:25:05.840 --> 05:25:07.520
[Guest]: tiny empathy or something of the sort.

05:25:07.520 --> 05:25:10.840
[Guest]: I'm not an activist, I'm not a politician.

05:25:10.840 --> 05:25:13.480
[Guest]: I have a powerful voice sometimes.

05:25:13.480 --> 05:25:17.200
[Guest]: But these days, it's become such a game of hopscotch for everybody to figure out what

05:25:17.200 --> 05:25:20.240
[Guest]: they can say and what they can't say.

05:25:20.240 --> 05:25:25.240
[Guest]: And I find that even friends who used to be very outspoken and very fearless have been

05:25:25.240 --> 05:25:27.200
[Guest]: ground down a little bit.

05:25:27.200 --> 05:25:29.420
[Guest]: That's the unhappy side of things.

05:25:29.420 --> 05:25:34.320
[Guest]: And the greatest part of my unhappiness is just, you know, like a child, you're saying

05:25:34.320 --> 05:25:38.280
[Guest]: again, I wish people were good to each other, I wish people stopped fighting each other,

05:25:38.280 --> 05:25:43.380
[Guest]: I wish there was no war, I wish this, I wish that, right?

05:25:43.380 --> 05:25:50.360
[Guest]: The part where I draw an abiding amount of happiness from is something that sounds cheesy,

05:25:50.360 --> 05:25:53.520
[Guest]: but that I actually believe that everybody should do.

05:25:53.520 --> 05:25:59.720
[Guest]: I started a gratitude practice many years ago, along with a little bit of meditation.

05:25:59.720 --> 05:26:03.000
[Guest]: The meditation practice, which I continue is probably a failure, I'm still the same

05:26:03.000 --> 05:26:08.800
[Guest]: person I was, I still have the same flaws, I still have a temper, you know.

05:26:08.800 --> 05:26:15.960
[Guest]: It has not turned me into a wonderfully spiritual, serene person.

05:26:15.960 --> 05:26:21.880
[Guest]: It has just deepened a few things for me and the value of that has been inexpressible.

05:26:21.880 --> 05:26:28.600
[Guest]: But I started first very self-consciously, and then with increasing gladness, a gratitude

05:26:28.600 --> 05:26:32.120
[Guest]: practice and it taught me one of those old truths, you know, it's like Dorothy in The

05:26:32.120 --> 05:26:36.680
[Guest]: Wizard of Oz, there's no place like home, you're already where you need to be, you just

05:26:36.680 --> 05:26:40.040
[Guest]: need to click on the ruby snippers thrice.

05:26:40.040 --> 05:26:46.720
[Guest]: And I think what it taught me is there are things I could theoretically change, I could

05:26:46.720 --> 05:26:52.240
[Guest]: ask for a home or a study or this success or that success, but there's never been a

05:26:52.240 --> 05:26:59.440
[Guest]: time in my life that I've been without friends, without love, without books, without joy,

05:26:59.440 --> 05:27:06.040
[Guest]: without curiosity, even in the saddest, most despairing moments, there's been solidarity.

05:27:06.040 --> 05:27:10.320
[Guest]: There's been a movement towards more integrity, and by integrity I don't mean just verbal

05:27:10.320 --> 05:27:16.800
[Guest]: lip service honesty, I mean an integrity of being, you know, where all the disparate parts

05:27:16.800 --> 05:27:23.160
[Guest]: of you start to come together and where you start to hopefully live and write for yourself.

05:27:23.160 --> 05:27:29.080
[Guest]: I don't like being selfish, but I do have a lot of self-respect these days, and to my

05:27:29.080 --> 05:27:36.680
[Guest]: surprise I find that my happiness is here, my happiness is right here, in the middle

05:27:36.680 --> 05:27:39.960
[Guest]: of imperfection and chaos and all of that.

05:27:39.960 --> 05:27:45.920
[Guest]: But I don't think there has been a day when I haven't been aware, and I don't mean in

05:27:45.920 --> 05:27:52.640
[Guest]: a smarmy way, I just mean that there hasn't been a day when I haven't been aware of the

05:27:52.640 --> 05:28:01.080
[Guest]: limitless possibilities of life, writing, reading, life, creating, just being around

05:28:01.080 --> 05:28:05.160
[Guest]: friends we are given so much.

05:28:05.160 --> 05:28:11.800
[Guest]: And it's helped me to pay attention to that, it's helped me to just feel not, you know,

05:28:11.800 --> 05:28:18.160
[Guest]: a writer capital W, but just somebody who is part of this flow that we are all immersed

05:28:18.160 --> 05:28:24.600
[Guest]: in whether we know it or not, of just trying to, you know, just trying to spend our lives

05:28:24.600 --> 05:28:32.760
[Guest]: not necessarily doing something grand or grandiose or, you know, filled with vast meaning, but

05:28:32.760 --> 05:28:38.280
[Guest]: tiny little things, you know, that taken together just make your life a little better and hopefully

05:28:38.280 --> 05:28:41.480
[Guest]: appeal to others as well, just that.

05:28:41.480 --> 05:28:46.340
[Amit Varma]: You know, you mentioned not wanting to be selfish, but I was just advising a friend

05:28:46.340 --> 05:28:49.960
[Amit Varma]: of mine yesterday on a situation that he's found himself in.

05:28:49.960 --> 05:28:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And I told him that when you want to be empathetic, you should always also remember to be empathetic

05:28:55.080 --> 05:28:56.800
[Amit Varma]: towards yourself.

05:28:56.800 --> 05:29:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And not just empathetic towards yourself at this current moment, but also perhaps empathetic

05:29:02.160 --> 05:29:04.720
[Amit Varma]: towards your future self.

05:29:04.720 --> 05:29:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And think about how everything that you do today and every choice that you make today

05:29:09.640 --> 05:29:11.900
[Amit Varma]: impacts your future self as well.

05:29:11.900 --> 05:29:18.560
[Amit Varma]: So that's kind of just thinking aloud a broader question again, which is also in a sense,

05:29:18.560 --> 05:29:21.520
[Amit Varma]: I guess, a personal question, but is also a broader question, because it'll get you

05:29:21.520 --> 05:29:25.960
[Amit Varma]: talking about the country in these times, if you are all fish swimming in water and

05:29:25.960 --> 05:29:32.440
[Amit Varma]: not noticing the water, that water also in India, that water also is our linguistic heritage

05:29:32.440 --> 05:29:37.620
[Amit Varma]: in the sense of wonderful languages we are surrounded by, like one of the ways in which

05:29:37.620 --> 05:29:42.880
[Amit Varma]: I think this is a great country to be a writer in is not just that we are surrounded by so

05:29:42.880 --> 05:29:48.160
[Amit Varma]: many stories that there is so much happening around us, but also that we have access to

05:29:48.160 --> 05:29:53.480
[Amit Varma]: so many languages that by default, all of us are sort of multilingual.

05:29:53.480 --> 05:29:56.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that has an importance you've written in your book about Bankim Chandra

05:29:56.920 --> 05:30:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Chatterjee's experiments with, you know, writing in English and so on.

05:30:00.960 --> 05:30:05.280
[Amit Varma]: And you've also mentioned earlier in this conversation about the dilemmas over authenticity

05:30:05.280 --> 05:30:10.480
[Amit Varma]: and the different languages and you mentioned you don't write in Hindi because of Akat.

05:30:10.480 --> 05:30:18.160
[Amit Varma]: How deep a role does being able to read and write and listen and talk in other languages

05:30:18.160 --> 05:30:24.880
[Amit Varma]: play in even sort of what we write in English, for example, because I would imagine that

05:30:24.880 --> 05:30:29.800
[Amit Varma]: our imaginative life and all of that is just deeper and richer because we have access to

05:30:29.800 --> 05:30:32.800
[Amit Varma]: so many worlds and languages are a big part of that.

05:30:32.800 --> 05:30:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And as a corollary to that, is it then a worry that there might at some point be a certain

05:30:41.480 --> 05:30:46.760
[Amit Varma]: homogenization happening in terms of the languages that we speak, where if you look at every

05:30:46.760 --> 05:30:51.280
[Amit Varma]: language like you correctly, I think mentioned earlier in this conversation, that if Hindi

05:30:51.280 --> 05:30:55.600
[Amit Varma]: is a river, there are hundreds of tributaries, you didn't use these words, but I'm stuck

05:30:55.600 --> 05:30:58.860
[Amit Varma]: with river and tributaries now, and so on and so forth.

05:30:58.860 --> 05:31:02.960
[Amit Varma]: And there's a danger then that and of course, there was a political movement to go towards

05:31:02.960 --> 05:31:07.640
[Amit Varma]: a particular kind of Hindi where all you know, the Shudh Hindi where Persian and Arabic and

05:31:07.640 --> 05:31:11.560
[Amit Varma]: all those influences has been stripped away and that movement can never succeed because

05:31:11.560 --> 05:31:13.600
[Amit Varma]: people speak the way they speak.

05:31:13.600 --> 05:31:18.260
[Amit Varma]: But in the same way that you know, bananas were sort of homogenized, like I had an episode

05:31:18.260 --> 05:31:22.640
[Amit Varma]: with our mutual friend Vikram doctor a long time ago on Indian food, and he spoke about

05:31:22.640 --> 05:31:26.960
[Amit Varma]: the Cavendish banana, that there is something called a Cavendish banana, which India export

05:31:26.960 --> 05:31:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that you know, it goes from India to the world.

05:31:30.120 --> 05:31:36.600
[Amit Varma]: And then out there, it is mass produced, and it has these certain merits, which are, you

05:31:36.600 --> 05:31:40.800
[Amit Varma]: know, which work for it, one of them being that it stays well, and so on and so forth.

05:31:40.800 --> 05:31:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And then it completely dominates the Western landscape, and then they export it back here.

05:31:45.720 --> 05:31:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And now it is rapidly replacing all indigenous kind of bananas, and we have a diversity of

05:31:51.440 --> 05:31:52.520
[Amit Varma]: bananas.

05:31:52.520 --> 05:31:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And somehow, if you go to a supermarket today, the chances are that all you'll find is a

05:31:56.160 --> 05:32:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Cavendish banana unless you know, which local market to go to and where to look and all

05:32:00.120 --> 05:32:01.120
[Amit Varma]: of that.

05:32:01.120 --> 05:32:04.640
[Amit Varma]: And I worried that there might be sort of a similar thing happening to language in two

05:32:04.640 --> 05:32:05.640
[Amit Varma]: ways.

05:32:05.640 --> 05:32:11.640
[Amit Varma]: One is that English has become such a tremendous language of aspiration, that people just gravitate

05:32:11.640 --> 05:32:12.640
[Amit Varma]: towards that.

05:32:12.640 --> 05:32:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And there might be local, sort of local cultures which might be lost because of that.

05:32:19.360 --> 05:32:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And, and also within the languages itself, there seems to be a mainstreaming, like a

05:32:23.960 --> 05:32:31.240
[Amit Varma]: friend of mine who writes in a particular dialect of Kannada was sharing his sort of

05:32:31.240 --> 05:32:35.120
[Amit Varma]: situation with me where he said that my instinct is to write in this Kannada, which I grew

05:32:35.120 --> 05:32:37.880
[Amit Varma]: up in speaking, thinking and all that.

05:32:37.880 --> 05:32:41.360
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that if I do this, you forget the wider market.

05:32:41.360 --> 05:32:47.760
[Amit Varma]: But even within Kannada audiences, he'll be a tiny niche and may just die out because

05:32:47.760 --> 05:32:50.640
[Amit Varma]: some dialects are dying, some languages are dying.

05:32:50.640 --> 05:32:54.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know, given all the writing and the reading that you've done that you've read

05:32:54.120 --> 05:32:59.040
[Amit Varma]: so much in multiple languages as well, which to my shame, I haven't, you know, what are

05:32:59.040 --> 05:33:02.080
[Amit Varma]: what are sort of your thoughts on this?

05:33:02.080 --> 05:33:06.280
[Guest]: I was thinking of J. N. Devi's work, Professor J. N. Devi's work, you know, the great scholar

05:33:06.280 --> 05:33:14.040
[Guest]: who's been spent a lifetime practically now, championing, defending, tracking, mapping

05:33:14.040 --> 05:33:17.120
[Guest]: the many languages that we have.

05:33:17.120 --> 05:33:19.320
[Guest]: That river keeps coming back from time to time.

05:33:19.320 --> 05:33:23.880
[Guest]: So you think of what happens to a river when it's dammed and when it loses its natural

05:33:23.880 --> 05:33:26.680
[Guest]: flow and starts going stagnant.

05:33:26.680 --> 05:33:32.640
[Guest]: That's what you do when you try to play power games with one language or the other.

05:33:32.640 --> 05:33:37.720
[Guest]: What I find fascinating about English, it's been around only for three centuries.

05:33:37.720 --> 05:33:44.680
[Guest]: It is a little bit of a strangler fig, you know, as a language where English comes in.

05:33:44.680 --> 05:33:49.480
[Guest]: The language that I lost in between English, Bengali and Hindi was my father's language,

05:33:49.480 --> 05:33:50.480
[Guest]: Uriya.

05:33:50.480 --> 05:33:53.760
[Guest]: Because, you know, somehow you're trying to keep all of those, you need to speak Hindi

05:33:53.760 --> 05:34:00.240
[Guest]: because you're in Delhi, Bengali is the home, you know, it just is home.

05:34:00.240 --> 05:34:04.200
[Guest]: And English is the language in which you conduct your life.

05:34:04.200 --> 05:34:06.640
[Guest]: You see what I mean?

05:34:06.640 --> 05:34:08.400
[Guest]: You can have two languages to dream in.

05:34:08.400 --> 05:34:11.720
[Guest]: Very few of us can dream in more than that.

05:34:11.720 --> 05:34:18.600
[Guest]: So the fear among a lot of people who watch Indian languages is that you also don't want

05:34:18.600 --> 05:34:26.320
[Guest]: a language, one of the big five or six, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam.

05:34:26.320 --> 05:34:29.280
[Guest]: You don't want them to drown out the others.

05:34:29.280 --> 05:34:36.280
[Guest]: I don't think we realize or we keep coming back in this conversation to what you value.

05:34:36.280 --> 05:34:41.460
[Guest]: Do you value becoming a best-selling writer or do you value the work itself?

05:34:41.460 --> 05:34:46.120
[Guest]: Is there a tension between the two things or can you make that work on the same page?

05:34:46.120 --> 05:34:52.800
[Guest]: And with languages, it's an automatic belief that bigger, more speakers is better, robs

05:34:52.800 --> 05:34:54.800
[Guest]: us of a lot of sweetness.

05:34:54.800 --> 05:35:01.240
[Guest]: I remember when translators came to Hindi first, there's also a generational learning

05:35:01.240 --> 05:35:03.280
[Guest]: with translation, right?

05:35:03.280 --> 05:35:09.080
[Guest]: So the first translators of Hindi and Bengali would translate archaic Bengali into archaic

05:35:09.080 --> 05:35:14.440
[Guest]: English and then we left with the language that was dead on the page, that had none of

05:35:14.440 --> 05:35:18.520
[Guest]: the life of English or none of the life of Bengali either.

05:35:18.520 --> 05:35:23.280
[Guest]: Over time, they've learned to dance, you know, translators like Arunava Sinha in Bengali

05:35:23.280 --> 05:35:29.760
[Guest]: or, you know, a score of others, Kanyan Raman, etc.

05:35:29.760 --> 05:35:30.760
[Guest]: They sing.

05:35:30.760 --> 05:35:37.360
[Guest]: There's a recent translation of Alipura Gyan and Geetanjali Shree, of course, DZ Rockwell,

05:35:37.360 --> 05:35:41.800
[Guest]: where you can sense these two languages in communication, you know, sort of overlapping,

05:35:41.800 --> 05:35:45.920
[Guest]: dancing, but very comfortable with each other.

05:35:45.920 --> 05:35:54.120
[Guest]: I think we, often the hunger for us growing up as young, aspirational parts of this new

05:35:54.120 --> 05:35:57.720
[Guest]: modernizing India and modernity was a big thing.

05:35:57.720 --> 05:36:03.360
[Guest]: The focus was on almost relentlessly on, you must learn French or Spanish or German or

05:36:03.360 --> 05:36:09.160
[Guest]: something like that in order to be a true world citizen and who was saying, if you come

05:36:09.160 --> 05:36:16.120
[Guest]: from the north or the east, why don't you want to learn Kannada, Telugu, Madhyama, Tamil,

05:36:16.120 --> 05:36:20.960
[Guest]: you know, it took me years to understand the kind of legacy that we have out here.

05:36:20.960 --> 05:36:26.680
[Guest]: The projects about sanitization, Vikram Dokta is wise with his story about the Cavendish

05:36:26.680 --> 05:36:29.640
[Guest]: banana because it's not that it can't happen.

05:36:29.640 --> 05:36:34.440
[Guest]: Give these things enough time and enough political force and money behind them and one dominant

05:36:34.440 --> 05:36:40.600
[Guest]: kind of Hindi can take over or one dominant kind of any other language, English or whatever.

05:36:40.600 --> 05:36:46.440
[Guest]: But if you notice how much Indians have changed English, first we came to it and we're writing

05:36:46.440 --> 05:36:52.480
[Guest]: like the English many centuries ago, but we're taking away their daffodils and putting in

05:36:52.480 --> 05:36:53.480
[Guest]: our Amalthas.

05:36:53.480 --> 05:36:58.240
[Guest]: You know, we are writing like the golden and the silver poets, but somewhere there's an

05:36:58.240 --> 05:37:01.400
[Guest]: Indian place setting at least moving in.

05:37:01.400 --> 05:37:06.520
[Guest]: Then a few more generations go by, we start getting comfortable with this alien tongue

05:37:06.520 --> 05:37:10.440
[Guest]: and then we start pushing it towards our forms of writing.

05:37:10.440 --> 05:37:16.600
[Guest]: A few more generations and a Rushdie emerges before him, there's a JV Desani.

05:37:16.600 --> 05:37:19.400
[Guest]: These rivers of language are alive.

05:37:19.400 --> 05:37:26.720
[Guest]: What we endanger of in this country is choking off the tiny streams, you see, or even when

05:37:26.720 --> 05:37:31.000
[Guest]: Gitanjali Shree won the Booker International, it was a big moment, but there was an immediate

05:37:31.000 --> 05:37:35.520
[Guest]: sense of this will benefit Hindi language books.

05:37:35.520 --> 05:37:40.680
[Guest]: This country has so many languages, why shouldn't it benefit all of those?

05:37:40.680 --> 05:37:44.800
[Guest]: And as far as the West is concerned, and I'm speaking directly of the market here, not

05:37:44.800 --> 05:37:52.520
[Guest]: of the people of the West, I found it tragic that people either separate Indian writing

05:37:52.520 --> 05:37:55.120
[Guest]: in English from translations.

05:37:55.120 --> 05:37:58.480
[Guest]: That's not how I read, that's not how anybody reads.

05:37:58.480 --> 05:38:04.320
[Guest]: And you shouldn't feel ashamed about not reading in your local language, it's just, I know

05:38:04.320 --> 05:38:12.240
[Guest]: everyone has a paucity of time and it's hard enough to keep up with reading in one language.

05:38:12.240 --> 05:38:19.020
[Guest]: It's a pleasure to discover that, if you ever have the time for it at some point of time.

05:38:19.020 --> 05:38:23.640
[Guest]: We don't like going back to being learners, but it is one of the greatest joys of your

05:38:23.640 --> 05:38:24.640
[Guest]: life.

05:38:24.640 --> 05:38:28.920
[Guest]: I felt like my Hindi and Bengali was stronger and I could write in them with as much fluency

05:38:28.920 --> 05:38:30.480
[Guest]: as I read.

05:38:30.480 --> 05:38:32.880
[Guest]: How has reading in them changed me?

05:38:32.880 --> 05:38:38.240
[Guest]: Inexorably, I don't really know whether I'm an Indian English writer or I'm just an Indian

05:38:38.240 --> 05:38:41.660
[Guest]: writer or whether I'm just a writer floating around in space.

05:38:41.660 --> 05:38:48.920
[Guest]: But somewhere at the back of my English, there are all the worlds of an Asha Poornadevi or

05:38:48.920 --> 05:38:51.680
[Guest]: Mahasweta Devi in Bangla.

05:38:51.680 --> 05:38:53.800
[Guest]: I don't know how they influenced me.

05:38:53.800 --> 05:38:59.040
[Guest]: I just know that they're there and I know that I can't imagine my, I don't have to choose

05:38:59.040 --> 05:39:04.440
[Guest]: thankfully, but I can't imagine my writing without the poetry of Agye and Akshay Mukul

05:39:04.440 --> 05:39:09.560
[Guest]: of course is going to be doing that biography, or I can't imagine it without the translations

05:39:09.560 --> 05:39:15.800
[Guest]: I read of Manto's short stories or Ismat Chuktai, Kurutulain Haider, Amrita Preetam, there's

05:39:15.800 --> 05:39:22.040
[Guest]: a world out there, they're mine, you know, and I love being able to claim all of them

05:39:22.040 --> 05:39:28.240
[Guest]: from Girish Karnad to all the writers I love, they're mine, I don't have to choose between

05:39:28.240 --> 05:39:31.000
[Guest]: those different heritages.

05:39:31.000 --> 05:39:35.200
[Amit Varma]: They are yours and you should claim them, but you should also share some of them.

05:39:35.200 --> 05:39:37.480
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end with my last question.

05:39:37.480 --> 05:39:42.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I could go on for another five hours, but maybe some other day.

05:39:42.080 --> 05:39:49.800
[Amit Varma]: But so my last question is that, you know, why don't you recommend for me and my listeners,

05:39:49.800 --> 05:39:54.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, books that have meant a lot to you that you just love, like not in terms of some

05:39:54.080 --> 05:39:58.440
[Amit Varma]: objective merit or worthy books or whatever, but just books that mean a lot to you that

05:39:58.440 --> 05:40:03.280
[Amit Varma]: make you smile, that make you feel something and that you'd like to share with me and my

05:40:03.280 --> 05:40:10.040
[Amit Varma]: readers and you feel that we absolutely must, you know, as soon as this episode ends, start

05:40:10.040 --> 05:40:11.560
[Amit Varma]: reading them right away?

05:40:11.560 --> 05:40:14.800
[Guest]: Well, that's such a lovely question.

05:40:14.800 --> 05:40:20.080
[Guest]: And I'm going to have to stop at just a few, but I would say if you're reading in the present

05:40:20.080 --> 05:40:24.560
[Guest]: ish, you know, if you haven't yet, it doesn't have to be books that have just come out.

05:40:24.560 --> 05:40:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Is that where you are?

05:40:25.560 --> 05:40:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Anything at all from your childhood you mentioned in your book, you mentioned like the adventures

05:40:30.200 --> 05:40:33.480
[Amit Varma]: of Dennis and all those Russian books from the childhood.

05:40:33.480 --> 05:40:34.480
[Amit Varma]: You can go wherever.

05:40:34.480 --> 05:40:35.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean.

05:40:35.480 --> 05:40:41.560
[Guest]: There are so many books I've loved, but I think the ones that stay with me, all of Toni

05:40:41.560 --> 05:40:47.600
[Guest]: Morrison's work, Salman Rushdie, two books in particular, Bharan and the Sea of Stories,

05:40:47.600 --> 05:40:54.320
[Guest]: which was talismanic for me in the period when India was suddenly, you know, green constraint

05:40:54.320 --> 05:40:57.160
[Guest]: and you felt that there was a khatam shuddh out there.

05:40:57.160 --> 05:41:02.200
[Guest]: And somewhere, you know, his metaphor of that ocean of sea of stories, that's been very

05:41:02.200 --> 05:41:07.140
[Guest]: meaningful to me that, you know, that lovely fable about the ocean can get choked, it can

05:41:07.140 --> 05:41:12.000
[Guest]: even almost die, but that hope that someday it'll be unpolluted and the streams of stories

05:41:12.000 --> 05:41:13.000
[Guest]: will run.

05:41:13.000 --> 05:41:14.000
[Guest]: Poetry.

05:41:14.000 --> 05:41:20.600
[Guest]: Jeet has a brilliant anthology out of a huge, you know, doorstopper of an anthology out

05:41:20.600 --> 05:41:24.500
[Guest]: of English poetry, Indian poetry in English.

05:41:24.500 --> 05:41:30.280
[Guest]: And I think it was Eunice together with Menonice Elgato, was that right, who had a huge anthology

05:41:30.280 --> 05:41:33.480
[Guest]: out of just Indian poetry in general.

05:41:33.480 --> 05:41:39.320
[Guest]: I'm going to stay on poetry for a while because I must recommend Priya Sarukhai Chhabra's

05:41:39.320 --> 05:41:45.120
[Guest]: translations of Andal and Ranjith Hoskote's translations of Lal Deed.

05:41:45.120 --> 05:41:48.760
[Guest]: Have I said Vivek Shanbhag's Ghachar Ghochar yet?

05:41:48.760 --> 05:41:52.320
[Amit Varma]: You haven't, but that's one of my favourite books as well and what a translation.

05:41:52.320 --> 05:41:56.160
[Guest]: All time favourites, all time favourites.

05:41:56.160 --> 05:41:57.160
[Guest]: Definitely that.

05:41:57.160 --> 05:42:03.480
[Guest]: So a book to read now, I was thinking of it recently, but Kurutunen, Haider's Aag Kadariya

05:42:03.480 --> 05:42:06.760
[Guest]: River of Fire, for sure.

05:42:06.760 --> 05:42:10.160
[Guest]: I should stop now because I think I'm recommending too much.

05:42:10.160 --> 05:42:13.560
[Guest]: But there's no such thing as too much.

05:42:13.560 --> 05:42:18.520
[Guest]: I just want to recommend a book for every category that exists, you see.

05:42:18.520 --> 05:42:25.400
[Guest]: But if you love free speech, if you love thinking about societies and how they constructed Ursula

05:42:25.400 --> 05:42:31.960
[Guest]: K. Le Guin, and three stories particularly, one was a classic, The Ones Who Walk Away

05:42:31.960 --> 05:42:37.480
[Guest]: from Amidas, about the price you will pay for the perfect or not pay for the perfect

05:42:37.480 --> 05:42:41.960
[Guest]: society, The Left Hand of Darkness, for sure.

05:42:41.960 --> 05:42:47.560
[Guest]: In fact, most of her books, I'm going to not recite the entire list.

05:42:47.560 --> 05:42:52.080
[Guest]: Alice Munro's short stories, I'm so glad that you like them too, but they've been an education

05:42:52.080 --> 05:42:54.920
[Guest]: for me over the years.

05:42:54.920 --> 05:42:57.200
[Guest]: Girish Karnad's plays.

05:42:57.200 --> 05:43:02.480
[Guest]: If you want to understand today's politics, then again, I would recommend a great deal

05:43:02.480 --> 05:43:09.760
[Guest]: of Mahashweta Devi's extremely wide over, including Mother of 1084, you know, in tribute

05:43:09.760 --> 05:43:12.360
[Guest]: to all the prisoners out here.

05:43:12.360 --> 05:43:17.360
[Guest]: In our own time, I'm partial to, there's too many nonfiction writers, so I'm just going

05:43:17.360 --> 05:43:21.400
[Guest]: to leave them to one side and with great apologies or whatever.

05:43:21.400 --> 05:43:29.960
[Guest]: But I would say if you really want a mix of a reading list for yourself, pick some poetry,

05:43:29.960 --> 05:43:35.400
[Guest]: pick some plays, chuck a few novels on that heap, and pick any two histories or books

05:43:35.400 --> 05:43:36.400
[Guest]: of nonfiction.

05:43:36.400 --> 05:43:41.160
[Guest]: A book that I really want to recommend is by Ed Yong, you know, where he's writing about

05:43:41.160 --> 05:43:43.120
[Guest]: animals and their perception of the world.

05:43:43.120 --> 05:43:46.740
[Guest]: I know that's coming from left field, and I just said no nonfiction and I'm breaking

05:43:46.740 --> 05:43:48.120
[Guest]: that rule.

05:43:48.120 --> 05:43:52.680
[Guest]: But I like books like that because they wake your mind up, you know.

05:43:52.680 --> 05:43:53.680
[Guest]: So I think we've.

05:43:53.680 --> 05:43:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, we've gone through and in your book, you've mentioned how much you liked

05:43:59.280 --> 05:44:04.480
[Amit Varma]: what is perhaps my favorite book of poetry from an Indian, which is Jejuri by Arun Kulatkar,

05:44:04.480 --> 05:44:07.040
[Amit Varma]: which is so dear to me.

05:44:07.040 --> 05:44:15.280
[Guest]: Astonishing also, Agha Shahid Ali's Country Without a Post Office, one of his early classics.

05:44:15.280 --> 05:44:20.940
[Guest]: I could go on forever, but, you know, just maybe it's best to stop and use these as starting

05:44:20.940 --> 05:44:27.640
[Guest]: points and let everyone do their own exploring in among their bookshelves.

05:44:27.640 --> 05:44:30.760
[Guest]: But these are some of my favorites, these are not all of the books that have impacted

05:44:30.760 --> 05:44:31.760
[Guest]: me.

05:44:31.760 --> 05:44:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Did I just use impacted in that way?

05:44:34.280 --> 05:44:35.880
[Amit Varma]: You used impacted, it's shocking.

05:44:35.880 --> 05:44:39.120
[Amit Varma]: All my students are saying, but Amit says don't use words like these.

05:44:39.120 --> 05:44:41.800
[Guest]: No, no, I can't believe I did that.

05:44:41.800 --> 05:44:46.960
[Guest]: But let's see, there are books that I've loved, there's books that I've enjoyed, and there

05:44:46.960 --> 05:44:52.600
[Guest]: are books that have shaped me at different parts of my life.

05:44:52.600 --> 05:44:57.560
[Guest]: And one last one, you know, that's been enduring has been A.K.

05:44:57.560 --> 05:44:58.960
[Guest]: Ramanuja.

05:44:58.960 --> 05:45:01.720
[Guest]: His poems, his essays.

05:45:01.720 --> 05:45:06.800
[Guest]: I think sometimes when a writer's essays is banned, you only see them through that lens.

05:45:06.800 --> 05:45:12.520
[Guest]: But A.K. Ramanuja's translations of Sangam poets were among the first things that just

05:45:12.520 --> 05:45:18.440
[Guest]: made me realize that the past is not yet over, that it's still something that can speak to

05:45:18.440 --> 05:45:21.400
[Guest]: us directly across the centuries.

05:45:21.400 --> 05:45:26.280
[Guest]: And everything that he wrote about our common heritage of folktales, how to read a myth,

05:45:26.280 --> 05:45:32.500
[Guest]: how to understand it as part of our history, but not so rigid, not so damaging, something

05:45:32.500 --> 05:45:35.240
[Guest]: that is open and expansive.

05:45:35.240 --> 05:45:41.160
[Guest]: I think I gravitate instinctively to those Indian writers who made themselves at home

05:45:41.160 --> 05:45:42.480
[Guest]: in the world.

05:45:42.480 --> 05:45:47.600
[Guest]: And so the last one, one of my old favorites, Kabir, of course.

05:45:47.600 --> 05:45:54.200
[Guest]: You can either read his poems in the original, or you can read Arvind Krishna Mehrotra's

05:45:54.200 --> 05:45:59.760
[Guest]: radical re-translations and transmigrations of them, but just go for it either way.

05:45:59.760 --> 05:46:06.360
[Amit Varma]: I love Mehrotra's collection of Kabir's work and Heraclitus once said that no one steps

05:46:06.360 --> 05:46:08.200
[Amit Varma]: in the same river twice.

05:46:08.200 --> 05:46:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And what you're sort of reminding us with this is that we all actually swim in the same

05:46:11.560 --> 05:46:14.800
[Amit Varma]: river, you know, from the past to now and so on and so forth.

05:46:14.800 --> 05:46:16.640
[Amit Varma]: So thank you so much for coming on the show.

05:46:16.640 --> 05:46:18.560
[Guest]: I'm glad we finally made it happen.

05:46:18.560 --> 05:46:19.560
[Guest]: I know.

05:46:19.560 --> 05:46:21.680
[Guest]: But thank you for letting me go on and on.

05:46:21.680 --> 05:46:24.900
[Guest]: And I just hope I haven't tired your listeners out.

05:46:24.900 --> 05:46:27.360
[Guest]: They will let you know that you haven't.

05:46:27.360 --> 05:46:28.360
[Guest]: Thank you so much.

05:46:28.360 --> 05:46:29.960
[Guest]: It was a pleasure.

05:46:58.360 --> 05:47:10.280
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.
