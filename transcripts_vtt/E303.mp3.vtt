00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
[Amit Varma]: During this episode, I was moved by something that my guest said. He spoke about how awkward

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.880
[Amit Varma]: he felt when his father tried to hug him. And that reminded me of my own father. In

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.920
[Amit Varma]: his last years before he died, I felt that he was opening up in ways that neither of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.640
[Amit Varma]: us were used to. Once when I visited him in Chandigarh, as I was leaving, about to get

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.880
[Amit Varma]: into my taxi outside the house, he opened his arms for a hug. It was an awkward moment.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.400
[Amit Varma]: I was both happy and moved, but I hid the emotion. On one trip home, he even thanked

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.320
[Amit Varma]: me for coming, which was also out of character because he was always so blase about it. When

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.440
[Amit Varma]: episode 200 of the show came out, which is basically a long interview of me by my guest,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.880
[Amit Varma]: he actually said he was proud of me, which was stunningly expressive, given his past

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.120
[Amit Varma]: record of reticence of being a hard man. It's a regret I have that I didn't peel back past

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
[Amit Varma]: all those layers, both his layers and mine, while he was still here. Maybe if I had heard

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: this episode, I would have. Here's the thing. I have done many episodes where I have discussed

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.940
[Amit Varma]: feminism and the lives that women lead. Indeed, the title of this episode follows on from

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.280
[Amit Varma]: episode 259, The Loneliness of the Indian Women. At this point in time, in 2022, anyone

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.720
[Amit Varma]: listening to this show understands the many layers of oppression that women live with

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.760
[Amit Varma]: and normalize and that we must fight against. We have language for what happens to them,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.840
[Amit Varma]: phrases like mansplaining and gaslighting and so on and on. We have frames to explain it.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.600
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, it isn't just women who are victims of patriarchy. Men are also diminished

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.120
[Amit Varma]: by it. They are trapped in roles, in grooves laid out for them. Here's what it means to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.600
[Amit Varma]: be a man, to be a provider, to be a father, to be a son. You play that role, you get the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.600
[Amit Varma]: job done, you don't cry at movies, don't show emotion, don't be a wuss. And many of us often

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.060
[Amit Varma]: get with the program and don't question what being male does to us. We have no language

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.760
[Amit Varma]: to describe this. We keep our emotions bottled up inside us, not expressing them to others,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.420
[Amit Varma]: not even expressing them to ourselves. So what my guest speaks at length about in this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.600
[Amit Varma]: episode should not be a surprise. The loneliness of the Indian man, the mental health problems

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.480
[Amit Varma]: that young people throughout this country are having to confront, and what this does

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.900
[Amit Varma]: to our society. This is all unseen. And there's a big lesson here. Men who call themselves

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.600
[Amit Varma]: feminists like me, need to not only think about how they look at women, but also how

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.160
[Amit Varma]: they look at themselves. Their kindness has to go in that direction as well. Only kindness

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.520
[Unknown]: can save us.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.080
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Nikhil Taneja, who trained as an

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.200
[Amit Varma]: engineer, began working life as a journalist at Hindustan Times, went on to MTV and to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.860
[Amit Varma]: Yash Raj Films, where he was a general manager at the age of 30. Then he was crippled by

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.840
[Amit Varma]: anxiety and decided to confront his mental health issues. And he realized that many of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.560
[Amit Varma]: the problems he faced came straight out of his being a man. He quit his job, did therapy,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.680
[Amit Varma]: and later started Yuva, an organization that makes content, builds communities, and carries

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.120
[Amit Varma]: out research that's meant to understand and empower young Indians everywhere. Now, I think

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: of my episodes as being stimulating conversations, deep dives akin to oral histories. And this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.600
[Amit Varma]: episode is all of them. But it's also an episode that can change lives. Something I felt about

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.560
[Amit Varma]: my episode with Shrayana as well. We discuss a growing loneliness in our connected world.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.800
[Amit Varma]: We discuss anxiety and mental health. We discuss the immense power of storytelling. What Nikhil

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.280
[Amit Varma]: has done with it is so unique and inspiring. We talk about the kindness project and initiative

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.520
[Amit Varma]: of Nikhil's and why most of all, we need to be kind to ourselves. So do listen and do

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.160
[Amit Varma]: share it with anyone you think may be interested. I know it's a long episode, but it contains

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.960
[Amit Varma]: multitudes. Before we get there, though, let's take a quick commercial break even though

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.800
[Amit Varma]: what the commercials are me only. That's how it is.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.040
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.480
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.720
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.920
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.360
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 per GST

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.160
[Amit Varma]: or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.920
[Amit Varma]: good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.920
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.720
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you for having me Amit. Yeah, I've been

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.800
[Amit Varma]: thinking of inviting you for a long time though, got down to it fairly recently, but I'm actually

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.720
[Amit Varma]: glad that I didn't invite you say two years ago, because the show was much shorter than

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.480
[Amit Varma]: and I just feel that you're a guest who's tailor made for this longer format where one

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.320
[Amit Varma]: can kind of go deep into oneself and introspect about the world. And that's that's one thing

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.720
[Amit Varma]: I've also really enjoyed about the talks you've given in your columns with HT, where, you

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.560
[Amit Varma]: know, there are various places where it feels like you're almost thinking aloud in the same

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.280
[Amit Varma]: way that I do about the same things I care about. So I really enjoyed that. One of the

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.600
[Amit Varma]: interesting things you mentioned in your column is that you are the last generation to grow

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.320
[Amit Varma]: up before the internet and also the the first generation to actually grow up with the internet

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.360
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that a transitional point and this is actually a question I've asked guests

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.040
[Amit Varma]: of my own age. I'm 48 now at the time of recording. And what I have noticed in my life is that

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.880
[Amit Varma]: I became an adult before the internet was there. So I was well into my 20s before the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.280
[Amit Varma]: internet came. And it was interesting because I had to kind of learn about the world again,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.720
[Amit Varma]: learn about myself again, you know, you just do that whole process from scratch, even something

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.440
[Amit Varma]: and it's a very clear demarcation and in my generation and also, you know, just in terms

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.040
[Amit Varma]: of earlier before the internet, you are restricted by communities of circumstance, whereas now

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.720
[Amit Varma]: we can form communities of choice. And in just so many ways, life is completely different.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.440
[Amit Varma]: I want to hear from you what it was like, you know, growing up before the internet,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.320
[Amit Varma]: because you can contrast it in a much better with in a sense growing up with it because

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.800
[Amit Varma]: it came when you were young enough. And, you know, earlier, when we were having lunch before

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.520
[Amit Varma]: this, we were speaking about the importance of finding that quiet it you don't have where

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.560
[Amit Varma]: you can just sit and, you know, not let sensations knock you from thing to thing. Tell me a bit

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.840
[Amit Varma]: about your growing up years before the internet, like, where were you born? Where did you grow

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840
[Guest]: up?

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.480
[Guest]: First, I want to again, and I know I've said this to you outside of the podcast, but I

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:24.160
[Guest]: think like this is a milestone. I was as I think one of the markers of, you know, making

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.000
[Guest]: it for me was when I get called to the to this podcast.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.360
[Amit Varma]: You're too kind. You've been on very good podcasts like Varun Duggirala, Karthik Narkarachan.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.360
[Guest]: Amazing. No, but thank you for having me. Honestly, I'm really look, as I said, I think

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.640
[Guest]: another thing that I'm really looking forward to over here is, you know, learning something

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.640
[Guest]: about myself also, which I think like that's the every time I hear your podcast, as you

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.480
[Guest]: yourself said, I think you learn not just about the person, but something about yourself.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:58.440
[Guest]: So where do I begin? So I was born in Karnal in Haryana. And my family, we were living

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.520
[Guest]: in Lucknow at that time. My father was a banker. My mother tells me about the time when we

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.720
[Guest]: were, you know, in Lucknow, we were not very well off. So she would always she has these,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.320
[Guest]: you know, when you see three idiots and you have that scene of black and white scene where

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:20.520
[Guest]: you show people being, you know, not very well off. She kind of always talks about it

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.420
[Guest]: in that way that, you know, papa ke ka coat phat jata tha. So then there was a choice.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.400
[Guest]: Should we get you an ice cream or should we get you should we get his coat repaired? So

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.080
[Guest]: that's that's the context that I have, you know, of of growing up at that time where

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:44.120
[Guest]: we were. There was a lot my father was doing to try and break out of his circumstance.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.360
[Guest]: And that was visible to everybody in the family. But he was constantly I don't think I spent

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.240
[Guest]: time with my father, you know, growing up at all, you know, because he was constantly

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.960
[Guest]: just trying to make it. He was just constantly trying to get more money, get a better house,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.380
[Guest]: get to a better life. And so, yeah, I don't, unfortunately, have too many memories of spending

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.720
[Guest]: any time with my father. So I was very much raised by my mother in that sense. And two

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.200
[Guest]: things started happening. Of course, I started, you know, finding a lot of love and empathy

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.500
[Guest]: for my mother for the sacrifices that she's done and kind of always wanting to grow up

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.520
[Guest]: to be the kind of the opposite kind of a man as my father because as like I would see my

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:37.680
[Guest]: mother doing it all alone, right? And my father just so much, you know, I just wish I knew

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.900
[Guest]: him more, which I still do right now. But yeah, that there was a lot of my early years,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.020
[Guest]: you know, we from Lucknow, we went to Delhi, my father moved out, he was in Bangalore.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: From there, we were there for about a year and a half. And then we went to the Middle

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.320
[Guest]: East, Dubai, in Delhi. You know, my memories of, I feel Amit, I've always somewhere been

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.600
[Guest]: like this outsider looking in. I was talking to Hitesh Kevalia, who's, you know, is a writer

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.520
[Guest]: and director, he's done Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Zyada Saavdhan. He used this fantastic term

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.760
[Guest]: called border wale log. He said that, you know, kuch log hote hain, border wale log

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.800
[Guest]: hote hain, jo, jo, they're always on the borders, they're never like inside or outside. I feel

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.440
[Guest]: like as someone who, you know, grew up in a manner where I was definitely not, I won't

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.840
[Guest]: say I was, you know, quote unquote poor, but we're definitely not very well off. And, and

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.120
[Guest]: suddenly in Delhi, when lifestyle started improving, I was put into, for example, Rhein

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.520
[Guest]: International. And I remember my memories of that time has been just me feeling really

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.040
[Guest]: like, where am I fitting in here, you know, as somebody who was not, you know, as as rich

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.720
[Guest]: as any of the other people over there, the way they spoke the English that they had,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.320
[Guest]: the clothes that they wore, the chocolates they would bring every day. And those are

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.840
[Guest]: my early memories of like growing up. And then we went to Dubai, where, you know, my,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.640
[Guest]: again, upwardly mobile. So, you know, got a slightly better lifestyle. Again, I felt

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.680
[Guest]: at home when I was in a school over there called our own English high school, where

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.080
[Guest]: which was basically the one place where I think every middle class Indian kid over there

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.600
[Guest]: was put in. But there was a better school there, which called modern high school, where,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.680
[Guest]: which was for the upper class, so to speak, where my parents ultimately put me. So my

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.920
[Guest]: parents had made this choice when I was in when I was in Delhi, my younger brother was

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.600
[Guest]: put in a place, put in not a very good school or a very rich school in that sense. And he

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.920
[Guest]: was put in a government school and I was put in Rhein International. And so when we went

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.200
[Guest]: to Dubai, they switched it and said, you know what, and now our younger son gets to go to

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.960
[Guest]: a better school and you know, Nikhil gets to go to our own. No offense to anybody from

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.840
[Guest]: our own. But eventually when I went into modern high, again, the same, I feel like so much

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.480
[Guest]: of my life was just trying to kind of figure out how, who, what are these people? And you

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.160
[Guest]: know, what is this? Where am I stand? Where do I stand with these people? Right? And for

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160
[Guest]: me, again, I think I just took it in with my mother also constantly telling me as his

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.760
[Guest]: mother was raising me pretty much on our own, constantly telling me things like, you know,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.080
[Guest]: you need to obviously do better. You need to get a certain amount of marks and you need

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.360
[Guest]: to make me proud. You need to go with every young boy is told, you know, you have to be

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.400
[Guest]: an engineer and do an MBA. All of those things were always there, you know, I was constantly

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.720
[Guest]: being told. So my ambition initially just became that I have to make my mother proud.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.560
[Guest]: That is all I want to do in my life. And no matter what place I was in, no matter what

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:48.680
[Guest]: role I was in, I was always just overworking, you know, putting my everything into it just

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.560
[Guest]: to make sure that when I go back, my mother is just like seeing all the work that she's

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: done in raising me and my brother. She's proud of us. And in that, I think I just imbibed

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.580
[Guest]: a mindset of like, you know, work is everything, you know, making it is everything. Aspiration

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.120
[Guest]: is everything, which somehow started conflicting with I think who I was as a person, which

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.440
[Guest]: I've now realized many, many, many years later, which was a person who used to really like

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.600
[Guest]: writing, who used to really like art, who used to really like watching movies growing

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.520
[Guest]: up. And, you know, stories were my comfort zone as someone again, as I said, someone

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.640
[Guest]: who didn't really fit in or did not know where to fit in. I would always watch movies as

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.080
[Guest]: you know, in a way for me to feel less alone. I remember one of the, you know, many years

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.840
[Guest]: ago, I was just trying to teach and I'm sure we'll come to that. When I was teaching my

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.240
[Guest]: students, I used to always ask them, you know, tell me your story. And then one day when

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.720
[Guest]: they asked me, what's my story, and I'd always tell them to go deeper, deeper, deeper. And

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.560
[Guest]: then I said something very superficial. And then I started thinking like, you know, everyone

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.800
[Guest]: I asked them to go deep, but what is my and then one of the and why do I do what I do?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.000
[Guest]: And I was in Yash Raj films at that time, I was, you know, filmmaker. And the deeper

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
[Guest]: that I went, I kind of recognized this one thing, which came to me as an epiphany that,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.280
[Guest]: you know, one of the reasons why I even interested in stories was because so my father was a

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.400
[Guest]: big Dev Anand fan. And the only time that my father would ever call me was when he put

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.360
[Guest]: on would come home and put on a Dev Anand movie. And then he'd be like, do you want

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.120
[Guest]: to watch it? And then I would sit with him and I would watch these movies. That's what

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:27.640
[Guest]: I remember growing up. And I suppose, in that moment with my father, I started recognizing

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.440
[Guest]: the power of stories and storytelling and the fact that, you know, they actually bring

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.840
[Guest]: you together in some way or the other. And that's my connection that I made with stories.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: You know, the only time I would ever have with my father was because of movies, because,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.520
[Guest]: you know, we got to sit together and spend three hours while we didn't may not have spoken.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.440
[Guest]: My father would be very excited about the facts of that film. And that's all I know,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.140
[Guest]: but he would never talk about me about feelings and emotions. But like, well, Dev Anand has

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.640
[Guest]: done these many films and Adi Varman has done this and Kishore Kumar has done this and you

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.000
[Guest]: know, but I was getting to spend time with my father, which meant a lot to me. But and

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.960
[Guest]: that was my life. And I started really falling in love with the written word with stories

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.320
[Guest]: started writing when I was very young, when I was about 14. And, and that's where the

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.640
[Guest]: internet came into my life. So from Dubai, we went to Bahrain. And there was a magazine

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.200
[Guest]: in the Middle East called Young Times, which was a part of the Khaleesh Times group over

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:27.640
[Guest]: there. And Young Times was for young writers. And they used to have an arts column in it

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.240
[Guest]: where people used to make paintings and drawings and send them. So my brother was a natural

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.920
[Guest]: artist, you know, so he would draw these beautiful, you know, drawings and whatnot and send them

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.880
[Guest]: and they'd get published. And I would constantly also try to do the same, but they would never

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.880
[Guest]: publish my story. And I mean, my drawings are used to get so irritated, you know, like,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.680
[Guest]: and I was very bad at it. And I would also then, you know, use like a transparent paper

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.160
[Guest]: and copy, you know, a drawing and I clearly they found out that I'm actually it's a plagiarism,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.120
[Guest]: which I now understand. But, but you know, I was just getting so frustrated that my brother

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.160
[Guest]: keeps getting published. I don't keep getting published. I've sent far more entries than

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.960
[Guest]: my brother. So one day I wrote a letter to them, you know, saying that, you know, like,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.480
[Guest]: I have a grievance with you all, you know, as a 12, 13, 14 year old, you, you know, I've

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.400
[Guest]: sent so many different, you know, entries and you never publish it. And they publish

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.040
[Guest]: that letter. And then I was like, well, clearly there's something in my writing that they

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.480
[Guest]: wanted to publish. So, so I started writing more letters to them and they started publishing

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.040
[Guest]: those letters. And eventually, because it was a youth magazine, I kind of, and because

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.040
[Guest]: we had access to the internet, they just had like this email ID. We had got our first computer

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.960
[Guest]: at that time. This is when I was 13. And, and we just got an internet dial up internet

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.040
[Guest]: connection. So I just, I don't know why, but again, sense of ambition, constantly wanting

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.720
[Guest]: to do better. I was like, what if I asked these folks that, uh, what if I could do something

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.600
[Guest]: in Bahrain as a young writer? Can I be their correspondent? Can I, you know, because there's

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.080
[Guest]: a lot of Indian celebrities to come to Bahrain. I was like, what if I interview them? And

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.920
[Guest]: I don't even know where these ideas are. I didn't even know where these ideas came from,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.800
[Guest]: but I was just, I gave it a shot because of the internet and the road back saying, yes,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.200
[Guest]: go for it. And I said, what? And, and that's where my writing career pretty much began

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:25.720
[Guest]: at, at 13, 14, you know, I got published. I've, I interviewed like from Junoon to, you

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:31.420
[Guest]: know, Shankar Mahadevan to, you know, to Michael Schumacher. I have interviewed all of them

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.280
[Guest]: before I was 18 during school years. And actually like spending time with those folks, Mohan

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.760
[Guest]: Lal, I've sat with him. And the internet was the way for me to get to know these people.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.720
[Guest]: To know them as well. I just do intense research on everybody. So when I'd go there, you know,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.440
[Guest]: because I was like, age is against me in that sense, they'd be like, Oh, who's this 13,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.480
[Guest]: 14 year old coming? But like my, I need to make sure that when I ask questions, nobody,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.400
[Guest]: you know, looks down on me. So I just research the hell out of everybody and then go into

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.160
[Guest]: that and, and start asking these questions. So before the internet, I feel like I kind

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.920
[Guest]: of did not, as I think, did not know where to fit in. And when the internet happened,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:16.960
[Guest]: I suddenly kind of found my voice, you know, as somebody who just in the offline world,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.720
[Guest]: because of a certain, I don't know, class hierarchy, a social hierarchy, I was just

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:31.400
[Guest]: always lost, always trying to find, you know, companionship, or true friendship, or authentic

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.480
[Guest]: relationships, which I was just not able to as a young boy. And, and which is where movies

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.600
[Guest]: became important to me. I think because of the internet, then I started finding like,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.160
[Guest]: a reason or an entire world on the internet. That was meant for me that was like, this

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.160
[Guest]: is my community, this is going to be my world. This is where I fit in.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.800
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's very resonant and many things I want to double click on. But first I was

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.960
[Amit Varma]: you just before you told me that you were born in Karnal, I thought of Karnal during

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.360
[Amit Varma]: lunch. And the reason is that I was born in Chandigarh. But so I kind of know Karnal from

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.840
[Amit Varma]: a distance. But the reason is that you were talking about the film you're kind of working

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.840
[Amit Varma]: on, you're talking about one of your projects. And a project that I once abandoned came to

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.640
[Amit Varma]: mind, which was about 12-13 years ago, I decided that I'm going to write the series of three

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.680
[Amit Varma]: really bad pulpy novels, much like Roger Corman films, you know, that kind of feel. And I'm

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.200
[Amit Varma]: going to write each of them in one week. So it's going to be really hurried and bad. And

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.400
[Amit Varma]: one of those was called Karnal in Karnal. And it was about this bunch of boys, bunch

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.360
[Amit Varma]: of guys who want to have a party in this farmhouse in Karnal. And they get a bunch of sex workers

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.120
[Amit Varma]: or a bunch of girls to have it with. And then it quickly becomes a horror film, as these

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.840
[Amit Varma]: women turn on them and eventually murder all of them. And, you know, so it was very gory

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.400
[Amit Varma]: and very whatever I never ended up doing this, because, you know, one thinks of a million

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.080
[Amit Varma]: projects and all that. But, you know, now when you mentioned Karnal, for some reason,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.640
[Amit Varma]: I thought of that. And it's again, women striking back against a patriarchy, right? There's

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.840
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of oppression you're hitting at, which is also the theme of so much of

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:16.800
[Amit Varma]: your work. The first of the things I want to double click on is your what you told me

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.440
[Amit Varma]: the memories you shared with your mother, and even your father, like I did this recent

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.480
[Amit Varma]: episode with Samarth Bansal, you know, very beautiful, deep conversation and where he

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.680
[Amit Varma]: spoke about the expectations he had from his mother. And, you know, he spoke about how

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.480
[Amit Varma]: the day he got his first job, she said that I feel like I have become independent. Because,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:45.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, and, and it was very interesting. And I'm interested in not just that aspect

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.480
[Amit Varma]: of it, but that aspect that in the sense, when we grow up, we often don't think of our

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.640
[Amit Varma]: parents a way we would do later, right? They are playing roles, we are also playing a role,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.720
[Amit Varma]: they are playing roles, they are stuck in that role. We take them for granted. For us,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.720
[Amit Varma]: a mother is a particular role that is being played by someone, a father is a particular

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.760
[Amit Varma]: role. We don't even think of them as real people. You know, recently, my father passed

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.800
[Amit Varma]: last year. So I was looking through old photographs. And I came across a photograph of my parents

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.800
[Amit Varma]: when they were in their early 40s. Right? And it's, it's like, a huge sort of mental

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.960
[Amit Varma]: shift you have to make. Because in that photograph, they're younger than I am now. And they're

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.520
[Amit Varma]: actual, they look like actual real people. And at the same time, I have a memory of them

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.200
[Amit Varma]: as that little boy in the picture, you know, looking at them as people who are in these

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.880
[Amit Varma]: roles, you never really see them as people. And later on, when you you know, you go through

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.440
[Amit Varma]: life, you look back, you kind of understand a little bit more, I think some people may

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.680
[Amit Varma]: go through their whole lives, just playing out roles, never seeing never understanding

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.080
[Amit Varma]: that my mother is someone who might have felt restrained by her circumstances that God knows

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.080
[Amit Varma]: what kind of quiet grief she hid within her as she did as she played her roles, you know,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.200
[Amit Varma]: and ditto for fathers, as you've pointed out, you know, both men and women in different

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:19.480
[Amit Varma]: ways are victims of patriarchy. But I want to ask about sort of this memory aspect that,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, were you clear as a kid at what was happening? Or is this stuff you're beginning

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.440
[Amit Varma]: to figure out in hindsight? And how do you look back on them and post all of that? You

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.560
[Amit Varma]: know, how did your how did your relationship with them evolve? Like, is this stuff that

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.640
[Guest]: you can talk about now at a distance?

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.440
[Guest]: Absolutely. When I was much younger, I obviously did not have an understanding or perspective

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.320
[Guest]: of the roles my parents were playing. I just had a lot of love for my mother, because I

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.400
[Guest]: would see how hard she tries. And not just because of me, and I don't want to I don't

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.240
[Guest]: want to dive too deeply into this part of my life, because it's about my brother. And

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.880
[Guest]: I don't think I'm the right person to talk about his life. But my brother went through

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:11.680
[Guest]: a really long phase of mental health issues, and younger brother, so just really like a

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:20.360
[Guest]: 10 year period where he was depressed. And my mother's worked day and night to, you know,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.280
[Guest]: help him. You know, even even when you were in Dubai Bahrain, you know, again, we were

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.200
[Guest]: not now I think we're in a place where we can easily say that we have privilege. But,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.160
[Guest]: you know, we were, we didn't have enough money to travel through taxi. So my mother would

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:44.000
[Guest]: enroll us in every, you know, extracurricular activity possible. And then just walk us there,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.680
[Guest]: you know, like, so we like 40-45 minutes in the 45-50 degree heat, we would be walking

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.240
[Guest]: from after school from our home to like, you know, tuition that she wanted us to be at

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.920
[Guest]: a karate class, a tennis class, a swimming lesson, which most of which we gave up on

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.160
[Guest]: you're like terrible kids in that sense, you know, but I was very aware that there is an

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.960
[Guest]: effort going into, you know, raising us and, and, and that became even more apparent when

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.440
[Guest]: my brother started going through his issues. And my mother really like just her entire

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.600
[Guest]: life became about making sure my brother is, you know, able to get out of it. We did not

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.960
[Guest]: know at that time it was depression. You know, at that time, we thought that there was, it

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.240
[Guest]: was just, I mean, he's some problem as a child, he's not a problematic child in some way.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.680
[Guest]: And much later, we found out that this is mental health related, because those terms

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.080
[Guest]: did not exist then, you know, so, so, so yeah, I think growing up and then my I was also

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.200
[Guest]: very close to my Maasi, you know, who was like this ray of light who would come like

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.040
[Guest]: again, she's a teacher, she has had a very hard life, she lost her husband, lost her

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.160
[Guest]: parents, single handedly, like took care of her parents after losing her husband very

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.480
[Guest]: early, lost her brother, both my mother, they've lost his elder brother. And she would just

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.600
[Guest]: come in and you know, give us like this. So these gifts she'll bring in, you know, just

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.800
[Guest]: a lot of love, a lot of, you know, care every time she'd come in to meet us. And these two

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.880
[Guest]: women I would, and my Maasi was someone who would, you know, teach at a school. So she

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.800
[Guest]: was a teacher, English teacher at a convent school in Karnal. And one of the most respected

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.560
[Guest]: women in Karnal, even today, like sometimes you go for holidays, and you meet a student

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.640
[Guest]: of hers who comes in, ma'am, you've, you've changed my life and whatnot. It's so beautiful

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.480
[Guest]: to see. So these two strong women, you know, who are doing everything that was that was

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.320
[Guest]: my understanding, like, you know, of of my parents in that sense, or my elders. On the

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.120
[Guest]: other hand, with my father, it was mostly resentment. I was just really angry with him

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.720
[Guest]: that he was not there for me. I'd see some of my other friends, you know, playing cricket

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.400
[Guest]: with their fathers, etc, etc, or hanging out with them, you know, my father had no time

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:02.800
[Guest]: for us. And, and my father also went through his own issues, used to be very angry, which

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.960
[Guest]: I feel like most fathers are, I suppose, now that I've found or now that I've spoken to

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.080
[Guest]: hundreds of 1000s of kids in India, I think that's the pattern, father is equal to angry.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.000
[Guest]: But what he would also go through something which I much later realized was anxiety. So

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.520
[Guest]: he was his he would his again, I feel he would there's a sense of violence, but that was

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.520
[Guest]: to himself versus that anger was taken out on us as well. But never as much as on himself,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:43.920
[Guest]: you know, if I can put it as nicely as possible. So I just did not really like I was just angry

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:50.360
[Guest]: with my father, you know, like I think all young men in our country are. And I wanted to be

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:56.080
[Guest]: the kind of husband. I mean, everything my father's like, I was always like, here's my

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.720
[Guest]: profile of my father, I'm going to be absolute opposite of him in every possible way. I'm

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.360
[Guest]: going to be the best husband, I'm going to be the best son, I'm going to be the best,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.680
[Guest]: you know, brother, I'm going to be the best, you know, caretaker of a home, I'm going to,

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.120
[Unknown]: you know, I mean, I'm never going to go into banking, which he was the absolute opposite

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:21.840
[Guest]: of banking. I was like, I'm not going to be a banker. So if he's outside of India, I'll

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.800
[Guest]: go back to India. You know, I'm everything for me was just like, I'm not going to be

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.800
[Guest]: him. And, and, and again, let me let me point out this that he was never in fact, he was

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.400
[Guest]: never unkind to me. You know, in that sense, like he was, he was not again, with my mother,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.560
[Guest]: he was I think he was just as patriarchal as every Indian man is, let me put it that

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.240
[Guest]: way, you know, which used to get me even angrier, because I'd be like, why are you, you raise

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.600
[Guest]: us, you do all this work in home, why do you still have to like, work for him? You're not

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.400
[Guest]: you don't have to work for him. You can you work for the you're working for your home.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:08.440
[Guest]: I get it, but you have to work for him as well. But, but he was, you know, while and

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.600
[Guest]: and for for whatever it's worth, he's never like, while he's been angry at us, and he's

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.960
[Guest]: might have raised his hands at me and my brother, but he's never like, you know, with my mother,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.960
[Guest]: he's never really been violent in a domestic violence way, you know, and, but he as I said,

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.720
[Guest]: he just had a lot of, you know, anxiety issues, which I much later found out and and seeing

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.560
[Guest]: him, I had a sense of, you know, and I feel very now that I look back, I feel really bad

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.280
[Guest]: about that I used to have a sense of a weak man. It's not a very strong man, you know,

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.180
[Guest]: whereas I feel like it does take a lot of strength for him to break out of the family

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:46.640
[Guest]: that he came from, you know, and go on to his whole family, you know, nobody else has

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.080
[Guest]: been, so to speak successful in his family, you know, he was from Panipat and his parents

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.280
[Guest]: and I mean, both our parents are from, you know, what is now Pakistan, Punjab in Pakistan,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.720
[Guest]: you know, crossed over, grandparents crossed over, one settled in, you know, Karnal eventually

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:07.320
[Guest]: and one settled in Panipat eventually. And, but he broke out of his, you know, he and

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:14.160
[Guest]: he did it on his own. There was no support system. He did like the, you know, the clerk

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.720
[Guest]: exam or, you know, whichever the banking exam is, and then rose his ranks. And now he is,

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.440
[Guest]: you know, chairman at ICC in Bahrain. And, you know, he's spoken at United Nations on

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.320
[Guest]: him. He's one of the biggest names in trade finance, even though he's still like thinks

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:36.560
[Guest]: he's nothing, you know, but it has, it's been very, I mean, much later, I've looked back

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.040
[Guest]: and thought that, you know, I mean, he was much stronger man without the support system.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.240
[Guest]: You know, my, my mother was the biggest support system, but he'd grown up without a system

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.200
[Guest]: which, which then made him so angry at his own life, that all the things that he would

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.520
[Guest]: do or, you know, he just didn't have the emotional quotient that my mother had. And I, earlier

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.160
[Guest]: I used to blame him for him for it. And then after a lot of therapy, I realized that, you

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.520
[Guest]: know, it's not his fault either, is it? So growing up, I had very, you know, clear rules

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.520
[Guest]: of, you know, what my mother's supposed to, my mother is what my father is. But much later

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.840
[Guest]: in life, I have, I was very angry with my father for many, many, many, many years. Now

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.840
[Guest]: I'm not, now I empathize, now I understand, now I feel bad for the way that I've treated

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.520
[Guest]: him as a son, even though, you know, I'm still angry at the way he treated my mother. But

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.480
[Guest]: at the same time, I recognize it's not, it's, it's conditioning. And it's, you know, he

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.480
[Guest]: had anxiety, he had conditioning, he tried so hard to, he's the reason why I have whatever

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.080
[Guest]: privilege I have today. He's the reason why our family has whatever privilege we have

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.200
[Guest]: today. That, you know, and we were good children. And that's a, let me be honest, like my brother

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.520
[Guest]: and I, we never, you know, we recognize that our parents have worked hard to get their

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.960
[Guest]: money. We've never spent up like, never, we didn't even ask for a gift on our birthdays.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:05.520
[Guest]: We were just happy, like being with each other, you know, and, and it's only like in my 30s,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.120
[Guest]: my father has started gifting me things, which has been like a, like, okay, what do I do

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:17.840
[Guest]: with this now? I have an iPad. Thank you. But, but, you know, so yeah, I just, I just,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.040
[Guest]: and on the other hand, when I, my anger with my father also translated to anger with my

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:29.840
[Guest]: mother during my 20s, because, because she wanted me to again, break out of our circumstances

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.200
[Guest]: in some way, she just put a lot of pressure on me, which again, I don't begrudge her for

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:40.280
[Guest]: anymore. But at that time, it just, it drove me into a certain kind of, again, depression,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.960
[Guest]: if I can say so, where I was trying after my, I mean, I'm sure we'll get into that.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:51.560
[Guest]: But I did after, even though I was someone who was writing such, such an early age, you

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.840
[Guest]: know, I remember this very distinct conversation, which is not even a conversation that my parents

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.840
[Guest]: would remember. But we were at our first ever family holiday in life, you know, so after

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:09.200
[Guest]: I finished 12th, my father took us for this SOTC Europe tour, you know, and there was,

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.800
[Guest]: and my father is always this person, which I'm saying he's always also been like, anytime

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.040
[Guest]: I had interviews, he'd drive me to those interviews. So he's also been like, I always looked at

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.960
[Guest]: him in such such a sharply negative point of view that I could never see the efforts

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.840
[Guest]: he made in different ways. But I remember like, again, my father showing off to everyone

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.000
[Guest]: saying my son has written in these magazines, he's interviewed these people, look at this,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.880
[Guest]: look at that, he was 17 at that time. And there's this old couple that he was talking

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.120
[Guest]: to, and the couple said, that sounds so fantastic. So is he going to now, I was in 12th, right?

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.480
[Guest]: Is he going to an arts college? Is he, are you putting him in like Delhi in like something

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.960
[Guest]: interesting? And my mother immediately said, no, no, that's a hobby. You know, that's not

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:51.720
[Guest]: what he will do. He will, you know, be an engineer. And, and he's going to, you know,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:58.440
[Guest]: and do MBA. And, you know, and I was, it wasn't like, it's such a distinct memory for me.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.200
[Guest]: And much later, I remember that it's still something that hits me that I just never had

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.840
[Guest]: an opinion or a decision in what I was ever going to do. It was just decided for me, right?

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.640
[Guest]: Ki yehi karega. Aur maine bhi uss time socha nahi, main ka, main bhi maan gaya tha, yehi

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:20.560
[Guest]: karna hai. I am going to be an engineer, you know. But I mean, I was this, whatever, bright

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.160
[Guest]: kid who used to love writing. And I wish somebody had pointed me in the direction and said,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.760
[Guest]: you know what, do this. But I had to find a different path. I had to finish engineering.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.320
[Guest]: Then I had to leave. I mean, like after that, I got jobs. Told my parents, dekho main, I'm

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.920
[Guest]: capable of getting jobs. After that, I came to Bombay and then started working with Hindustan

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.440
[Guest]: Times at a very, you know, like a terrible, terrible salary for like two, two and a half

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.520
[Guest]: years. Even during that time, my mother would keep telling me and she would say it in the,

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.520
[Guest]: again, from a place of, you know, you're not earning money, you should really like do something

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:57.560
[Guest]: where you're going to be comfortable. But for me, it was always like, you know, have

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.920
[Guest]: some faith in me. I know there's no money right now, but I'm trying to do something

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.720
[Guest]: of my own. You're the one person who's always given me love. Why can't you today show me

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.960
[Guest]: that love and that trust and that support and, and, and just let me be. And that just

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.800
[Guest]: drove like a wedge into our relationship. So for a very long time, you know, I kind

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:25.160
[Guest]: of have this thing where I feel like when you are younger, your parents are always forgiving

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.240
[Guest]: you for like being an idiot. You know, in the middle, there's a time when you grew up

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.680
[Guest]: and your parents stop forgiving you because you're like, now you can't be needed because

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.080
[Guest]: you are, you know, not young anymore. But because your parents have always had a certain

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.240
[Guest]: way of behaving with you, you start, you know, also getting angry. You've always like, why

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.880
[Guest]: not now? I'm so what I'm still your child or whatever. You still say I'm a child, but

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.720
[Guest]: why are you getting angry? So you also get angry back, right? And then you kind of get

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.280
[Guest]: older and then you become the opposite. You become a parent in that sense to your parents

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.440
[Guest]: where you're just like, yeah, they're old and they don't get it as much as we do now.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.120
[Guest]: We need to start forgiving, right? And that's what I think happened after in my thirties

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:08.760
[Guest]: where I've just like, let it all go. And I've really, you know, try to listen to my parents,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.720
[Guest]: try to understand them. As you very nicely said, I've tried to look at them not as parents,

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:19.760
[Guest]: but as human beings and just really felt bad for the way that I was just so angry in my

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.880
[Guest]: twenties with them. I mean, we still, my mother is still very hurt about the way that I talk

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:31.320
[Guest]: about these years because she obviously has done her best to be a fantastic mother, even

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:37.080
[Guest]: though it ended up pressurizing me and driving me into a sense of like real despair that

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: my mother doesn't believe in me, you know, but I can now keep telling her that it's okay,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.960
[Guest]: you know, it's not your fault as well. And you need to be comfortable with that, you

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.080
[Guest]: know, that there was a period that maybe both of us, I mean, all of us are victims of patriarchy

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.560
[Guest]: and none of us knows any better. You know, you can get angry with your parents as much

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.080
[Guest]: as you want, but they've been conditioned to behave in the same way from their parents

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.720
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. You know, everybody has come from the societal conditioning. And

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:08.040
[Guest]: if you are aware today, you need to have the empathy and it's empathy is not easy. It is

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:13.120
[Guest]: a responsibility. It is, it's tough. It's a burden sometimes, but if you don't have

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.840
[Guest]: it, then you know, you're never going to have, you're never going to go beyond anger into

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:25.680
[Guest]: love, into compassion, into togetherness, you know. So I'm just, I'm really glad that

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.440
[Guest]: now I see my parents differently. And I'm just a lot more grateful for what they've

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.840
[Guest]: given me. My father for the long hours, you know, where he just, when I think about it

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.640
[Guest]: right now, I mean, he never got to hang with his son. I, I've always felt like he didn't,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:46.840
[Guest]: my father didn't hang with me. But now I also feel like, well, he as a person, as a human

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.720
[Guest]: being, as a man did not get to hang out with his son. You know, my mother, I would always

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.480
[Guest]: be like, she always wanted me to be this way. And now I'm, I'm looking at it in a different

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.920
[Guest]: way that she wanted some, she expected something from her son, which her son was pushing back

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.760
[Guest]: on. So, so even their anger was valid or, you know, their efforts were valid, you know,

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.920
[Guest]: in whatever they were doing. So, yeah, I feel a little, I feel like a tinge of regret in

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.080
[Guest]: the way that I was in my 20s. But I recognize that, you know, obviously, this is just the

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.120
[Guest]: way life is. And we got to do better now.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.200
[Amit Varma]: There's a lovely anecdote in one of your columns about when you're getting married and you're

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.280
[Amit Varma]: having this destination wedding in Simla, and your mother is, you know, arguing with

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.440
[Amit Varma]: you about some little thing. And you're like, come on, it's my marriage. Why are you arguing

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:37.880
[Amit Varma]: now? And tell me about that. And what I'm also interested in is that you were able to

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.200
[Amit Varma]: after a period of time, shrug off that layer where, you know, they're human beings for

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.400
[Amit Varma]: you, they're not playing a role anymore. So you can see them in that new light and can

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.160
[Amit Varma]: evaluate them in that new light. Were they able to shrug off those layers, not just with

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.040
[Amit Varma]: regard to you, but perhaps with regard to yourself? Like, are these conversations, like,

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.240
[Amit Varma]: everything that we've been talking about, is this a conversation you could have with

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.640
[Amit Varma]: both of them sitting there sitting across somewhere?

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.520
[Guest]: Great question. With my father, not so much. Because my father, he's still like, you know,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.640
[Guest]: I don't know if he'll ever hear this. He totally hears most of the things I do. So I'm also

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.800
[Guest]: now a little worried that he's going to hear this. But, you know, I'd love to have a conversation

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.600
[Guest]: with my father someday, you know, and I want to, I want to just have an honest conversation

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:30.280
[Guest]: with him, just get to know him better. Now, the thing about him, he also talks a lot.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.520
[Guest]: OK, so he's also someone who's very absent minded in how much he speaks. So he speaks

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.560
[Guest]: a lot about his life anyway, but not in a meaningful way. Right. So I may know, I know

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.920
[Guest]: every story of his life a hundred times over, because that's anytime he meets anybody at

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.200
[Guest]: any party, he will repeat those stories. At the same time, I just feel like there's nothing

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.760
[Guest]: I know beyond the surface of these stories. So I'd love to have like a meaningful conversation

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.240
[Guest]: with my father someday where, you know, we can be friends and we can talk about each

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:07.400
[Guest]: other. But, you know, I just feel like he never matured into the EQ that you should

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:14.920
[Guest]: have to be able to have a compassionate conversation with someone you love, someone who loves you.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.680
[Guest]: So he just has just been, distance has been his, and I feel like that's true for all fathers,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:29.320
[Guest]: right? Distance becomes their thing. I don't know what to say, but that's what they're,

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.160
[Guest]: that's the way of life, you know, being distant from each other. You work, I have to work

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.480
[Guest]: on my thing, you work on your thing. And every once in a while we will call each other and

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.680
[Guest]: then I will hand the phone to your mother, which is, you know, like every time my father

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.200
[Guest]: calls me, the first reaction is I get scared. Like, why is my father calling me? Kuch ho

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.720
[Guest]: toh nahi hain, you know, dar la jata hai mujhe. And if he calls me and he's just like, how

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.800
[Guest]: are you? I'm like, why? Like, what happened? That's my question. I don't like, I'm fine.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.280
[Guest]: What? I'm like, what happened? You know, that thing he might sometimes just, so I, I've

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.560
[Guest]: still had that place with my father now after retirement has also wanted to like, give me

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:12.400
[Guest]: a hug. And I'm just like, what? When do you want hugs? When he gives me a hug, when I

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.080
[Guest]: give him a hug, even with somebody who kind of now talks a lot about things like empathy,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.920
[Guest]: I get so uncomfortable. I don't know, you know, when my father gives me a hug, I'm still

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.400
[Guest]: like, I don't know what to do about it. I'm just like closed. I'm like, this is weird.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.120
[Guest]: This is not natural. Even though it should be the most natural thing ever, right? For

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.040
[Guest]: a child to be hugged by their parent. So I feel bad about that. I want, I would love

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.040
[Guest]: to change that. I don't know how to, I'm still struggling with it. On the other hand, with

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.560
[Guest]: my mother, I'm really fortunate that, you know, we have gone through every cycle of

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:47.000
[Guest]: our relationship where we've gotten really angry with each other. I stopped talking to

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.200
[Guest]: her almost for a year in between. And I was so angry with her not supporting me and not

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.120
[Guest]: seeing me go down a path where I was very, and despaired that she wanted me to do an

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:05.360
[Guest]: MBA. I remember like, this one time when I was at MTV, I had, my show was announced at

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.720
[Guest]: 25. I had become the creator and producer, the youngest creator and producer at MTV to

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.440
[Guest]: create a fiction show. I was going to be given that those credits, you know, and for anybody

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.920
[Guest]: who's 25 to get that was just an insane thing in India, you know, and I called my mother

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.800
[Guest]: and I said, you know what, they've announced my show. I'm only producing it. I'm also going

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.760
[Guest]: to be credited as created by, you know, and she heard me out and she's just like, I can't

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.360
[Guest]: forget that. She's just like, that's so good to hear. That's so great to hear. Does that,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:38.920
[Guest]: but does that mean you will not do an MBA? And I'm like, I just told you that at 25,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.280
[Guest]: I am going to be making a show of my own on national television. And your thing is still

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.920
[Guest]: stuck on. But I mean, that's parents, right? Like, and because that's the only way that

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:57.720
[Guest]: she knows that people become successful, because that's the only she's, she just didn't have,

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.520
[Guest]: you know, she didn't have the internet to begin with. And she did not have, you know,

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.040
[Guest]: enough resources would tell her that, you know, there are possibilities outside of engineering

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:13.880
[Guest]: and MBA for a young man to be able to still find his voice and his career and make it.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:21.280
[Guest]: And until I joined Yashraj, I remember like the, for me, the, my greatest moment in life

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:26.560
[Guest]: so to speak is when my mother came to Bombay and I started working in Yashraj and I had

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.480
[Guest]: done pretty well over there. So I'd gotten a cabin and I'd been promoted to GM. So I'd

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.960
[Guest]: got a double promotion, got, became GM at YRF and my mother had come down to Bombay.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.560
[Guest]: So I just asked her to come to the Yashraj office. I took her through, I showed her around

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.240
[Guest]: the whole Yashraj campus, took her then to my floor, you know, got her to come to my

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.920
[Guest]: cabin and said, this is my cabin. And then she entered and I got her to sit down to a

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.480
[Guest]: picture with it. I'm like, are you feeling happy now? And she said, yes, I'm feeling

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.040
[Guest]: very happy. And then I was like, okay, now it's like achieved, tick mark, you know, just

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.520
[Guest]: the fact that my mother is now finally like happy with where I am in life. But at that

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.880
[Guest]: time it was tough, you know, but we went through a lot, you know, we, we, you know, and, and

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.440
[Guest]: I mean, that was how that happened in the marriage, which is a whole other thing that

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.920
[Guest]: has happened, you know, we, there was a lot of misunderstanding between me and my mother

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:23.240
[Guest]: and I, you know, and, but eventually I just started. And again, I think anxiety and therapy

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:32.960
[Guest]: have been like God given gifts to me where I could tap into, you know, a lot more of

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.640
[Guest]: my, you know, empathy or my emotions to be able to look at my family in different lights,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.920
[Guest]: you know, and go beyond the anger, you know, and over the last six, seven years, I have

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.400
[Guest]: had such a beautiful, friendly relation with my mother. She's my closest, one of my closest

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.400
[Guest]: friends, I would say, if not my closest friend, my wife is my closest friend. If she hears

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.760
[Guest]: that I said something, otherwise she'll get angry.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.720
[Amit Varma]: You're getting into trouble with both people.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:06.040
[Guest]: Tough, tough line, but, but she's, you know, and to her credit, she has tried so hard to

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:12.960
[Guest]: kind of be a friend to us. And I've not seen other people of her age or of her generation

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.760
[Guest]: try that hard. She has tried so hard. I am so inspired. And I, I look up to her so much.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.840
[Guest]: She has done everything. She realized that her relationship with both her children was

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.080
[Guest]: getting stuck at a place. We were not, wasn't going beyond that. And she did everything.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:36.000
[Guest]: She said, tell me what I have to do. And she did it. She's like, you know, I mean, all,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.760
[Guest]: all parents, I feel after a certain point, you know, because of the patriarchal conditioning

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.080
[Guest]: and everything, they have these certain, you know, whether they're homophobic, Islamophobic,

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.880
[Guest]: all of these, you know, issues, just conditioned into them. She's gone beyond them. She's like

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.960
[Guest]: tried when you would tell her that this is wrong, she would hear it. We'll say that,

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.360
[Guest]: you know, this is misogynist. She will fight back a little bit, but then she would be like,

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:05.640
[Guest]: okay, explain why. And she's heard it. And she's been, she's, I mean, it's incredible

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.800
[Guest]: the way she has carried herself, the grace, the, she's the light of my life. I'll be very

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.760
[Guest]: honest. She's like, you know, I'm my biggest fear in life, honestly, is that I don't know

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.520
[Guest]: who I'll be when she's gone. I just don't know. I don't know. Like she's, she's really

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.600
[Guest]: carried the family. She's carried, you know, yeah, she's even with all the pressure she

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.400
[Guest]: put on me, I can't, you know, I can't, I'm just far more grateful about the kind of values

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.640
[Guest]: she's inculcated in me. There are still a lot of things in me that I, I do get angry

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:44.400
[Guest]: that, you know, it came from mother, but like, it's, you know, she's done everything to,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.440
[Guest]: you know, compensate for any time she has not been, you know, kind to us or not been

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:56.760
[Guest]: like understanding or a good friend and just a parent in that sense. So, yeah, I'm, you

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.640
[Guest]: know, as I said, in that, during my wedding, like, it was one of those things where, you

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.960
[Guest]: know, we had many things happen, but like, long story short, we had reached that place

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:15.000
[Guest]: where my parents and my wife's parents were just at loggerhead, so to speak, because they're

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.160
[Guest]: from Assam, we're from the Punjabis, just ridiculous things started coming up, you know,

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.080
[Guest]: like, why are we having this in the, they wanted to do it in the daytime, because that's

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.440
[Guest]: how they do it, and we want to do it in the night time, because that's how we do it, you

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.160
[Guest]: know, they wanted non-veg, my parents were like, suddenly, my mother, who's been, while

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.200
[Guest]: my family is now vegetarian and whatnot, but my mother, who would encourage my younger

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.320
[Guest]: brother to eat chicken, because it gives strength, even though I'm not going to eat it, suddenly

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:45.360
[Guest]: I was like, no, we will never have non-veg on our wedding, like, what is this, like ridiculous

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.000
[Guest]: things, so, you know, and I remember, like, things came to such a head that I was just

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.840
[Guest]: again getting really, like, I was very frustrated in my wedding, because I feel like I was,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:01.280
[Guest]: I was getting myself married, like, because my parents anyway live, they don't live in

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.160
[Guest]: the country, so I was just very, again, just my father is just, doesn't know what to do,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.680
[Guest]: he's just like a tourist to my marriage, he's come as a guest, no idea, what's happening,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.840
[Guest]: what's not happening, the whole wedding, the whole location, I got everything done, my

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.480
[Guest]: mother's tried her best, but she also doesn't live in India, beyond a point, what can she

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.160
[Guest]: do, so I was also very, I was like, I'm getting married now, you need to just, you know, I

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:26.560
[Guest]: know that you have more sense and more love than this, you've been a good mother to me,

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.280
[Guest]: why are you making such a big thing out of such a small stupid thing, and then she said

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.600
[Guest]: during that time, the first time I think we've had an honest conversation, where she told

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:41.400
[Guest]: me that, you know, you've always done what you wanted, you've always, and I didn't say

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.200
[Guest]: anything, which is lies, she told me lots of things, but she's like, you finish engineering

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.240
[Guest]: and then you decide to go to Hindustan Times, you've said that you're gonna marry a Punjabi

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.680
[Guest]: girl and then you went and married an Aziz girl, you said you'll not do media, you did

00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:00.080
[Guest]: that, everything has been like against what we wanted, but we didn't say anything, but

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.200
[Guest]: like this is the, and then she said this thing that, you know, again, just has remained in

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.800
[Guest]: my head where she said that, you know, but when it comes to the marriage, right, that's

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.600
[Guest]: the last time your parents get to have a say in your life, after that it's your life, after

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.400
[Guest]: that where will we come, you know, but this is the thing that we get to do, and this is

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:26.280
[Guest]: the last thing we get to do, so, you know, if you're not letting us do this, then like,

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.680
[Guest]: you know, I just feel like I don't have a stake in your life, and I don't know what

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.200
[Guest]: to do as a mother, and I just, that honest thing that happened, and I was just like,

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.640
[Guest]: man, if you had said this earlier, all this wouldn't have happened, so I just said, we

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.280
[Guest]: will do what you want, and then we did everything, I mean, we did everything, we said like what

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.880
[Guest]: functions do you want, I convinced her parents, I just made sure, we did like three versions

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.400
[Guest]: of the marriage, we went to Assam to kind of, you know, to be with Daisy's parents and appease

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.840
[Guest]: her family, went to Bahrain again, did a whole function for my family, in the wedding, we

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.760
[Guest]: said what all we have to do, we will do everything, you just, you know, you want to do this, we

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.080
[Guest]: will do it your way, you know, don't feel like, it means so much to me, everything that

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.640
[Guest]: you have done for me, so, that is the moment I think where I started looking at her not

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.840
[Guest]: as my mother, but like as a human being, and I feel like that's one of the first times

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:21.360
[Guest]: that I realized that, you know, where I have been, you know, I just realized that, you

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:27.840
[Guest]: know, this person's son is getting married, you know, my mother's son is getting married,

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.000
[Guest]: and she should also have a stake in that, right?

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.360
[Guest]: Why am I making such a big deal out of it?

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:38.920
[Guest]: So yeah, I think it's been a journey to understanding my parents, but I'm, yeah, I'm more grateful

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.120
[Guest]: than, you know, regretful of the things that have happened so far.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I was very struck by that, that beautiful story of that conversation and similar because

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.520
[Amit Varma]: it is a rare moment of honesty that, you know, people can't often see themselves so well

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.240
[Amit Varma]: as she saw herself in that moment and was able to express, you know, one of my favorite

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:04.280
[Amit Varma]: phrases in literature, which I think expresses a human condition so well is Thoreau's phrase,

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.800
[Amit Varma]: lives of quiet desperation, right, and I think most people definitely so in all the generations

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.760
[Amit Varma]: before us, live lives of quiet desperation.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think part of that desperation doesn't necessarily come from things like monetary

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.360
[Amit Varma]: circumstances or all those other things.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.160
[Amit Varma]: It comes from just being trapped in a groove that this is a groove that has been laid out

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160
[Unknown]: for you.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:33.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, the man has to be the owner, he has to be the stern man, he cannot show emotion,

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:39.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, all of that and the mother's got a different role and everything you said about

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:45.720
[Amit Varma]: your parents was so resonant with me, I can, you know, recognize all of that.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:52.240
[Amit Varma]: And in general, the great human tragedy has been that the illusion never lifts, the layers

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.320
[Amit Varma]: never go, which is why I was interested if you, you know, managed to speak about them

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:02.480
[Amit Varma]: later about all of this, because I think most of us who get on these grooves and live out

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.200
[Amit Varma]: that quiet desperation, we can't express it, we can't acknowledge it even to ourselves.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And we are passing it on.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:15.240
[Amit Varma]: Like one of my favorite poems by Philip Larkin has these great lines, man hands on misery

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.440
[Amit Varma]: to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.140
[Amit Varma]: And that's such a lovely poetic image, it deepens like a coastal shelf, right.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the poem is trying to convince people not to have children.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:31.200
[Amit Varma]: For just this reason, man hands on misery to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:37.240
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that you've written eloquently about is firstly, these traps of

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.080
[Amit Varma]: getting trapped in these roles.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:45.880
[Amit Varma]: And also the fact that this might be the one generation, you know, especially Gen Z digital

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:52.680
[Amit Varma]: natives exposed to the world growing up on the internet, who have access to other truths,

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:58.600
[Amit Varma]: who don't have to, you know, follow these lanes that are laid out for them by patriarchy

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.520
[Amit Varma]: or by conservative Indian society or any of that.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And you've spoken about this a lot, and I'll put all those links in the show notes also.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:13.760
[Amit Varma]: But I'd also like you to talk about how your realization of this evolved about these strict

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:20.600
[Amit Varma]: roles, these lanes that are laid out, tell me a little bit about how your realization

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:26.560
[Amit Varma]: of this evolved and then going through time, you know, like, because once you realize it,

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.440
[Amit Varma]: you can't unsee it, you know, it's absolutely, it's never unseen again.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And you will see it in every face that you look into, you will see it, right, you will,

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.000
[Amit Varma]: you will hear it in their stories.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:44.880
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that journey for you and what Yeah, you know, so I think, again,

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.800
[Guest]: you know, I saw all of it at home without registering, you know, that this is, I just

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.160
[Guest]: knew that this is wrong, my mother shouldn't be constantly, you know, in the service of

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.920
[Guest]: my father.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920
[Guest]: She should.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:07.920
[Guest]: My mother used to be a professor of economics, even she had an MA in economics at Kurukshetra

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:15.960
[Guest]: University, and then she had taught it to students over there when she was 23, 24.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.880
[Guest]: She's a wonderful painter.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:21.800
[Guest]: She's I mean, she's one of the smartest I'm telling you, she's like, it's insane how multifaceted

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800
[Guest]: she is.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:28.200
[Guest]: You know, tell her anything and she'll do it, you know, I remember this one moment,

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.480
[Guest]: you know, where we were at this really random place called workshop called born to excel,

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.440
[Guest]: where these folks had come to kind of give young people how to the methods of excelling

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.640
[Guest]: or whatever is a summer course that you are getting enrolled in.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.200
[Guest]: And you know, the first time he asked the question, the man over the workshop, and he

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.600
[Guest]: was like, Well, I have a question that if there is a let's see which young person answers,

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.360
[Guest]: you know, and there is a bucket, and in that bucket, there is, you know, a ball, how do

00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:03.760
[Guest]: you take it out without your hand, you know, and, and, and then everybody was like, giving

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.760
[Guest]: all kinds of answers.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.360
[Guest]: Nobody's like, you know, you can't turn it over, or you have to keep it in etc.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.360
[Guest]: And then a mother was the one who's like, when you put water into it, and then it'll

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360
[Guest]: come up on its own.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.640
[Guest]: And, you know, in this case, like, yes, that's the right answer.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.640
[Guest]: Never got this answer.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.240
[Guest]: My mother is so sharp, you know, so she's, she's very creative.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.000
[Guest]: She writes poems at now also, she's like at 66 now.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.440
[Guest]: And she has these wonderful poems for my birthday, she will write a poem and narrate it by my

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.200
[Guest]: wife's birthday.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:36.360
[Guest]: So beautiful, you know, and so yeah, I kind of knew always that, you know, there is, it's

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.360
[Guest]: not right.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:42.240
[Guest]: But, you know, and I just wanted to be the opposite of that didn't realize that genders.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.480
[Guest]: If anybody would ask me, what is identity?

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:49.360
[Guest]: You know, it's a question that now, I think a lot about, especially in the world we live

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:56.040
[Guest]: in right now, how identity has become so, you know, become such a big issue.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.640
[Guest]: And how we have now reframed every, you know, our identities into nationalism, right?

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.360
[Guest]: But when you ask, you know, when we were growing up and you ask, what's your identity?

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.960
[Guest]: You wouldn't I mean, I don't know, Indian was maybe one thing you would say, you know,

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.600
[Guest]: I would say engineer, because all the boys are engineers, you know, be taken in computer

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600
[Guest]: engineering.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.600
[Guest]: That's my identity.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.800
[Guest]: You know, somebody would say a writer, somebody say artist, you know, those were the ways

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.920
[Guest]: that you would define yourself, right?

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.640
[Guest]: I would never think of gender as an identity that like, like when you ask a woman this,

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:32.840
[Guest]: what's your identity, she will say woman, because every day of her life, she's reminded

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.560
[Guest]: that you're a woman through the way our systems are structured, but men are not, would never

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.800
[Guest]: say, although now they are saying because of I think, in a post-media world, every man

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:47.160
[Guest]: suddenly has become more aware of their identity, which is a whole thing, but, but before that,

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:51.040
[Guest]: it was never the thing that, you know, I'm a man that was never it, it was always designation

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:57.840
[Guest]: when I'm a CEO, or I'm a, you know, again, engineer, I'm the owner of these houses, or

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:03.000
[Guest]: you know, I have this much property, your numbers would define your identity, as a young

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.960
[Guest]: as a man, and you think about it, it all comes down to your reduced your worth is reduced

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960
[Guest]: to numbers.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:13.720
[Guest]: It's, it's about how many marks you got, how many trophies you won, how many extracurriculars

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:19.680
[Guest]: you participated in, you know, everything, everything is monetizable, everything is,

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.520
[Guest]: you know, has to have a worth attached to it.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:27.200
[Guest]: You can't even have as a hobby, I remember like when you're going up, and I'd read like

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.680
[Guest]: a lot and you know, and then sometimes we like instead of reading this, why don't you

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.600
[Guest]: read your school textbooks, because that's the way you will get more marks, you know,

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.760
[Guest]: you'd play something, you know, if you're, if instead of doing this, why don't you do

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.980
[Guest]: this thing and take part in this competition.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:46.840
[Guest]: So even a hobby needed to be something that is a is in service of a victory or an achievement

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.900
[Guest]: you needed to have, you know, and then how many of these achievements did you have was

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:56.880
[Guest]: what would define you as a man, then salaries became a thing, then you know, then packages,

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:02.560
[Guest]: CTCs, then the number of houses that you have the number of cars, you have everything, everything.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:08.440
[Guest]: It's all been like a, you know, we've just been reduced to numbers as identities, right?

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440
[Guest]: And we don't think about that.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440
[Guest]: That's just how it is.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.160
[Guest]: That's just normalized.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:20.400
[Guest]: And and but somewhere I kind of subconsciously or unconsciously started recognizing or started

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:24.800
[Guest]: feeling that, you know, everything that I'm going through, as somebody who was fighting

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.480
[Guest]: this idea that after engineering, I don't want to do this.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:35.120
[Guest]: I'd gotten jobs in, you know, I was in NID Gurukshetra, like Mahima, and, you know, I

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.640
[Guest]: was also taking part in all that.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:42.160
[Guest]: So I realized in the first six months that I can't do this.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.160
[Guest]: And that's a very big thing for someone who used to be a really like, I was a good student

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.760
[Guest]: in school, like I cared about computing, computer science, I used to code, I used to enjoy coding.

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.880
[Guest]: And then six months of NID Gurukshetra and while it is somewhat also a reflection of

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.720
[Guest]: the college, while I don't think it's entirely that, I just feel it's just engineering as

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.360
[Guest]: a setup, you know, and you go in there and six months, you're just like, what the hell

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.520
[Guest]: is going on.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.560
[Guest]: And when you realize that you can't do this, then you have three and a half years to figure

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560
[Guest]: out what to do.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:14.720
[Guest]: You know, I feel like that's like a, I always joke and say this that, you know, in the US,

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:20.280
[Guest]: you'd have people would give after 12th standard, you know, to their children, a gap year.

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.480
[Guest]: You go and have a gap year, travel the world, find out who you are.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.480
[Guest]: In India, there is a gap year for boys, engineering college, go for engineering, then you do what

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.960
[Guest]: you want to do in life, right?

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:34.040
[Guest]: So I was, it was that on me, I went there and then I was like, okay, now I have this

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.760
[Guest]: time and I don't want to quit because again, I'm a man, so I can't just quit.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.040
[Guest]: So I will go through this.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.560
[Guest]: I will somehow, I'll do what it needs to pass and I'll do what it needs to get exams.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.960
[Guest]: I know that I'm not interested in this anymore, but what can I do with my time over here?

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.880
[Guest]: So I started, you know, again, doing more writing work, I start, you know, there's a

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:55.800
[Guest]: magazine that I got to be a part of that I created a magazine, a college magazine out

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.560
[Guest]: of the last entity and last version of what it was.

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:05.800
[Guest]: It used to be a paper, you know, like two papers on a wall stuck as that was the college

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.800
[Guest]: magazine culture.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.520
[Guest]: I created a whole, you know, 30-40 pager proper magazine.

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.880
[Guest]: I got into Vishwanathan Anand with Ranbir Kapoor and said like, this is your magazine

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.120
[Guest]: now, like, here's what it can be.

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.200
[Guest]: I used to, I mean, again, with the official college magazine, became the editor like Mahima

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:32.080
[Guest]: as the one after so, you know, and all of and at college, I kind of just did everything

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080
[Guest]: I could.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.280
[Guest]: I took part in every extracurricular thing.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.100
[Guest]: Now it's reverse because I talk about identity also, as I said earlier, you know, I used

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.560
[Guest]: to be someone who is to always be the outside looking in.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:47.680
[Guest]: Suddenly, as somebody who had a little bit of, I mean, I became aware of my privilege

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.680
[Guest]: at that time.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680
[Guest]: So it is a digression.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.160
[Guest]: I'll go back into your question.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:58.440
[Guest]: But NIT Gurushetra is when I immediately, instantly became aware of my privilege.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:04.200
[Guest]: It is a and anybody who knows the way NITs function, you have 50% quota from the same

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.760
[Guest]: state and 50% of the rest of the country.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.080
[Guest]: So there was everybody from every place.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:14.880
[Guest]: And most people were, you know, were not, so to speak, that privileged or, you know,

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.000
[Guest]: that came, came from a certain kind of, and I recognize this on the very first conversation

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.200
[Guest]: I had in a mess, which, you know, I had no idea what is caste, you know, and as they

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.600
[Guest]: say that, you know, if you're upper caste, you don't know what it is, right.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.680
[Guest]: But I never knew and, and I remember the first conversation I had with, you know, someone

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.120
[Guest]: in the mess and the boy said, I asked him, like, what do you do, I mean, which, which,

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.520
[Guest]: you know, where are you from, he said, Panipat, oh great, I'm from Karnal, great, something

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.520
[Guest]: in common.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.280
[Guest]: Then like, what are you doing over here?

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.720
[Guest]: I'm doing engineering, computers, he's doing whatever electric, electronics, mechanical,

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.160
[Guest]: okay, fine, you know, we'll not the same thing, not the same course, but whatever.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.600
[Guest]: And then I'd asked him, and this is my always my regular normal follow up question, what

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.280
[Guest]: does your father do?

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.840
[Guest]: That's just the question that everybody asks, you know, or at least I assumed that, because

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.520
[Guest]: I was always asked to me.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.560
[Guest]: And you know, when I was in Dubai and Bahrain, and that's how we kind of like, what does

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560
[Guest]: your father do?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.000
[Guest]: You buy my father is working here, my father's working there, whatever it is.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.560
[Guest]: And here the answer was that, well, he's works, he works in a garage.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.240
[Guest]: In my, you know, my upper caste mind, I was just like, oh, he owns the garage.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.200
[Guest]: He's like, no, no works in it.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.160
[Guest]: And then I was like, in my again, I can't fathom I'm just like, so, like, does he

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.960
[Guest]: have like this car, big cars, and he works with big cars and because he's like, no, he

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.760
[Guest]: repairs bicycles.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.280
[Guest]: And I was suddenly I was like, wait, what?

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:49.080
[Guest]: Like, you know, I mean, it was such a big that everything I used to feel about class,

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.640
[Guest]: you know, before I came, because I was the one outsider looking in into these rich folks

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.400
[Guest]: in these schools, where everybody where they would talk about like, what do you do after

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400
[Guest]: class?

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.280
[Guest]: So I have like a, you know, I have an instructor who comes in to play the, you know, piano

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
[Guest]: and teach me the piano.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:13.160
[Guest]: Whereas I had like this one keyboard, you know, I was like, yeah, I play basketball

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
[Guest]: with my friend.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:21.480
[Guest]: At that time, whatever we didn't have that many courts, you know, it was like, you know,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.560
[Guest]: and even the reference point they would have of English films, I started watching English

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.680
[Guest]: films much later.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.920
[Guest]: I was always Bollywood, I was like, what are these reference points I just didn't fit in.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.560
[Guest]: And suddenly I realized now my reference points were suddenly like, not the same as the ones

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.600
[Guest]: and most people in NID Kurukshetra.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.360
[Guest]: And that privilege that that sense of that understanding immediately, you know, it was

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:51.960
[Guest]: now like, suddenly I was the guy in NID Kurukshetra who was who was from the outside, whereas

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.720
[Guest]: like people would look at it and again, that's, I mean, it's sad or I don't know what it is,

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:04.000
[Guest]: but a lot of kids would just kind of, you know, give me respect purely because I knew

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.120
[Guest]: English well, or they would talk to me with a certain sense of like, I didn't get bullied

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.280
[Guest]: as much.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.160
[Guest]: I mean, when I say bullied, I didn't get ragged as much, you know, in college, well, I got

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160
[Guest]: bullied in school.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160
[Guest]: It's a different story.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.480
[Guest]: But in college, I didn't get ragged because people were just like, this guy's an NRI and

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.400
[Guest]: he's well spoken.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.600
[Guest]: And I would dance and I would take part in cultural activities.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.920
[Guest]: And suddenly I was like, oh, he's a cool kid.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.720
[Guest]: And because I was nice and just I'm able to talk to people were just like, you know, affable

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.880
[Guest]: to talk to people were just like, you know, okay, let's let him go, let's not say anything

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.880
[Guest]: to him, whatever.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.240
[Guest]: So my privilege also saved me from where all the other kids from my batch would get beaten

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240
[Guest]: up.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.000
[Guest]: They'd have, you know, half their faces, you know, with blue marks and whatnot.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.840
[Guest]: I was so I just started recognizing.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.360
[Guest]: So I've had this really bizarre incidents in NID Kurukshetra where, you know, I'll tell

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.360
[Guest]: you a funny one.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.920
[Guest]: And, you know, it'll also give context to some of the conversations that, you know,

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.880
[Guest]: we're having on gender.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.480
[Guest]: The first and this is a true story, okay.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:16.440
[Guest]: The first day I was in a classroom in NID Kurukshetra and people were asking where all

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.800
[Guest]: teachers would ask you, tell your roll number, where you from, etc, etc.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:28.120
[Guest]: So I said, like, you know, whatever roll number 20, 25 and I was from Bahrain and somebody

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.760
[Guest]: said little later, a girl said they're from Dubai.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.760
[Guest]: I said, oh, cool.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.920
[Guest]: So after the class, I went to the girl, I said, you're from Dubai, I'm from Bahrain,

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.240
[Guest]: we should like, you know, exchange numbers or whatnot, right?

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.760
[Guest]: She was sitting next to a girl, you know, who was from Faridabad.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760
[Guest]: And I said, where are you from?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760
[Guest]: She said, I'm from Faridabad.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760
[Guest]: I said, great.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.040
[Guest]: So can we have like, can I have your number also, we'll just keep in touch.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.880
[Guest]: And now she gave the number, but I thought that she was a little hesitant.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.280
[Guest]: Now in my head, you know, like, in Bahrain, all the boys and girls, we all used to talk,

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.240
[Guest]: there was never like a whole thing, which I never realized that NID is like a big thing

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.080
[Guest]: for a guy to ask a girl a number and like, take it and whatnot.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
[Guest]: I didn't realize all of this, okay?

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.760
[Guest]: At night, I have to go, I'm in my room.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
[Guest]: And there's a knock.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.760
[Guest]: We used to live it to first year, live it to roommates, there's a knock on my door.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:21.080
[Guest]: I open the door and there's this big Haryanvi Jat guy, you know, with his four or five other

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.200
[Guest]: all well built, strong, good looking folks.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.960
[Guest]: And then he just aggressively asked me, look, what do you think he is?

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.440
[Guest]: I'm like, who are you?

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440
[Guest]: What happened?

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.440
[Guest]: I'd never seen him before.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
[Guest]: Maybe I've seen him before, but I don't know his context.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.000
[Guest]: He's like, do you think he's Bond?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.360
[Guest]: I'm just like Bond, I'm thinking chemistry, covalent bond, you know, I'm like Bond?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.360
[Guest]: And he's like, do you think you're James Bond?

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.760
[Guest]: I was like, no, bro, what are you talking about?

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.080
[Guest]: He's like, will you take a girl's number?

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.120
[Guest]: And I'm just like, first of all, I didn't even recognize, he's like, how did you take

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120
[Guest]: her number?

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120
[Guest]: I was like, okay, what happened?

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:02.080
[Guest]: He's like, do you know that the girl from Faridabad, one of the guys said the girl from

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.600
[Guest]: Faridabad is his girlfriend.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600
[Guest]: Do you know that?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.720
[Guest]: I was like, I had no clue, you know, how would I know?

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.920
[Guest]: And I'm okay, delete the number, man, I was just being friendly, I'm not like pursuing

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.160
[Guest]: her or whatever.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.760
[Guest]: So he's like, delete number, delete the number, delete it, you know, he's like, don't you

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.760
[Guest]: don't mess with the girl from Faridabad, I'll come and beat you up.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760
[Guest]: That was his whole thing.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.280
[Guest]: And all these guys gave me like, this is your last first and last warning, you know, and

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.840
[Guest]: I was like, dude, sorry.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.400
[Guest]: And I was like, I'm a coward, no, I'm from Bahrain, I have a whole cushioned life, suddenly

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400
[Guest]: in Bahrain, etc, etc.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.200
[Guest]: I was a big fat kid, you know, who also wore these loose clothes, I was like fully like,

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200
[Guest]: what's happening to me?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.480
[Guest]: So I said, sorry, sorry, please delete the number, I'm not a hero, please go away.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.360
[Guest]: So he went away.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.840
[Guest]: And then sometime and I was just like, my roommates were like, my roommates were also

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840
[Guest]: from the Middle East.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.280
[Guest]: So we kind of had figured out, okay, let's live together.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:55.040
[Guest]: And they were also looking at me like, you know, do you not realize that, you know, in

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.080
[Guest]: this place, etc, etc, you can't be so open with girls, you know, people like, you have

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.360
[Guest]: to be really smart about it, I was like, okay, I'll try and be like really smart about it.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.640
[Guest]: And then sometime later, this guy comes back.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640
[Guest]: And this time he's alone.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.760
[Guest]: So I was like, bro, forgive me, I didn't know, I did not realize that.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.200
[Guest]: He's like, you tell me, how did you get your number?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.920
[Guest]: And I'm like, I mean, how did you get it, I said, sorry, he's like, no, no, I'm asking

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920
[Guest]: how did you get it?

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920
[Guest]: Explain it to me.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.560
[Guest]: How do you get a girl's number?

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:27.480
[Guest]: I said, what do you want to do, you know, he's like, I want her number, but she's your

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.480
[Guest]: girlfriend.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.560
[Guest]: And his actual words were, but don't tell her, she's my girlfriend.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.800
[Guest]: I'm like, what is going on in this college?

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.960
[Guest]: So I said, well, I just asked her, man, you have to just be like polite and like, she

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960
[Guest]: gave it.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.480
[Guest]: He's like, explain it to me.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.480
[Guest]: And somehow during then, I mean, this was the first such incident.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.440
[Guest]: And from that point, for whatever it's for, whatever reasons, the Haryanvi kids who would

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.160
[Guest]: not very well fit in with all the other kids from different states.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.240
[Guest]: And there was a lot of rivalry and I mean, you know, a lot of anger, a lot of fights

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.480
[Guest]: that have happened in our college, etc.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:08.240
[Guest]: For whatever reasons, I got a little bit of respect because I, again, maybe polished or

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.600
[Guest]: whatever in Polish, when I say again, not in a, in just the way that I would speak a

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.640
[Guest]: certain way, I was like a, which was, which was this understanding of what, what it meant

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.960
[Guest]: to be, what, what your Indian society needs you to be after a certain point of time.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.760
[Guest]: So I was a prototype of like, this is what happens after four years of engineering college.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:40.840
[Guest]: And somebody who is already knows English, already has, quote unquote, self confidence,

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.920
[Guest]: already can talk to girls, already can like write, you know, so and, and for whatever

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.680
[Guest]: it's worth, I was not an asshole, you know, and that was something that, you know, everybody

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.320
[Guest]: found like a very unique thing about me, whereas other NRE kids typically were seem to be as

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320
[Guest]: assholes.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.640
[Guest]: I mean, no offense, but that's just how it was.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.720
[Guest]: And so suddenly, all the boys, Haryanvi boys kind of also gave me the liberty and the respect

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.000
[Guest]: to kind of talk to them, whenever there was something that they were doing wrong, they

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.640
[Guest]: would come to me to ask me about like, you know, aise kaise karte hain, aise kaise karte

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.640
[Guest]: hain, very generously.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.840
[Guest]: And I really like respect that, that, you know, there were people who would ask ki jana,

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.000
[Guest]: ab mujhe ladki saath, I need to ask her out, how do I do it?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.640
[Guest]: And you know, and I'm just like, I've had one girlfriend before this, I'm not like a,

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.600
[Guest]: I'm not hitch, you know, mujhe ithara bhi nahi bata, I'm right now, I was, you know,

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.840
[Guest]: going through a heartbreak, theek hai, but whatever, I'm helping.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.960
[Guest]: On the other hand, whenever there was somebody who would be rude, obnoxious, inappropriate,

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:44.600
[Guest]: which I saw a lot of, I saw so many young boys, just be filthy with girls.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.960
[Guest]: And in their heads, that's just how they thought.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.480
[Guest]: You know, you flirt, unko lagta tha, flirt karna hota hai ki ladki attitude rakhti hain

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.800
[Guest]: na, to as a boy, what you need to do is you need to call and give them gaalis.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.480
[Guest]: To gaali deke na, to usko, apne aap jo na, wo bole ki usko samajh aata hai ki ladka bhi

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.280
[Guest]: na, uske andar te se zyada attitude hai.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.680
[Guest]: Aur jab baat chal jayega ki you have more attitudes, wo pighal jayegi, and then she'll

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.600
[Guest]: be like, okay, this is the guy I want.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.640
[Guest]: Because this is the guy who'll protect me, because he has more attitude than me.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.160
[Guest]: This is the way they used to think.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.320
[Guest]: Girls would change their phone numbers, they would find a new phone number, leak it, and

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.080
[Guest]: then everybody would have, everybody would call in, everybody would send these insanely

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.520
[Guest]: dirty messages, and I would watch this with horror.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.840
[Guest]: I'm like, how are you doing this, right?

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.360
[Guest]: And again, none of this right now coming from a place where I didn't know what feminism

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.360
[Guest]: is or whatever it is.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360
[Guest]: Just, I thought it's just human decency, right?

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.920
[Guest]: Like, don't be such an asshole.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.840
[Guest]: And I'd go up to, like, these kids.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.680
[Guest]: And again, I'm not just saying that they are only from Haryana, they're all kinds of places

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.800
[Guest]: that people would become, who would giving me that respect of like, ki theek hai, tum

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.800
[Guest]: mujhe bol sakte ho.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.360
[Guest]: I remember this one time where, like, this guy said, in, in a, in a truth or dare game,

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.760
[Guest]: among a classroom, in a canteen, asked a girl to say, what is your bra size?

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.080
[Guest]: And I was like, how?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.880
[Guest]: And I just got so, I was so irritated, I was like, shut up.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.280
[Guest]: That's not what you say.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.120
[Guest]: And then it became awkward and like, whatever, you know, and then later also, he didn't say

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
[Guest]: anything to me at that time.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.600
[Guest]: Raat ka again, he came to me, he's a different guy, came to me in the night, he says, dekh

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.720
[Guest]: mai teri aizad karta hu, tu jo bolega, main sununga.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.640
[Guest]: Tu mujhe samjhayega na, ki yeh nahi karna chahiye, main nahi karunga.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.360
[Unknown]: But agli baar, tu ne kiske saamne mujhe shut up bola na, toh wahin dhar doga tujhe.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.240
[Unknown]: I was like, but theek hai, chalo, sun toh liya na, aur kuch maara nahi.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.400
[Guest]: So I've come very close to getting beaten up by these guys, but just somehow just been

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.400
[Guest]: let off.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.240
[Guest]: But I understood like there is, you know, and in that college is where I got the first

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.680
[Guest]: sense of like, the deep, deep patriarchal conditioning that happens.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.120
[Guest]: And you know, again, they were not, these are not evil people, right?

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.320
[Guest]: They were not, it's not that they were bad human beings.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.560
[Guest]: It's just that that's how they were conditioned.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.640
[Guest]: Most young boys that I've met at that time, from whichever part of the country, unfortunately

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.000
[Guest]: had a certain idea of what women are and what women should be and, you know, what we should

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.440
[Guest]: be doing with them and how we should be thinking of them.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.880
[Guest]: And again, I'm not saying that I was not, as a, you know, young horny teenager, even

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.080
[Guest]: I used to objectify girls as a teenager, etc.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.040
[Guest]: But at the same time, I was not like, I just felt like this was way too extreme, ki theek

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.400
[Guest]: hai tum, you're thinking about them and talking about them with your best friend, like, oh,

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.760
[Guest]: I like this girl and whatever.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.760
[Guest]: That's one thing.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.960
[Guest]: But like, you know, getting as part of a community, people used to watch porn together, yaar.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.120
[Guest]: That was the weirdest for me, like, poor community, 6 log, 10 log na saath mein aate na porn saath

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.840
[Guest]: mein dekh rahe hain, ek kamadi ke andar hai, I'd just be like, kaise kar rahe ho tum, yeh

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840
[Guest]: kya chal raha hai?

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.800
[Guest]: So I was just, I was an alien in that world.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.280
[Guest]: I would just be like, this is, this is weird.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.960
[Guest]: But I realized that there are certain gender dynamics, you know, and again, the understanding

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:44.320
[Guest]: of privilege that I had, that clearly there is, you know, something that I seem to have

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.760
[Guest]: an understanding of that others don't.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:54.480
[Guest]: And maybe, you know, I can try in whatever manner to help, you know, without looking

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.240
[Guest]: down, without having judgment, without shaming anybody who thinks like this, just try to

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.000
[Guest]: talk them, talk to them and help them understand what, why, what they're doing and why they're

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
[Guest]: doing it is wrong.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.920
[Guest]: I again did not know what this is conditioning the society, yeh sab mujhe nahi pata tha.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.440
[Guest]: Just as a, you know, again, just as a, I would say a decent person, a decent human being

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:19.000
[Guest]: who later when I realized was, had that, like empathy is also privilege, you know, I genuinely

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: feel that.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.880
[Guest]: I feel like, you know, having that awareness of, of, you are not born quote unquote, you

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:34.880
[Guest]: know, with again, I, I, I'm using this word again and I, and I want to use it in those

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.080
[Guest]: setting of those quotes, sophisticated, you know, that there's an idea that every, you

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.040
[Guest]: know, parent has for their young Indian child that, you know, if you wear a certain kind

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.440
[Guest]: of clothes, if you have a certain kind of a way of speaking, if you know English in

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.480
[Guest]: a certain way, if you, you know, your hair is done in a certain way, if you, if the,

01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:02.020
[Guest]: that's what a sophisticated young Indian boy should be like, you know, and it was, and

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:06.640
[Guest]: I started recognizing that this is where earlier I used to look at maybe other kids like that,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.600
[Guest]: that he is more sophisticated than me, now I understand that people are looking at me

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.760
[Guest]: and saying that I am more than them, so where I was feeling misfit there, I was feeling

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.440
[Guest]: misfit here too, but in a very different way, where I was fully aware of the class and caste

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.560
[Guest]: privilege that I had without knowing these terms at that time, and that's where I think

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.400
[Guest]: in many ways my, you know, understanding of gender really started from, and then, I mean,

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.000
[Guest]: I started dating a girl over there and the kind of shit that, you know, we've gone through

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.640
[Guest]: in college, I can't get too much into it beyond the point again, because it is my wife's story,

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.800
[Guest]: I don't want to, but we went through some really horrible times in college where, you

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.480
[Guest]: know, there were rumors spread about us and whatever it is, just really nasty stuff, and

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.560
[Guest]: I was just, I just couldn't understand why would, you know, why would society behave

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.480
[Guest]: in this manner, you know, what have we done to any of you, like, where is this coming

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.600
[Guest]: from, why would you say something so shameful and so hurtful about other people, you know,

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.240
[Guest]: when it comes and break it down into, well, this is what a man does, this is what a woman

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.520
[Guest]: does, so clearly there is something here, like, where is this, what is happening, so

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.680
[Guest]: the culture only, I just kind of, so where I was fitting in from a lens of, you know,

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:24.120
[Guest]: where I was finding myself at ease in a bunch of people who are definitely who I seemed

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:28.440
[Guest]: closer to, in terms of like, if I would have never gone to the Middle East, these are the

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.720
[Guest]: kind of kids I would have exactly been like, right, so I was a little bit more comfortable

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.220
[Guest]: and at ease with my friends over there than I've ever been with anybody in the Middle

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.220
[Guest]: East.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.960
[Guest]: At the same time, after a point of time, because of the cultural differences, you know, that

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.000
[Guest]: because I'd spent that time there, I still started realizing there's a big vast difference

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.640
[Guest]: in the way everybody's been conditioned, where my conditioning allowed me to have the privilege

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.040
[Guest]: of looking at, you know, people beyond the lenses of gender and as human beings, and

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.720
[Guest]: as stories, and versus as like, you know, this is a boy, this is a girl, this is what

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.480
[Guest]: they do, you know, I just, with everybody else, there was a very clear divide, and in

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.080
[Guest]: that divide, boys behaved in a certain way and girls behaved in a certain way, and it

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.320
[Guest]: was, it was a divide.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.480
[Guest]: So I went through some really tough times, again, there's just some stuff that I'd rather

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.920
[Guest]: not get into, but, you know, in college, and then when I got into Bombay, again, it was

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.040
[Guest]: like a whole shift, Bombay, now, I've been in Kurukshetra for 4 years now, and if a girl

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.440
[Guest]: is sitting at a place, where a guy comes and sits next to her, they'd be like, oh, that

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.520
[Guest]: guy likes that girl, literally, you like her, you've sat in the same seat as she's at, like,

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.280
[Guest]: what is this, what, what are you talking about, Mahima spoke about like the, the hostile

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.800
[Guest]: time, you know, times, right, like, I used to feel so terrible about the fact that, you

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.640
[Guest]: know, like, I get to be in that college, and at the very minimum, I mean, I didn't go to

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.680
[Guest]: the library much, let me be honest, but you know, the fact that there are people who had

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.600
[Guest]: access to the library throughout the night, you know, till 12 o'clock, and girls had to

01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.040
[Guest]: 5.30, 6 o'clock, go back to the, never had, like, you know, the liberty or the freedom

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:06.240
[Guest]: to explore, you know, outside of just the X number of hours they were, you know, in

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.320
[Guest]: college, and it was just so unfair, you know, the whole system I had to drop and I was also

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.360
[Guest]: coming from a place, I like this girl, why do I have to drop her at 6 o'clock, I want

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.320
[Guest]: to spend more time with her.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:20.120
[Guest]: But yeah, but and then I came to Bombay, and then suddenly, like my, I was in an HT, where

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.720
[Guest]: I was one of two guys and in a, in a team where everybody else was a woman.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:30.040
[Guest]: And suddenly, like where I had been fighting a certain kind of patriarchal conditioning

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.920
[Guest]: and misogyny and in the way that things were structured in Kurukshetra, it was the absolute

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.000
[Guest]: opposite over here.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.360
[Guest]: And then I had to, again, rewire and kind of be like, Acha, now I can't think like that.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.960
[Guest]: I need to think in a different way, again, I need to like, you know, be more comfortable,

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.880
[Guest]: I was not comfortable for the longest time, I couldn't hug girls, it was such a it became

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.720
[Guest]: such a big issue for me, like, it became so awkward, I just did not.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.000
[Guest]: I don't I just don't know, like people girls would come and hug every, you know, everyone

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.320
[Guest]: in like, in Bombay, this is very cool, and your friends and doesn't matter, right.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.400
[Guest]: But I was just at freeze, I'd be like, wait, you know, someone's guilty, someone give me

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.680
[Guest]: a kiss, I just be like, what the hell happened?

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.600
[Guest]: Because four years of Kurukshetra conditioned me that deeply to like, look at it as like

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.840
[Guest]: a problem, you know, and if you have your own girlfriend, you have your own partner,

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840
[Guest]: that's one thing.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.960
[Guest]: But the moment you are in a, you know, system of people, you have to have boundaries.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.120
[Guest]: So all of this really ultimately came down to two things.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.880
[Guest]: It's a long winded answer, but two things have happened.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.560
[Guest]: One is, as I said, and again, I think we might get deeper into it was mental health, you

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.160
[Guest]: know, which is at 30, I got I was diagnosed with clinical anxiety.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:51.200
[Guest]: And a lot of my therapy ultimately ended up being about gender, you know, my till that

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.200
[Guest]: point, I had never thought of my identity as a man ever.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.040
[Guest]: You should ask me what I said, I could have given you x number of answers, but the answer

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.600
[Guest]: would never be a man.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.040
[Guest]: And in my in my therapy sessions, I realized that everything that had happened in my life,

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.080
[Guest]: every decision that I had made was because I was a man.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.120
[Guest]: Every decision I'd made wasn't for no other reason.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.080
[Guest]: The reason that I had to go to engineering college was because I'm a man.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.720
[Guest]: The reason that I had to, you know, it was such a big fight with me and my parents, when

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:27.200
[Guest]: I had to, you know, be when I had to take up something else outside of engineering when

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.840
[Guest]: I had to take up Hindustan Times MTV, you know, my parents wouldn't understand because

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.520
[Guest]: I was a man because they had a certain and I had to do MBA, I've studied, I've given

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.800
[Guest]: CAT, I've given GMATS, you know, I used to get up at four o'clock every morning after

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.320
[Guest]: point in time while I was studying, working at Hindustan Times to go to and to do mock

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
[Guest]: tests and whatnot.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.040
[Guest]: Because I was just like, I don't know, I was in despair.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
[Guest]: I didn't know what else to do.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.680
[Guest]: I was like, I'll do my work.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.040
[Guest]: And in that work for that matter, just to tell you again, at 22, 23, I've interviewed

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:01.280
[Guest]: everyone Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, A. R. Rahman, you name

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.880
[Guest]: it, all the big folks at 22, 23, I've done it.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.960
[Guest]: So I was outperforming everywhere.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960
[Guest]: But there was never enough.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.960
[Guest]: It was never enough.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:14.240
[Guest]: It was always about the fact that if you do MBA, you'll get this much money.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.400
[Guest]: So I realized that so much, even though now I was, I'd come to Yashraj and I'd got

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.240
[Guest]: a bunch of, you know, touchwood success at YRF, where I was in a very comfortable position.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.040
[Guest]: I'd gotten everything that, you know, there's a middle class checklist, you know, you shouldn't

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.560
[Guest]: have a designation, you shouldn't have a cabin, you know, you shouldn't have so much money

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.120
[Guest]: in the bank, you shouldn't have a car, etc.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.240
[Guest]: I'd got all of that and that was by 30.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:42.640
[Guest]: And then when I reached there, the question then came to be like, now I've done it.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.920
[Guest]: Now what?

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.960
[Guest]: And I couldn't, I didn't have an answer.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.480
[Guest]: Because what happens when you hit those milestones that you've been trying to hit all your life?

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480
[Guest]: There is no answer.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.320
[Guest]: There are, there's just more milestones to go to.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.440
[Guest]: And then I was just like, is that it?

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.600
[Guest]: There's this quote, I think, I don't know who it is by, right, like, I hope, say it's

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:04.720
[Guest]: by Jim Carrey that, I don't know if it's by him, but that I hope everyone gets the fame

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.560
[Guest]: and money, all the fame and money that they want so that they know it's not the answer,

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.560
[Guest]: you know.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.240
[Guest]: So I did get whatever, you know, level of what I wanted, the middle class checklist.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.600
[Guest]: And then I realized that I'm unhappy still.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.600
[Guest]: I'm not happy.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.200
[Guest]: In fact, my unhappiness, after all the legitimate success that I was seeing with my work at

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:30.520
[Guest]: Yash Raj, I was just, I felt like I was in a machine, in a simulation where I'm every

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.880
[Guest]: morning getting up, going to work, you know, in this traffic, you know, sitting in my desk,

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.240
[Guest]: working on something that somebody else, a corporation, even if it was Yash Raj films

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.200
[Guest]: that I have the best time working there, I was still working on something that somebody

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.440
[Guest]: else might want from me.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.560
[Guest]: There is, I was doing it in the service of getting somebody else a certain amount of

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.200
[Guest]: money for an ambition that somebody else may have had somewhere.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.600
[Guest]: What was I doing for myself?

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.600
[Guest]: What was I doing?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.960
[Guest]: You know, did I even know what myself is?

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:05.200
[Guest]: You know, do I even know, like, if I didn't have, if I didn't just run from one milestone

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:11.640
[Guest]: to another, if I didn't just go from one day to the next without ever having, I don't think

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.160
[Guest]: Amit in my entire life, I have quote unquote chilled on a weekend in my entire life so

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.160
[Guest]: far.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.440
[Guest]: I used to fill my Sundays and Saturdays up.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.840
[Guest]: I'd go teach on the weekends, you know, in Jai Hind, in Churchgate, you know, because

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.160
[Guest]: I was like, weekends are for, you know, I mean, I have time, what am I going to do with

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
[Guest]: this time?

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160
[Guest]: I need to fill it up with more work.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.520
[Guest]: I was at one point when I was working at Yash Raj, I was writing an open magazine, I was

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:38.280
[Guest]: writing a Sunday Guardian, I was teaching at Jai Hind, I was hosting a show from Film

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:43.720
[Guest]: Companion, I was programming from Mumbai Film Festival, I was writing something for Scholastic

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.160
[Guest]: every year, 80 things I was doing and still I continue doing even though now I have a

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.720
[Guest]: better sense of it, but it's so hard, I'm scaling back now Sundays I don't work at all,

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.120
[Guest]: but it's so hard, I still get anxiety on Sundays because I don't know, you know, I feel like

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.040
[Guest]: am I, what am I doing in that time, I need to make it productive, productivity has to

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.200
[Guest]: be the most important thing for me, you know, why, why can't I just relax?

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.080
[Guest]: I realized every one of these things came down to being a man, you know, every one of

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.360
[Guest]: these things came down to gender and that just really frustrated me because I was like,

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:20.120
[Guest]: I just, because the one thing that I didn't want to be was a man because of my father

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:26.400
[Guest]: and you know, again, I'd grown up all these years angry at him because he was quote-unquote

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.680
[Guest]: a man who was, you know, not a good, who's not a father, who was not a husband, who's

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.040
[Guest]: not a, was just a man, just earning for his and just constantly and I was doing the same

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040
[Guest]: thing.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.600
[Guest]: When I was making my first show, I remember like, I, for two years, I did not speak to

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600
[Guest]: my friends.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.360
[Guest]: I did not spend time with my family.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.520
[Guest]: You know, my brother and I stopped talking because I was just so, it was like, if the

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.480
[Guest]: show fails, where will I land?

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.480
[Guest]: What will my life be?

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.680
[Guest]: It had become such a big thing that this cannot fail and it failed very spectacularly, which

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.560
[Guest]: was again, and I realized much later that what I went through after that a year after

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560
[Guest]: that was also anxiety.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.080
[Guest]: I just didn't have the terms for it.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.980
[Guest]: But at 30, when I started going through anxiety, when I was doing well, which was the next

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:13.640
[Guest]: new thing, right, like I, my understanding of mental health was that when you are going

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.960
[Guest]: through, it happens when you're going through a low phase, I was going through the best,

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:24.400
[Guest]: best phase of my entire life and I was unhappy and I was empty and I was sad and I just,

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.280
[Guest]: and I was anxious as I used to have panic attacks.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:35.960
[Guest]: I used to, you know, I got the opportunity like the, to go for, I mean, started then

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.120
[Guest]: there was, there's a event called goalkeepers that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.120
[Guest]: hosts in New York in 2017.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.280
[Guest]: I got the opportunity to go as an India delegate, they call 300 emerging leaders from across

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.280
[Guest]: the world.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.720
[Guest]: In that first year, Barack Obama was the keynote speaker, Justin Trudeau was there, Malala

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720
[Guest]: was there.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.720
[Guest]: It was insane.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.080
[Guest]: I was invited as a gathering of that people as, as far as you and I are sitting, I was

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:03.600
[Guest]: that far, you know, just a little further from Barack Obama and, and I had so much anxiety.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.800
[Guest]: I was, I was shaking every day, I couldn't wake up in the mornings because I was like,

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.360
[Guest]: they will find out that I don't know shit.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.840
[Guest]: They will find out that, you know, I'm an, you know, I'm, I'm not as, I don't deserve

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.000
[Guest]: to be here.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.720
[Guest]: I had, I had to go to, I had to go to therapy like three times a week in the week that I

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.440
[Guest]: was going to, I would have anxiety about everything.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.280
[Guest]: I remember the day this event was happening, I was in New York for the second, I mean,

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.120
[Guest]: the first time I'd done it with my brother, with the second time ever, and I was, I was

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.400
[Guest]: in a hotel and I was, and I couldn't get up in the morning.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.760
[Guest]: I just, I had such a massive, the first time I realized that this is what a panic attack,

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.480
[Guest]: I mean, later much later I realized, I thought I was having a heart attack.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.400
[Guest]: I was in the bed, I couldn't get up.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.720
[Guest]: My heart was, it, it was all over.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.440
[Guest]: I just, I thought this is it, this is, I'm, this is it for me.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.440
[Guest]: Like it was so bad.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.880
[Guest]: And my first thoughts always just come down to, I wish I'd told my mother my e-banking

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.960
[Unknown]: passwords as if there was a lot of money there, there's nothing there.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.560
[Guest]: But those are the thoughts that used to come to my, my head.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.320
[Guest]: But it was just, I was like, this is it for me.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.560
[Guest]: I'm going to die in a hotel room in New York.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.200
[Guest]: You know, it's a nice room, but like, I'm going to die here.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.720
[Guest]: And then somehow after like 15, 20 minutes of trying to deal with it, I caught up and

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.400
[Guest]: then it's like, okay, I'm still alive somehow, went there.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.160
[Guest]: But like the questions that started at that time was just like, what is the point of this?

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.980
[Guest]: Why am I doing this?

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.960
[Guest]: Why does any of this matter?

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.920
[Guest]: And these are larger existential questions that I think everyone at some point goes through

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:42.520
[Guest]: for, but for me, it really came down to the fact that my entire life was just me leading

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.600
[Guest]: a story that was given to me by somebody else that was given to me by society, not even

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: my parents and society and parents were given to a society, right?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.280
[Guest]: So I was just following the society's narrative of what a life should be like.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.080
[Guest]: And every fight that I had, every, every day I was angry, my relationship with my father,

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.760
[Guest]: my relationship with my work, my relationship with my mother, my relationship with my wife,

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.560
[Guest]: everything, every single thing was, you know, colored with patriarchy.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.360
[Guest]: And I tried my best to be the best possible husband to my wife.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.480
[Guest]: I was like, you know, so if the only time I started having weekends or caring was in

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:26.000
[Guest]: Yashraj, people were like, you're the only person in Bollywood who doesn't pick up phones

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
[Guest]: on Saturdays and Sundays.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.840
[Guest]: I was like, I'm married, I'm with my wife, I don't want to do it.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.640
[Guest]: Because I wanted to be the opposite of my father.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.260
[Guest]: So I was just like, I'm not going to be him.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:42.200
[Guest]: So I'm going to constantly just give myself that, you know, that space to be a good husband.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.680
[Guest]: But in trying to balance being a great person at work and being a good husband, again, it

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:52.680
[Guest]: was just I was giving anxiety to myself, because I was just trying to fight the narrative throughout

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.920
[Guest]: without realizing I'm fighting it.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:59.960
[Guest]: And then therapy and clinical anxiety when I broke, so to speak, and it got really bad.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.680
[Guest]: And again, it was so much stigma, because again, when in 2015, 16, who knows who was

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.940
[Guest]: pocket speaking on mental health, you know, especially among men.

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:14.120
[Guest]: So I just didn't have so much stigma, but finally, my brother, because he had gone through

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.800
[Guest]: his own mental health issues, recommended and said, like, you should try a therapist.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.800
[Guest]: It's okay.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800
[Guest]: It's not a big deal.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.800
[Guest]: Give it a shot.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.080
[Guest]: What's the worst that can happen?

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.280
[Guest]: And I did go and and then yeah, my life changed after that.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:32.320
[Guest]: Because after that, I every session, I mean, it took me a few sessions.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:39.840
[Guest]: But like the the the defining session for me happened when one day after three to four

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.800
[Guest]: months of therapy, my therapist said, I know you want to I figured your problem, I said,

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.200
[Guest]: what is wrong as I figured it out, finally, all the and my head was like, if I need to

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.400
[Guest]: pass it, that's how you're thinking all this money, money, number number.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.720
[Guest]: So I said, Okay, tell me what's my problem.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.680
[Guest]: She's like, you're not very emotional.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.120
[Guest]: And I got so offended in that sense, I was like, I am not emotional as in my head as

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.000
[Guest]: like, what a waste of money the last three months has been, do you not know who I am?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.480
[Guest]: I write long posts, you know, on empathy, and I am like, I cry when I watch movies,

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.280
[Guest]: you know, I'm the most emotional person that I know, how could you say this?

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.280
[Guest]: I was so offended.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.240
[Guest]: And she's like, I knew you're going to react like this, you know, but let me explain what

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.240
[Guest]: I mean.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.320
[Guest]: And she gave me this example.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.120
[Guest]: She's like, what happens when your wife has a bad day at work?

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.680
[Guest]: And she comes home after that.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:31.160
[Guest]: I said, she comes and rants about it, talks to me about it, and then we might just, you

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.880
[Guest]: know, go and unwind by watching a movie or whatever.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.080
[Guest]: She says, what happens when you have a bad day at work and you go home?

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.360
[Guest]: I said, I'm different from my wife.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.520
[Guest]: I don't like talking about, I want to keep my work life and my home life separate.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.240
[Guest]: I don't like talking about or ranting about, I don't want to burden her with all of this.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.720
[Guest]: And she looked at me and smiled and she's like, you and every man in India.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.920
[Guest]: I said, and she's just like, every man does this.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:01.720
[Guest]: Every man thinks that, you know, emotions are for a woman to express, but a man should

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:07.080
[Guest]: just take that burden on himself and keep his work and private life separately.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.160
[Guest]: And because burdening someone, the burdens are only for us to take.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.800
[Guest]: By telling, giving it to somebody else would be burdening them and we just keep it inside.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.360
[Guest]: And one day, you know, we burst, whether it's through panic attacks and anxiety or through

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.960
[Guest]: heart attacks and, you know, just death, right?

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.200
[Guest]: And he's like, that's what I said, what I meant, you know, you can write about emotion,

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:32.160
[Guest]: you can intellectualize emotion, which I still do, but you don't, you don't allow yourself

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.160
[Guest]: to feel it.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.000
[Guest]: You don't allow yourself to express it.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.320
[Guest]: And I was like, oh shit, what has she said?

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:47.280
[Guest]: And she's just, and in that moment when she said, this is what men do, I was like, I'm

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280
[Guest]: a man.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280
[Guest]: Oh shit.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.240
[Guest]: I thought till this point, I just didn't know.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:58.200
[Guest]: And from that time, every single thing that I have done, you know, I have seen gender

01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.200
[Guest]: in it.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.920
[Guest]: I have not been able to unsee gender after that.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.400
[Guest]: It's been my whole life after that.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:10.880
[Guest]: You know, every space I'm in, I'm so aware of gender, every space I'm in.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.080
[Guest]: I can't be in a room where there are too many men and not see that there is no woman here.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.880
[Guest]: Or there's only one woman here.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.160
[Guest]: I can't see it.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.560
[Guest]: And, and which is why also in my company, for example, in you are right now, 26 people

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.280
[Guest]: about 69 women.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.160
[Guest]: So it is, it was my most, I mean, at first I wanted to make sure that let's have like

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.440
[Guest]: equality and let's have equal gender.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.320
[Guest]: And then after that, honestly, like the most talented people he found for the vision of

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.960
[Guest]: women only, which is great.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:44.440
[Guest]: But you know, but it was, but I can't like, now I just, I know like how, how badly, there's

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:50.920
[Guest]: this beautiful line that I read, there was a Angelina, Angelica Abraham, I forget her

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920
[Guest]: name.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.920
[Guest]: I'm so sorry.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:32:01.240
[Guest]: She's a, she's, she's, I mean, she's a politician now, which is also she writes about gender

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.400
[Guest]: and she works on gender and she's Angelica, I think her name is.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.160
[Guest]: And she hosted a workshop on gender and, and I just joined it.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:14.080
[Guest]: I wanted to, and again, I was one of two men out of 50 women over there.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.720
[Guest]: And in that there's this wonderful thing that, you know, it's a great course, if you guys

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:21.040
[Guest]: find it, please, you know, go and be part of it.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.160
[Guest]: It was gender leadership and gender.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:29.440
[Guest]: So there's a great quote that, that I found there and that I cannot ever forget now, which

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.940
[Guest]: is that patriarchy oppresses every gender, but benefits and benefits the men, but it

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.520
[Guest]: also oppresses the boys that they once were.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:44.000
[Guest]: And this learning that when you were a boy, you've never ever thought that you could be

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
[Guest]: oppressed, right?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.440
[Guest]: I don't think like it's wrong as, as someone who claims to be a feminist, I can't, I would

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:55.240
[Guest]: never say that boys have been oppressed as, as, uh, you know, when they were younger,

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.240
[Guest]: how are you oppressed?

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.240
[Guest]: We are benefited from gender, right?

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.640
[Guest]: We've benefited from patriarchy, except the fact that, was it right for me to not go into

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.800
[Guest]: arts and go into engineering, isn't that also a certain kind of oppression when you put

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:12.320
[Guest]: this idea that, you know, it is benefiting them later.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.920
[Guest]: But in their minds, the toxicity that comes from thinking that there is, you know, uh,

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.240
[Guest]: that's the only way to be the narcissism is the only way to be being the king is the only

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:24.240
[Guest]: way to be.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.000
[Guest]: Every man should be the man of the house is the only way to be, you know, I think that's

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.720
[Guest]: also, and it's fairly, it's correct, right?

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.800
[Guest]: Like that's also patriarchal.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:39.200
[Guest]: It is, it is, it is a patriarchal oppression, oppression where, where every boy has to be

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:47.560
[Guest]: a certain version of a man as, as early as possible, otherwise their life is pointless.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.600
[Guest]: You know, because I work so much with education also, and with, you know, I was shocked to

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.840
[Guest]: learn and find, and this happened in my roadshow, which I'll also talk about at some point,

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:04.080
[Guest]: I'm sure, but it, I was shocked to find that the students who said rates among boys in

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:10.200
[Guest]: our country is like three times the rate of girls and, and it's earlier, it was shocking

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.200
[Guest]: to me.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.920
[Guest]: Now it's not surprising after I've been on the roadshow, met all the young people across,

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:20.600
[Guest]: you know, because every boy seems to be just lonely because they don't know the, the one

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.160
[Guest]: big and then again, it's been a very long answer, but I'll try and end it here.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.160
[Guest]: But one of the biggest things that I've learned over the last few years about gender is that

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:35.160
[Guest]: here's what has happened, right?

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:42.480
[Guest]: For a certain kind of a young urban woman, and I'm not saying across, you know, I know

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.440
[Guest]: intersectionally it's not been that case, but for a certain kind of a young urban woman

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:54.800
[Guest]: or an upper class woman or an upper caste woman, feminism has been a, has been introduced

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.960
[Guest]: into their lives, whether it is through the internet, whether it is through friends, whether

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.080
[Guest]: it is through communities online, whether it is through mentors, whatever, which has

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:08.480
[Guest]: created these wonderful positive spaces that they have, where they get encouraged.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.080
[Guest]: This is also what I learned on the roadshow, right?

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.000
[Guest]: On the roadshow, every young woman would come and talk about gender, you know, what they

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
[Guest]: were going through because of the gender.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.960
[Guest]: But at the end of it, they would always point out, look at that, because of that girl, I've

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:20.960
[Guest]: survived.

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:21.960
[Guest]: Look at my friend over there.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.960
[Guest]: I just want to give her a shout out because of her today I'm here.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:30.640
[Guest]: Every young woman, you know, because of, sorry, because of feminism, because of like the girl

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:37.760
[Guest]: tribes that they have, have found these safe spaces where they are not alone anymore.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.620
[Guest]: They are learning from each other.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:45.620
[Guest]: It's not easy to be a woman in any way, but there is a community today that is helping

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.900
[Guest]: any woman who wants to beat the patriarchal system and break out of it.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:55.720
[Guest]: You know, there is lots of resources, feminism overall, and it's again very difficult.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:01.360
[Guest]: I'm in no way saying that it's easy, but there is support while this is happening.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.320
[Guest]: And while suddenly women have started recognizing that, you know, they don't need to be, and

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:09.680
[Guest]: again, no offense to anybody who still chooses to be a homemaker, but they don't need to

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.680
[Guest]: be homemakers.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.200
[Guest]: They have a choice now.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.560
[Guest]: They can go and work.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.000
[Guest]: They can go and, you know, they can choose not to have children.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.320
[Guest]: They can choose to do whatever they want with their bodies, which is obviously the, which

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.040
[Guest]: should have always been the case.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.640
[Guest]: But now they realize that it's a choice.

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.520
[Guest]: It's not a necessity.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.520
[Guest]: It's not the, this is the story they were given.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:31.520
[Guest]: The story that every young woman in our country has been given is that your life's mission

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.920
[Guest]: statement is to get married.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920
[Guest]: You have to get married.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.320
[Guest]: And because you get married, you are, all your life has to be in the service of that

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.320
[Guest]: goal.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.040
[Guest]: When you don't get a good guy, your life has no meaning.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.240
[Guest]: Marriage is your life's purpose.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.320
[Guest]: And having a kid is your life's purpose.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.120
[Guest]: And food is your life's purpose because the mission statement is only about getting settled.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:54.960
[Guest]: And Kanyadaan happens, one man hands you over to another man.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.040
[Guest]: And that's your, you know, life, you know, it's in the service of men.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.200
[Guest]: You're never a woman.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.520
[Guest]: You're always a daughter, a wife, you know, a sister, but you're never a woman or an identity

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.120
[Guest]: or a human being.

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.040
[Guest]: On the other hand, but now that feminism has happened and women have kind of found out

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:17.680
[Guest]: about this, they are supporting each other and getting, you know, and recognizing these

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.960
[Guest]: setups and these traps.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.360
[Guest]: On the other hand, during the same time where girls are now saying, I don't want to get

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.000
[Guest]: married at an early age.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.320
[Guest]: I don't want to, you know, sit at home and cook and, you know, just have children, which

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:37.400
[Guest]: is again for those who choose to do it short, but it's a choice as I said, they are choosing

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.760
[Guest]: to go against every patriarchal conditioning, etc.

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.040
[Guest]: But at the same time, no boy has been told that what you have been doing all your life

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.880
[Guest]: is also patriarchal.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.280
[Guest]: There is no tribe for boys.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.040
[Guest]: There is no positive community for boys.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.320
[Guest]: Every avenue that exists for men is toxic.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.360
[Guest]: Every community on the internet for boys, 99% of them, I would say are toxic communities.

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.680
[Guest]: They're not about empathy for men having empathy for themselves or having empathy for others,

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:10.080
[Guest]: but about why women is your enemy, because today women is more quote unquote woke.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.360
[Guest]: So you know, the power is going away from men.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.280
[Guest]: So it's all toxic communities that are conditioning into men that women are the problem or feminism

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.420
[Guest]: is the problem when it's not the problem.

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.680
[Guest]: Feminism is actually for everyone.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.880
[Guest]: But unfortunately, again, it's been weaponized by a lot of online communities to say that

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.400
[Guest]: it is only for women and men don't benefit from it.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.080
[Guest]: But then actually, if women are, if women are choosing to work, what that means for

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.720
[Guest]: men is that you don't have to earn as much.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.040
[Guest]: You don't have to, you know, work that hard.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.440
[Guest]: You can also spend your life and have an actual work life balance.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.080
[Guest]: You can spend time with your son.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.760
[Guest]: You can spend time with your parents.

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.840
[Guest]: You can have hobbies, which you were probably not allowed to have when you were younger,

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.080
[Guest]: because you were told your entire life has to be just about work.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:57.120
[Guest]: But in every way that a woman benefits, a man also benefits, you know, by the burden

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.720
[Guest]: becoming lesser.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.840
[Guest]: But men don't know this because no one's talking about it and no community is there to support

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:09.920
[Guest]: men to a positive safe space community saying that, you know what, it's okay if you wanted

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:17.320
[Guest]: to be a writer or an artist or a, you know, guitar player or a chef or a stand-up comedian

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.400
[Guest]: or an Instagram model, whatever.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.300
[Guest]: It's okay.

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:28.520
[Guest]: Even if that doesn't lead to the same amount of money you get after engineering an MBA

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.520
[Guest]: because guess what?

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.880
[Guest]: You will have now a partner who will and both of you will equally contribute in your household.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.680
[Guest]: You need to learn cooking, not because it's a woman's duty or in not a man's, but it's

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.440
[Guest]: a great skill to have a life skill to have for anybody.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.800
[Guest]: Everyone should learn to cook.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.720
[Guest]: What is it's a great thing you when you go to host when you when boys go to hostels,

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.600
[Guest]: they're completely like, I don't know what to do in my life, you know, because mothers

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.000
[Guest]: think that boys don't need to be.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.800
[Guest]: And again, unfortunately, it is mothers because fathers are never at home.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.720
[Guest]: So again, that's so much patriarchy, so much gender conditioning and all the largest problem

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.240
[Guest]: now is that girls have understood and have found a community and they're, you know, getting

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:13.160
[Guest]: smarter, evolving into better versions of, you know, what they could be, whereas boys

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:18.400
[Guest]: have not been told this and nobody's creating any positive spaces for boys.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.040
[Guest]: Nobody's having empathetic conversations with boys.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.920
[Guest]: So boys are getting angrier because they are just thinking that because of feminism, girls

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.920
[Guest]: have gone the other side.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.920
[Guest]: But what about us?

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920
[Guest]: I did everything.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.920
[Guest]: You told me to do engineering.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.920
[Guest]: I did it.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920
[Guest]: You told me to do MBA.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.920
[Guest]: I did it.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.880
[Guest]: But now that I want a girl who wants to marry and sit at home, she's saying I won't.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:34.880
[Guest]: Why not?

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.960
[Guest]: Why did I do all of this?

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.640
[Guest]: Then I could have just at 14 decided to be a writer and not having to do all of this.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.720
[Guest]: So that resentment and anger now, unfortunately, is being taken out on women.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.760
[Guest]: And that is why they have so much toxicity on the internet.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.840
[Guest]: That is why you have so much anger in the streets.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:54.200
[Guest]: That is why you have so much, I mean, everything that women go to a country which seems to

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:59.800
[Guest]: be even more right now is actually happening because, you know, boys are just absolutely

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:00.800
[Guest]: clueless.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.920
[Guest]: They've been lonely.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.720
[Guest]: And now that loneliness has turned into anger and resentment because nobody is trying to

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:11.560
[Guest]: have sensitive conversations about gender with them, saying that now we live in a world

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:18.040
[Guest]: where it's also okay for you not to be the version of a boy or a man that Petra K tells

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.120
[Guest]: you to be.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.760
[Guest]: It is okay to not hustle as hard.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.440
[Guest]: It is okay not to work as hard.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.520
[Guest]: It is okay to have hobbies.

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.800
[Guest]: It is okay to have work-life balance.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800
[Guest]: It is okay to cry.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.800
[Guest]: It is okay to, you know, just spend time, you know, without being productive.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:38.400
[Guest]: It is okay to, you know, not want to, you know, harm yourself because you're failing

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.760
[Guest]: in an exam.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:45.800
[Guest]: It is okay to fail in exams and do something else apart from engineering and MBA.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.280
[Guest]: Every one of these things is okay.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.000
[Guest]: It is absolutely okay.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.120
[Guest]: You don't have to try so hard.

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.960
[Guest]: You don't have to be so hard on yourself.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.080
[Guest]: And that anger is also the anger historically we see with all our parents.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:05.600
[Guest]: Why are most of our fathers angry or violent or alcoholic?

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:13.600
[Guest]: Because for the same reason, they've just buried it all inside without having any avenues

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.840
[Guest]: to express.

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.520
[Guest]: Anytime they were expressed, anytime they would express, they would be looked down upon.

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:23.520
[Guest]: I told you that I thought my father was weak because he used to, you know, I thought he

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.960
[Guest]: was weak because he was going through anxiety.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.480
[Guest]: And I used to look at it as, you know, whenever he would talk about it, complain about it

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:34.400
[Guest]: or go through something, I would just, I would look, you know, what kind of a man is he?

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.040
[Guest]: Because that was what was conditioned into me that boys can't, every time I would have

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.480
[Guest]: a scrape, you know, somebody would come and tell me, you're crying like a girl.

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.880
[Guest]: You know, now if girls cry and boys don't cry, and now I can't cry and I can't have

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.240
[Guest]: an healthy outburst of emotion, and I'm always going to be looked down upon as a sensitive

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.720
[Guest]: boy just because I'm crying, then I'd much rather not cry.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.720
[Guest]: And that becomes toxic.

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.400
[Guest]: And that becomes, that turns into anger.

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.880
[Guest]: And that turns into, you know, whatever you see in the world right now.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.480
[Guest]: So it is, we need to have these conversations.

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.360
[Guest]: I'm so grateful to therapy.

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.960
[Guest]: I'm so grateful to anxiety.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:15.280
[Guest]: I'm so grateful to my own mental health issues for leading me to a place where today I can

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.960
[Guest]: I recognize these patterns in my own life.

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:25.280
[Guest]: I'm trying as hard as possible to overcome any of the toxicity inside of me that still

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.920
[Guest]: remains as a product of patriarchy.

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.080
[Guest]: And I am dedicating a lot of my life to having these conversations about gender with all

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:41.560
[Guest]: genders, you know, with women, men, and other genders to kind of tell them that you don't

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:45.560
[Guest]: have to be defined by a single story that patriarchy gives you.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.840
[Guest]: You can have any story you want.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.800
[Guest]: You know, you need to fight back against patriarchy, you need to fight back against it.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:55.840
[Amit Varma]: These are such incredibly insightful and inspiring points.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And I want to read out this lovely para from one of your pieces, where you wrote, quote,

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.320
[Amit Varma]: it is tragic that we live in a world where even as patriarchy benefits men, it first

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.320
[Amit Varma]: oppresses the boys they once were, the boys who could have grown up not necessarily to

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.720
[Amit Varma]: be engineers or doctors or MBAs, but perhaps poets and artists and dancers if they were

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.560
[Amit Varma]: allowed to be the boys who could have grown up, not necessarily to constantly and continually

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.480
[Amit Varma]: work for money, but perhaps be present fathers and husbands, the boys who could have grown

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.280
[Amit Varma]: up without a stigma against feeling vulnerable, punishing any perceived weakness through violence,

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.600
[Amit Varma]: but perhaps be kinder and gentler to the world around and to themselves, stop quote, and

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.920
[Amit Varma]: the story from your engineering college about you know, you asking for that girl's number

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:41.920
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, that reminded me of a story, a friend of mine told me in Hyderabad recently,

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.440
[Amit Varma]: which ends in a great line.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.480
[Amit Varma]: So I've always remembered it, which is that basically, he was in an athletic delegation,

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:52.480
[Amit Varma]: so he had gone for some sports event to Haryana, one of these Haryana towns, perhaps even Karnal.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.360
[Amit Varma]: So there, there was also a local girls team or whatever, he got talking to one of the

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:00.080
[Amit Varma]: girls and they were friendly and they hung out and all.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And that evening in the place where they were staying, a bunch of Haryanvi boys came and

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.040
[Amit Varma]: they beat him up, because one of those guys had been trying to put out the girl and the

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.760
[Amit Varma]: girl wasn't giving him line of day.

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.200
[Amit Varma]: So they beat him up.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And they beat him up and they go.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.640
[Amit Varma]: And then like in your case, that boy comes back.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And this guy is like, what you've already beaten me up.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.520
[Amit Varma]: And the guy just looks very sad and you know, and then he looks at him.

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:30.200
[Amit Varma]: And he brings his face close to him and whispers, daagi toh laal hai, right?

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And just the way it was said, daagi toh laal hai, I remember it for that reason.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:40.080
[Amit Varma]: But it's also very poignant, because the boys who beat up this boy, like you pointed out,

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.080
[Amit Varma]: they are also trapped.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.560
[Amit Varma]: They're also victims.

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.680
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, that like you so wisely said, women now have the tools and the language

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and the frames to understand this.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, they may not always have the privilege or the circumstances to act upon it.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.440
[Amit Varma]: But the language is there, the frames are there, they can understand it, they can understand

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.440
[Amit Varma]: what's happening to them.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And they can, you know, even if they can't always fight it effectively.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.820
[Amit Varma]: It's there out there.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.760
[Amit Varma]: But for men, it is not there.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Men have no clue.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.440
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Sringda Poonam many years back when this was a shorter show on

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.440
[Guest]: her lovely book, Dreamers.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And there she spoke about how while girls throughout small town India are asserting

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.600
[Amit Varma]: themselves, the boys are just confused, boss.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.600
[Unknown]: Kuch samajh mein nahi aa raha hai.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Kuch samajh mein nahi aa raha hai.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, what role, you know, when we look at why society is the way it is, you

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.320
[Amit Varma]: know, one of the really interesting points you made, which I want to ask you about, is

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.600
[Amit Varma]: the role of popular culture.

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Because typically, one looks at popular culture as a reflection of society.

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And the point you made, boss, here it works as much the other way.

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:55.920
[Amit Varma]: That popular culture can actually shape society.

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:02.240
[Amit Varma]: And our popular culture is really all about toxic masculinity, like Bollywood kya hai

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:03.240
[Unknown]: yaar.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.800
[Amit Varma]: Bollywood is basically about, you know, to romance a girl there is basically to stalk

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.360
[Amit Varma]: her and harass her and so on and so forth.

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, the men are entitled and the women eventually give in.

01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So, is there kind of change happening?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Because very clearly, in terms of women, in terms of the material available to them, the

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.880
[Amit Varma]: frames available to them, the language available to them, at least the change is out there.

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.640
[Amit Varma]: But in terms of men, it's still the great unseen.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Most men can live their entire lives without thinking of themselves in any way, as victims

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600
[Amit Varma]: of this.

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Like earlier, you mentioned about how on day one, you know, when you had that conversation

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:44.520
[Amit Varma]: with that friend of yours whose father or dad worked in a garage, that a layer fell

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.080
[Unknown]: from your eyes that you see your privilege, class ka.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you spoke about how women always have the awareness that they are women, right?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's true.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Most men don't realize that women are walking around with an extra layer of awareness ki

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.720
[Amit Varma]: raat ko walk ke liye jaana hai, so you have to think, you enter a lift, you're looking

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.080
[Amit Varma]: at everybody else.

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.360
[Amit Varma]: You always have that extra layer of awareness in your head, which men don't, right?

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.920
[Amit Varma]: And one conclusion from that, which is true, is that it's a better world for men, obviously,

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.440
[Unknown]: but you don't need that layer, right?

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.540
[Amit Varma]: But the other conclusion is that there is another layer about what being a man is doing

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.120
[Amit Varma]: to us, and we don't see that.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:29.640
[Amit Varma]: So you know, do you feel that through all your traveling and your work, and we'll talk

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.140
[Amit Varma]: about all of that in detail, of course, later.

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:37.840
[Amit Varma]: But just as a broader question, do you feel that this is changing in any way?

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.700
[Amit Varma]: What is the role popular culture is playing?

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:43.160
[Amit Varma]: Is popular culture letting our society down?

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.040
[Guest]: What is your sense of this?

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:51.400
[Guest]: So I again talk a lot about this in my talks, you know, I have for a very long time, I wondered

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.960
[Guest]: why does India not have like superhero universes, right?

01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.200
[Guest]: Superhero kyu nahi hai India gandhar, mallabh you had one Krrish and you had like one, you

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:04.600
[Guest]: know, Drona and you know, you had two three like Ravan, but like you've never had that

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.480
[Guest]: culture which is so prevalent in Hollywood, right?

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.720
[Guest]: Why is that the case?

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.520
[Guest]: And I've been, you know, kyu nahi banti itni, kyu nahi banti itni?

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:20.280
[Guest]: And then at some point it struck me that the reason we don't have superheroes in India

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:27.640
[Guest]: is because every man in every film plays a superhero because he's an Indian man.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:31.080
[Guest]: You don't need superheroes in India, you have Salman Khan, you don't need superheroes in

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.640
[Guest]: India, you have Rajinikanth, you don't need superheroes in India, you have Tiger Shroff.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.640
[Guest]: What do you need?

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:44.680
[Guest]: They are what super, what RRR, why is the world flipping over it because you know where

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:52.200
[Guest]: you have to put a, you know, X amount of VFX logic into why Captain America can take a,

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.560
[Guest]: you know, has a super strength and has a backstory where he's become so strong that he can now,

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.960
[Guest]: you know, hold a, you know, or Spiderman has to go through a spider like a whole thing

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.240
[Guest]: of becoming strong and then can stop a train.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.440
[Guest]: Here, you know, in RRR, you just have to be an Indian man and you can take a tank and

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440
[Guest]: throw it to somebody.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.440
[Guest]: You can take a motorcycle and throw it in someone's head.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.920
[Guest]: And that's just something that people are flipping out, but that's been the narrative

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:21.000
[Guest]: always that Indian men don't need to be, you know, you don't need to have a spider biting

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.880
[Guest]: you or a secret serum that turns you into a super soldier or like having gadgets like

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.920
[Guest]: Iron Man to become, you know, strong and, you know, inhumanly powerful.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.080
[Guest]: You are inhumanly powerful anyway because you have an Indian man.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:37.680
[Guest]: And the problem in front of you is that somebody has taken the girl that you like away, you

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.040
[Guest]: know, and that's what an Indian woman is supposed to do.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:45.800
[Guest]: She's the damsel in distress where an Indian man has to, Indian man has to save the girl,

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.120
[Guest]: save the day, save the world.

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:50.720
[Guest]: The Indian woman has to be saved.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:58.280
[Guest]: And during this entire time, you know, her trajectory is just waiting to be saved.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.560
[Guest]: And then in the middle, for some reason, dancing like that's the ways that, you know, Hindi

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:06.040
[Guest]: films have been constructed for the longest time.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:12.960
[Guest]: So, you know, and we are the only society, again, can you imagine, like we call hero,

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:17.280
[Guest]: like the lead actor in a movie, a hero, right?

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.680
[Guest]: It's nowhere in the world do you call the lead actor, the hero of the film, he's a hero

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.520
[Guest]: of the film because he's a hero and, and, and he's a superhero.

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.280
[Guest]: That is why you're calling him a hero.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:34.160
[Guest]: And then, and you know, why do you have, you know, films which are called as female led

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.400
[Guest]: films in our country now, that this film is a female led film, Tapsee leads this film,

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:44.600
[Guest]: Bhoomi Pednekar leads this film, Anushka Sharma leads the film, it's a female led film.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.280
[Guest]: Because the premise of Indian films is that there will be a hero.

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.040
[Guest]: And the moment you don't have a hero, you have to warn the audience that there is no

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.040
[Guest]: hero in this film.

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:59.960
[Guest]: In this film, women are leading it and women are not heroes in the minds of like filmmakers

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.360
[Guest]: or the Bollywood or the industry at large, right?

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.120
[Guest]: A woman who is fighting a circumstance, but a man is a hero.

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:11.960
[Guest]: So heroine means someone who's going to dance and be saved, but otherwise you are a women

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:12.960
[Guest]: led film.

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.560
[Guest]: So can you imagine like the even the nomenclature of how we talk about, you know, the vocabulary

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:23.680
[Guest]: we use when we talk about, you know, cinema and we talk about are the people who act in

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.040
[Guest]: films, item numbers as an example.

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:34.360
[Guest]: Even now, man, can you imagine that you have, you call it that, you call a dance number

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:40.000
[Guest]: with a girl in a skimpy dress as first of all, that is the number one way to promote

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.560
[Guest]: any film.

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.720
[Guest]: Just now another film has come out Bhediya, which is about, you know, a man turning into

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.720
[Guest]: a wolf.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:52.600
[Guest]: What does that have to do with an actress, you know, dressing in, you know, and again,

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:55.360
[Guest]: nothing, but that's the way to promote that.

01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:01.600
[Guest]: You need to have quote-unquote as, you know, item number where a girl is quote-unquote

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.360
[Guest]: an item.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.840
[Guest]: Imagine the derogatory language you're using to even refer to a woman over here and she's

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:09.160
[Guest]: performing a number.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:14.080
[Guest]: And while of course some people, you know, actresses were smart and, you know, filmmakers

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.520
[Guest]: were smart, turn it into an art form.

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:23.080
[Guest]: As an example, BD Jalaila in, you know, in Omkara, which is Vishal Bhardwaj's way of

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:24.080
[Guest]: like.

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:28.680
[Guest]: So there are actresses and there are filmmakers who try to reclaim that idea, that if we have

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:30.680
[Guest]: to do it, we will do it smartly.

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:34.560
[Guest]: If the producer or the studio says that we have to put it, this is the only way to promote,

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.360
[Guest]: we will do our own thing from it, etc.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.520
[Guest]: But at the same time, you can think whatever you want for the most widest audiences in

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:49.360
[Guest]: our country, it is still like a provocative number for men to lust after, right?

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.400
[Guest]: And you know, to see women in less clothing.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.920
[Guest]: So that's been historically the way we look at it.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.920
[Guest]: Now when you, and again, this was something else that I speak in my talks also with young

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:04.600
[Guest]: people like when you look at the history of the way Bollywood has, you know, gone in terms

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.800
[Guest]: of heroes.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.400
[Guest]: And if I just go back, not, you know, there's a Dilip Uma Dev Anand, but if I start from

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:18.880
[Guest]: Amitabh Bachchan for as an example, in the 70s, there was one character that everybody

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:19.880
[Guest]: knew of.

01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.880
[Guest]: What is the name of the character?

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.480
[Guest]: Amitabh Bachchan used to play it, Vijay.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480
[Guest]: Everyone knows that, right?

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:27.280
[Guest]: Vijay is the angry young man.

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.280
[Guest]: Why is he angry?

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.320
[Guest]: Because society is not fair.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:39.200
[Guest]: Society is, you know, oppressing, you know, poor and the people from underprivileged sections

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.640
[Guest]: and you want food, you want clothes, you want a house, for that, either you're going to

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:47.000
[Guest]: be a coolie and fight for the rights or you're going to be a don or you're going to be a,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.480
[Guest]: you know, as a mafia in Zanjeer and whatever it takes, you will fight back as an angry

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.680
[Guest]: young man.

01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:01.320
[Guest]: You are Vijay and it is, and because society is oppressive, you are going to, you know,

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:03.520
[Guest]: get angry and fight back.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.440
[Guest]: Once the economic boom came after, you know, Amitabh Bachchan playing this till Agneepath

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:15.000
[Guest]: in the late 80s, you know, still Vijay Dhiranath Chauhan, you know, a whole 10-15 year period

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.200
[Guest]: of him playing that.

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.080
[Guest]: In the 90s, the economic boom happened, right?

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.240
[Guest]: So now people were not as angry because you're just like, okay, now we have a food house.

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.760
[Guest]: They're still entitled themselves.

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.560
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly, you know, but you get, you know, it's not as difficult right now to fight

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.920
[Guest]: for a food house because there's far more jobs being introduced into the economy, right,

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:35.760
[Guest]: Manmohan Singh?

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.880
[Guest]: You know, and now you, what happens then?

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.440
[Guest]: Then you find, once you have roti, kapda, makka, then what do you need in life?

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.720
[Guest]: You need love.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:47.120
[Guest]: So then you have another kind of a hero that comes up.

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:48.840
[Guest]: And that hero is Shah Rukh Khan.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.120
[Guest]: And he also has a name.

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.120
[Guest]: What is the name?

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.760
[Amit Varma]: Shah Rukh Khan films, what is the name?

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760
[Amit Varma]: Rahul, right?

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:55.760
[Guest]: Rahul.

01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:56.760
[Guest]: He's Rahul.

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:00.280
[Guest]: He's Rahul and he's in every film and he's, you know, spreading his arms and he's looking

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.400
[Guest]: for the love of his life and because that's what he needs right now.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.320
[Guest]: And then Rahul went on for, again, another 10-15 years, K3G, till then, 2000s, later

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:14.360
[Guest]: late 2000s, Rahul kept going, Raj kept going, Rahul kept going, Shah Rukh Khan's romance

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.440
[Guest]: period.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.640
[Guest]: After that got over, you had a third kind of a hero, you know, that now that you found

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.120
[Guest]: love also and you had dating apps coming in, you had like all kinds of different ways of

01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.280
[Guest]: people became more, you know, brave and courageous to talk about love with their families.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.160
[Guest]: You don't really need to kind of fight for love.

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.560
[Guest]: You didn't need to like, it was an open conversation.

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.000
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan normalized it.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.160
[Guest]: So now when you have all of this, you have Roti, Kapda, Makaan and you have love, what

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:40.440
[Guest]: do you now need?

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.440
[Guest]: Then the answer came to like, you know, you need to find who you are, you need to now

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.440
[Guest]: go internal.

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.880
[Guest]: Everything was external till now, now it's about to become yours.

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.880
[Guest]: And then there came a new kind of a hero, Ranbir Kapoor, who is your man-child, who

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.600
[Guest]: is, who's got everything.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.800
[Guest]: He's got tons of girls after him.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:00.720
[Guest]: He's, he might be going after one girl, but ultimately his every film is a coming of age

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.480
[Guest]: film where he's trying to come to terms with who he is and trying to find out who he is.

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.200
[Guest]: At the end of the film, whether it is through a girl, whether it is through a, you know,

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.360
[Guest]: a job, whether it is through any other thing, whether it's a drama or whatever, he, he has

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.140
[Guest]: a revelation at the end of it.

01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:16.040
[Guest]: And then he realizes this is who I am.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.240
[Guest]: I'm not, you know, I'm not a child anymore.

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240
[Guest]: I'm a man.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:24.120
[Guest]: And you know, and that process through that process, whether it's in Yeh Jawani, Yeh

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:30.240
[Guest]: Diwani, wherever you see it, ultimately, I don't want to fall, I want to fly.

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.760
[Guest]: I want to walk, I want to run, I don't want to fall.

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.680
[Guest]: That's the whole generation of young men where Ranbir Kapoor came in and you had another

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.680
[Guest]: hero.

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:43.360
[Guest]: He was called Sid and Sid is now Ranbir Kapoor, right?

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:48.560
[Guest]: This is that for three decades of cinema, literally as a character.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:53.000
[Guest]: And it's a man, that character is a man and he represents what men at that time are going

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
[Guest]: through.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.400
[Guest]: Immediately after that came like the Ayushman era.

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:04.320
[Guest]: And that Ayushman era is basically, now what happens?

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.560
[Guest]: Now you start caring about society around you because now you have found all of these

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.560
[Guest]: four things.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.840
[Guest]: You also realize like thinking about yourself is important.

01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:12.320
[Guest]: Self-introspection is important.

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.880
[Guest]: You know, being quote unquote with Ranbir Kapoor, being a fuckboy is also important.

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.840
[Guest]: Then what, what really happens in life, then you maybe start looking at society.

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:23.120
[Guest]: So Rajkumar, Ayushman, they have started like their own, you know, journeys of like showing

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.280
[Guest]: the world a prism of, you know, here's the issues with society.

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.440
[Guest]: You should care about it, etc, etc.

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:34.280
[Guest]: Here at this point, also the female led film, as I said, started coming in as well.

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:37.480
[Guest]: And you know why it really happened when you kind of go into the history as someone who's

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.760
[Guest]: again worked in Bollywood for a bit.

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.360
[Guest]: The history of female led films in India is that these are the, these are the films that

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.080
[Guest]: men refuse to do.

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:48.720
[Guest]: Most of these films were written for men and then men were like, this is too small.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.240
[Guest]: I'm not looking like a hero in this.

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:53.440
[Guest]: I'm not a big, you know, I don't have much of an action scene.

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.160
[Guest]: I don't think my arc is great.

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.040
[Guest]: So then the directors and producers would be like, okay, what are you doing?

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:03.120
[Guest]: So then you have to, you rewrite it and say, what if it was a woman?

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:08.920
[Guest]: Examples, example, I mean, NH7 as an example, you know, again, I'm not, I'm not referring

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.400
[Guest]: to this film as a very specific film about which would have happened here, but the general

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:21.920
[Guest]: trend, you know, I mean, there are so many films that, you know, I also know that have

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.640
[Guest]: changed from being, and I can't, because I was at Yansradha, I can't name them.

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.200
[Amit Varma]: Bollywood people won't listen to it.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.200
[Amit Varma]: They'll listen to it.

01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Everyone will listen.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.840
[Guest]: So, so, okay, as an example, you know, and again, no disrespect to, you know, the, to

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:38.480
[Guest]: my alma mater, you know, again, one of the best times I've ever had, I must say it, and

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.760
[Guest]: I'm not saying it for any other reason, because I genuinely loved working there.

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:48.880
[Guest]: Hichki, which was, which Rani Mukherjee ultimately, you know, did, was written for a man.

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:55.000
[Guest]: It was written and they took it to different men, and different men, like, just weren't,

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.400
[Guest]: you know, like, I don't know if I want to be a teacher or whatever it is.

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:03.080
[Guest]: And ultimately, then they rethought it and said, what if we attach a bigger actor, but

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.160
[Guest]: it's a female.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.640
[Guest]: And suddenly the film became monetizable, because when it's a female, you also pay her

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.840
[Guest]: lab because of the gender parity in our country and in all industries.

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:15.320
[Guest]: So the budget of the film doesn't exceed a certain amount.

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.360
[Guest]: So it's easy to recover the money also.

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.360
[Guest]: So everything then became business wise, it became, you're putting low cost, but low investment.

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:25.120
[Guest]: And then the return can be in certain cases can be a lot more, right?

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:30.520
[Guest]: So it's, this is the way that, you know, female women in our country have gotten their own

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.640
[Guest]: films.

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:34.400
[Guest]: It's only happened after men refused to do those films.

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:39.040
[Guest]: And women, when you look at any female led film in our country, now, again, I'm using

02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:42.860
[Guest]: that term, because that's the easiest way of identifying them, right?

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:47.520
[Guest]: If you look at any of these films led by women actors, you will have a film which Shahrukh

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.080
[Guest]: Khan, Salman Khan, anybody, no matter who it is, will lead.

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:56.360
[Guest]: And you will have any actor between a Deepika to an Anushka, all the big actors of our times

02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.880
[Guest]: who are female will act in them opposite, even if their role is like five scenes.

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:03.920
[Guest]: And in fact, and it's like a, it's a trial by fire.

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:08.000
[Guest]: It's almost a coming of age for every Akshay Kumar film ki andar, Kiara Advani aagi for

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.400
[Guest]: five scenes, then you know, that's when you get noticed.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.120
[Guest]: And then you can maybe someday lead your own film.

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.160
[Guest]: That's the way people get to know you when you are opposite, or this is the way unfortunately

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.740
[Guest]: things are structured, right?

02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:24.040
[Guest]: But when you see a female, a film which has a big female star, you have a Deepika, you

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:30.440
[Guest]: know, in Chhapaak, you have a, you name it, you name it, you have Anushka in NH7, in NH40,

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.360
[Guest]: I forget what the title was.

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:38.720
[Guest]: You have Bhumi's films, Tapsee's films, you know, Rocket, Rashmi, any of these films,

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.920
[Guest]: the male actors are always going to be folks who are either from a different industry,

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.520
[Guest]: because they're not as big in Bollywood cinema.

02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:51.640
[Guest]: So they're okay with coming in like Punjabi cinema, I work in South, so I'm happy Dulukar

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.640
[Guest]: Salman will come in.

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.960
[Guest]: He's comfortable, while of course, I think South films and South actors have their own

02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.960
[Guest]: mind and they're really smart about taking good scripts versus actually some of them,

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:03.400
[Guest]: at least some of them today don't fall into that trap.

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:08.400
[Guest]: But but you have, you know, you will see that, you know, otherwise it is supporting actors

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:12.440
[Guest]: or indie actors or web series actors who start playing opposite them.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.960
[Guest]: And no one, you will never see like in America, as an example, you will have a Ghostbusters,

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.440
[Guest]: a female Ghostbusters, which has four women playing Ghostbusters and a Chris Hemsworth,

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:27.000
[Guest]: whose Thor will come and play a cameo for like, you know, and play a secretary and have

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.400
[Guest]: 10 jokes on him.

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:29.400
[Guest]: And it's crazy.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:34.600
[Guest]: You will have, you know, Brad Pitt doing in Lost City doing like a small role because

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.720
[Guest]: Sandra Bullock said to me that, you know, will you come in, you know, do Channing Tatum

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:41.240
[Guest]: and I are doing a film and will you come and do a five minute cameo?

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.440
[Guest]: And he said, sure, I will do it.

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:47.600
[Guest]: So you have all of these big Hollywood blockbusters and you have all of these big actors are okay

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.200
[Guest]: with doing smaller roles if it's like a female that they love, etc, etc.

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:58.280
[Guest]: But in it's not the case in India, it's almost seen as, you know, I can't, I remember again

02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:06.320
[Guest]: without wanting to name the actors, I really respect them, I remember one of the, you know,

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.780
[Guest]: so I was having a conversation with Rajkumar Rao.

02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:15.600
[Guest]: This was, I was interviewing him at a film festival in, in IIT and Queen had just come

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:18.440
[Guest]: and I said, like, you know, Rajkumar, your work in Queen was just incredible.

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.480
[Guest]: It's so great to see you in like that role where you are going, you know, you're not

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.960
[Guest]: really playing like you're okay with playing a comfortable with being a negative character,

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:25.960
[Guest]: etc.

02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.320
[Guest]: And he said it publicly only, which is why I guess I can quote it, where he said that

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.040
[Guest]: I'm never going to play a character like that again, not because it's negative, but because

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:35.920
[Guest]: it was Queen, it was Kangana's film.

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.760
[Guest]: And why am I, you know, playing such a lesser part in that film, I want to be seen as a

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.760
[Guest]: lead hero.

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:44.960
[Guest]: And if I continue playing those films, I will never be seen as a hero, I will always be

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.080
[Guest]: seen as a actor who is, I won't be seen as a hero, again, quote unquote, I will always

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:55.320
[Guest]: be seen as like this actor who's playing opposite a female in a female led film.

02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.960
[Guest]: So and now Rajkumar is never going to be seen in a film like if Kangana does a film, you

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.360
[Guest]: will never have a Rajkumar in a film like that, you'll always have somebody who is who's

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.800
[Guest]: from an indie scene or a web series scene.

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:11.400
[Guest]: So it is Bollywood main itne issues hain, itne issues hain, and, and even with people

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:16.240
[Guest]: who have good intentions, these issues, because now they've created a vicious cycle of this,

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.440
[Guest]: and a vicious cycle that gives the people the same thing over and over again, after

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.060
[Guest]: which people are thinking this is what they want, which is not true.

02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:28.320
[Guest]: Because when you have like, because Aamir Khan, until recently has been a very successful

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:32.280
[Guest]: example of showing that you can give them a good script, and they will take it, a three

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.500
[Guest]: idiots has nothing to do with like Dangal for that matter, even with all of its problems

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:42.400
[Guest]: when it came to its feminism, Dangal was a film where Aamir Khan played a 40 40 50 year

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:48.040
[Guest]: old father, and you had two new actresses, there were no songs, you know, which were

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:54.080
[Guest]: quote unquote, again, item numbers, there was no female, there was no romantic, there

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:57.320
[Guest]: was one of the rare films without a romantic angle and made 350 crores, it was the highest

02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:04.000
[Guest]: grossing film, Hindi film outside of Bhavbali of all time, you know, so it's, if you and

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.560
[Guest]: Rajkumar Hirani, again, you know, while with everything that's happened with him, like,

02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:13.520
[Guest]: he was a great example of showcasing that you can have a film on any subject.

02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:17.480
[Guest]: And if you do it right, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, now he's done a period of films for whatever

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:18.480
[Guest]: it's worth.

02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:23.340
[Guest]: Anand Raidh until again, while his again films have some of them have been very problematic.

02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:28.000
[Guest]: Most of these films, when you do something, if you have a good script, and you have a

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.880
[Guest]: good narrative, and you have good actors in it, Ayushman's first few films, which were

02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:38.480
[Guest]: just absolutely fresh, did nobody could have thought that Ayushman and Rajkumar will become

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.360
[Guest]: you know, 100 150 crore actors, but they just started choosing subjects over everything

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.360
[Guest]: else.

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:46.280
[Guest]: And the subjects were so good that people just started being like, hey, you know, this

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:52.120
[Guest]: is a we want to see this film not because of who's in it, but which also became his

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:58.000
[Guest]: style then, but because of what's in it, Badhai Ho Ke Andar, the film was Gajraj Rao and Neena

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
[Guest]: Gupta's film.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.160
[Guest]: And Ayushman was one of them.

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:04.160
[Guest]: I mean, I really respect him for being brave enough to do a role where he's not the hero

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:05.480
[Guest]: in that film.

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:08.520
[Guest]: And Sania Malhotra is actually not the quote unquote heroine in that film.

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:13.280
[Guest]: Both of them are the supporting cast of Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta.

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:16.440
[Guest]: But they were okay with doing something like that because it's a great script.

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.400
[Guest]: And you know, when you do a script and you do it with a director that they respect, the

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.840
[Guest]: film ends up becoming a hit.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:24.880
[Guest]: But again, now we have pandemic has happened now again, we have gone back to the space

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:28.720
[Guest]: where now a certain kind of South film, which has a certain kind of misogyny, a certain

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.200
[Guest]: kind of same angry young man, the 70s are back in in, you know, in some somehow in the

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:36.040
[Guest]: 2020s.

02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:39.800
[Guest]: And now we are seeing I mean, I saw Kantara and everyone's been hyping it up.

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:43.520
[Guest]: And I full respect to the, you know, the acting of Rishabh Shetty.

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.480
[Guest]: And you know, there was something very interesting there.

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:51.320
[Guest]: But like, I just couldn't, there was a point in the film where the girl he likes, he goes

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:56.160
[Guest]: and gives, you know, touches her waist in this inappropriate manner, gives her a, I

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.440
[Guest]: don't know, twists her belly, and laughs about it.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.880
[Guest]: And his friends say, why did you do that?

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.080
[Guest]: That's romance or whatever it is.

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.040
[Guest]: It's one of the biggest hits and nobody is even talking, I mean, reviewers are, but I

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:16.080
[Guest]: didn't see any of the reviews or any of the general people opinion that, okay, I like

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.320
[Guest]: Kantara, but this scene, I couldn't, the movie for me after that, just after I saw that scene,

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:25.760
[Guest]: I was just like, you know, how can I be comfortable with anything that happens in the movie that

02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:32.360
[Guest]: if there's such a rampant, misogynistic, you know, idea over here, right then and there

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:34.920
[Guest]: and the way the woman's character has been treated in the whole film, again, it's just

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.160
[Guest]: like a woman who's in service of a man.

02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:44.960
[Guest]: So gender is a, I don't think enough people recognize it, you know, if filmmakers in our

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:49.840
[Guest]: country are now making films about which show gender in a new light or show for that matter

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.000
[Guest]: sexuality in a new light or anything, I think they're also coming from a sense of business

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.920
[Guest]: now that a story like this, because nothing else is working, this might work, so let's

02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:58.920
[Guest]: give it a shot.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:03.160
[Guest]: I don't think there's enough people who are passionate about it, or who care about it

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:09.600
[Guest]: or who and anytime, you know, like as somebody who's also tried very hard to have these conversations,

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:14.520
[Guest]: you if you pitch it that this is about gender, people are just going to be like, I don't

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.520
[Guest]: care.

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.160
[Guest]: But if you pitch it as entertainment, and then they're like, Oh, but I like what you've

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:21.280
[Guest]: done in gender, they themselves will say interesting.

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:26.360
[Guest]: But if I say that I'll tell you a story, but I'll tell you a story that it's a great story,

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:27.920
[Guest]: then you might be interested in it.

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:31.800
[Guest]: But the moment I start by saying, you know, I think we're trying to reverse, we're looking

02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:34.760
[Guest]: at misogyny in this way, I don't want to care, I don't care about message or whatever it

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.920
[Guest]: is, because they think that there is a stench that comes with social issues, that the moment

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:45.600
[Guest]: you talk about social issues, you know, there is your your film and your idea and your thought

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:51.840
[Guest]: and your story has a stink to it, that that people try to rub off like it cannot be seen.

02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.760
[Guest]: As an example, Aamir Khan, again, no disrespect to anybody over here.

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:00.640
[Guest]: I'm just trying to like, when when thugs of Hindustan came, and this is just something

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.320
[Guest]: I noticed, right, again, I really respect him, I just talked about how Dangal was, you

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:05.320
[Guest]: know, whatever.

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.240
[Guest]: But when thugs of Hindustan came, he went on coffee with Karan.

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:11.400
[Guest]: And Karan Johar said that, you know, you've been, you know, you have been such an impactful

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:16.200
[Guest]: person, you know, you've done, what do you say, Satyamev Jayate, all your films have

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.240
[Guest]: social issues at the core of it, it's so incredible, etc.

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:24.960
[Guest]: And Aamir Khan said, no, no, no, I don't make films for social issues, I make good films,

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:30.800
[Guest]: it's a good thing that I got a social message, but my social issue, he was so terrified,

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:36.560
[Guest]: as one of India's biggest actors, to be seen as somebody who's supporting a film with a

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.560
[Guest]: social cause.

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.560
[Guest]: He's just like, no, no, no, no, no, please don't, you have to look at the like, immediate

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:48.360
[Guest]: fear on his face, that please don't bracket me as a socially responsible actor, I'm not

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.360
[Guest]: one, sorry.

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:54.360
[Guest]: I am a hero and I'm an actor, I'm waiting for a thug, I'm killing people there, I'm

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:57.120
[Guest]: doing violence, I've done Ghazni also, look, I do everything.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.920
[Guest]: So don't bracket me in that.

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:03.880
[Guest]: I'm just doing good, good cinema, if they resonate and great, if not, they don't.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.280
[Guest]: And anybody who tries to do talk about social issue, Enraak Kashyap, you will have a separate

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.040
[Guest]: fan base, but no one go for his films beyond a point of time, you know, you will have people

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:13.140
[Guest]: just it's, it's sad.

02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:16.720
[Guest]: And I just I don't think that you know, when you look at international cinema, and you

02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.920
[Guest]: look at foreign cinema, you know, you know, as a foreign cinema, non English cinema, you

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:25.920
[Guest]: have something like Parasite, which is about class.

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:28.200
[Guest]: And that's why it won the Oscar.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:34.220
[Guest]: And they're the people they're aware, they're all coming together to make that commentary.

02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:39.360
[Guest]: You have most of the incredible films that are made internationally, have that team,

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:44.280
[Guest]: you know, Asghar Farhadi, any of these people that you have internationally, and they're

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:51.960
[Guest]: proud of the fact that they're exploring an insight or a theme into a social, social and

02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.640
[Guest]: all art is political, all art is about social issues only.

02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:59.000
[Guest]: You may realize it or you may not realize it.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.320
[Guest]: If you realize it, then you are then you're making it consciously if you don't realize

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:08.320
[Guest]: it, you're just, you know, perpetuating stereotypes of a certain social understanding of the world

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.120
[Guest]: you have and a certain political understanding of the world, you may not know that you have

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.240
[Guest]: done misogyny, but you have done misogyny, and that is your point of view.

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.800
[Guest]: I'm not even talking about Kabir Singh right now.

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:22.080
[Guest]: I'm talking about like most of Indian Bollywood like history, which is had casual misogyny

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:26.480
[Guest]: as you very well said, most Akshay Kumar films have had like, you know, just the hero like

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.680
[Guest]: a girl by constantly stalking her by constantly like, you know, and that is the way that most

02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.800
[Guest]: men think.

02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:38.880
[Guest]: I know friends of mine, you know, who are women who have gotten into relationships after

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.240
[Guest]: men followed them, because they were just like, okay, and this is I'm talking about

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:46.760
[Guest]: maybe 10-15 years ago, because Imran Hashmi made it cool.

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:50.840
[Guest]: And they thought that this is romantic, that if he saw me on this place, and then he followed

02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.920
[Guest]: me to somewhere, you know, maybe he really likes me.

02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:59.360
[Guest]: And because again, and there is a class element to that also, he seems like a person in a

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.560
[Guest]: caste element to this also, it seems like he's from upper class, upper caste, so I don't

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:04.320
[Guest]: mind like going out on a date for them.

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.680
[Guest]: I don't feel unsafe.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:14.520
[Guest]: So there is, I mean, so many, so many issues that have been perpetuated consciously, unconsciously,

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:17.440
[Guest]: subconsciously by Bollywood, will it change?

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.440
[Guest]: I don't know.

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:21.840
[Guest]: I think the web world is trying some very interesting things.

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:27.400
[Guest]: You have a Delhi, you're seeing folks like Shefali Shah, who was an iconic actor, you

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.360
[Guest]: know, being able to now have, you know, lead her own shows like a Delhi crime and, you

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.760
[Guest]: know, and kick ass at it.

02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:39.040
[Guest]: You know, you have like now, now, a little bit of the internet, fortunately, is giving

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:46.160
[Guest]: the web space is giving a little bit more respect to actors beyond age, beyond genders,

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.640
[Guest]: you know, and just good storytelling, you know, but again, I mean, it's a clutter after

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.440
[Guest]: a point of time, you know, this when there's too much, ultimately, when everybody wants

02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:58.560
[Guest]: to make 20,000 of one thing, then you look at the formula.

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.840
[Guest]: And then you don't look at what is the out, you don't look at what is that biggest success,

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:05.640
[Guest]: because that's always going to be difficult to make.

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:09.000
[Guest]: Not everybody can make a family man, not everybody can make a Delhi crime, but everybody can

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:14.840
[Guest]: make a true crime show where a girl gets kidnapped and there's a man who's trying to, you know,

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:18.560
[Guest]: whatever, who's at the hem of it, another man who's trying to save that's the easiest

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.560
[Guest]: thing to do.

02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:23.880
[Guest]: You get any director, get any writer, get any kind of actor, and you know, people will

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.440
[Guest]: watch it because that's what they've always been watching.

02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:33.520
[Guest]: So I know I still I feel like I have hope I always have hope that just unfortunately

02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:39.080
[Guest]: the kind of person I have, but at this point, I don't see where I don't I don't know where

02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:43.480
[Guest]: Bollywood is leading or where Indian cinema at large is leading, especially with the rise

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.920
[Guest]: of these hyper masculine South films.

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.400
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of things I want to double click on and ask further questions about but first

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.560
[Amit Varma]: boss Nikhil, I have to say, every time you say no disrespect intended, when language

02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:04.960
[Amit Varma]: like that is used, basically what you're saying is full disrespect intended, it's like, yeah,

02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.560
[Amit Varma]: I don't mean to burst your bubble.

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.280
[Guest]: Whenever you say I don't mean to burst your bubble, you're bursting the bubble.

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:12.120
[Amit Varma]: I am with you.

02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.120
[Amit Varma]: So never mind that.

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:18.120
[Amit Varma]: No, I all of this is extremely insightful in terms of, you know, little things like

02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:24.120
[Amit Varma]: how we normalize all of this, either term like item number, term like female led film

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.760
[Amit Varma]: at one on one hand, it's a description accurate to her.

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:33.600
[Amit Varma]: But on another hand, the fact that the description is necessary, is telling you something, you

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.640
[Amit Varma]: know, just calling someone a hero in a film, sort of telling you something and just the

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:43.160
[Amit Varma]: fact that, you know, Kiara Advani can act in a film led by Akshay Kumar, but Akshay

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:47.360
[Amit Varma]: Kumar will never act in a film led by any woman, obviously.

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know, earlier at lunch, we were both raving about TikTok.

02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'll, you know, I'll sort of talk about that to get to my next question.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And I had even for a month, I had taught one course called TikTok and Indian society I

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.920
[Amit Varma]: had, in fact, taught it on WhatsApp.

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:04.440
[Amit Varma]: So it was like WhatsApp University.

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.600
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I taught it on WhatsApp was to support my chapters, I had like hundreds

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.040
[Amit Varma]: of TikTok videos I wanted to send.

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:16.120
[Amit Varma]: So if you think of the vertical format, WhatsApp was actually the best place to send it sequentially

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.600
[Amit Varma]: with my comments and all that, but that was a time TikTok was banned.

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:21.200
[Amit Varma]: So I just did it once.

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I loved about TikTok is that TikTok broke through all the structures that existed.

02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, that happened at the same time as you know, Jio was making broadband almost

02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:33.120
[Amit Varma]: ubiquitous.

02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, a person in a village who might otherwise have felt that no one was making

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.360
[Amit Varma]: entertainment for them, that no one was speaking to them, could turn on their mobile phone

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and no matter what they were, maybe alternate sexuality or whatever, they might have felt

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.560
[Amit Varma]: that they are all alone.

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And you can suddenly see people like yourself, creating art and entertainment for you.

02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.760
[Amit Varma]: And then there is that magic moment where you can turn the camera around, and you can

02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.560
[Amit Varma]: make something yourself.

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:07.800
[Amit Varma]: And initially, obviously, you would find TikTokers initially doing, you know, those standard

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.640
[Amit Varma]: memes with a lip sync to something or whatever.

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:16.120
[Amit Varma]: But then going beyond that, I just saw such an outpouring of great original art coming

02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.120
[Amit Varma]: out of that.

02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And it blew my mind.

02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.240
[Amit Varma]: And it was bottom up, which I just loved.

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:24.440
[Amit Varma]: And that way, unfortunately, TikTok was banned.

02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:31.740
[Amit Varma]: And my sense has been over the last few years, whenever I look around me across domains,

02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:37.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, whether it is in the media, or just across domains, that the mainstream is crumbling,

02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:41.680
[Amit Varma]: right, that the mainstream is crumbling, everything is getting decentralized.

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And while there is a lag in the transition, mainstream players have no clue what's happening

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:47.600
[Amit Varma]: out there.

02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Right?

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:54.240
[Amit Varma]: Would you say that that's also the case with Bollywood in the sense that the way the industry

02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.880
[Amit Varma]: works and things is really a bit of an artifact.

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:01.240
[Amit Varma]: They have a notion of what works, right?

02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:06.020
[Amit Varma]: And then what you beautifully called a vicious circle kicks into play, where they'll produce

02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:09.640
[Amit Varma]: more and more of that, and some of that will work, and then they'll double down on that.

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And they'll say, huh, this works.

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.880
[Amit Varma]: But they cannot think outside that particular box, that TikTokers were thinking outside

02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:16.880
[Amit Varma]: all boxes.

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And so do you feel that that's a problem with mainstream industry in the sense that in another

02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.160
[Amit Varma]: place you spoke about how you did not want to be a filmmaker sitting in a glass cabin

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.560
[Amit Varma]: and Andheri saying this is what the youth wants, this is what the country wants.

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And we'll talk about that phase of your life also.

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:44.020
[Amit Varma]: But do you think that we are stuck in that space, where we are probably ready for a kind

02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:48.520
[Amit Varma]: of content and a kind of art, which people aren't producing because of this lag because

02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.600
[Amit Varma]: entertainment is still so top down?

02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:57.280
[Guest]: Lots to say on this, honestly, where do I begin?

02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:07.320
[Guest]: So I feel like fundamentally now we as an audience don't understand the film industry.

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:13.680
[Guest]: It's called an industry to begin with, the industry, Bollywood in one hand, even Hollywood,

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.040
[Guest]: most film industries.

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:23.720
[Guest]: Let's just leave some of the European kind of cinema out of it for now, but it's a business

02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:29.760
[Guest]: and it's like it's worse than gambling because there's no science to it, right?

02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:37.600
[Guest]: When you think about it, every other industry in the world has a structure of what works.

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:43.040
[Guest]: If I am a computer engineer, if I would have gone into the same line, I would be given

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:44.040
[Guest]: a certain kind of code.

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:48.360
[Guest]: I would have a certain problem statement, solve this problem statement, do this coding

02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:50.320
[Guest]: and then maybe we'll reach the solution.

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.320
[Guest]: There are ideas, innovations you have and obviously still you don't know whether it

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.040
[Guest]: will work or not, but there is a structure you can follow to reach there and a lot of

02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.040
[Guest]: people have reached there.

02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:01.680
[Guest]: There's a lot of technological innovation that happens because of structure.

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:07.160
[Guest]: There is nothing that can guarantee a hit film, nothing in the world because if that

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:11.080
[Guest]: was true, then every film would be a hit, nothing.

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:16.560
[Guest]: So there are sometimes films like, you know, suddenly there are films that come out like

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:19.640
[Guest]: an Ayushman film, as I said, can come out and make 150 crores because it was just a

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:23.780
[Guest]: fresh topic, Vicky Doonar came out of nowhere, then from till Badhaay Do, everything kind

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:25.240
[Guest]: of worked like that.

02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:31.200
[Guest]: You will have a suddenly you will have an RRR that will come out and blow Hollywood

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:32.200
[Guest]: away.

02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:36.760
[Guest]: It is 100% going to be nominated to the Oscars because every American filmmaker has gone

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:40.280
[Guest]: nuts watching it like what is happening over here, right?

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:44.940
[Guest]: But I mean and not everybody can be Raja Mouli, not everybody can be Ayushman, but not anybody

02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:51.280
[Guest]: can be like Salim Javed at that time at the height of their, you know, success.

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.480
[Guest]: So there is no formula.

02:19:53.480 --> 02:20:01.040
[Guest]: And yet, when you crack something that works, the kind of return on investment you can have,

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:02.840
[Guest]: it's pretty crazy.

02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:04.200
[Guest]: And you can have it instantly, right?

02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:07.680
[Guest]: When you have a business, you have to build a business for 10 years, and then you get

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:11.800
[Guest]: a valuation then you whatever, you know, you put a lot of hard work for a very long time,

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:13.160
[Guest]: and something happens.

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.360
[Guest]: You have one and a half years that you put a film in if you kind of put it together in

02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:17.440
[Guest]: a smart way.

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:25.120
[Guest]: If it works, you know, you have 300-400 crores that you make, you know, in like, over a period

02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:27.140
[Guest]: of two months or three months.

02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:30.960
[Guest]: So the return on investment is so great that people are happy to do this gamble, but it

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:31.960
[Guest]: is gambling.

02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:36.400
[Guest]: Like you're up as a as a poker player, you said luck plays a chance so often right and

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.640
[Guest]: you know, you can have skill, but the same thing in Bollywood, you can have some skill,

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:45.880
[Guest]: but a lot of it is just pure luck, right and and and that's Bollywood, but fundamentally

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:53.720
[Guest]: people think and misunderstand that you know, it is it is it is a place that is out to make

02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:56.480
[Guest]: things that the audience would love or enjoy.

02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.240
[Guest]: That is the secondary object is never the primary objective.

02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:06.120
[Guest]: On the other hand, there are fools, the fools like me, there are fools like many other writers,

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:12.120
[Guest]: directors, filmmakers who watch some of these movies that could be made for any reason possible,

02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:16.120
[Guest]: you know, and in some way somewhere these films made them feel less alone.

02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:17.120
[Guest]: I have grown.

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:18.120
[Guest]: I came to India.

02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:23.640
[Guest]: This is a true story because of DDLJ, I grew up, you know, I had got I did my GMAT, so

02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:28.200
[Guest]: I did my SATs and I got a great score and all my friends in my circle of friends in

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.200
[Guest]: Bahrain went to America.

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:32.520
[Guest]: I was the one who said no, I want to go to India for two reasons.

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:36.320
[Guest]: One I wanted to go to I wanted to go to Bombay and be a and and make it in Bombay.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:43.120
[Guest]: I was very clear and all of it started with DDLJ and I was like what is this?

02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:48.000
[Guest]: I am like I have my favorite thing ever and and the funniest part of this is that I it's

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.440
[Guest]: not the thing that worked for me DDLJ is not Shah Rukh Khan, not Kajol, but Amrish Buri

02:21:54.440 --> 02:22:01.520
[Guest]: repeatedly saying my country's soil and you know my soil's fragrance and and and I was

02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:06.920
[Guest]: like inspired by him to say that yes, my country, my soil, my soil's fragrance, Punjab, I want

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:11.000
[Guest]: to go there, I want to do something there, but like the film also in itself, Aditya Chopra,

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:16.200
[Guest]: I ended up working at Yash Raj, got to work with Aditya Chopra and it's just insane like

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:19.840
[Guest]: you know, but as a young boy, I saw those films and I was like this crazy and when Hrithik

02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:24.520
[Guest]: Roshan came, I was just like I was obsessed with Hrithik, obsessed.

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:28.600
[Guest]: I was I have I bought like some 30,000 posters of Hrithik Roshan.

02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:33.760
[Guest]: I had created a website, embarrassing but I had created a Geocities website, a fan website

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:39.080
[Guest]: of Hrithik Roshan when I was like 13, you know, so there was something in films, you

02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:44.480
[Guest]: know, that spoke to young people who did not and especially I feel like young boys who

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.520
[Guest]: just did not know where to fit in, you know, I would see a Bollywood film and you would

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:53.440
[Guest]: speak to any writer, any filmmaker in Lokhandwala Andheri and they will have a story about like

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:57.400
[Guest]: the film that corrupted them, the film that made them realize that this is what they want

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.840
[Guest]: to do and it really comes down to an insight that I felt a little less alone.

02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:07.120
[Guest]: As an NRI kid growing up outside of India, films were my connect with my country.

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:10.600
[Guest]: It was my connect with my language while of course, you know, Middle East beyond a point

02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:15.760
[Guest]: of time has tons and tons of Indians anyway, so it's not like I was in a very foreign place.

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.640
[Guest]: Still, you know, there was something that I would see Punjabi culture in particular

02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.160
[Guest]: is like super resonant in like, you know, YRF and Dharma films and whatnot.

02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:27.520
[Guest]: So I'd watch those films and I was like, you know, as somebody who still struggles to be

02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:32.200
[Guest]: Punjabi and is very embarrassed by it because it's the language of my, you know, parents

02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:37.880
[Guest]: and my grandparents, you know, I would hear Punjabi music and I would see films, you know,

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:41.960
[Guest]: DDLJ and there's all these Malhotras and Khannas and Kapoors and whatnot like, you know, this

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:44.160
[Guest]: is these are my people, right?

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:48.680
[Guest]: But when you enter Bombay and you come to Bollywood, so to speak, you realize that these

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:56.560
[Guest]: are all of this is these are power centers, there are art is elitist, you know, and it's

02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:02.000
[Guest]: always been when people look down and say, okay, you've not seen Gone with the Wind,

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.680
[Guest]: you're not seeing classics, you're not seeing European cinema, you're not seeing like, you

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:10.400
[Guest]: know, Ingrid Bergman, you've not seen any of these like big filmmakers, big names, you

02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:16.920
[Guest]: know, and people look down on you and say that, you know, because it is it was a language

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:21.800
[Guest]: of first a language of intellectuals, then a language of rich people, then a language

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:22.880
[Guest]: of business.

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.520
[Guest]: It was never something that anybody can, it was not a democratic system.

02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:32.100
[Guest]: Why is there this whole anger about demotivism, but you fundamentally misunderstood what this

02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:33.360
[Guest]: industry is.

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:41.960
[Guest]: If you're angry about nepotism, it's I can't even now said no offense, but you know, you've

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:47.040
[Guest]: called me out on it, but people get angry about nepotism, I'm just like, do you not

02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:51.440
[Guest]: recognize you think that this is an industry that was made on merit, it wasn't, it was

02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:54.960
[Guest]: made on it was business deals.

02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:55.960
[Guest]: Everybody's the same family.

02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:02.240
[Guest]: 80% of Bollywood is one family, yes, Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar are cousins, you know,

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:07.320
[Guest]: and like in most people don't know that they're literal cousins, you know, and and so and

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:11.960
[Guest]: there were four or five families, you know, in the 50s 60s that started it, and they've

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:15.920
[Guest]: been like, they've grown their empires and businesses, few new people have definitely

02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:19.200
[Guest]: come in and whatnot, tried to create Anurag Kashyap as an example to try to create an

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.880
[Guest]: alternate culture and alternate industry along with it.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.440
[Guest]: But still it is it is about people who have money, and they will do with the money whatever

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.760
[Guest]: the hell they want.

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:33.400
[Guest]: And why would they give them, you know, money to outsider quote unquote, because if I give

02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:39.320
[Guest]: it to my son, or my daughter, at least if I fail, you know, I'm putting it I'm feeling

02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:43.600
[Guest]: because I pointed on my children, but if I put it on an outsider, and that feels I'm

02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:46.280
[Guest]: just like I'm an idiot or what, because it's a gamble.

02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:51.280
[Guest]: There is no structure, there's no formula, you can have the best actors, you know, from

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.520
[Guest]: outside of Bollywood, but ultimately, you know, it's a risk.

02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.320
[Guest]: And why would someone take a 30 crore 20 crore 10 crore 5 crore risk on somebody else, when

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.960
[Guest]: you can take that 5 crore risk on your family, right and it's the same.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:05.200
[Guest]: So everybody is in cohort with each other.

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:07.080
[Guest]: It's an incestuous industry.

02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.320
[Guest]: Everybody is like, you know, you work with each other, that's those have been the power

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:17.280
[Guest]: centers for the longest time, the internet broke it, YouTube broke it, we come to TikTok.

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.580
[Guest]: But that's what happened in the and I was fortunate as being someone who was started

02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:27.460
[Guest]: off as a, you know, culture writer in Hindustan Times, you know, and was writing about quote

02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:32.000
[Guest]: unquote, the seed, you know, I was I was seeing stand up comedy happen.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.800
[Guest]: I've also done open mics at the beginning, I've seen the independent music culture, I

02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.040
[Guest]: was reporting on it.

02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:41.880
[Guest]: I was seeing channel V and MTV transforming into something interesting.

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.080
[Guest]: You know, what were they doing for culture at that point of time, this alternate season

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:50.880
[Guest]: Anurag Kashyap and that became my entry in Dev D I saw in 2008-9 ki baat thi, paagal ho

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:51.880
[Guest]: gaya tha.

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:52.880
[Guest]: I was like, what is this?

02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:55.960
[Guest]: What I've seen that film in theatres like four times, I was like, how is this like,

02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:56.960
[Guest]: what is happening?

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:01.040
[Guest]: Udaan I saw, Vikram Aditya Motwani, Oye Lucky Lucky Boys, I think it's one of the greatest

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:05.760
[Guest]: films ever made of all time, Dibakar Banshee, I went and met them, you know, because I was

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:09.120
[Guest]: I had the, you know, I was in a place I was in Hindustan Times and, you know, after a

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:11.800
[Guest]: point of time, I realised paise toh mil nahi rahe hai, so I made a list of people I wanted

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:12.800
[Guest]: to meet.

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:14.480
[Guest]: I was like, I'm just going to go and interview these people.

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:17.680
[Guest]: So I met all of the people I used to love and, you know, like, I love this guy, I want

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.680
[Guest]: to meet him.

02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:23.320
[Guest]: I would love this, you know, woman and, you know, as a director or whatever.

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:27.680
[Guest]: And I just have these, you know, lists and just go after these people and they're not

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:30.680
[Guest]: just India lists internationally.

02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:35.160
[Guest]: I interviewed Richard Linklater, I interviewed Aaron Sorkin, all the people that I considered

02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:38.880
[Guest]: my heroes, I just go after them and interview them, right.

02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:43.960
[Guest]: And I would be inspired by how these people are not your, they are not from these power

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:46.880
[Guest]: centres and it's not even easy for them.

02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.720
[Guest]: They have struggled epically, they have struggled publicly, but they have done it.

02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:53.600
[Guest]: They have broken the system.

02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.320
[Guest]: And that was always something that I kind of always had the back of my hand.

02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:00.120
[Guest]: So even when I got into MTV, I was, I joined the digital team at that time.

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:02.120
[Guest]: I was the editor of the MTV website.

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:06.320
[Guest]: As editor of the MTV website, there was one website, nobody gave a shit about it.

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:09.920
[Guest]: I was suddenly this 24 year old who's like, you're free say, you gave a little bit of

02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:10.920
[Guest]: a budget.

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:12.680
[Guest]: And I just, I wrote all kinds of articles on it.

02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:14.920
[Guest]: And suddenly those articles started going viral, started.

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.840
[Guest]: And then there was a team that I was given and a team that I was part of suddenly.

02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.640
[Guest]: And Koch studio, the first time was coming and then they gave it to me and said, you

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.280
[Guest]: know, you are the whatever digital in charge of making it happen.

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:28.640
[Guest]: And I was just trying all kinds of things.

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:32.920
[Guest]: We did like a, at that time, like a video interview pod and we didn't even have the

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:37.200
[Guest]: terms podcast, but we did like a video with all the Shankar, all the people who were performing

02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.200
[Guest]: at Koch studio.

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.200
[Guest]: We did like this video gathering.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.240
[Guest]: We did a tweet, tweet meetup.

02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:45.600
[Guest]: So all the Koch studio fans and got them to go to the sets and watch it live.

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:46.680
[Guest]: And these are all experiment.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.680
[Guest]: Nobody was doing this.

02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:48.680
[Guest]: It was just fun.

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:51.880
[Guest]: I was there when the internet was, you know, making things happen.

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:55.600
[Guest]: And that's where I made the series on, on, on air after that.

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.280
[Guest]: And I made six films at MTV actually, and that's where I got to get into Bollywood.

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:04.320
[Guest]: I made six films with Anurag Kashyap, Anurag Basu, Sujit Sarkar, Nikhil Adwani, Rohan Sippy,

02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:05.320
[Guest]: Abhinay Deo.

02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:06.680
[Guest]: And I was producing all of them.

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:09.080
[Guest]: I mean, there's a whole, again, other story around that.

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:15.280
[Guest]: But when I got into, it was at that time in 2014, 2015, where TVF, that video, Rohdi's

02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.400
[Guest]: video went viral.

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:18.200
[Guest]: And I was at MTV at that time.

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.200
[Guest]: And this video and everybody in MTV was talking about how this internet video is like, what

02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:23.200
[Guest]: is this?

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.240
[Guest]: And that was the first, you know, in that sense to break through, you know, and, and

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.840
[Guest]: one of the first viral, viral videos, because they made fun of Rohdi's, right?

02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.640
[Guest]: The show that I was making the disaster of a show that I made was called Reality Stars,

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.560
[Guest]: which was a fiction show about reality shows.

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:45.560
[Guest]: We had a, is my whole idea of making a parody or like a satirical show, a comedy about these

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:48.280
[Guest]: bunch of people who want to be part of a show called MTV rejects.

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:59.680
[Guest]: So, so, but I saw that there was, you know, a scene, a literal counterculture happening

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:02.840
[Guest]: alongside where the power centers did not matter anymore.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:09.840
[Guest]: If you were earlier, and again, I go a little bit into like can, but earlier to become famous,

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:14.200
[Guest]: you know, fame, the idea of fame has always been associated with, you know, being in front

02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:17.400
[Guest]: of the camera, being in front of the screen at one point to become famous.

02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:20.760
[Guest]: And you see this in old Bollywood films, and you see this in films of your, where you see

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:28.560
[Guest]: like somebody coming to VT station, and Bombay is the city of dreams, right?

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:32.480
[Guest]: And that's where city of dreams, and you know, you will, you come to Bombay, you stand in

02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.400
[Guest]: a line somewhere, and like, you know, you do an audition, and maybe you become an actor

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:39.480
[Guest]: and Amitabh Bachchan's story is this, someone else's story is that, everyone has come to

02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:43.120
[Guest]: the station, went there, stood in this line, and one day he became a superstar.

02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:46.160
[Guest]: Then they go to bandstand and talk about the fact that I am now the king of the world,

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:47.160
[Guest]: right?

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:48.880
[Guest]: That's the story.

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:52.560
[Guest]: But you had to come to Bombay, you had to struggle in those lines, and many, many, many

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:54.160
[Guest]: did not make it, right?

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:55.960
[Guest]: And then reality TV happened.

02:30:55.960 --> 02:31:01.200
[Guest]: But reality TV, whether it was Indian Idol, Sarekama, and then of course, you know, roadies

02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:05.040
[Guest]: and all of these other shows, they said that you don't have to come to Bombay, we will

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:06.040
[Guest]: come to you.

02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:10.400
[Guest]: So we will come to your city, you still have to stand in line, but there'll be judges,

02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:13.640
[Guest]: and immediately they'll look at you and say, this person has the potential to be a star.

02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:16.600
[Guest]: And then you can be in front of the television and suddenly you'll be a star one day.

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:21.400
[Guest]: So suddenly, like it became closer home, I had that opportunity of becoming a star.

02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:27.520
[Guest]: And when the internet happened, even that, you didn't have to stand in line, you didn't

02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:34.080
[Guest]: have to even go to a city somewhere, you could be sitting in any part of the country, the

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:35.360
[Guest]: world.

02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:41.360
[Guest]: If you had an internet connection, which after, you know, Jio and after, you know, 4G happened

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:43.560
[Guest]: in our country, everybody kind of got one.

02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:49.960
[Guest]: If you have a phone, this is a new generation, which is, there is no generation before the

02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:53.200
[Guest]: present Gen Z generation that have anything in common.

02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.120
[Guest]: No two Indians are the same.

02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:58.000
[Guest]: Everybody has a different circumstance, different story, there's nothing unites us, nothing,

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.120
[Guest]: not one thing, colour, caste, creed, religion, everything is different, right?

02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:08.520
[Guest]: But for a new generation, the Gen Z of young people, everybody, no matter what social hierarchy

02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:12.040
[Guest]: you were in also had like a mobile phone, because of 4G and because of like just that

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:15.560
[Guest]: became your life, right, like you, everybody had to have a mobile phone, if you wanted

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:21.000
[Guest]: to do anything, any kind of work, any kind of like, so even the poorest of the poor would

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.800
[Guest]: have like some sort of a cell phone with which they would operate, right?

02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:29.880
[Guest]: And that phone in your hand became democracy in your hand, it became freedom in your hand,

02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:33.800
[Guest]: it became, you know, freedom of speech, freedom of expression in your hand, you know, YouTube

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:39.180
[Guest]: happened, YouTube still required a little bit of, YouTube is where you saw the first,

02:32:39.180 --> 02:32:44.280
[Guest]: you know, batch of folks who broke through and said, I don't have to worry about whether

02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:49.160
[Guest]: it was TVF, you know, whether it was AIB, we did Vifilm, we of course had a little bit

02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:53.600
[Guest]: of a lot of money, I mean, a lot of money and privilege in that sense, and access in

02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:56.920
[Guest]: that sense, but we made our first web shows at that point of time, there was all the bunch

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:59.100
[Guest]: of comedians who came from different places.

02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:03.200
[Guest]: And then you also had individual YouTubers, you had your Bhawanbhams of the world, you

02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:09.520
[Guest]: have your Prajakta Kohli's of the world, these people who are, who not really from any of

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:14.040
[Guest]: the power centers historically, they have not come from the richest of backgrounds,

02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:19.320
[Guest]: they're not from like a quote unquote elite, you know, upbringing, they have broken through

02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:23.280
[Guest]: just because their talent and they had consistently and they had passion and they wanted to do

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:24.280
[Guest]: it.

02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:28.920
[Guest]: They would not wait for, they wouldn't knock on a door, wait for someone to open it, they'd

02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:33.440
[Guest]: create, you know, doors, they would create the opportunities that stormed through it

02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:37.800
[Guest]: because the YouTube equalized everybody.

02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:42.500
[Guest]: At the same time, YouTube still required you to have like at least a certain sense of editing,

02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:46.320
[Guest]: you would still need to have editing, you'd still need to have, you know, either a camera

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:50.240
[Guest]: or a phone or, you know, a phone with like a good camera.

02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:55.360
[Guest]: So there was still a little bit of privilege required, still a little bit of like, class,

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.240
[Guest]: certain kind of class for you to belong to, to be able to make something for YouTube,

02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:03.120
[Guest]: which was long form, which was, which required a certain kind of skill that not, and not

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.800
[Guest]: everyone with privilege had, right?

02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:12.160
[Guest]: And then TikTok came and TikTok even broke through that.

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:19.680
[Guest]: You did not need anything apart from like any kind of a phone with a basic camera, nothing

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:23.920
[Guest]: else, nothing, nothing, nothing else, one 5G connection, one phone with a camera and

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.400
[Guest]: you can be, you can do whatever the hell you want.

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.080
[Guest]: You can, you can record yourself doing anything.

02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:30.740
[Guest]: You can instantly become famous.

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:38.240
[Guest]: You can instantly go viral, you know, it, it, it was the most democratic of any mediums

02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:41.320
[Guest]: of any art form we've ever had in India.

02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:44.800
[Guest]: No one before that, and you know, people would look down on it and say cringy and you know

02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.960
[Guest]: what, but that's a very classist way of looking at it.

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:51.660
[Guest]: You know, look at these people, you people would look at it to laugh at it.

02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:58.640
[Guest]: On the other hand, you look at it to see the, the talent, the, the ambition, the aspiration,

02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:04.800
[Guest]: the passion, the excitement, enthusiasm that no matter which background and circumstance

02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:09.240
[Guest]: you have from India and, and it had people from marginalized communities speaking up.

02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:15.200
[Guest]: You were seeing videos of like, you know, trans kids from like smaller towns in India,

02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:17.440
[Guest]: you know, expressing themselves.

02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:23.440
[Guest]: You had most of TikTok and some of the biggest early stars of TikTok were Muslim young kids,

02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:29.600
[Guest]: you know, and, and you can judge them for, you know, the content they were making.

02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.800
[Guest]: But before that, no one, they were not allowed to express because where would they do it?

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.200
[Guest]: You would require a certain amount of power and money.

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:42.320
[Guest]: And that's the only way expression was always, always, always, they were gatekeepers to expression

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:44.120
[Guest]: in our country and in the world.

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.840
[Guest]: And that's why I'm saying art has always been you, people, film snobs, people who call them

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:55.640
[Guest]: the film snobbish because you have a certain privilege and access to art in the first place.

02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:59.280
[Guest]: And if you look down on people who don't have that access or who did not have that access,

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:04.240
[Guest]: that's nothing but classism, you know, so TikTok broke through that classism.

02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:09.160
[Guest]: And of course, invited a certain kind of judgment, which also came from classism, but it was

02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:12.080
[Guest]: the first and only democratic medium.

02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:15.440
[Guest]: And when TikTok happened, and you know, when YouTube happened, and when you know, people

02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.600
[Guest]: started coming on the internet and expressing themselves as authentically as possible.

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:21.120
[Guest]: You see the correlation because I was there.

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:25.440
[Guest]: I can tell you the correlation at that time was that and I've been I've been on those

02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:26.440
[Guest]: panels.

02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:29.660
[Guest]: I've had those conversations 2014-15 with filmmakers saying that, you know, looking

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:33.000
[Guest]: at what is working on the internet and saying that, you know, maybe we should start talking

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.760
[Guest]: about the things that they're talking about, you know, and suddenly you had those stories

02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:41.000
[Guest]: that were suddenly socially conscious, they didn't just come out of the blue.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.480
[Guest]: Every filmmaker and producer who punted on those things, they punted on it because they

02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:50.120
[Guest]: realized that the internet is making those, you know, conversations happen and they were

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:53.360
[Guest]: happening very actively and it was engaging conversations.

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.160
[Guest]: People were watching YouTube videos on body positivity.

02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:59.560
[Guest]: So let we can do Dhamaka Ayesha, when you're watching films on, you know, a web show on

02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.760
[Guest]: man's world that I had done, which was which had which as I said, has like some 90 million

02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.960
[Guest]: views right now, across all its episodes, it is on gender inequality.

02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:12.200
[Guest]: And it's a and people watch that and you see the comments on that people are saying for

02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:14.920
[Guest]: the first time we are having this conversation.

02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:18.360
[Guest]: So when you do that, a Ki and Ka becomes possible and I'm not saying there's a direct.

02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:22.680
[Guest]: It's not like R. Balki saw that and said, let me make a Ki and Ka, but it would not

02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:23.680
[Guest]: have happened.

02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.520
[Guest]: Arjun Kapoor would not have, you know, five years ago, someone who's launched himself

02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.280
[Guest]: with Ishaq Zadeh would not have done a Ki and Ka where, you know, he's the house home

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:36.400
[Guest]: house husband, so to speak and homemaker and the woman is going and earning, but those

02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:39.120
[Guest]: conversations are happening because of the internet and because of YouTube and because

02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:40.600
[Guest]: of Tik Tok.

02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:44.240
[Guest]: If Tik Tok weren't banned, I feel like we would have seen a different and you saw you

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:50.080
[Guest]: saw a different kind of a young superstar that was rising, you know, who like the idea

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:55.960
[Guest]: of Vijay and Amitabh Bachchan and and the angry young man, you had a different kind

02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:01.880
[Guest]: of actual young boy with an identity who would you would not associate with a certain class

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:06.960
[Guest]: or a certain community or a certain idea of what should be a success successful name.

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.760
[Guest]: Maybe those names were not people think names that you would know how to pronounce because

02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:14.420
[Guest]: they would come from any different part of the country, you know, but the ban unfortunately

02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:19.000
[Guest]: like stopped it in its tracks and today again you have all these kind of platforms and it's

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:25.120
[Guest]: still still people are still people who go viral, they're still stars that kind of have

02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:29.680
[Guest]: overnight successes, you know, so to speak, but it's not you still it still comes from

02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:31.440
[Guest]: a certain class background.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:37.480
[Guest]: You kind of see that very obviously, you know, you you people who get internet culture people

02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:45.500
[Guest]: who have the wherewithal the the access again the privilege the the education the in jokes,

02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:49.920
[Guest]: you know to understand that this is what is going to work on the internet and doing it

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:54.480
[Guest]: you still have people, you know, and Amit Bhadana kind of, you know, in Haryanvi will

02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:59.280
[Guest]: do something you have like this really interesting platform by the folks who were actually, you

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:03.320
[Guest]: know, started, I forget the name of the organization, but we're in dreamers as well who started

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:04.320
[Amit Varma]: something.

02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.880
[Amit Varma]: They started witty feed and now they're on stage.

02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:07.360
[Amit Varma]: I had Vinay Singhal on my show.

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.960
[Guest]: Exactly Vinay Singhal, you know, again, they're doing such interesting work now, you know,

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:12.760
[Guest]: so what is the future of this?

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:18.560
[Guest]: I don't know, you know, the power structures are still very much based out of Bombay, Delhi,

02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:20.880
[Guest]: you know, the money flows through there.

02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:24.960
[Guest]: So but there is, you know, money that is also coming in and I'm sure that at some point

02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:25.960
[Guest]: they will notice.

02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:30.480
[Guest]: I saw that when I think either Praveen or Vinay, we're having a conversation online.

02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:35.560
[Guest]: I saw that they had come to Bombay too and they went to the sets of Nikhil Advani's show

02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:37.000
[Guest]: Mumbai Diaries.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.200
[Guest]: So clearly like filmmakers also taking note and saying like who are these interesting,

02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:46.240
[Guest]: you know, young people who are doing something in regional using the internet and ultimately

02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:51.440
[Guest]: they have access to communities and audiences that we may not have.

02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:57.840
[Guest]: So in the need to find those audiences, which they can obviously monetize, maybe our films

02:39:57.840 --> 02:39:58.920
[Guest]: will change.

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:03.080
[Guest]: But my big worry is that they're only going to change because South films are the biggest

02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:04.080
[Guest]: hits right now.

02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.720
[Guest]: So our films will also start again replicating the success formula of South films and South

02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:17.320
[Guest]: films and big blockbusters, unfortunately have never, you know, gotten, have never had

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:20.840
[Guest]: an evolved understanding of gender.

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:24.160
[Guest]: That's my worry that again, that'll make a big comeback again in Bollywood because that's

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:25.160
[Guest]: what's working.

02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:26.160
[Guest]: That's the formula.

02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.160
[Guest]: Everyone's right, right.

02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:28.160
[Guest]: And then we're going to go backward.

02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:34.360
[Amit Varma]: So in the very fascinating episode I did with Vinay, he pointed out one interesting thing.

02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:38.960
[Amit Varma]: He said that stage is doing so well that there's now a reverse migration.

02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Ki Haryana se ya Rajasthan se jo bachche aate the Bombay mein film banane ke liye, ab wapal

02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:46.000
[Amit Varma]: ja rahe hai because they can make it in their language.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.960
[Amit Varma]: And not just a language, their dialect, like I'd encourage all listeners who haven't already

02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:56.040
[Amit Varma]: heard it to listen to my episode with Vinay because the profound point there was about

02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:02.480
[Amit Varma]: how it was of a kind of localization, like I was always worried about homogenization

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:04.880
[Amit Varma]: happening in our society.

02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:09.520
[Amit Varma]: One point that Vinay made really well was ki shaher mein bhasha hoti hai, shaher ke

02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:10.840
[Amit Varma]: bahar boli hoti hai.

02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, a city will have a language and outside a city you'll have dialects.

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And the typical pressure used to be that a small kid will, like Vinay, born in a Haryanvi

02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:24.800
[Amit Varma]: village, he'll speak a particular dialect, but he'll go to the city and he'll feel inferior

02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.800
[Amit Varma]: because you know, everybody else seems more sophisticated outside and looking in border

02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.080
[Amit Varma]: wale like that beautiful term.

02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And the incentive will be to speak to Hindi and so all the dialects die out and that these

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:39.040
[Amit Varma]: main languages Hindi, Bengali and all of those remain.

02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:44.840
[Amit Varma]: But what is happening here is kind of the opposite, which is incredibly inspiring that,

02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:48.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, so many people tell him that they feel so empowered.

02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:51.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, people will go and tell him ki are all my life has spoken Haryanvi, but I was

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:53.040
[Amit Varma]: embarrassed about it.

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:56.660
[Amit Varma]: But now I'm feeling ki theek hai, no, I can take pride in my culture.

02:41:56.660 --> 02:41:59.720
[Amit Varma]: And it's an incredibly inspiring story.

02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:06.120
[Amit Varma]: And I completely agree so much with what you said about snobs, like no disrespect to snobs

02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:07.120
[Unknown]: intended.

02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:12.240
[Amit Varma]: But you know, one thing, one thing I tell my writing students also is that read whatever

02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.240
[Amit Varma]: you enjoy reading.

02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, koi hierarchy nahi hai, ki is bookne yeh prize jeeta hai, yeh toh somehow you got

02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:18.600
[Amit Varma]: to struggle through it.

02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:22.480
[Amit Varma]: No, everything that captures your attention is doing something right.

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:27.000
[Amit Varma]: You will learn from it, you will internalize that stuff by osmosis, you'll pick up those

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000
[Amit Varma]: tricks and all that.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:34.240
[Amit Varma]: I want to ask you a question about structure in the context of actual filmmaking, right?

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:39.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, to take a step back in the creator economy, one of the really heartening things that I've

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:44.440
[Amit Varma]: seen happening over the last decade or so, is what Kevin Kelly wrote about in his famous

02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:49.000
[Amit Varma]: essay, 1000 true fans has kind of happened, like Kevin Kelly wrote this cult essay around

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.280
[Amit Varma]: 2009 2010, called 1000 true fans.

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And his point was that creators will not have to scale anymore.

02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:01.040
[Amit Varma]: In the past, your model always has been ki aapko scale karna hai, right?

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:06.200
[Amit Varma]: So your top 1% of people make a lot of money, everybody else is struggling and you know,

02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:09.160
[Amit Varma]: having cutting chai in the tapris or varsova.

02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:12.960
[Amit Varma]: But his point was that now you don't have to scale a creator.

02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:18.720
[Amit Varma]: If you can find 1000 fans who pay you $100 a year, that's $100,000, right?

02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And when he wrote that, it wasn't happening.

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.020
[Amit Varma]: But he was very prescient, because it is happening today.

02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:27.880
[Amit Varma]: It is definitely happening today, like on Substack, for example, that $100 a year is

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:31.960
[Amit Varma]: your standard, this thing and all kinds of people who haven't been heard of before are

02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:34.060
[Amit Varma]: literally making millions doing that.

02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:36.680
[Amit Varma]: So it has completely become possible.

02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And in the audiovisual medium, the tools of production have become superbly democratized.

02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:48.840
[Amit Varma]: Really, anybody I think today, if they have the will, can actually make a film, right?

02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Like a one great example is a Japanese film, One Cut of the Dead, amazing film, which was

02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:58.640
[Amit Varma]: made for the equivalent of 20 lakhs and made the equivalent of 200 crores, something like

02:43:58.640 --> 02:43:59.640
[Amit Varma]: that.

02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:05.140
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, no film has really filled me with the joy of cinema, as that did.

02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:10.120
[Amit Varma]: So the thing is, you know, if you have the will, you can make a film for 20 lakhs now.

02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:12.360
[Amit Varma]: But the bottleneck is the distribution.

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And part of the problem there is, the model through which we consume cinema is this very

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:23.900
[Amit Varma]: weird model, where a lot of people congregate in a big hall and watch a film together, right?

02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:26.940
[Amit Varma]: And if you think about it in isolation, we've normalized that model.

02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:31.180
[Amit Varma]: But if you think about it in isolation, or if an alien had to come to this planet and

02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:36.440
[Amit Varma]: think about how do we entertain people, this would seem like a very stupid model, because

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:39.120
[Amit Varma]: this requires you to scale, right?

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, what we have seen creators doing in the audiovisual medium is you don't have to scale,

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.020
[Amit Varma]: you had TikTok, which you still have elsewhere, you have YouTube, YouTube creators don't need

02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:54.280
[Amit Varma]: to scale anymore, you know, but in terms of actual cinematic storytelling, this still

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:58.420
[Amit Varma]: seems like a fundamental bottleneck, ki aise kyu hai?

02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Maybe there's there are intermediate models, like you have small halls, which people can

02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:07.320
[Amit Varma]: just book online, pachas log kuch dekhna chahate hain, bees log kuch dekhna chahate hain, you

02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.320
[Amit Varma]: have a room somewhere.

02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:14.040
[Amit Varma]: What is also another trend that seems to be happening is that the kind of films which

02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:19.140
[Amit Varma]: succeed in big theatres are now the spectacle films which require the big theatres.

02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:25.320
[Amit Varma]: So your Marvel Cinematic Universe and RRR and all that, and the intimate cinema, you

02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:31.480
[Amit Varma]: expect that to move to OTT and all of that, toh Ingmar Bergman OTT pe aap dekho, aur you

02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.160
[Amit Varma]: know, Steven Spielberg aap hall pe jaake dekho.

02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, so what is your thought of this structurally?

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Because again, it seems that, you know, I feel like 15 years later, everything will

02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:44.160
[Amit Varma]: be different.

02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:47.120
[Amit Varma]: But we can't imagine how because it's unknown unknowns.

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:51.760
[Amit Varma]: But right now what we have is an artefact of the past that we are somehow kind of, you

02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:53.820
[Amit Varma]: know, still struggling with.

02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So my question is structurally, how do you think we can get past this?

02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:02.560
[Amit Varma]: The fact that the means of production are in everybody's hand, aap aur main agar ek

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:08.280
[Amit Varma]: idea karte hain, bana sakte hain in very little money, you know, but it will not find a thousand

02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:10.240
[Amit Varma]: true fans even if they exist.

02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:12.240
[Amit Varma]: The bottleneck is there.

02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:18.280
[Guest]: See, you are talking about structure purely because you're talking about film in the long

02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:20.640
[Guest]: form medium, right?

02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:26.760
[Guest]: But that is not the only way of making film now.

02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:31.480
[Guest]: What people are doing with one and a half minutes right now is also filmmaking, you

02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:38.720
[Guest]: know, and you can consume for one hour, you know, 30 of those, 40 of those videos or you

02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:44.080
[Guest]: can spend that one hour in watching one episode of a web show or you can spend, you know,

02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:50.080
[Guest]: James Gunn said this brilliant thing where he said that, you know, I mean, some of it

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:53.520
[Guest]: I'm going to add to it, but because I'm going to Indianize it, but like when you watch a

02:46:53.520 --> 02:47:00.080
[Guest]: film in India, let's say, let's say an example, you have to spend half a day of your time

02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:01.320
[Guest]: to go and watch that film.

02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:04.160
[Guest]: There's half a day of your life that you have to take away.

02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:08.720
[Guest]: It's a community experience because India mein films again, to go into the history,

02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:15.280
[Guest]: logic, et cetera, the highest crossing film in India at a 500, 700 crores, which is RRR

02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:19.400
[Guest]: or Bahubali has been watched by 4% of Indians in theaters.

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:24.600
[Guest]: That's how many people it takes to watch the highest crossing 4% of film people going to

02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:25.600
[Guest]: theaters.

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:30.840
[Guest]: Some of them are going for the second time, people, families in India go for films at

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:35.680
[Guest]: a, on a Diwali or an Eid or one of those, because it's an expensive medium.

02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:38.240
[Guest]: So it is community viewing because of that.

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:40.240
[Guest]: It isn't family outing.

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:42.480
[Guest]: You go to the park every day, which is free.

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:46.160
[Guest]: And then when you have a little bit of money for the middle class or, you know, upwardly

02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:50.840
[Guest]: mobile, you know, then you go and kind of, uh, go and watch a film, take your whole family

02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:55.600
[Guest]: and say, which is why the stars also happen because you go and watch the film of that

02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:00.160
[Guest]: one person that you kind of know historically, you will not go and watch the film of a younger

02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:01.160
[Guest]: person.

02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:04.840
[Guest]: And when nationalistic or patriotic films happened, they kind of, uh, you know, said

02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:09.520
[Guest]: you don't need to know who's in it as, because it is about your country or the issue that

02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:10.520
[Guest]: you care about.

02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:13.240
[Guest]: You're going as a community to watch that and say, okay, I want to know what happened

02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:14.240
[Guest]: to my community.

02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:16.840
[Guest]: So that is an example.

02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:23.400
[Guest]: So theaters in India and films that many people anyway don't watch very, very, very few people

02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:26.960
[Guest]: watch films, but because they're so big and there's so much money that is thrown at them

02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.500
[Guest]: and they're so visible.

02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:33.920
[Guest]: You have this, the reason in India that people are supersized because of satellite and now

02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:35.720
[Guest]: because of the internet.

02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:41.360
[Guest]: But before it was satellite, when we film would come to TV, TV rights for films go up

02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.480
[Guest]: to 50, 60, 70 crores because that is because TV was in every home theater is not.

02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:50.080
[Guest]: Everybody cannot afford the theater because and there's a half a day.

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:51.080
[Guest]: Think about it, right?

02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:54.600
[Guest]: Like, you know, you are going from one place to another place and traffic you are signing,

02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:58.280
[Guest]: you know, I mean, okay, you buy a ticket online, but you, if you have to buy popcorn, that's

02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:02.120
[Guest]: another, this money also gone thousand rupees for this popcorn, but if you're not buying

02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:06.400
[Guest]: it, you go sit inside the theater, you have to wait for 15 minutes by the rides, you know,

02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.760
[Guest]: and then finally after like one and a half hours of you just waiting or two hours, maybe

02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:15.200
[Guest]: sometimes you just kind of get to watch the film, then you see, you know, the first time

02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:18.120
[Guest]: and then you're like, oh my God, I've just wasted my entire day because I've spent this

02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:19.520
[Guest]: money and this is a bad film.

02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:22.360
[Guest]: So you lose and you don't just lose time and money.

02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:26.480
[Guest]: Yes, you don't just lose money, you lose almost a half a day of your life, after which you

02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:28.800
[Guest]: have to go finish it because you're paid for it.

02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:29.800
[Guest]: You don't even leave midway.

02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:36.440
[Guest]: So at the end of it, you go back and then six hours of your life gone.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:40.200
[Guest]: You know, on the other hand, on the internet, you have the privilege and the power that

02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:45.360
[Guest]: if you just sample something on Netflix, on Amazon, on any of these platforms, if you

02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:46.360
[Guest]: lose, it's okay.

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:47.360
[Guest]: You're watching three, four minutes.

02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:48.360
[Guest]: I don't like this.

02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.360
[Guest]: I'll go to watch something else.

02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:51.640
[Guest]: So you're not really losing that much time, just three to four minutes.

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:55.680
[Guest]: But if you win, which is like if you see something that you love, then you suddenly win 10 hours

02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:56.680
[Guest]: of it.

02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:57.680
[Guest]: You have like 10 episodes.

02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:58.680
[Guest]: You're like, oh great.

02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:59.920
[Guest]: Now my whole weekend is sorted.

02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:03.160
[Guest]: Now I can watch this and binge it and do like one, two, three, four.

02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.840
[Guest]: So it's a victory or defeat that people psychologically feel when, you know, and why right now people

02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:12.880
[Guest]: are much more comfortable with watching films, you know, at home versus in theater.

02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:19.680
[Guest]: So as an idea also, I just, I think I, I don't, I don't think that it's a, I don't believe

02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:24.960
[Guest]: that films have ever been structurally, the long form has been that important.

02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:30.480
[Guest]: It has been a means of entertainment for people, you know, and entertainment today is people

02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:32.080
[Guest]: are competing for time.

02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:38.120
[Guest]: They are not competing for, you know, entertainment as an example, right?

02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:43.560
[Guest]: A theater is competing with Facebook, which is competing with TikTok, which is competing

02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:47.800
[Guest]: with, I mean, I'm talking about obsolete mediums now, but it is completely Insta Reels, which

02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:53.560
[Guest]: is competing with a standup show, which is competing with a, with a, you know, a music

02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:57.980
[Guest]: live performance, which is competing with a spoken word, which is competing with cat

02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:01.960
[Guest]: videos on YouTube that you're just scrolling through mindlessly or Insta stories that you're

02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:02.960
[Guest]: going through.

02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:06.480
[Guest]: Your time is the commodity that everybody's after, right?

02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:11.080
[Guest]: And, and, and the idea of entertainment also for most people now has been because especially

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:18.280
[Guest]: after the pandemic is now this, we are so conditioned to need and consume and inhale

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:24.200
[Guest]: this entertainment that us, you, if you get up right now and walk out, I will immediately

02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:28.240
[Guest]: have my phone, not just to see, like, maybe I'll see my messages and what, then that's

02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:29.240
[Guest]: the first 30 seconds.

02:51:29.240 --> 02:51:32.720
[Guest]: But after that, I'm immediately going and seeing Insta stories or going through Twitter.

02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Why?

02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:35.280
[Amit Varma]: I should get up and walk out with your phone.

02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:38.840
[Guest]: Like, otherwise, I don't know what to do with myself.

02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:43.120
[Guest]: Immediate reaction, anybody's instant reaction, the moment, like you're in a deep conversation

02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:46.360
[Guest]: and somebody has, wait, I have a, you know, I have one second of work, the phone comes

02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:49.880
[Guest]: out and the phone, you're not, as I said, you're not just checking it for information

02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:52.840
[Guest]: or somebody's reaching or am I reachable or not reachable?

02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:53.840
[Guest]: That might be the first instance.

02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:58.080
[Guest]: The second instance, what can I see in like nibbles of entertainment?

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:02.720
[Guest]: So we do a lot of research at you also, we do a, we have a whole research vertical.

02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:09.680
[Guest]: So we kind of divide it into, you know, food into, so we divided entertainment, you know,

02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:12.620
[Guest]: categories for young people into how they consume.

02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:16.800
[Guest]: So this nibble content, nibble content is the kind of content that you are mindlessly

02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:19.040
[Guest]: consuming in between conversations.

02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:23.760
[Guest]: Sometimes I might be talking to you and I might just kind of open the, while you said

02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:27.240
[Guest]: something and I'm just like, okay, I might open a phone, just see three stories and keep

02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:28.680
[Guest]: that's nibble content.

02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:33.280
[Guest]: Then you have, you have your, you know, snacks, snacky content, where you have, where you

02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:37.240
[Guest]: go to, instead of Insta story, you might go to YouTube because you have a 10 minute windows

02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:38.360
[Guest]: somewhere in between.

02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:42.560
[Guest]: You might be traveling, you might be, you know, in a college, in a class, etc.

02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:46.400
[Guest]: And then you have 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, you might see a YouTube video,

02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:51.520
[Guest]: you might see 5-6 Insta Reels today, you might have any other form of entertainment.

02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:57.280
[Guest]: Then you have your full meal content, which is the time you actually with your, at the

02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:02.160
[Guest]: time when you are having food, when you are with your family, you see, you decide to say

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:09.080
[Guest]: that I will watch a series now or like a long form, you know, piece of fiction or whatever

02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:10.080
[Guest]: it is.

02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:15.040
[Guest]: And every bit of our life now is filled with entertainment.

02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:17.360
[Guest]: Structures don't matter anymore.

02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:23.800
[Guest]: And to your point about why we why there is this stupid idea of, you know, going to theaters.

02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:28.120
[Guest]: I mean, I already told you that it was a community experience, because that's how you, you know,

02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:31.760
[Guest]: families would go and families have historically gone and you know, it's an outing for the

02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:33.240
[Guest]: whole family when you go and watch a film.

02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:38.360
[Guest]: But outside of that, it is one of the last few places now to I think it's become even

02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:39.360
[Guest]: more important.

02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:41.840
[Guest]: One of the last few places where you have a collective experience, where else are you

02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:46.080
[Guest]: having collective human experiences and when you are watching a film in theater, why is

02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:47.080
[Guest]: it so important?

02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:48.080
[Guest]: How do you feel?

02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:49.080
[Guest]: I feel it's important.

02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:50.080
[Guest]: I don't think it is.

02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:51.240
[Guest]: I don't think it is necessary.

02:53:51.240 --> 02:53:52.920
[Guest]: I don't think that I think it is.

02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:56.960
[Guest]: It is becoming obsolete and and I hope it doesn't die.

02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:01.720
[Guest]: But I think it is very important because that collective experience of laughing, crying,

02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:06.560
[Guest]: the thrill of a horror film, everybody collectively gasping when you're watching something makes

02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:08.400
[Guest]: you again feel less alone.

02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:12.040
[Guest]: You're kind of you realize that you're part of a human race, you are part of it's beautiful.

02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:15.840
[Guest]: I think it's just so beautiful when you are, you know, when there's an emotional scene

02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:19.720
[Guest]: and you have tears in your eyes and you hear another person sniffing and you're like, okay,

02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:23.480
[Guest]: I'm not alone in like feeling sad or emotional at this point.

02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:27.800
[Guest]: I think that's a very important part of a human experience that we can only get while

02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:34.760
[Guest]: watching live, either watching a music performance or watching a sports match or, you know, in

02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:39.240
[Guest]: a theater, but there's no other place where you can have a collective human experience

02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:40.240
[Guest]: like that.

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:42.200
[Guest]: So it is important only for that reason.

02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:43.200
[Guest]: No other reason.

02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:44.200
[Guest]: Necessary?

02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:45.200
[Guest]: No, I don't think anymore.

02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:46.200
[Guest]: I don't think it doesn't matter anymore.

02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:51.640
[Guest]: You know, even a 30 second Instagram reel is a film.

02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:55.920
[Guest]: And if anybody says it's not film, again, I think it's coming from place of elitism.

02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:57.520
[Guest]: If you're saying that, oh, it's too easy.

02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:58.520
[Guest]: It's not easy.

02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:01.560
[Guest]: I, I tried making it difficult.

02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:02.560
[Guest]: It is.

02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:09.560
[Guest]: And young people are inherently recognizing the power and potential of these 30 seconders

02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:15.080
[Guest]: to and saying such interesting things, they're doing it in such interesting ways.

02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:21.320
[Guest]: They're I mean, the talent on like these short form mediums is incredible.

02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:23.000
[Guest]: Who are we to say this is not a film?

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.000
[Guest]: It is a film.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000
[Guest]: It is very much a film.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:33.040
[Guest]: So, I mean, yeah, I feel like, I feel like, you know, we the future of overall film is,

02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:39.800
[Guest]: is, is these broken down things, you know, I feel which is and while we need those larger

02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:47.240
[Guest]: experiences when it comes to I think, I think in the internet and particularly now places

02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:51.200
[Guest]: like stage, as you said, you know, are going to fill those needs where again, you're talking

02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:58.840
[Guest]: about indie films, you know, coming on or the Bergman films, you know, coming on the

02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.000
[Guest]: internet that's actually stopped happening already.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.800
[Guest]: So you don't have more indie films anymore on these mediums, you actually have far more

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:12.800
[Guest]: masala films because because and this is another thing that I've kind of realized that people

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:19.560
[Guest]: what people don't go to people don't watch these films because they're great content

02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:25.080
[Guest]: on YouTube on by paying subscription, they watch these films because they're bad films

02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:28.960
[Guest]: and you don't when you have and you watch it because they're mindless.

02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:32.600
[Guest]: You watch it because you don't, you know, you're, you're not wasting money.

02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.840
[Guest]: It's almost free and you're watching free, mindless, stupid content.

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:42.520
[Guest]: You don't, it's very rare now to have intimate and experiences with cinema.

02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:47.480
[Guest]: Again those are, those are art and I would love, I would love for us to have more of

02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:48.480
[Guest]: those experiences.

02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:50.360
[Guest]: I miss those experiences.

02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:56.160
[Guest]: I grew up in the nineties on indie films and indie expression and clerks, you know, to

02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:00.960
[Guest]: Steven Soderbergh to Kevin Smith and all the folks, you know, Sofia Coppola, all the folks

02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:05.760
[Guest]: and their beautiful, beautiful films as an indie Richard Linklater, of course, one of

02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:13.280
[Guest]: my heroes, you know, but but those films now, you know, maybe need to be self-distributed.

02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:16.600
[Guest]: Platforms are not going to pick those films anymore because platforms are going to offer

02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:20.920
[Guest]: the thing that is going to make you stay there and what makes you stay on most of these platforms

02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:25.440
[Guest]: after your tired day where you have worked your ass off, you're sitting with your family

02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:31.520
[Guest]: and you're not trying to just have a good time is mindless, stupid films, you're throwing

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.680
[Amit Varma]: so many insight bombs that I am already feeling nostalgic for this conversation, even though

02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:38.680
[Amit Varma]: we haven't even reached the break yet.

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:44.040
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of things that what you just said reminded me of it fully from like gender empathy

02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:48.880
[Guest]: into like the skill passion that we will very much get back to that.

02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:51.720
[Guest]: No, but I'm just saying I, this is the other aspect and facet.

02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:56.560
[Guest]: I just love, I just love storytelling and filmmaking.

02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:58.280
[Guest]: It's just something that I that drives me a lot.

02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:03.680
[Amit Varma]: So what you just said about, you know, the mindless films and, you know, reminded me

02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:08.400
[Amit Varma]: of something the economist Rashmini Deshpande said on my show, where she said that her father

02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:11.320
[Amit Varma]: once taught her that there are four kinds of films.

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:17.000
[Amit Varma]: There are good, good films, good, bad films, bad, good films and bad, bad films.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And the good, good film is a film that is trying to do something worthy and it succeeds.

02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:25.080
[Amit Varma]: So that is your Bergman films, Fellini films, so on and so forth.

02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'm big fans of those guys.

02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:33.080
[Amit Varma]: The bad, good film is a film that is trying to do something like that, but is basically

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:37.520
[Amit Varma]: boring the pants out of you, which I would say is like money call on, you know, that

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:51.000
[Amit Varma]: then a good, bad film is a film that technically you're not supposed to watch guilty pleasure,

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:52.000
[Amit Varma]: but it's mind blowing.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.000
[Amit Varma]: You just love it.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.440
[Amit Varma]: Like you have spoken, I think in the past of Andaz Apna Apna is one of your, you know,

02:58:56.440 --> 02:58:57.440
[Guest]: that's a good, good film.

02:58:57.440 --> 02:58:58.440
[Guest]: That's a good, good film.

02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.440
[Guest]: High art.

02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:00.440
[Amit Varma]: I agree.

02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:01.440
[Amit Varma]: The moment I said it, I, yeah.

02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:06.680
[Unknown]: But like a gunda perhaps, you know, or disco dancer, yeah, could be good, bad films and

02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:08.760
[Amit Varma]: a bad, bad film is just bad in every way.

02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:13.320
[Amit Varma]: So I think the good, bad films are the kind of mindless time pass, which people would

02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:14.320
[Amit Varma]: really enjoy.

02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:18.400
[Amit Varma]: And I also agree about not thinking in the boxes that we are used to thinking in.

02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:22.760
[Amit Varma]: Like we tend to think in an hierarchy of forms that if you're a writer, your book is at the

02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:26.000
[Amit Varma]: top, you know, blog post will be at the bottom.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And like, you know, when one of the points I made while I was talking to a mutual friend

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:35.560
[Amit Varma]: Mahima before she started a great newsletter was why does it have to be a book?

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:40.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, newsletter is such a good form and, you know, and she's made so much out of it.

02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:45.600
[Amit Varma]: And so that is something where I completely sort of agree with you.

02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:50.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm really fascinated by nibble, snack, full meal, you know, double click on that some

02:59:50.480 --> 02:59:51.480
[Amit Varma]: other time.

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:56.680
[Amit Varma]: But before we go into a break, you know, that point you made about collective experience

02:59:56.680 --> 02:59:59.020
[Amit Varma]: in theater is a beautiful point, right?

02:59:59.020 --> 03:00:02.600
[Amit Varma]: Because anywhere else, like you go to a cafe and there are groups of people sitting together,

03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:07.200
[Amit Varma]: but a lot of the time, you'll have a group of four looking into their phones, not into

03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:08.200
[Unknown]: each other's eyes.

03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:09.200
[Unknown]: It's not collective anymore.

03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:12.360
[Amit Varma]: While in a cinema hall, everyone else is feeling the same thing.

03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:16.640
[Amit Varma]: So I often I cry easily at movies, right?

03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'm always embarrassed and trying to cover it up because hey, men aren't supposed to

03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:21.520
[Amit Varma]: cry.

03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Right?

03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:23.520
[Guest]: Does that happen to you too?

03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you pay attention to that do you try to hide it?

03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:27.720
[Guest]: I'm very conscious of it.

03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:32.960
[Guest]: And my wife is Daisy, her name is, and she's, she knows that I cry in movies.

03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:36.800
[Guest]: Every time I cry, she, I feel she feels for me.

03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:38.600
[Guest]: So she just looks at me as if like, it should be okay.

03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:41.240
[Guest]: And I'm just like, let me have this experience.

03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:42.240
[Guest]: Don't stare at me when I'm crying.

03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:43.240
[Unknown]: I just want to cry.

03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:48.000
[Guest]: I don't want to like, have someone look at me when I'm crying, you know, and, and, and

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:52.240
[Guest]: I mean, there's to tie everything, you know, so far that we've been speaking together.

03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:53.240
[Guest]: I can't cry otherwise.

03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:55.740
[Guest]: I mean, I can't cry.

03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:59.240
[Guest]: If I want to cry right now, I will try my best when I can't cry.

03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:04.720
[Guest]: And when I feel really, and this is just, I mean, so sad when I even say it out loud,

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:10.960
[Guest]: but when I feel really like sad, and I want to cry, I didn't go and watch an emotional

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:12.960
[Guest]: film so that I will have tears.

03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:19.320
[Guest]: So I'm like, at least this is the way that I'm able to, that is the level of toxic that

03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:27.120
[Guest]: masculinity is in me, conditioned in me, that I am unable to cry otherwise.

03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:35.360
[Guest]: When my grandfather passed away, and I was as close to him, I, and in fact, the reason

03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:39.720
[Guest]: that I came to NID Kurukshetra was because it's next to Karnal.

03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:42.280
[Guest]: And my grandfather and my maasi lived in Karnal.

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:46.040
[Guest]: And I wanted to spend, I'd never, I loved my grandfather, but never spent any time with

03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:47.040
[Guest]: him.

03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:48.040
[Guest]: So I wanted to live close to him.

03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:49.040
[Guest]: And then weekends I would spend with him.

03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:51.760
[Guest]: So I was like, very fortunate to have gotten some time with him.

03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:58.360
[Guest]: When he died, for two days, I couldn't cry, just could not cry.

03:01:58.360 --> 03:01:59.360
[Guest]: Why?

03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:04.600
[Guest]: Because I was, my maasi was crying nonstop, just consoling her.

03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:07.960
[Guest]: I was just like, suddenly I fell into the duty of my man.

03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:10.880
[Guest]: Okay, my manly duty is that I have to take care of all the guests.

03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:12.500
[Guest]: My maasi is in no condition.

03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:14.320
[Guest]: So I will take care of all the arrangements.

03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:17.400
[Guest]: I'll tell you, tell me what she's, it's not that she wasn't doing, she was doing a lot

03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:20.040
[Guest]: of stuff herself, but she was broken.

03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.120
[Guest]: And her, my uncle hadn't reached yet.

03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:25.280
[Guest]: My mother from Barain hadn't reached yet.

03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:27.280
[Guest]: Nobody had been able to reach at that time.

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:35.520
[Guest]: So a whole day, day and a half, I was just taking care of all the duties of the, of a

03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:42.120
[Guest]: household where someone's passed away without, when my friends came to be like, we're sorry

03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:44.960
[Guest]: from Kurukshetra, you know, how are you feeling, et cetera.

03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:48.640
[Guest]: And I'm like, sad, didn't have tears.

03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:54.760
[Guest]: It's only when one and a half days later, when my mother and I got a quiet moment and

03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:59.960
[Guest]: my mother just asked me, how are you feeling that I burst into tears.

03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:07.960
[Guest]: I was, and then I was inconsolable because just that moment of her reaching out and actually

03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:10.200
[Guest]: caring about my own emotion and being like, how are you feeling?

03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:12.480
[Guest]: I was just like, that's it.

03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:13.680
[Guest]: I just had tears.

03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:15.480
[Guest]: But I can't cry otherwise.

03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:17.160
[Guest]: It's very difficult for me to cry.

03:03:17.160 --> 03:03:26.320
[Guest]: I yeah, and, and, and films have, and that is also why I am, I, I love film so much because

03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:32.840
[Guest]: as a man, I'm able to feel things and feel emotions or give space to those emotions that

03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:36.880
[Guest]: I'm otherwise hiding away or I'm otherwise suppressing.

03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:44.120
[Guest]: So, so films have been the most important friend that I've had growing up.

03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:52.360
[Guest]: It has, it has, it has been, yeah, films and shows and, you know, art, cinema, whatever

03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:55.080
[Guest]: you want to call it, have been like a lifesaver for me.

03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:59.960
[Guest]: It made me in a world where I was struggling to fit in, it helped me like find a space

03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:04.160
[Guest]: for a man who was trying to cry, but not able to.

03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:06.960
[Amit Varma]: Then Shah Rukh Khan films happened.

03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:12.920
[Amit Varma]: Okay, wrong reason to cry, I guess, you know, his acting is so bad, that would make me cry.

03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:15.280
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan is the love language of India.

03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And you've, you've, you've spoken to Shahana, absolutely.

03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:23.160
[Guest]: And a book is just such a great book.

03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:24.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a great book.

03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's also my most popular episode so far.

03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's a great metaphor, you know, a cinema hall, a cinema, you know, men crying in the

03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:32.400
[Amit Varma]: dark together.

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:33.440
[Amit Varma]: That's such a great metaphor.

03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:38.600
[Amit Varma]: On that note, let's go for a break.

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:46.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:51.200
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009, and became somewhat popular at the time.

03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:53.480
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me.

03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:01.160
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced to think about many different things

03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:03.480
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

03:05:03.480 --> 03:05:06.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:11.200
[Amit Varma]: Only now, I'm doing it through a newsletter.

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:17.240

[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:47.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:51.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Nikhil Taneja about his fascinating life and work and so on.

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And let's now come back to sort of the chronological narrative.

03:05:57.240 --> 03:06:03.120
[Amit Varma]: You pointed out key engineering was basically your gap years, where you were figuring out

03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:04.640
[Amit Varma]: what to do with your life.

03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:07.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about this process.

03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:12.280
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, when I look back on my college years, and when I speak to others as well

03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:17.320
[Amit Varma]: who've come on the show, what I find is key, there are two kinds of pulls and pressures

03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:18.320
[Amit Varma]: happening.

03:06:18.320 --> 03:06:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And one is you want to fit in with your peers, you want to fit in with the cool boys or you

03:06:22.240 --> 03:06:26.720
[Amit Varma]: want to, you know, so you're molding yourself to kind of fit in or to whatever, you know,

03:06:26.720 --> 03:06:29.920
[Amit Varma]: similar to the pressure of being a man in a sense.

03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:34.720
[Amit Varma]: And the other is you're trying to figure yourself out, find yourself and very often you're constructing

03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:40.200
[Amit Varma]: for yourself a self image of what you want to be seen as rather than trying to actually

03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:42.920
[Amit Varma]: understand who you really are.

03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Now I'm guessing that since you landed up there as the NRI cool boy, I guess that pressure

03:06:47.320 --> 03:06:51.080
[Amit Varma]: would not have been so intense, the first pressure of fitting in and so on.

03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:58.760
[Amit Varma]: But through your life, how has that process been of getting to understand yourself a little

03:06:58.760 --> 03:06:59.760
[Amit Varma]: better?

03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:04.440
[Amit Varma]: You've already spoken about how the therapy you did later on in dealing with anxiety kind

03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:07.520
[Amit Varma]: of helped with an aspect of that.

03:07:07.520 --> 03:07:13.400
[Amit Varma]: But in general, take me through this process of understanding who you are and what you

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:16.640
[Amit Varma]: are and coming to terms with it.

03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:23.480
[Guest]: I don't think that I had the self-awareness of any kind of self-awareness about myself

03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:34.240
[Guest]: when I was younger, when I was in college, you know, as I said, I think the three and

03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:39.880
[Guest]: a half years for me were again, once I found out that it was all about like, now what can

03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:40.880
[Guest]: I do with my time?

03:07:40.880 --> 03:07:45.560
[Guest]: And as I said, I started writing, I started furiously, you know, there's this incident

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:50.600
[Guest]: that happened much later, which was actually quite like sweet when I met a college friend

03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:51.600
[Guest]: many years later.

03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:54.600
[Guest]: And, you know, I was in Hindustan three, four years after college, I was still in Hindustan

03:07:54.600 --> 03:08:00.000
[Guest]: and I was earning a lot of, not earning too much again, you know, 14 and a half thousand

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:05.120
[Guest]: for two and a half years in Bombay, you know, it's just tough.

03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:07.760
[Guest]: I met like a friend who had gone to US after that.

03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:12.320
[Guest]: And he came back from the US and just came for a visit or something.

03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:16.880
[Guest]: And I just met him and I was just, he's like, how's life, I was like, I'm not really happy

03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:17.880
[Guest]: right now.

03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:21.880
[Guest]: Because he's like, because I'm not earning the money, you know, I don't know if I'll

03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:23.880
[Guest]: be successful or not.

03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:27.920
[Guest]: And he's not someone I kind of was very close with, you know, he's just someone like I was

03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:30.440
[Guest]: friends with, but not very close friends with.

03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:32.360
[Guest]: So he just said, he's like, are you mad?

03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:34.320
[Guest]: You're going, you know, it's like, why, what happened?

03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:39.560
[Guest]: He's like, he's like, I haven't, you were the only person in our college where all of

03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:46.120
[Guest]: us were, you know, we used to drink and study, so we sat in our room, you were churning out

03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:51.360
[Guest]: issues of your magazine, you know, you were the only one who was, who was late till three

03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:57.280
[Guest]: o'clock in the, in the night, trying to make something out of your life, while the rest

03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:01.040
[Guest]: of us were, you know, just doing nonsense.

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:04.200
[Guest]: And there is, even if you're not successful right now, there's no chance you won't be

03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:05.200
[Guest]: in the future.

03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:10.040
[Guest]: So I feel like, as I said, I still have some, you know, until like someone else tells me,

03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:15.440
[Guest]: I never look at myself as like, you know, I'm doing enough for whatever reasons.

03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:19.520
[Guest]: And it just hit me that, yeah, that's, that's been my college, you know, I actually, so

03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:26.680
[Guest]: I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I don't have, I've never had any of these,

03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:27.680
[Amit Varma]: you know.

03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:38.200
[Guest]: I take four numbers of girls, which is clearly the vice, you know, for a lot of people there.

03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:44.800
[Guest]: But, but yeah, like, you know, I just, beyond a point, I didn't have enough things, you

03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:48.760
[Guest]: know, times or reasons to hang out with, you know, you hang out with your friends until

03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:52.440
[Guest]: they start drinking, because after they're drinking, then it's just a drunken conversation

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:55.380
[Guest]: where you are the sober person, you're like, what am I doing here?

03:09:55.380 --> 03:09:57.120
[Guest]: So you don't have those conversations.

03:09:57.120 --> 03:09:58.120
[Guest]: I did.

03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:01.160
[Guest]: Although, on the other hand, I think while I didn't learn much about myself, I learned

03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:05.960
[Guest]: a lot about India, you know, because, again, fortunately, unfortunately, there's no LAN

03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:09.520
[Guest]: in our, this is 2004 to 2008.

03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:10.520
[Guest]: That's where I studied.

03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:13.440
[Guest]: 2000, there was no LAN in our college.

03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:16.560
[Guest]: And there was only like one computer center where you had internet.

03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:21.920
[Guest]: So in your hostel, and because Haryana and North India, and there's always power cuts.

03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:27.120
[Guest]: So every night for one and a half hours, the electricity would just go off.

03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:28.500
[Guest]: And then what do you do?

03:10:28.500 --> 03:10:30.600
[Guest]: Your phone at that time, again, was expensive.

03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:34.760
[Guest]: So you can't call people until I think my third year things became inexpensive and you

03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:37.600
[Guest]: had free calling and free messaging, or whatever.

03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:39.720
[Guest]: And that's the year I made a girlfriend.

03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:41.880
[Guest]: So clearly, thank you Airtel.

03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:47.680
[Guest]: But before that, you didn't even know enough, I mean, while you had that one number after

03:10:47.680 --> 03:10:51.720
[Guest]: that incident, I was like, I'm never calling a woman in my life now.

03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:54.880
[Guest]: But so what did you do?

03:10:54.880 --> 03:10:59.560
[Guest]: And I kind of started after like getting really bored and, you know, talking to my roommates

03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:02.800
[Guest]: and my roommates, I didn't really get along within the first couple of I mean, decent

03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:05.680
[Guest]: people just didn't have much in common.

03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:10.520
[Guest]: I started recognizing that, you know, well, I'm in this campus where there are these people

03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:14.000
[Guest]: from all over the country, from every state of India.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:18.160
[Guest]: I have every day there's a power cut, I have nothing to do, nobody can do anything in first

03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:19.160
[Guest]: year.

03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:25.880
[Guest]: So maybe I'll just go and like, find the stories of others, right?

03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:29.440
[Guest]: And it wasn't like a conscious, like, I'm going to find the stories of others.

03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:31.880
[Guest]: It was more like, let me just go and chat with other people, right?

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:35.120
[Guest]: So I just go up to somebody's room and like, I've never met and just knock on their door

03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:43.560
[Guest]: and be like, you know, we stayed the same, you know, yeah, same hostel or the same floor

03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:45.160
[Guest]: or whatever it is.

03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:47.200
[Guest]: And we've never spoken.

03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:51.760
[Guest]: So yeah, I'm Nikhil and this is where I'm from, I'd love to know a little bit about

03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:52.760
[Guest]: you.

03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:55.040
[Guest]: And then suddenly, like some of those conversations would go nowhere, people were just also not

03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:56.040
[Guest]: very open.

03:11:56.040 --> 03:11:59.400
[Guest]: And then some of them would just turn into like really deep conversations.

03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:03.520
[Guest]: And and sometimes I would have it only once in like, I've spoken to some people during

03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:08.440
[Guest]: power cuts once and never spoken to them again, beyond hi, hello for the rest of my college

03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:09.440
[Guest]: life.

03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:13.680
[Guest]: But that one conversation was deep enough for me to kind of, you know, like if I if

03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:17.680
[Guest]: we ever see each other in public, we hug the hell out of each other and just be like, Oh,

03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:20.120
[Guest]: my God, like, so great to see you after all these years.

03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:26.600
[Guest]: So because of that, I kind of got a sense and understanding of, you know, the stories

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:27.600
[Guest]: of others.

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:31.040
[Guest]: And I think that helped me recognize a little bit of our own story as well.

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.080
[Guest]: I didn't know what stories were, I didn't know that, you know, like, again, self awareness

03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:39.920
[Guest]: neither you didn't have the internet, I, you didn't, as even though I was writing for a

03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:45.040
[Guest]: newspaper, you know, or a magazine at that time, even at that time, I did not have like

03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:47.640
[Guest]: Chetan Bhagat did not exist at that time.

03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:53.360
[Guest]: Even at that time, there was no example, a public example of, you know, people who could

03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:54.920
[Guest]: have stories like mine.

03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:57.960
[Guest]: And most of the stories I would hear of people who kind of did the other thing, right?

03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:02.440
[Guest]: So you kind of also connected with that somebody who's a lovely singer, I would find out, you

03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:03.760
[Guest]: know, who's come from this.

03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:07.320
[Guest]: But the reason that I'm like, why don't you go into one of these reality shows and like,

03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:11.840
[Guest]: you know, try singing, just be like, I'm the only child of my family.

03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:15.240
[Guest]: And or I'm the, you know, elder son of my family.

03:13:15.240 --> 03:13:18.920
[Guest]: And my aim is to make it to Microsoft.

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:23.880
[Guest]: Because that's the way I mean, I need to my parents have put so much money, you know,

03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:26.600
[Guest]: I need to be the return on investment for them.

03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:29.240
[Guest]: And for whatever it was that boy is in Microsoft now.

03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.200
[Guest]: And you know, he's made it but he's a beautiful singing voice, which I don't know if anybody

03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:37.560
[Guest]: will ever get to listen to beyond like, the close circle of friends that he may have,

03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:40.120
[Guest]: which is also okay, you know, I mean, sure.

03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:43.560
[Guest]: But I'm just saying like, so many stories that I would hear from so many people from

03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:47.920
[Guest]: all these different parts of India, there's a boy from like, Jammu and Kashmir.

03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:53.600
[Guest]: That I was, it just helped me recognize that, there are so many stories, you know, and every

03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:59.880
[Guest]: story kind of has a, you know, starts with, you know, I mean, nobody really knows where

03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:00.880
[Guest]: it's leading.

03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:06.600
[Guest]: Nobody is aware that, you know, which act of our stories are we are in.

03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:12.920
[Guest]: But there is something there, you know, that, that somewhere makes you recognize that you

03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:19.240
[Guest]: are also a story, you know, where I feel like all of us look at each, I mean, so NID Gurushekhar

03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:24.640
[Guest]: also how we call each other, you know, after a point of time, either we make boys by surname,

03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:31.920
[Guest]: but in our culture, you know, you start calling from wherever you are, so the boy from Bareta,

03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:33.480
[Guest]: you know, is called Bareta.

03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:39.280
[Guest]: The boy from Jammu is called Jammu, you know, Jammu, come here, Bareta, come here.

03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:40.280
[Amit Varma]: So what was yours?

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:41.280
[Guest]: Barain?

03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:45.800
[Guest]: Yeah, no, Barain for a, you know, a long time, it was Barain Nidhokarnal, but after, as I

03:14:45.800 --> 03:14:49.320
[Guest]: said, like for me, for whatever reason, I was always seen as like this.

03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:54.800
[Guest]: So people would typically call me Taneja or close people would call me like whatever Motu

03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:55.800
[Guest]: etc.

03:14:55.800 --> 03:15:00.880
[Guest]: But I started looking at realizing that every one of them with whatever names or whatever

03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:07.760
[Guest]: labels they were given, there was a story about them that nobody would know that, you

03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:11.120
[Guest]: know, if you just didn't ask them, everyone had a stereotype.

03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:15.880
[Guest]: There's a backbencher, there's a frontbencher, there's a gissu kid, there's a frustu kid,

03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:18.600
[Guest]: all these terms that we used to give each other, you know.

03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:25.400
[Guest]: But beyond that, they all had like this really deep stories that even they wouldn't ever

03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:26.400
[Guest]: think about.

03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:27.400
[Guest]: But that's all I could think about.

03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:30.920
[Guest]: I can't get out of my mind that there is a boy who has such a beautiful singing voice,

03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:36.520
[Guest]: but who's, you know, because he's the eldest son of the family has to only, you know, study

03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:41.280
[Guest]: and do engineering because he has to get into a certain place and he has to make his family

03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:42.280
[Guest]: circumstance better.

03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:46.040
[Guest]: Now that's because I have the privilege to not think at that time, I'd found myself having

03:15:46.040 --> 03:15:51.120
[Guest]: the privilege to not think about and yet I was not living my own story.

03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:55.600
[Guest]: I was also doing engineering, even though I liked writing and I was writing in newspapers

03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:58.120
[Guest]: and magazines and I created my own magazine.

03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:02.200
[Guest]: I've done everything, but I was not doing and you know, funnily what happened and such

03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:05.640
[Guest]: a funny random thing sometimes that happens to you that like puts you on a different path.

03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:11.840
[Guest]: One of my first roommates in my second year, actually first year only afterwards, the second

03:16:11.840 --> 03:16:16.760
[Guest]: roommate I ever had, who I became very good friends with in year one.

03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:17.760
[Guest]: I had met him.

03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:19.280
[Guest]: I mean, we had not spoken for a bit.

03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:23.520
[Guest]: We had become decent friends, but never for a, we just kind of lost touch in the middle.

03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:26.520
[Guest]: We were in different sections and different batches.

03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:29.320
[Guest]: One day again, power cut happened, fourth year, final year of college.

03:16:29.320 --> 03:16:30.320
[Guest]: I've already got two jobs.

03:16:30.320 --> 03:16:34.840
[Guest]: I've got Accenture, CSE, bit of sort in that sense and you know, I'm like, now I'm chilling

03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:40.400
[Guest]: as a senior, nothing to do, two jobs, you can't get more, like to cap at two.

03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:43.280
[Guest]: This guy meets me in a power cut, he's like, how's your life going, kaise chal rahi hai

03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:44.280
[Guest]: zindagi?

03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:46.000
[Guest]: I'm just like, yaar, accha chal raha hai, got two jobs, etc.

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:50.160
[Guest]: He's like, acha, tu bhi yeh hi karega, tu ne toh bola tha ki, I mean, tere uska kya hua

03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:54.120
[Guest]: writing, writing ga, tu bahut likhta tha us time par bhi, young times, old times, four

03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:55.120
[Guest]: years ago.

03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:57.760
[Guest]: I was like, haan, main soch raha hun ki, and this was my plan at that time, ki main, you

03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:02.240
[Guest]: know, one of the jobs, CSE, will give me Bombay as the, which is the place you want to be

03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:03.240
[Guest]: located.

03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:04.240
[Guest]: They give you the option.

03:17:04.240 --> 03:17:10.480
[Guest]: I will go to Bombay and, you know, main din mein yeh karunga, side mein na main, you know,

03:17:10.480 --> 03:17:11.480
[Guest]: writing karunga, and that's how, like, it's my plan right now.

03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:13.560
[Guest]: Aur jab wo chalne lag jayega, then I will leave it and do this.

03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:18.360
[Guest]: And this guy is just very nonchalantly, in the complete nonchalance, said like, he's

03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:23.520
[Guest]: like, haan, sahi idea hai, tu aisa karna, tu pehle Bombay jaana, side mein yeh karna,

03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:27.640
[Guest]: phir tu MBA karna, side mein writing karna, phir shadi karna, side mein writing karna,

03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:30.840
[Guest]: phir bache karna, side mein writing karna, phir tu ek din mar jayega na, tu writing

03:17:30.840 --> 03:17:31.840
[Guest]: side mein rehgi.

03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:38.320
[Guest]: You know, aur bolte bolte bol gaya, and you know, chal bhai, what, I mean, you do just

03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:44.960
[Guest]: like, I, suddenly my life flashed in my entire, in front of my eyes, and I was like, that

03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:45.960
[Guest]: is so true.

03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:50.560
[Guest]: I could just be doing this, and that's what I'd been doing till then, since 14 to now,

03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:55.200
[Guest]: I was 20 at that time, 6 years, all of this were, these were side pursuits for me.

03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:59.840
[Guest]: They were never the, because, again, arts nahi kar sakte hai, toh hobby hai, this cannot

03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:01.120
[Guest]: be your live stream.

03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:06.680
[Guest]: And then I realized, like, I have, I now already had two jobs, and one of them was in, you

03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:10.520
[Guest]: know, July, I had to join in July, and one I have to join in August.

03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:12.600
[Guest]: My college finished in April.

03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:16.720
[Guest]: So then I was like, from the time this conversation happened, which I think would have been in

03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:22.080
[Guest]: the end of first semester, beginning of second semester, I said, I have now 6 to 8 months.

03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:23.480
[Guest]: He's absolutely right.

03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:24.480
[Guest]: Let me give it a shot.

03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:25.480
[Guest]: Let me try.

03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:26.960
[Guest]: Why am I saying that ki side mein karenge?

03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:28.240
[Guest]: If I get a job, I will go for it.

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:29.240
[Guest]: If I get a good job.

03:18:29.240 --> 03:18:32.000
[Guest]: I already have like a safety net now.

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.000
[Guest]: I need to give it a shot.

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.200
[Guest]: I did everything possible.

03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:41.560
[Guest]: I reached out to like, anybody, you know, I used to blog a lot at that time on a website

03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:43.760
[Guest]: called on a forum called Zanga.

03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:49.040
[Guest]: So Zanga pe na logon ko, do you know anybody like, you know, in Bombay who would want to,

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.440
[Guest]: you know, hire me and here's my resume or whatever.

03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:54.120
[Guest]: And my resume was like a lot of writing, of course, engineering college student, but a

03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:55.120
[Guest]: lot of writing that I'd done.

03:18:55.120 --> 03:18:59.280
[Guest]: I'd also started writing for Jam, which I think again is a rite of passage for most

03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:05.600
[Guest]: people at that time, you know, so, and kahi na kahi after like hundreds of attempts and

03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:08.240
[Guest]: hundreds of people, do you know, do you have a cousin in Bombay?

03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:11.360
[Guest]: Do you have somebody who knows somebody, etc, etc.

03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:15.200
[Guest]: Itne emails bheje maine, puri list mein, I remember like sabko, jiten logon jana tha

03:19:15.200 --> 03:19:20.840
[Guest]: ki Bombay kuch ko jante ho, media ke andar, I tried in NDTV, I tried in MTV, I tried everywhere.

03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:25.520
[Guest]: And then some, one of my junior's sister was working in Hindustan Times.

03:19:25.520 --> 03:19:31.520
[Guest]: She passed on my resume to Khalid Muhammad, who was the editor at HD Cafe.

03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:35.920
[Guest]: And yeah, I got a call and said, you know, very interesting CV, you guys want, you want

03:19:35.920 --> 03:19:36.920
[Guest]: to come over to Bombay?

03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:37.920
[Guest]: Can you come tomorrow for an interview?

03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:38.920
[Guest]: I was like, I'm in Karnal.

03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:39.920
[Guest]: So sure.

03:19:39.920 --> 03:19:40.920
[Guest]: Immediately, shyaam ko maine, subhe aagle din flight pagdi, Bombay mein mohacha, I'd

03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:41.920
[Guest]: add a folder of all the articles that I'd done.

03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:42.920
[Guest]: So it's like, what all have you done?

03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:43.920
[Guest]: I was like, yeh lo mera folder.

03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:56.440
[Guest]: So it was young times, you know, this, that, etc.

03:19:56.440 --> 03:19:59.640
[Guest]: So he's like, okay, great, you seem to be like young and smart, etc.

03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:00.640
[Guest]: This is what we can pay you.

03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:01.640
[Guest]: Yeah, you want to join?

03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:04.960
[Guest]: I said, oh yeah, so easily.

03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:08.400
[Guest]: And yeah, I never had to intern for whatever it's worth.

03:20:08.400 --> 03:20:10.920
[Guest]: And next day, I joined HD.

03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:14.640
[Guest]: And I mean, they told me literally that giving me some, you know, one week ka time diya tha,

03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:15.640
[Guest]: the one week I'd taken.

03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:21.320
[Guest]: Next day, I went back, came back a week later, 2008 July and joined HD.

03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:27.040
[Guest]: But it is, it is, it is through somebody else that I realized that this should be, this

03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:28.920
[Guest]: is what I should be doing.

03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:30.640
[Guest]: But and I had asked my mother for that.

03:20:30.640 --> 03:20:34.320
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't tell my mother, you know, at that time that I'm going to be applying

03:20:34.320 --> 03:20:35.320
[Guest]: to other places.

03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:36.560
[Guest]: I said, job mili viye hai.

03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:40.440
[Guest]: And then when I got this job, then I said, listen, so I have these two jobs, but I also

03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:42.560
[Guest]: have Hindustan Times now.

03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:46.440
[Guest]: And it's since it's HD, you know, and I'd also gotten jobs in two other, I'd got a job

03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:51.640
[Guest]: in OML, I'd got a job in a PR agency called Pink Relations, I remember.

03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:55.200
[Guest]: And so I'd got three jobs, and then I had to choose now, OML was paying me a little

03:20:55.200 --> 03:20:56.200
[Guest]: bit more than HD.

03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:58.080
[Guest]: Pink Relations was also paying me a little bit more.

03:20:58.080 --> 03:20:59.080
[Guest]: But HD was HD.

03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:03.000
[Guest]: So I was like, I mean, I can't now, Khalid Mohammed was somebody again, I read his newspaper,

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:04.000
[Guest]: you know, reviews.

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.840
[Guest]: I was like, if he's going to be my boss, I mean, I want to do this.

03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:12.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I came to Bombay, and you know, it's, and it's taken me until from that time on.

03:21:12.640 --> 03:21:16.760
[Guest]: But I think that's the first thing where again, an external circumstance and the second part

03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:20.320
[Guest]: would be my teaching.

03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:27.440
[Guest]: Hearing the stories of my students, you know, made me recognize that I need to introspect

03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:29.800
[Guest]: deeper into what is my own.

03:21:29.800 --> 03:21:37.920
[Guest]: Of course, anxiety and therapy were the big, ultimate points of transition in me recognizing

03:21:37.920 --> 03:21:43.560
[Guest]: became like Imtiaz Ali movie character, I took a sabbatical after, you know, so one

03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:46.760
[Guest]: of the things in therapy that after this whole conversation that I had, where she told me

03:21:46.760 --> 03:21:51.320
[Guest]: like, I had to figure out what do I want to do after I came back from goalkeepers from

03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:54.680
[Guest]: after that panic attack, I just came back and I decided that I realized what I want

03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:56.680
[Guest]: to do in life.

03:21:56.680 --> 03:21:57.960
[Guest]: I first want to quit.

03:21:57.960 --> 03:22:01.960
[Guest]: I don't think I can do my job, you know, and I need to give myself time.

03:22:01.960 --> 03:22:05.160
[Guest]: I need to take time to find out what is my story.

03:22:05.160 --> 03:22:11.720
[Guest]: And I and I and I decided to just and I told this, I remember I told this to my therapist,

03:22:11.720 --> 03:22:16.880
[Guest]: I was like, I decided I'm going to quit YRF and she's like, that's not what I told you.

03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:17.880
[Guest]: I told you to introspect.

03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:19.240
[Guest]: I didn't tell you to quit your job.

03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:20.440
[Guest]: I was like, no, no, I'm quitting.

03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:21.440
[Guest]: How can you quit YRF?

03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:22.440
[Guest]: She was like shocked.

03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:26.360
[Guest]: My parents, everybody was like, you are doing really well at YRF, don't quit.

03:22:26.360 --> 03:22:32.040
[Guest]: And and I was just but I was sure that I needed to give myself some time to figure out what

03:22:32.040 --> 03:22:33.040
[Guest]: is my story.

03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:36.920
[Guest]: And in those six and I took and I quit and I ultimately they were very kind, YRF was

03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:37.920
[Guest]: super kind.

03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:43.680
[Guest]: They've always been so kind to me, but they said like, you know, you take to you instead

03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:46.720
[Guest]: of like quitting, just take three months.

03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:49.360
[Guest]: And after three months, you tell us, do you want to continue or don't want to continue?

03:22:49.360 --> 03:22:50.360
[Guest]: That's fine.

03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:54.080
[Guest]: So after two months only, I knew that I didn't want to continue, but I so I kind of scrubbed

03:22:54.080 --> 03:23:02.480
[Guest]: off everything, left everything, left my teaching, left film companion, left YRF, left everything,

03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:08.080
[Guest]: switched off my phone, went to Bahrain, you know, with my parents for a few months.

03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:12.760
[Guest]: And to just and then I traveled a little bit, I kind of put a post online.

03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:17.920
[Guest]: And that's where I think even the Yuva's idea really started.

03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:22.280
[Guest]: I put a post online where I just told, you know, that I want to, I have quit my job.

03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:23.280
[Guest]: I have some time.

03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:24.600
[Guest]: I want to meet students across the country.

03:23:24.600 --> 03:23:26.800
[Guest]: If you are in a college in somewhere, please call me.

03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:28.040
[Guest]: I'd love to come over.

03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:32.800
[Guest]: So college in Indore called me, a college in Bangalore called me, a college in Bhubaneshwar

03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:34.320
[Guest]: called me.

03:23:34.320 --> 03:23:38.800
[Guest]: And I just went in all these different places and just met students for two to three days

03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:40.320
[Guest]: and speaking to them.

03:23:40.320 --> 03:23:43.760
[Guest]: And after all the work, I mean, all my teaching, and I know I've not spoken much about it,

03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:48.760
[Guest]: but teaching was the most transformative thing that has happened to me.

03:23:48.760 --> 03:23:55.440
[Guest]: You know, it is, yeah, because I think I entered teaching.

03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:00.000
[Guest]: I entered teaching with this idea with like that I am going to change people's lives,

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.320
[Guest]: you know, and the reason for that was also because of my time at NID Kurukshetra.

03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:07.040
[Guest]: After a point of time when I had a full sense of my privilege, I just wanted to, for whatever

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:10.120
[Guest]: it's worth, I just wanted to do whatever I can to give back.

03:24:10.120 --> 03:24:13.320
[Guest]: When I got a job, again, I'll tell you privilege ka kaise realization ho, when I got my job

03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:14.320
[Guest]: in CSC.

03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:16.120
[Guest]: CSC is a big company, right?

03:24:16.120 --> 03:24:19.840
[Guest]: Like, you know, when for computer and computer students, it's a big deal.

03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:25.360
[Guest]: And I got it very easily, like, in you know, how are these first whatever I was technically

03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:29.920
[Guest]: proficient enough to clear technical, I was not like the best student, I was like seven

03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:35.480
[Guest]: point something I'd gotten a seven pointer, but but it was technically decent enough and

03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:38.560
[Guest]: smart enough to crack their test or whatever it is.

03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:43.160
[Guest]: And then the big challenge would come in the HR round for most people, because you have

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:46.400
[Guest]: to be comfortable with comfortable in speaking to English and you have to comfortable in

03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:47.400
[Guest]: the corporate structure.

03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:50.720
[Guest]: And English to mujhe aati di and I can talk to people.

03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:52.960
[Guest]: So the HR round was never an issue.

03:24:52.960 --> 03:24:55.120
[Guest]: So I'd go into HR and immediately I'd get a job.

03:24:55.120 --> 03:24:59.040
[Guest]: So two places I applied to two places I got a job in, right and CSC.

03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:02.160
[Guest]: So I got a job and I was like, Oh, no big deal, kitti aasani se mil gayi.

03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:05.440
[Guest]: And I remember that I'd come to my room after getting the CSC job and I was like, what,

03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:08.360
[Guest]: you know, theek hai, I told my parents ki mil gayi job agara.

03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:14.360
[Guest]: And I remember, there's this other guy who'd also got, you know, this job in CSC, who had

03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:18.320
[Guest]: never really interacted with much beyond, he was in a different section, a different

03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:19.680
[Guest]: course also.

03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:24.920
[Guest]: And he just came to my room and he's like, tujhe CSC mil gayi, maine ka haan, he's like

03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:27.880
[Guest]: meri bhi aayi and he burst into tears.

03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:28.880
[Guest]: He was so emotional.

03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:34.640
[Guest]: He's like, matlab kap se sapna dekh raha tha yeh job mil jaye CSC and he was like a nine

03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:39.600
[Guest]: pointer and he's like mujhe itni mushkil hui thi mujhe jana hai, matlab main toh dar gaya

03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:45.000
[Guest]: tha JD mein, PI mein, kya hoga, kya nahi hoga and I was like, what is a cakewalk for me?

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:50.840
[Guest]: This boy's like, gotten so emotional and I just felt like, man, you know, this shouldn't

03:25:50.840 --> 03:25:55.720
[Guest]: be that easy for me, like, or whatever, you know, you kind of have this and I was also,

03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:00.440
[Guest]: you know, just so you also know right now, I'd come from NRI Kota, okay, so I'm not like,

03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:06.160
[Guest]: so I was also, I constantly aware that, you know, I am here on a seat where I'm paying

03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:10.600
[Guest]: and all of these people have worked much harder than me to be here, whether I deserve it or

03:26:10.600 --> 03:26:14.080
[Guest]: not is, I was always thinking, do I deserve it or not deserve it?

03:26:14.080 --> 03:26:16.680
[Guest]: And what am I doing to make use of this seat?

03:26:16.680 --> 03:26:19.660
[Guest]: And then I was just like, I need to give back.

03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:24.520
[Guest]: So I started a club in my college called Aspire, where I was like, now I'm going to dedicate

03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:28.000
[Guest]: the rest of my, after I've gotten these jobs, I'm going to dedicate the rest of my time

03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:35.280
[Guest]: at NID Kurukshetra to teaching public speaking to, you know, or GDPI to get, you know, my

03:26:35.280 --> 03:26:37.040
[Guest]: juniors to clear them.

03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:42.520
[Guest]: So that's, and I, I think for six months, I just did that, like, in fact, it was so

03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:46.760
[Guest]: sweet, like, then professors that coming to me saying, can you also involve me, I would

03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:49.180
[Guest]: also learn to love like to learn.

03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:51.560
[Guest]: And I'd done post masters in Bahrain and whatnot.

03:26:51.560 --> 03:26:57.240
[Guest]: So I kind of created a structure basis that but I, that's really also where I kind of

03:26:57.240 --> 03:27:09.560
[Guest]: realized that the joy of, of sharing, or teaching or, you know, helping out in whatever way

03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:14.120
[Guest]: possible and using a privilege in a, in a manner where it's where someone else is benefiting

03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:16.320
[Guest]: off of what you got so easily.

03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:21.160
[Guest]: And even though, as I've said, it wasn't like my whole life has been a piece of cake with

03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:25.800
[Guest]: my parents and whatnot in Bahrain and I said, a lot of bullying had also happened.

03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:31.320
[Guest]: And at the same time, after that, it just stuck to me that, you know, this is something

03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:32.360
[Guest]: that I want to continue doing.

03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:39.840
[Guest]: So when I joined HT, I used to have interns, like nobody, no one knew what they were doing

03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:40.840
[Guest]: in BMM.

03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:47.720
[Guest]: So I just asked one of my friends, who was also a professor at Jain, who had become a

03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:53.320
[Guest]: professor at Jain, I also want to teach because I want to teach like journalism to, you know,

03:27:53.320 --> 03:27:56.360
[Guest]: these young people because they clearly like don't know the structure of writing or whatever

03:27:56.360 --> 03:27:57.360
[Guest]: they come in.

03:27:57.360 --> 03:27:59.920
[Guest]: You know, I don't want people to, I can help them.

03:27:59.920 --> 03:28:06.840
[Guest]: So I came with this, this, this messiah severe complex that I had helped people in NID Kurukshetra

03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:10.280
[Guest]: and now it become like, now I'm going to change the lives of the kids.

03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:13.800
[Guest]: And because there, anybody like, when you got a job, you will get emotional calls from

03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:14.800
[Guest]: people.

03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:15.800
[Guest]: Sir, I got a job.

03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:19.920
[Guest]: Because we used to call seniors, sir, you know, all like, thank you for like that course

03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:25.240
[Guest]: and that changed my life, I was hearing this and I was, my heart was getting full and I

03:28:25.240 --> 03:28:26.760
[Guest]: was like, man, I made a difference.

03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:33.040
[Guest]: And then I went to college in Jain college in Mumbai, and no one gives a shit about the

03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:34.560
[Guest]: professors over there.

03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:35.560
[Guest]: No one cares.

03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:39.400
[Guest]: You can have like this notions and narcissistic notions of like giving back.

03:28:39.400 --> 03:28:40.400
[Guest]: They don't want to receive.

03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:41.400
[Guest]: They're like, screw you.

03:28:41.400 --> 03:28:45.400
[Guest]: You are anyway three years older than us and you want to change our lives, please, bro,

03:28:45.400 --> 03:28:46.400
[Guest]: think about yourself.

03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:49.120
[Guest]: I used to have students come to me after my first batch, it was such a big disaster.

03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:53.200
[Guest]: My first batch students would like message me on Facebook messages saying, like, this

03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:58.240
[Guest]: is maybe how you should go about teaching students are advising me how to be a better

03:28:58.240 --> 03:28:59.240
[Guest]: teacher.

03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:02.560
[Guest]: I was like, this is and I was so like disappointed with the way the first batch went, because

03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:07.800
[Guest]: I'd come with these really wrong notions that I want to give back that in the second batch,

03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:11.360
[Guest]: I wanted to teach one more batch, even the teacher was, you know, like the coordinator

03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:17.520
[Guest]: recognized I failed a little bit in the first batch, although I taught a lot of, you know,

03:29:17.520 --> 03:29:21.880
[Guest]: which nobody cared about also, because like in a BMM batch of 30-40 students, only three

03:29:21.880 --> 03:29:22.880
[Guest]: want to be journalists.

03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:24.680
[Guest]: The rest of them anyway want to do other things.

03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:28.720
[Guest]: So why am I doing news reporting to people, how do they write, what is the structure.

03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:33.560
[Guest]: So second time, I just wanted to kind of, I was like, I'm a little bit more humility

03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:40.720
[Guest]: and go into it with the intent of not just teaching, but also learning, not just talking,

03:29:40.720 --> 03:29:42.520
[Guest]: but also listening.

03:29:42.520 --> 03:29:53.440
[Guest]: And that I did not recognize at that time, but it became a it was a radical thing I ended

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:57.080
[Guest]: up doing without recognizing or realizing it.

03:29:57.080 --> 03:30:02.720
[Guest]: Because what started happening is because I was so curious and eager to listen to them

03:30:02.720 --> 03:30:09.400
[Guest]: and kind of non-judgmentally learn from them, I came off my high horse and being like, I'm,

03:30:09.400 --> 03:30:12.920
[Guest]: you know, I'm not a teacher here, I mean, while I'm a teacher, but I'm really here to

03:30:12.920 --> 03:30:13.920
[Guest]: listen to you.

03:30:13.920 --> 03:30:18.240
[Guest]: I want to hear your thoughts, your opinions on, I mean, from journalism topics or what's

03:30:18.240 --> 03:30:23.040
[Guest]: happening in the world, but like, let's chat, let's talk, here's a topic I want everyone

03:30:23.040 --> 03:30:24.040
[Guest]: to have their voice.

03:30:24.040 --> 03:30:27.000
[Guest]: And I'd reach out to people and say, you know, this is your voice, tell me, tell me, tell

03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:28.000
[Guest]: me.

03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:31.240
[Guest]: And then slowly students outside of class hours would start coming to me and saying,

03:30:31.240 --> 03:30:35.160
[Guest]: you know, thank you for just like asking me to speak up or it was tough for me, but like

03:30:35.160 --> 03:30:38.960
[Guest]: you made it really comfortable and then would tell me other problems of their life.

03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:41.520
[Guest]: You know, I have this issue with my parents, what do I do?

03:30:41.520 --> 03:30:45.960
[Guest]: And I'm just like, I don't know, like, you know, so I would still give them whatever

03:30:45.960 --> 03:30:51.520
[Guest]: little bit of advice that I could, you know, in whatever more experience I had in life.

03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:56.320
[Guest]: But I also had a recognizing that every one of these kids would come in and talk about

03:30:56.320 --> 03:30:58.040
[Guest]: these things that they cared about.

03:30:58.040 --> 03:31:01.400
[Guest]: And somehow they were not talking to each other.

03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:06.080
[Guest]: I'm like, you said a problem, you said a problem, Sonu's problem is the same, but you're not

03:31:06.080 --> 03:31:07.240
[Guest]: talking to each other.

03:31:07.240 --> 03:31:14.080
[Guest]: This person sits, you know, I mean, Bombay, just again, there's an ecosystem of like hierarchies

03:31:14.080 --> 03:31:15.080
[Guest]: we've spoken about, right?

03:31:15.080 --> 03:31:18.680
[Guest]: There's a hierarchy of how people sit in a Bombay classroom.

03:31:18.680 --> 03:31:26.160
[Guest]: So there is a, there is a Bandra club of people who sit in, in one bunch, you know, who were,

03:31:26.160 --> 03:31:30.400
[Guest]: who would always sit in a, and again, you know, this is, this is, this is just what

03:31:30.400 --> 03:31:32.680
[Guest]: I saw in my classroom.

03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:38.480
[Guest]: Also the kids from Bandra was just not interested in like, you know, journalism or news reporting,

03:31:38.480 --> 03:31:42.600
[Guest]: you know, they were always like, in fact, I've had one of the Bandra students come to

03:31:42.600 --> 03:31:45.200
[Guest]: me and again, I'm not stereotyping, this is just how it was in my class.

03:31:45.200 --> 03:31:46.200
[Guest]: No disrespect.

03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:47.200
[Guest]: No disrespect.

03:31:47.200 --> 03:31:49.400
[Guest]: But Bandra kids have come to me and said, would you like to smoke weed?

03:31:49.400 --> 03:31:54.560
[Guest]: I'm like, I'm your professor, please can you not ask me that question, bro, do you want

03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:55.560
[Guest]: to smoke?

03:31:55.560 --> 03:31:56.560
[Guest]: I'm like, what are you saying?

03:31:56.560 --> 03:31:59.440
[Guest]: First of all, you shouldn't be smoking up a second, you should not be telling me to

03:31:59.440 --> 03:32:00.440
[Guest]: smoke up.

03:32:00.440 --> 03:32:03.560
[Guest]: If you want to do it, do it outside the class, please don't come in the middle of the class

03:32:03.560 --> 03:32:05.680
[Guest]: at the time of college school.

03:32:05.680 --> 03:32:10.280
[Guest]: They were, they were, they were kids from, for example, Navi Mumbai, who would all sit

03:32:10.280 --> 03:32:14.000
[Guest]: on the further benches, you know, Navi Mumbai and beyond.

03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:16.720
[Guest]: And one of the reasons I started realizing, why do they, why?

03:32:16.720 --> 03:32:19.800
[Guest]: Because they would always be late because the trains used to miss, etc. etc.

03:32:19.800 --> 03:32:22.920
[Guest]: And they would form their own little community, which was a community of people who would

03:32:22.920 --> 03:32:26.640
[Guest]: miss trains and then be late together, that if both of them miss, let's become friends

03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:29.880
[Guest]: because we are from the same, they could be, one could be a Bhandar, one could be a Vashi,

03:32:29.880 --> 03:32:33.520
[Guest]: but one couldn't be from Thane, but they would just be like, we are from the back and beyond

03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:34.520
[Guest]: of Bombay.

03:32:34.520 --> 03:32:35.520
[Guest]: So now this is one community.

03:32:35.520 --> 03:32:39.360
[Guest]: There was a South Bombay community always, you know, and these were the richest kids

03:32:39.360 --> 03:32:43.840
[Guest]: from like really rich families, they would have a language only that I wouldn't understand.

03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:47.360
[Guest]: You know, I was like, what language is this, what vocabulary is this, what's going on?

03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:52.160
[Guest]: They talk in ways that I would just be like, confused, like, what did you just say?

03:32:52.160 --> 03:32:53.160
[Guest]: What does that word mean?

03:32:53.160 --> 03:32:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Please explain.

03:32:54.160 --> 03:32:56.680
[Guest]: Like, for example, like internet language now that has happened, right?

03:32:56.680 --> 03:33:00.200
[Guest]: They were like the originate OGs of that language.

03:33:00.200 --> 03:33:06.720
[Guest]: These languages have started from these subcultures of like, you know, kids who, you know, baby,

03:33:06.720 --> 03:33:07.720
[Guest]: I don't know, man.

03:33:07.720 --> 03:33:11.040
[Guest]: When you see whatever you're seeing in like all of these Bollywood, young Bollywood actresses

03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:14.080
[Guest]: talk in the language, that was a language that they would communicate in.

03:33:14.080 --> 03:33:20.120
[Guest]: And then you would have the kids from, there were always the kids from Delhi, who would

03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:21.840
[Guest]: hate everyone from Bombay.

03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:24.640
[Guest]: And then you would have the kids of rest of India, who would hate everyone from Delhi

03:33:24.640 --> 03:33:27.280
[Guest]: and Bombay, and they all had their own batches.

03:33:27.280 --> 03:33:28.280
[Guest]: And I would see it.

03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:29.280
[Guest]: I would see it.

03:33:29.280 --> 03:33:33.680
[Guest]: You know, that there is which are the front benchers who are just kind of like, you know,

03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:38.200
[Guest]: the first people to try and like fit in and be like, mujhe zindagi mein jana, aagey badna

03:33:38.200 --> 03:33:41.520
[Guest]: hai, toh mujhe pata nahi, main aagey badunga nahi badunga, but aagey baith toh sakta hoon.

03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:44.880
[Guest]: You know, so that is their intent, whether they're topping or not topping is beyond the

03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:45.880
[Guest]: point.

03:33:45.880 --> 03:33:46.880
[Guest]: At least they're first somewhere.

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:50.360
[Guest]: Then you had your backbenchers, who are there only for attendance, you know, or like, attendance

03:33:50.360 --> 03:33:51.880
[Guest]: de do, mein soh jaata hoon.

03:33:51.880 --> 03:33:56.960
[Guest]: That was my favorite people because they were at least they were so, you know, casual about

03:33:56.960 --> 03:33:57.960
[Guest]: what they wanted.

03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:00.800
[Guest]: Their ambition was, I want to just please give me attendance and don't disturb me.

03:34:00.800 --> 03:34:04.120
[Guest]: And then the middle benchers would always be people with existential crisis, like, you

03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:07.920
[Guest]: know, like people who just did not know where to fit, like, I don't know which group I'm

03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:08.920
[Guest]: in.

03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:09.920
[Guest]: So I'm going to sit on the middle bench.

03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:12.040
[Guest]: And you know, they're always there will be like four individuals sitting on the middle

03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:15.520
[Guest]: bench, who are always like, just don't know which group.

03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:18.080
[Guest]: So I'd see all these groups, I'll see all these communities, I'll see all these labels

03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:22.920
[Guest]: and I'm like, kya chal raha hai yahan par na, and individual come to me and you'll talk

03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:25.080
[Guest]: about like, this is what I'm going through, this is what I'm going through, but you're

03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:26.400
[Guest]: not talking to each other.

03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:32.120
[Guest]: So one day, randomly, absolutely, I remember it was it was it was raining on that it was

03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:33.120
[Guest]: a Sunday.

03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:37.120
[Guest]: And I used to teach on Saturday, Sundays because I was a weekend, weekdays par padha nahi sakta

03:34:37.120 --> 03:34:38.120
[Guest]: tha.

03:34:38.120 --> 03:34:40.440
[Guest]: Sunday ko aaye the sab log, kaafi bali shod thi us din par.

03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:44.640
[Guest]: So I saw that nobody's like, what 75% of the class was there.

03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:47.300
[Guest]: But I realized that not anybody's in the mood to study.

03:34:47.300 --> 03:34:50.480
[Guest]: So I was trying to talk and then they were all talking to each other.

03:34:50.480 --> 03:34:53.760
[Guest]: And then you know what, I was like, you know what, today, let's not pretend, you know,

03:34:53.760 --> 03:34:55.680
[Guest]: to study or whatever.

03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:00.240
[Guest]: I actually just wanted to, and it came out of curiosity also I said, I just want to kind

03:35:00.240 --> 03:35:03.000
[Guest]: of know because and let's just have an honest chat.

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:06.600
[Guest]: I want to know that I speak to so many of you individually.

03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:09.560
[Guest]: And then you are able to tell me all the things that you're going through.

03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:13.080
[Guest]: But for whatever reason, I found out that you guys really judge each other, right?

03:35:13.080 --> 03:35:19.520
[Guest]: Like you don't, you all sit in your own subgroups and your own sub, you know, sections and just

03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:23.560
[Guest]: mingle with each other as if that's the only world that you can ever be in.

03:35:23.560 --> 03:35:27.600
[Guest]: I mean, you have that, like what I was doing in NID Gurukshetra, I was also like, you have

03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:33.120
[Guest]: the, you have the possibility and the opportunity to interact with people from all kinds of

03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:35.600
[Guest]: parts of like Bombay and the rest of India.

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:36.880
[Guest]: Why are you not getting to know each other?

03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:40.000
[Guest]: Why are you not, why are you creating these cliques and like talking to each other?

03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:42.360
[Guest]: You know, people give you labels.

03:35:42.360 --> 03:35:46.240
[Guest]: You don't have to believe them, you know, and again, I, at this time, again, I don't

03:35:46.240 --> 03:35:47.440
[Guest]: have that understanding of gender.

03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:48.440
[Guest]: I don't have that understanding.

03:35:48.440 --> 03:35:53.760
[Guest]: I just have a little bit of experience from NID Gurukshetra, but I just found it very

03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:58.000
[Guest]: irritating that, you know, that and, and, and sad that, you know, that there are all

03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:05.720
[Guest]: of these human made ideas of who should be talking to whom people in the same class circles

03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:09.920
[Guest]: should stay with each other, same like interest should stay with each other.

03:36:09.920 --> 03:36:14.280
[Guest]: In fact, all my learning and all the, I mean, my favorite, my closest friend, my wife is

03:36:14.280 --> 03:36:15.400
[Guest]: from Assam.

03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:20.200
[Guest]: I would never have, till I was in Bahrain, I did not know, I'll be as honest in saying

03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:22.720
[Guest]: I did not even know where Assam was on the map of India.

03:36:22.720 --> 03:36:25.920
[Guest]: And now I'm married to a girl from Assam because of NID Gurukshetra.

03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:32.280
[Guest]: My closest friend is from, you know, a small village in, near Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:37.520
[Guest]: And he's now in the US and working in Amazon and, and I mean, just all kinds of friends

03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:41.200
[Guest]: that I've had from that time have come from all kinds of different places of, you know,

03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:42.200
[Guest]: the country.

03:36:42.200 --> 03:36:45.520
[Guest]: It's like, it's made me richer as a person.

03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:49.440
[Guest]: And but I just feel like, you know, you guys are not using this opportunity.

03:36:49.440 --> 03:36:54.360
[Guest]: So I just said, like, you know, for today, let's just for one minute, I want you to just

03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:56.100
[Guest]: stop talking to each other.

03:36:56.100 --> 03:36:58.520
[Guest]: And for some reason, they stopped, which is just like, wait, what is happening?

03:36:58.520 --> 03:36:59.520
[Guest]: Why did you stop talking?

03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:04.040
[Guest]: I just said, and I wanted to think for a second, who are you beyond these labels that you have

03:37:04.040 --> 03:37:08.000
[Guest]: given yourself and what the society has given you?

03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.040
[Guest]: And then come and like, talk about it.

03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:11.440
[Guest]: What is your story beyond these labels?

03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:16.360
[Guest]: I said very casually, I had never thought that this is a big thing.

03:37:16.360 --> 03:37:19.800
[Guest]: And then, and then after this one minute, they all looked up, I was like, was there

03:37:19.800 --> 03:37:20.800
[Guest]: quiet for one minute?

03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:21.800
[Guest]: Clearly, they were introspective.

03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:23.280
[Guest]: So I said, who wants to talk?

03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:28.360
[Guest]: So one person first came up and like said something very like, well, I want to be a,

03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:33.920
[Guest]: you know, even things like I just chill over here, but I want to, I'm very, I want to,

03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:34.920
[Guest]: I used to be a cricketer.

03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:37.880
[Guest]: But then I had some injury, couldn't play, but I want to now get into sports broadcasting,

03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:38.880
[Guest]: you know, that's my ambition.

03:37:38.880 --> 03:37:42.920
[Guest]: I was like, well, sure, that's not what I went by Louisville stories, but thank you

03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:45.280
[Guest]: for coming and speaking up.

03:37:45.280 --> 03:37:47.520
[Guest]: For whatever it's worth, that boy is a sports broadcaster today.

03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:50.960
[Guest]: So you know, full marks for him.

03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:58.920
[Guest]: The second boy who came, he changed my life, man, like, he came and he's this lovely, lovely

03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:01.040
[Guest]: boy.

03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:03.080
[Guest]: And he happened to be gay.

03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:06.000
[Guest]: So he came and spoke to everyone and said he was very openly gay.

03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:11.960
[Guest]: He was like someone who would, you know, be very open and comfortable with his identity

03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:13.020
[Guest]: in college.

03:38:13.020 --> 03:38:18.320
[Guest]: So he came and said to everyone, he's like, well, you know me as someone who's like open

03:38:18.320 --> 03:38:22.640
[Guest]: about his sexuality and you're all like, I'm very comfortable.

03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:28.480
[Guest]: But what you don't know about me and the story that I have beyond this label is that every

03:38:28.480 --> 03:38:34.440
[Guest]: evening after college, on the way to home, I stop at a petrol pump.

03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:35.440
[Guest]: He has a bike.

03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:37.400
[Guest]: I used to go on the bike and stop at a petrol pump.

03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:44.120
[Guest]: And then I take out different clothes that I change into so that when I go home, I have

03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:46.760
[Guest]: to hide who I am in front of my parents.

03:38:46.760 --> 03:38:48.720
[Guest]: Because my one truth is that I'm gay.

03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:52.660
[Guest]: The second truth is my parents and I belong to a very religious family.

03:38:52.660 --> 03:38:58.240
[Guest]: And in my family, it is not okay for homosexuality is not okay.

03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:00.840
[Guest]: And in my religion, homosexuality is not okay.

03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:08.720
[Guest]: So while here I get to be who I am in front of the people I love the most, I have to hide

03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:10.960
[Guest]: a part of me.

03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:14.860
[Guest]: And and then he just burst into tears when he said this.

03:39:14.860 --> 03:39:22.040
[Guest]: And then suddenly that moment, that day, that boy changed the trajectory of my life.

03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:25.480
[Guest]: I think I wouldn't be overstating that.

03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:28.840
[Guest]: Because immediately after that, a wave of empathy happened in the classroom and somebody

03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:29.840
[Guest]: becomes vulnerable.

03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:30.840
[Guest]: And this is the thing about stories.

03:39:30.840 --> 03:39:33.240
[Guest]: And stories lead to other stories.

03:39:33.240 --> 03:39:34.360
[Guest]: Vulnerability is actually strength.

03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:40.960
[Guest]: If you are if you are sharing something, it allows people to to also let their guards

03:39:40.960 --> 03:39:48.720
[Guest]: down and share back, you know, human connection, human bonding, human friendships all happen

03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:53.580
[Guest]: because of this beautiful thing called empathy that comes after you share your stories.

03:39:53.580 --> 03:39:59.160
[Guest]: And this boy shared his story and everyone was like, you know, maybe I should do it too.

03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:04.080
[Guest]: So then there is a girl who came up and she's like, she's already crying.

03:40:04.080 --> 03:40:07.440
[Guest]: She's like, everyone thinks of me as a topper.

03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:10.440
[Guest]: And I've topped I've topped everywhere, you know, all know me.

03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:15.120
[Guest]: But I've topped in the college, I've topped in this district, I've been a school topper.

03:40:15.120 --> 03:40:16.120
[Guest]: But you don't know why I top.

03:40:16.120 --> 03:40:17.120
[Guest]: Her story is heartbreaking.

03:40:17.120 --> 03:40:26.320
[Guest]: She's like, when I was born, I very soon found out that my parents wanted a boy and but they

03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:27.720
[Guest]: got a girl.

03:40:27.720 --> 03:40:33.080
[Guest]: So for some reason, my parents and especially my father has never really given me love.

03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:37.960
[Guest]: She's like, I grew up not knowing what love is, but then kind of started recognizing that

03:40:37.960 --> 03:40:42.600
[Guest]: with other students in school, they would get a lot of love from the parents when they

03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:43.600
[Guest]: would do well in their exams.

03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:48.280
[Guest]: So I was like, what if I start doing well in my exams and I'll get love from my parents.

03:40:48.280 --> 03:40:51.920
[Guest]: She's like, from that time onwards, I'm in primary school, I've been topping everywhere.

03:40:51.920 --> 03:40:54.960
[Guest]: I've topped school, I've topped district, I've topped college.

03:40:54.960 --> 03:40:59.040
[Guest]: And every time I take my report card or my marks back to my father in the hope that he

03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:02.100
[Guest]: says I love you to me, but he still hasn't.

03:41:02.100 --> 03:41:03.580
[Guest]: And she's just in tears.

03:41:03.580 --> 03:41:07.200
[Guest]: And as all of us are listening, and we're like, man, what is going on?

03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:11.640
[Guest]: And just really beautiful, powerful stories started coming out.

03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:18.520
[Guest]: Very emotionally speaking about what the world thinks of them as and who they really are.

03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:25.140
[Guest]: And I realize at this point, man, there is there is something here that you know, something

03:41:25.140 --> 03:41:30.040
[Guest]: happened that that day and that evening that kind of totally it started as like a 12 o'clock

03:41:30.040 --> 03:41:31.040
[Guest]: session.

03:41:31.040 --> 03:41:35.600
[Guest]: And then it went on to like six o'clock, like six hours, we were just talking.

03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:38.200
[Guest]: Everybody and everybody heard everybody else.

03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:44.520
[Guest]: Everybody gave everybody the respect of like, time and emotion and empathy and hugs.

03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:46.960
[Guest]: There were so many hugs that day.

03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:48.600
[Guest]: And I was like, man, what has happened?

03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:52.400
[Guest]: And then you know, like your WhatsApp, I mean, I think the WhatsApp group after that gets

03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:57.240
[Guest]: lit and there's so many like, emojis and like hearts and whatnot and hugs.

03:41:57.240 --> 03:42:01.460
[Guest]: And I was like, there's something here, you know.

03:42:01.460 --> 03:42:04.880
[Guest]: And all the people who missed it then suddenly were like, man, you know, something happened

03:42:04.880 --> 03:42:08.680
[Guest]: yesterday, like everybody's talking about.

03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:11.640
[Guest]: And I realized that maybe there's something that I need to do with every batch, you know,

03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:12.840
[Guest]: this happened by mistake.

03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:18.360
[Guest]: But it just made me so it made me realize the power of stories, power of empathy.

03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:21.720
[Guest]: And I started I then called it started calling it the kindness project.

03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:25.480
[Guest]: And I said, like, this is a project, the next batch I gave from the very beginning, but

03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:28.760
[Guest]: here it happened by, you know, accident.

03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:31.880
[Guest]: I said that at the end of the semester, I'm going to give you a project.

03:42:31.880 --> 03:42:35.920
[Guest]: And it's called the kindness project, where I will ask you to do this exercise.

03:42:35.920 --> 03:42:39.160
[Guest]: You have the whole semester to think about it, you can start thinking from now.

03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:42.120
[Guest]: But I want you to tell me the story you have beyond the label that you have.

03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:46.920
[Guest]: And I will, I'd start my class by asking how many of you want to be journalists and like

03:42:46.920 --> 03:42:49.240
[Guest]: actually four of them would be like, I was like, great.

03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:53.160
[Guest]: Now, all of the rest of you also have a story, why are you here?

03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:56.400
[Guest]: And I want to know that story, but I will talk about it in the last class.

03:42:56.400 --> 03:43:00.600
[Guest]: And I said, I'd say that it's a marked project, but I give everybody full marks.

03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.200
[Guest]: And then every year, year on year on year, I mean, the kind of stories that came out,

03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:09.760
[Guest]: it is, it became, I mean, at that time, I did not know the terms for it, but became

03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:10.960
[Guest]: a safe space.

03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:16.360
[Guest]: It became a space where I'm so proud to say a student of mine decided that he's going

03:43:16.360 --> 03:43:21.320
[Guest]: to come out to the world in that space, because he didn't have an opportunity.

03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:24.200
[Guest]: And he just came, I remember, he's just the sweetest boy.

03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:28.520
[Guest]: And he came and he's like, said a few lines about himself and what he likes and how he's

03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:33.120
[Guest]: as a human being, what he likes, what he doesn't like, and he ended by saying, so I just want

03:43:33.120 --> 03:43:39.800
[Guest]: to say that I'm a boy who has brown hair, black eyes, crooked tooth.

03:43:39.800 --> 03:43:44.680
[Guest]: And I have, you know, and I like boys, and he just said something so beautiful.

03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:47.040
[Guest]: Everybody was like, wait, what did he just come out?

03:43:47.040 --> 03:43:51.280
[Guest]: And it was just hugs, hugs, hugs after the other was so beautiful.

03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:57.040
[Guest]: One of the most powerful, and I because I want to is just some one of my most inspiring

03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:04.040
[Guest]: I think stories, one of the most powerful stories happened with this boy who, who came

03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:08.760
[Guest]: to me and said, Sir, I don't know what to say in this, you know, class because I don't

03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:09.760
[Guest]: have a story.

03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:10.760
[Guest]: Everybody has a story.

03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:11.760
[Guest]: I don't have a story.

03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:12.760
[Guest]: So I don't know what to say.

03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:20.520
[Guest]: So now this boy, I'll tell you what this was, he's like the brightest, one of the brightest

03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:22.160
[Guest]: smartest kids I'd met.

03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:26.080
[Guest]: He was so bright, he would correct me in class, he'd just be like, that's wrong.

03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:27.200
[Guest]: This is the right thing.

03:44:27.200 --> 03:44:30.440
[Guest]: And I was just after one time I realized that you know a lot more than me.

03:44:30.440 --> 03:44:33.880
[Guest]: So he would ask me questions and say, you know, that you said this, but this happened

03:44:33.880 --> 03:44:34.880
[Guest]: in 1852.

03:44:34.880 --> 03:44:35.880
[Guest]: I said, I didn't know.

03:44:35.880 --> 03:44:42.400
[Guest]: I have not, I have not done, you know, not studied history or, or, or even for that matter,

03:44:42.400 --> 03:44:45.120
[Guest]: journalism or engineering, but I work in history.

03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:49.120
[Guest]: That's why I'm teaching you, you know, so, but if you have something, I want you to talk

03:44:49.120 --> 03:44:50.120
[Guest]: about it.

03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:51.880
[Guest]: So why don't you come and tell like what happened?

03:44:51.880 --> 03:44:55.760
[Guest]: So be my co-professor once is like asking me because I don't know, I'm very comfortable

03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:56.960
[Guest]: with saying, I don't know.

03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:01.200
[Guest]: So he started, so I just told him, I said, the only thing I know about you is that you're

03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:03.760
[Guest]: very well read, crazily well read.

03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:08.680
[Guest]: It is insane how I 2021, you know, so many things about like the world.

03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:10.280
[Guest]: Maybe there's a reason behind it.

03:45:10.280 --> 03:45:12.160
[Guest]: Maybe there's a story that I don't know.

03:45:12.160 --> 03:45:13.160
[Guest]: What is the story?

03:45:13.160 --> 03:45:17.200
[Guest]: And then his eyes just widened and he's like, Oh shit, I think I know what my story is.

03:45:17.200 --> 03:45:20.200
[Guest]: I said, great, then come and tell it in that class.

03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:23.920
[Guest]: So and I'd workshop with most of the kids, I would workshop these stories, then I'd be

03:45:23.920 --> 03:45:28.680
[Guest]: like, tell me what it is, and then we'll try to get you to dig deep and say something authentic.

03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:32.120
[Guest]: So he said, I said, he said, can I tell you, I was like, whatever you prefer, he's like,

03:45:32.120 --> 03:45:33.120
[Guest]: can I say it in the class directly?

03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:39.520
[Guest]: I said, sure, came to the class, he's like, so his story was, he's like, I've grown up

03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:44.200
[Guest]: in a very misogynistic setup, very patriarchal setup, he's like, my father is a patriarch

03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:45.200
[Guest]: of the house.

03:45:45.200 --> 03:45:51.920
[Guest]: And he's so patriarchal that when there is that I have a sister and my mother, even when

03:45:51.920 --> 03:45:55.840
[Guest]: he's watching TV, and the remote control is on the table in front of him, he will not

03:45:55.840 --> 03:45:57.200
[Guest]: pick it up himself.

03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:00.520
[Guest]: He will call my mother or my sister to come and pick it up for him.

03:46:00.520 --> 03:46:05.840
[Guest]: He's like, it used to be so irritating to me to see and so and I used to get so angry

03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:09.160
[Guest]: at the way he treats me and the way he treats my mother and there were different rules for

03:46:09.160 --> 03:46:10.160
[Guest]: all of us.

03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:12.760
[Guest]: My sister would not get to God, I'd get to God, my sister would not get a certain kind

03:46:12.760 --> 03:46:14.360
[Guest]: of money, I'd get a certain kind of money.

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:17.320
[Guest]: If there's some work to be done, my sister, my mother were the ones who are being asked

03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:20.960
[Guest]: to do the work, whereas I wouldn't be asked to do it at all.

03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:26.320
[Guest]: And he's like, my anger turned into resentment.

03:46:26.320 --> 03:46:32.360
[Guest]: And when sometimes my father would hit me or hit any of us, there was a day where I

03:46:32.360 --> 03:46:34.240
[Guest]: almost hit him back.

03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:37.120
[Guest]: And then I realized that what am I doing?

03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:38.560
[Guest]: How can I do this?

03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:40.120
[Guest]: I'm turning into him.

03:46:40.120 --> 03:46:43.660
[Guest]: He's like that realization happened and I just got very scared.

03:46:43.660 --> 03:46:48.740
[Guest]: And I was like, there has to be a better way of, you know, giving back to my father without

03:46:48.740 --> 03:46:52.520
[Guest]: getting angry like him, because that's his thing, I don't want to be that boy.

03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:57.720
[Guest]: So he's like, every time I would fight with him and say that, you know, you can't do this,

03:46:57.720 --> 03:46:59.840
[Guest]: he would say, but this is the way the world works.

03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:00.840
[Guest]: This is the way the world works.

03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:08.120
[Guest]: This is the position of girls, boys do this, girls do that, women do this, men do that.

03:47:08.120 --> 03:47:11.140
[Guest]: Don't fight, you know, the way the world works.

03:47:11.140 --> 03:47:13.360
[Guest]: So he started, he just, he had Google.

03:47:13.360 --> 03:47:16.520
[Guest]: So he went online and he's just like, is this the way the world works?

03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:21.000
[Guest]: And then he discovered feminism and then he discovered feminist movements, then he discovered

03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:25.960
[Guest]: communities in different parts of the world, which did not have patriarchy, but matriarchy.

03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:28.680
[Guest]: So the next time his father would get angry and say, this is the way the world works,

03:47:28.680 --> 03:47:32.620
[Guest]: he would hit back with a fact and say, you know what, in Northeast India, the kids take

03:47:32.620 --> 03:47:37.040
[Guest]: the names of their mothers, you know, because it's not patriarchy, it's matriarchy, so it

03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:38.040
[Guest]: is not the way the world works.

03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:39.840
[Guest]: It might work in this household, but not everywhere.

03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:43.440
[Guest]: And his father would suddenly be stumped, he'd be like, wait, what?

03:47:43.440 --> 03:47:46.560
[Guest]: The next time he'd say, this is the way the world works, he'd be like, do you know about

03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:47.560
[Guest]: the feminist movement over here?

03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:48.560
[Guest]: And this is what happened here.

03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:50.840
[Guest]: In Africa, there's a tribe, there is.

03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:53.200
[Guest]: And he would always come back with facts.

03:47:53.200 --> 03:47:57.780
[Guest]: And the father would just be like, I don't know what to say to this, because he was not,

03:47:57.780 --> 03:48:02.400
[Guest]: you know, getting angry back at him, but talking in like, facts.

03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:06.760
[Guest]: And he's like, he's like, I started doing this so much that my father, instead of getting

03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:10.520
[Guest]: angry, would just like, go away, because he didn't know how to respond.

03:48:10.520 --> 03:48:14.680
[Guest]: And he's like, now it's reached a place where it's not that my father has suddenly become

03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:17.560
[Guest]: like a feminist, or, you know, is not patriarchal anymore.

03:48:17.560 --> 03:48:20.080
[Guest]: But when he wants the remote, he picks it himself.

03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:22.880
[Guest]: He's like, that's how much of a change it is.

03:48:22.880 --> 03:48:27.440
[Guest]: He doesn't ask my mother and my sister to, you know, get it.

03:48:27.440 --> 03:48:29.240
[Guest]: And I was like, man, he's like, that's my story.

03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:35.280
[Guest]: And I'm like, insane, like, just the fact that this boy has so many facts in him.

03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:37.360
[Guest]: Can you imagine the deep story behind that?

03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:43.120
[Guest]: And through these stories of these young people, I started recognising that I too have a story.

03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:50.480
[Guest]: Now, what I used to think, I used to understand, and that man thing, I never could unlock.

03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:55.840
[Guest]: But I unlocked like, why I care about films, I told you, it's my father and stuff.

03:48:55.840 --> 03:49:01.160
[Guest]: You know, a lot of it really, yeah, I just struggled, I knew there was something there,

03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:03.080
[Guest]: but I just did not know what it was.

03:49:03.080 --> 03:49:04.160
[Guest]: And then it was anxiety.

03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:05.160
[Guest]: And then it was therapy.

03:49:05.160 --> 03:49:12.280
[Guest]: And actually, how I also realised it is anxiety is one of my students, by the way, like, one

03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:14.600
[Guest]: of my students has spoken about anxiety in her session.

03:49:14.600 --> 03:49:17.360
[Guest]: So I called her one day and said, can I meet?

03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:19.560
[Guest]: You know, and you're very close, we're very thick.

03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:22.600
[Guest]: So I met her, you know, for lunch or something.

03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:26.920
[Guest]: And I said that, so you said you got anxiety, just tell me like, what all happens?

03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:27.920
[Guest]: What are the symptoms?

03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:29.280
[Guest]: Because she was taking therapy at that time.

03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:32.920
[Guest]: And then she told me like, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens, this

03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:33.920
[Guest]: happens.

03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:36.080
[Guest]: And I was like, shit, all of this happens to me.

03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:39.200
[Guest]: So is this is what I have also anxiety.

03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:42.560
[Guest]: And she said, maybe it is, you should get it checked, and maybe you should go to a therapist.

03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:46.080
[Guest]: And that's where I was like, oh, shit, I can't go to a therapist, I'm a man.

03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:51.560
[Guest]: But yeah, I mean, it's in my students, it's in the conversations that I had.

03:49:51.560 --> 03:49:56.680
[Guest]: It's in the stories of others that I found my own, you know, so and then, of course,

03:49:56.680 --> 03:50:00.200
[Guest]: in clinical anxiety.

03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:04.480
[Amit Varma]: It's such a powerful thought and such a powerful frame, just, you know, just thinking about

03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:09.240
[Amit Varma]: what your story is, like what your roommate, in fact, said to you that you should be writing

03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:13.520
[Amit Varma]: on the side, writing on the side, writing on the side, and just taking that step back

03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:20.200
[Amit Varma]: and forcing you to think of it in terms of stories can, you know, at least make you self

03:50:20.200 --> 03:50:21.200
[Amit Varma]: reflect.

03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And I was struck by this talk that you gave, where there's this lovely line where you say,

03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:30.640
[Amit Varma]: stories unite us, labels divide us, right, and I'll link it from the show notes, of course.

03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But this is, you know, so particularly pertinent today, because, you know, I keep saying, it's

03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:43.600
[Amit Varma]: almost a cliche on my show where I quote Whitman and talk about how we contain multitudes.

03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:48.960
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is that a lot of the way, a lot of the discourse around us is so reductive,

03:50:48.960 --> 03:50:55.680
[Amit Varma]: where we'll reduce people down to labels and to narratives, that so and so is a liberal

03:50:55.680 --> 03:51:00.960
[Amit Varma]: and anti-national, this is so and so, that is so and so, everywhere you're putting narratives

03:51:00.960 --> 03:51:05.320
[Amit Varma]: of victimhood or narratives of oppression, looking at people only through that lens.

03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And that is just offensive to reduce people to one particular thing over which they had

03:51:10.040 --> 03:51:14.340
[Amit Varma]: no control, because it's often just an identity of birth.

03:51:14.340 --> 03:51:17.640
[Amit Varma]: Another theme I often talk about on the show is the difference between the abstract and

03:51:17.640 --> 03:51:18.640
[Amit Varma]: the concrete.

03:51:18.640 --> 03:51:23.080
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra, and she wrote a book on the memories of partition.

03:51:23.080 --> 03:51:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and in her episode, she spoke about how while collecting material for the book,

03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:33.000
[Amit Varma]: she was sitting with a family in Pakistan, who had come over after partition, and they

03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:34.360
[Amit Varma]: had suffered a lot.

03:51:34.360 --> 03:51:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, they were just full of rage when those memories came and they were saying,

03:51:38.840 --> 03:51:42.240
[Amit Varma]: Hindus are like this, Hindus are like that, Hindus are like this, Hindus are like that.

03:51:42.240 --> 03:51:45.160
[Amit Varma]: But then they suddenly noticed that they're talking to a Hindu and they said, lekin tum

03:51:45.160 --> 03:51:47.200
[Amit Varma]: nahi beti, tum achhi ho.

03:51:47.200 --> 03:51:52.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's the difference between an abstract notion in the head and a concrete person with

03:51:52.400 --> 03:51:55.400
[Amit Varma]: a story who's actually sitting in front of you.

03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:59.800
[Amit Varma]: And when I think about what divides us today, it is abstract things like all these labels

03:51:59.800 --> 03:52:01.520
[Amit Varma]: we pin on people.

03:52:01.520 --> 03:52:07.080
[Amit Varma]: And it is abstract notions like nationalism and purity and culture and all of this crap.

03:52:07.080 --> 03:52:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And but what can unite us is in the concrete, once you know somebody's story, as you've

03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:15.560
[Amit Varma]: pointed out, it is difficult to hate them.

03:52:15.560 --> 03:52:22.480
[Amit Varma]: It is difficult because you and that's one of the things that literature and reading

03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:27.760
[Amit Varma]: literature really helps because when you live the lives of others through, you know, getting

03:52:27.760 --> 03:52:33.480
[Amit Varma]: inside their heads, it just gives you so much more empathy, where and it gives you so much

03:52:33.480 --> 03:52:38.560
[Amit Varma]: more insight into yourself, where you say ki mera bhi to story hai, you know, the strength

03:52:38.560 --> 03:52:42.720
[Amit Varma]: that I'm showing, ye bhi kisi majboori se aayi hai, kisi frustration se aayi hai, you

03:52:42.720 --> 03:52:48.040
[Amit Varma]: know, tum itna kyu muskura rahe ho, you know, exactly that kind of thing.

03:52:48.040 --> 03:52:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So and I'll dive into the anxiety later also, because I want to do a little bit of a dive

03:52:53.440 --> 03:52:54.680
[Amit Varma]: into that with you as well.

03:52:54.680 --> 03:53:00.720
[Amit Varma]: But on the point of stories, your kindness project seems to me to be so powerful, because

03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:06.960
[Amit Varma]: suddenly everybody in the classroom is a real person to every other person in the classroom.

03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And that is mind blowing.

03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And that is what our society needs. Because today, even when we talk with friends, we

03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:16.520
[Amit Varma]: are looking inside our smartphones, and we are lost in the abstractions on the on the

03:53:16.520 --> 03:53:18.120
[Amit Varma]: in the black mirror.

03:53:18.120 --> 03:53:22.480
[Amit Varma]: But we are not actually, you know, looking into each other's eyes and making that real

03:53:22.480 --> 03:53:24.120
[Amit Varma]: human connection.

03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And you found a device to unlock that in a particular setting, which is a particular

03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:29.620
[Amit Varma]: setting of a classroom.

03:53:29.620 --> 03:53:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And since then with you, you are you've, you know, found other sort of devices like that.

03:53:34.160 --> 03:53:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your thinking on this, because the world needs more of this.

03:53:40.600 --> 03:53:50.000
[Guest]: You know, it's only in hindsight that I started recognizing why this idea of storytelling

03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:51.440
[Guest]: and narrative became so important.

03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:54.040
[Guest]: So again, one of the first things was my mother only, right?

03:53:54.040 --> 03:53:56.120
[Guest]: Like I told you, I joked with you.

03:53:56.120 --> 03:53:59.600
[Guest]: And I mean, not it wasn't a joke, but I told you about the fact that when you know, when

03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:05.280
[Guest]: I had my first show, my mother said, like, to the MBA.

03:54:05.280 --> 03:54:10.200
[Guest]: And one day, you know, I had a very big fight with my mother, you know, where I, where I

03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:17.240
[Guest]: asked her, I said, okay, if I do MBA, then what will happen?

03:54:17.240 --> 03:54:19.720
[Guest]: And she's like, then you'll be successful.

03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:22.720
[Guest]: I said, then what will happen?

03:54:22.720 --> 03:54:27.160
[Guest]: Because I was trying to see where, what is this idea in her head, then what will happen?

03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:30.940
[Guest]: She is like, then you'll earn money, you'll have a lot of money.

03:54:30.940 --> 03:54:33.300
[Guest]: I said, then what will happen?

03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:34.920
[Guest]: Then you'll buy a household.

03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:35.920
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:36.920
[Guest]: Then you'll buy a car.

03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:37.920
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:38.920
[Guest]: Then you'll get married.

03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:39.920
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:40.920
[Guest]: Then you'll settle down.

03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:41.920
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:43.120
[Guest]: Then you'll have kids.

03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:44.240
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:45.640
[Guest]: Then you'll bring up the kids.

03:54:45.640 --> 03:54:47.120
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:49.060
[Guest]: Then the kids will go to college.

03:54:49.060 --> 03:54:50.200
[Guest]: Then what happens?

03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:51.320
[Guest]: Then what happens?

03:54:51.320 --> 03:54:52.440
[Guest]: Then you retire.

03:54:52.440 --> 03:54:54.680
[Guest]: I want to know what will happen?

03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:57.040
[Guest]: And she's like, what happens after that?

03:54:57.040 --> 03:54:59.040
[Guest]: To khush hone ke liye mujhe retire hona badega

03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:04.040
[Guest]: And she's just like very honestly and earnestly was like haan

03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:07.040
[Guest]: I said aur agar mujhe abhi khush hona hai phir

03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:10.040
[Guest]: And she's like aisa nahi hota

03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:12.040
[Guest]: I'm like aisa nahi hota matlak kya hota hai

03:55:12.040 --> 03:55:13.040
[Guest]: I want to be happy right now

03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:15.040
[Guest]: She's like nahi happy nahi hota abhi tumhara bhi duties hoti hai

03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:19.040
[Guest]: And it just and again in that moment I realized yaar

03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:22.040
[Guest]: Not in that moment much later I think

03:55:22.040 --> 03:55:24.040
[Guest]: Retrospective mein I kind of recognized

03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:27.040
[Guest]: But this is what our parents were given duties

03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:30.040
[Guest]: And that's what they thought all of us have to perform duties

03:55:31.040 --> 03:55:32.040
[Guest]: You're not living for yourself

03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:36.040
[Guest]: You're living for the next for the child you will birth

03:55:36.040 --> 03:55:38.040
[Guest]: You're living for the partner you will have

03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:39.040
[Guest]: You will live for the

03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:43.040
[Guest]: How does how can in our country in our society

03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:45.040
[Guest]: Anyone even find their story

03:55:46.040 --> 03:55:49.040
[Guest]: When you are constantly told that you have to live

03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:51.040
[Guest]: Your entire story is about somebody else

03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:52.040
[Guest]: There is no such thing

03:55:52.040 --> 03:55:54.040
[Guest]: And you know it's another

03:55:54.040 --> 03:55:58.040
[Guest]: Such a random you know insight to this

03:55:58.040 --> 03:56:02.040
[Guest]: Like when I'd gone on this SOTC tour with my family

03:56:02.040 --> 03:56:04.040
[Guest]: There's a lot of old couples over there

03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:07.040
[Guest]: And I was really like I was like are we not

03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:10.040
[Guest]: I mean again 17 year old I was like where are the young people in this tour

03:56:10.040 --> 03:56:12.040
[Guest]: Why are there so many old people etc

03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:14.040
[Guest]: And one of them we became close to a couple

03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:16.040
[Guest]: That's the couple that actually even asked my parents

03:56:16.040 --> 03:56:18.040
[Guest]: So I asked them uncle aunty aap log jana

03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:21.040
[Guest]: You know you are like well in your 60s or whatever

03:56:22.040 --> 03:56:24.040
[Guest]: How are you why are you doing this tour

03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:26.040
[Guest]: It's just a curious question ki kya kar rahe ho

03:56:26.040 --> 03:56:30.040
[Guest]: He's like bete humare bachon ki shadiya hogi hai

03:56:30.040 --> 03:56:33.040
[Guest]: You know toh humne ka chalo ab enjoy karte thoda

03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:36.040
[Guest]: And I was like and it's the same thing my mother said right

03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:39.040
[Guest]: Like ab shadiya hogi hai duty khatam hogi hai

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:42.040
[Guest]: Settle kar di hai ab hum enjoy kar sakte hai

03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:46.040
[Guest]: So till then till your 60s you can't enjoy life

03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:49.040
[Guest]: That is the idea that we are given to people

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:51.040
[Guest]: Your story is not your own

03:56:51.040 --> 03:56:54.040
[Guest]: You are not allowed to think that you have you know

03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:57.040
[Guest]: It's selfish, it's considered selfish to say that you know

03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:00.040
[Guest]: Tum apne ware sochta hai, tum apne ware mein kitna sochta hai

03:57:00.040 --> 03:57:03.040
[Guest]: If you are not sacrificing for your family

03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:06.040
[Guest]: Then you are selfish, you are self-centered, you are egoistic

03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:09.040
[Guest]: Tu apne ware mein hi sochta hai, tu sab ke ware mein hi sochta hai

03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:11.040
[Guest]: Sehb apne ware mein sochta hai

03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:14.040
[Guest]: This is why so many people who wanted to be other things

03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:16.040
[Guest]: Now this is across gender

03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:18.040
[Guest]: Who wanted to break out of their circumstance

03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:20.040
[Guest]: Or break out of their narratives

03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:22.040
[Guest]: Were just constantly told, shamed in society

03:57:22.040 --> 03:57:24.040
[Guest]: And shamed in family structures

03:57:24.040 --> 03:57:26.040
[Guest]: Saying that you don't care about us

03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:28.040
[Guest]: You only care about yourself

03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:30.040
[Guest]: Whereas this idea of a Shravan Kumar

03:57:30.040 --> 03:57:36.040
[Guest]: This boy who took his parents on a pilgrimage

03:57:36.040 --> 03:57:38.040
[Guest]: And did it on his own

03:57:38.040 --> 03:57:40.040
[Guest]: That's the ideal son that everybody should have

03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:42.040
[Guest]: And the ideal daughter is the one

03:57:42.040 --> 03:57:44.040
[Guest]: Who finds that best Shravan Kumar

03:57:44.040 --> 03:57:46.040
[Guest]: Kind of a boy and then serves him

03:57:46.040 --> 03:57:48.040
[Guest]: He will serve the parents, she will serve him

03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:50.040
[Guest]: Who is living for themselves?

03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:52.040
[Guest]: Everybody is living for somebody else

03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:54.040
[Guest]: The parents will live for these kids

03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:56.040
[Guest]: Parents live for the kids, the boy has to live for the parents

03:57:56.040 --> 03:57:58.040
[Guest]: The wife has to live for the husband

03:57:58.040 --> 03:58:00.040
[Guest]: Then they have to live for the children

03:58:00.040 --> 03:58:02.040
[Guest]: It's a chakra view

03:58:02.040 --> 03:58:04.040
[Guest]: Nobody is living for themselves

03:58:04.040 --> 03:58:06.040
[Guest]: And that is half our society's problem

03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:08.040
[Guest]: Why is everybody angry in our society?

03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:10.040
[Guest]: Because nobody does anything for themselves

03:58:10.040 --> 03:58:12.040
[Guest]: They try to do it

03:58:12.040 --> 03:58:40.040
[Guest]: Stop worrying about what everybody else wants

03:58:40.040 --> 03:58:42.040
[Guest]: Now maybe I should think about it

03:58:42.040 --> 03:58:44.040
[Guest]: Because my only focus in life was work

03:58:44.040 --> 03:58:46.040
[Guest]: It was just work

03:58:46.040 --> 03:58:48.040
[Guest]: Because I needed to make my mother proud

03:58:48.040 --> 03:58:50.040
[Guest]: Because she raised me

03:58:50.040 --> 03:58:52.040
[Guest]: I need to pay her back

03:58:52.040 --> 03:58:54.040
[Guest]: In some way

03:58:54.040 --> 03:58:56.040
[Guest]: And paying her back in my case was not money

03:58:56.040 --> 03:58:58.040
[Guest]: Because of privilege

03:58:58.040 --> 03:59:00.040
[Guest]: But it was in terms of pride

03:59:00.040 --> 03:59:02.040
[Guest]: In terms of getting her to have

03:59:02.040 --> 03:59:04.040
[Guest]: Where she could go and tell somebody else

03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:06.040
[Guest]: Look what my son is doing

03:59:06.040 --> 03:59:08.040
[Guest]: Look how successful my son is

03:59:08.040 --> 03:59:10.040
[Guest]: For the community to call herself

03:59:10.040 --> 03:59:12.040
[Guest]: Like my mother

03:59:12.040 --> 03:59:14.040
[Guest]: It's just

03:59:14.040 --> 03:59:16.040
[Guest]: All of us are living

03:59:16.040 --> 03:59:18.040
[Guest]: These narratives for others

03:59:18.040 --> 03:59:20.040
[Guest]: And nobody is actually living

03:59:20.040 --> 03:59:22.040
[Guest]: For themselves

03:59:22.040 --> 03:59:24.040
[Guest]: And I have always

03:59:24.040 --> 03:59:26.040
[Guest]: I have just found this

03:59:26.040 --> 03:59:28.040
[Guest]: Such a terrible thing

03:59:28.040 --> 03:59:30.040
[Guest]: Such a tragic thing

03:59:30.040 --> 03:59:32.040
[Guest]: Such a sad way

03:59:32.040 --> 03:59:34.040
[Guest]: In which we look at our culture

03:59:34.040 --> 03:59:36.040
[Guest]: I am not saying

03:59:36.040 --> 03:59:38.040
[Guest]: We need to push each other away

03:59:38.040 --> 03:59:40.040
[Guest]: And not care about our families and communities

03:59:40.040 --> 03:59:42.040
[Guest]: Of course we must

03:59:42.040 --> 03:59:44.040
[Guest]: But it's okay to also care about yourself

03:59:44.040 --> 03:59:46.040
[Guest]: Self care as a concept

03:59:46.040 --> 03:59:48.040
[Guest]: Does not exist

03:59:48.040 --> 03:59:50.040
[Guest]: In Indian society

03:59:50.040 --> 03:59:52.040
[Guest]: People who do self care

03:59:52.040 --> 03:59:54.040
[Guest]: Today are called influencers

03:59:54.040 --> 03:59:56.040
[Guest]: It's not a

03:59:56.040 --> 03:59:58.040
[Guest]: It's not a thing that you practice

03:59:58.040 --> 04:00:00.040
[Guest]: It's not a thing that you care about

04:00:00.040 --> 04:00:02.040
[Guest]: Even the idea of self care

04:00:02.040 --> 04:00:04.040
[Guest]: Right now Amit when you think about it

04:00:04.040 --> 04:00:06.040
[Guest]: Now it comes down to

04:00:06.040 --> 04:00:08.040
[Guest]: Going to spas or like

04:00:08.040 --> 04:00:10.040
[Guest]: Getting a manicure pedicure

04:00:10.040 --> 04:00:12.040
[Guest]: Or having a pool day

04:00:12.040 --> 04:00:14.040
[Guest]: Or whatever you know

04:00:14.040 --> 04:00:16.040
[Guest]: Even those are commodified

04:00:16.040 --> 04:00:18.040
[Guest]: And capitalist ideas of what self care is

04:00:18.040 --> 04:00:20.040
[Guest]: Self care is you know

04:00:20.040 --> 04:00:22.040
[Guest]: Actually being able to spend a Sunday

04:00:22.040 --> 04:00:24.040
[Guest]: Without having to worry about productivity

04:00:24.040 --> 04:00:26.040
[Guest]: Self care is actually having a day

04:00:26.040 --> 04:00:28.040
[Guest]: Only for yourself without worrying like

04:00:28.040 --> 04:00:30.040
[Guest]: What will my you know

04:00:30.040 --> 04:00:32.040
[Guest]: Partner, husband, son

04:00:32.040 --> 04:00:34.040
[Guest]: Wife, family

04:00:34.040 --> 04:00:36.040
[Guest]: Want to do or think of

04:00:36.040 --> 04:00:38.040
[Guest]: I can't plan

04:00:38.040 --> 04:00:40.040
[Guest]: It's been so tough for me to plan a solo trip

04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:42.040
[Guest]: Because I have

04:00:42.040 --> 04:00:44.040
[Guest]: My brother lives in the US

04:00:44.040 --> 04:00:46.040
[Guest]: My parents live in Bahrain

04:00:46.040 --> 04:00:48.040
[Guest]: My wife obviously lives with me

04:00:48.040 --> 04:00:50.040
[Guest]: But anytime I have free time

04:00:50.040 --> 04:00:52.040
[Guest]: I need to find a way of dividing it with the three people

04:00:52.040 --> 04:00:54.040
[Guest]: My aunt lives in Karnal

04:00:54.040 --> 04:00:56.040
[Guest]: I'm close to all of them

04:00:56.040 --> 04:00:58.040
[Guest]: Whatever free time I have I'm always like

04:00:58.040 --> 04:01:00.040
[Guest]: You know

04:01:00.040 --> 04:01:02.040
[Guest]: I need to divide it

04:01:02.040 --> 04:01:04.040
[Guest]: My therapist tells me

04:01:04.040 --> 04:01:06.040
[Guest]: Where is the time that you are living for yourself

04:01:06.040 --> 04:01:08.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't know

04:01:08.040 --> 04:01:10.040
[Guest]: But you solved the problem

04:01:10.040 --> 04:01:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Because now they will all listen to this

04:01:12.040 --> 04:01:14.040
[Guest]: And your aunt from Karnal will call you

04:01:14.040 --> 04:01:16.040
[Guest]: And say you don't need to come

04:01:16.040 --> 04:01:18.040
[Guest]: They are very sweet and they say this

04:01:18.040 --> 04:01:20.040
[Guest]: It's not even about them

04:01:20.040 --> 04:01:22.040
[Guest]: My parents and my mother

04:01:22.040 --> 04:01:24.040
[Guest]: And my aunt in particular

04:01:24.040 --> 04:01:26.040
[Guest]: My father doesn't even like

04:01:26.040 --> 04:01:28.040
[Guest]: When he comes and meets me

04:01:28.040 --> 04:01:30.040
[Guest]: Although again as I said he is trying now

04:01:30.040 --> 04:01:32.040
[Guest]: But my mom and aunt have been super supportive

04:01:32.040 --> 04:01:34.040
[Guest]: And of course

04:01:34.040 --> 04:01:36.040
[Guest]: They also sacrifice in sending their children away

04:01:36.040 --> 04:01:38.040
[Guest]: They say one day you go away

04:01:38.040 --> 04:01:40.040
[Guest]: They want you to

04:01:40.040 --> 04:01:42.040
[Guest]: Get out of and go to a different place

04:01:42.040 --> 04:01:44.040
[Guest]: And study and work there etc

04:01:44.040 --> 04:01:46.040
[Guest]: Even if they want

04:01:46.040 --> 04:01:48.040
[Guest]: They don't ask their children now

04:01:48.040 --> 04:01:50.040
[Guest]: Because sacrifice has become the whole thing

04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:52.040
[Guest]: So there is just tons and tons of

04:01:52.040 --> 04:01:54.040
[Guest]: Problems in the way

04:01:54.040 --> 04:01:56.040
[Guest]: We think of all of this

04:01:56.040 --> 04:01:58.040
[Guest]: And it's become

04:01:58.040 --> 04:02:00.040
[Guest]: So difficult for us

04:02:00.040 --> 04:02:02.040
[Guest]: It also comes

04:02:02.040 --> 04:02:04.040
[Guest]: From again two other things

04:02:04.040 --> 04:02:06.040
[Guest]: One thing again

04:02:06.040 --> 04:02:08.040
[Guest]: Is this idea of

04:02:08.040 --> 04:02:10.040
[Guest]: How we have constantly been

04:02:10.040 --> 04:02:12.040
[Guest]: Compared growing up

04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:14.040
[Guest]: Always

04:02:14.040 --> 04:02:16.040
[Guest]: So you are

04:02:16.040 --> 04:02:18.040
[Guest]: Again your life is a shadow of that

04:02:18.040 --> 04:02:20.040
[Guest]: Cousin that you are competing with

04:02:20.040 --> 04:02:22.040
[Guest]: It is always about that

04:02:22.040 --> 04:02:24.040
[Guest]: Neighbors son or daughter that you need to beat

04:02:24.040 --> 04:02:26.040
[Guest]: It is always about

04:02:26.040 --> 04:02:28.040
[Guest]: You know in the group of people

04:02:28.040 --> 04:02:30.040
[Guest]: Your parents, in a group of people

04:02:30.040 --> 04:02:32.040
[Guest]: You have to be the most intelligent

04:02:32.040 --> 04:02:34.040
[Guest]: So when you have these

04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:36.040
[Guest]: When you are constantly

04:02:36.040 --> 04:02:38.040
[Guest]: Where is the empathy lacking right now

04:02:38.040 --> 04:02:40.040
[Guest]: The empathy is lacking

04:02:40.040 --> 04:02:42.040
[Guest]: In our society because we have been

04:02:42.040 --> 04:02:44.040
[Guest]: Forced to be

04:02:44.040 --> 04:02:46.040
[Guest]: To think about our better good

04:02:46.040 --> 04:02:48.040
[Guest]: For our

04:02:48.040 --> 04:02:50.040
[Guest]: Families

04:02:50.040 --> 04:02:52.040
[Guest]: So we have turned into

04:02:52.040 --> 04:02:54.040
[Guest]: We have been

04:02:54.040 --> 04:02:56.040
[Guest]: Pushed into individual narratives

04:02:56.040 --> 04:02:58.040
[Guest]: So that we can

04:02:58.040 --> 04:03:00.040
[Guest]: Make our families proud

04:03:00.040 --> 04:03:02.040
[Guest]: So we can make our systems

04:03:02.040 --> 04:03:04.040
[Guest]: Proud but in the pursuit of

04:03:04.040 --> 04:03:06.040
[Guest]: That we are supposed to not care

04:03:06.040 --> 04:03:08.040
[Guest]: About the community

04:03:08.040 --> 04:03:10.040
[Guest]: And that's just the paradox and

04:03:10.040 --> 04:03:12.040
[Guest]: Irony of it all

04:03:12.040 --> 04:03:14.040
[Guest]: You are constantly told that

04:03:14.040 --> 04:03:16.040
[Guest]: If you have to go ahead you have to go on your own

04:03:16.040 --> 04:03:18.040
[Guest]: You have to beat it

04:03:18.040 --> 04:03:20.040
[Guest]: You have to defeat it

04:03:20.040 --> 04:03:22.040
[Guest]: And when you go ahead

04:03:22.040 --> 04:03:24.040
[Guest]: And someone is left behind

04:03:24.040 --> 04:03:26.040
[Guest]: You can't go back

04:03:26.040 --> 04:03:28.040
[Guest]: You can't go back, fools go back

04:03:28.040 --> 04:03:30.040
[Guest]: Fools are the ones who stop

04:03:30.040 --> 04:03:32.040
[Guest]: Or pause or rest

04:03:32.040 --> 04:03:34.040
[Guest]: Or who kind of, you have to constantly

04:03:34.040 --> 04:03:36.040
[Guest]: Every bit of your time

04:03:36.040 --> 04:03:38.040
[Guest]: Has to be commodified, you have to

04:03:38.040 --> 04:03:40.040
[Guest]: Constantly go to the next milestone

04:03:40.040 --> 04:03:42.040
[Guest]: In life and that's just the middle

04:03:42.040 --> 04:03:44.040
[Guest]: Class overall thinking

04:03:44.040 --> 04:03:46.040
[Guest]: And I am not saying that right now I am middle class

04:03:46.040 --> 04:03:48.040
[Guest]: At all but I am just saying that that's the culture

04:03:48.040 --> 04:03:50.040
[Guest]: That has become the middle

04:03:50.040 --> 04:03:52.040
[Guest]: Class culture and in that culture

04:03:52.040 --> 04:03:54.040
[Guest]: If you, and you are doing all of this so someday

04:03:54.040 --> 04:03:56.040
[Guest]: You can also pay back to your parents

04:03:56.040 --> 04:03:58.040
[Guest]: So for the idea of, but you are resenting everybody

04:03:58.040 --> 04:04:00.040
[Guest]: And you are only, after a point of time

04:04:00.040 --> 04:04:02.040
[Guest]: You become so conditioned and just moving forward

04:04:02.040 --> 04:04:04.040
[Guest]: Moving forward, moving forward that you are not even looking left and right

04:04:04.040 --> 04:04:06.040
[Guest]: And most people ultimately

04:04:06.040 --> 04:04:08.040
[Guest]: Also stop talking to their parents or stop like caring

04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:10.040
[Guest]: For their parents because they have pushed them into these narratives

04:04:10.040 --> 04:04:12.040
[Guest]: They have become so individual

04:04:12.040 --> 04:04:14.040
[Guest]: They are like why should I care about you now

04:04:14.040 --> 04:04:16.040
[Guest]: While it's not true for most of the country

04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:18.040
[Guest]: Again sacrifice is the large word

04:04:18.040 --> 04:04:20.040
[Guest]: Which is also given as a word to burden us

04:04:20.040 --> 04:04:22.040
[Guest]: And burden everybody with this idea

04:04:22.040 --> 04:04:24.040
[Guest]: That you can't do something for yourself

04:04:24.040 --> 04:04:26.040
[Guest]: So you have to do for the family

04:04:26.040 --> 04:04:28.040
[Guest]: You know

04:04:28.040 --> 04:04:30.040
[Guest]: But in a society you have to do it for yourself

04:04:30.040 --> 04:04:32.040
[Guest]: So you are not

04:04:32.040 --> 04:04:34.040
[Guest]: And that's where you chip away every sense of

04:04:34.040 --> 04:04:36.040
[Guest]: Empathy you have for anybody else

04:04:36.040 --> 04:04:38.040
[Guest]: Or for that matter for yourself

04:04:38.040 --> 04:04:40.040
[Guest]: And that's the largest thing, while you don't have

04:04:40.040 --> 04:04:42.040
[Guest]: Empathy for others, you also don't have any empathy for yourself

04:04:42.040 --> 04:04:44.040
[Guest]: You are not compassionate to yourself, you are not

04:04:44.040 --> 04:04:46.040
[Guest]: Kind to yourself, you don't slow down, you don't think

04:04:46.040 --> 04:04:48.040
[Guest]: Why are we, where is the question

04:04:48.040 --> 04:04:50.040
[Guest]: About why we are doing what we are doing

04:04:50.040 --> 04:04:52.040
[Guest]: That question is not asked in education systems

04:04:52.040 --> 04:04:54.040
[Guest]: And when we ask questions, all in our country

04:04:54.040 --> 04:04:56.040
[Guest]: No one is able to ask questions

04:04:56.040 --> 04:04:58.040
[Guest]: If someone asks a question, you are shocked

04:04:58.040 --> 04:05:00.040
[Guest]: How are you asking a question

04:05:00.040 --> 04:05:02.040
[Guest]: Don't ask questions, keep your head down

04:05:02.040 --> 04:05:04.040
[Guest]: Respect your elders, one other thing that I have

04:05:04.040 --> 04:05:06.040
[Guest]: Like always had this massive

04:05:06.040 --> 04:05:08.040
[Guest]: Why respect your elders

04:05:08.040 --> 04:05:10.040
[Guest]: And not respect everyone

04:05:10.040 --> 04:05:12.040
[Guest]: I am not saying don't respect your elders

04:05:12.040 --> 04:05:14.040
[Guest]: I am just saying why is the saying not that

04:05:14.040 --> 04:05:16.040
[Guest]: Respect everyone, it's respect your elders

04:05:16.040 --> 04:05:18.040
[Guest]: Because of patriarchal system where you know

04:05:18.040 --> 04:05:20.040
[Guest]: You have to respect those in power who are older to you

04:05:20.040 --> 04:05:22.040
[Guest]: And the only

04:05:22.040 --> 04:05:24.040
[Guest]: Allegiance you have

04:05:24.040 --> 04:05:26.040
[Guest]: Is to be with the people in power

04:05:26.040 --> 04:05:28.040
[Guest]: Anybody who is not in power, you can say anything to them

04:05:28.040 --> 04:05:30.040
[Guest]: You can do anything to them, which is what we are seeing right now

04:05:30.040 --> 04:05:32.040
[Guest]: Anybody who is marginalized

04:05:32.040 --> 04:05:34.040
[Guest]: Is not respected, is not

04:05:34.040 --> 04:05:36.040
[Guest]: Kind of given any bit of love and empathy

04:05:36.040 --> 04:05:38.040
[Guest]: Because they are not elders

04:05:38.040 --> 04:05:40.040
[Guest]: And elder is not just about older

04:05:40.040 --> 04:05:42.040
[Guest]: In terms of experience, it's just

04:05:42.040 --> 04:05:44.040
[Guest]: Bade, bada insaan

04:05:44.040 --> 04:05:46.040
[Guest]: Bado ki izzat karo

04:05:46.040 --> 04:05:48.040
[Guest]: Sabki izzat karo, kabhi zingi mein

04:05:48.040 --> 04:05:50.040
[Guest]: If that was a society we would be living in

04:05:50.040 --> 04:05:52.040
[Guest]: Empathetic, not divided

04:05:52.040 --> 04:05:54.040
[Guest]: Not polarized kind society

04:05:54.040 --> 04:05:56.040
[Guest]: Sabse pyaar rakho, izzat bhi kya hota hai

04:05:56.040 --> 04:05:58.040
[Guest]: Izzat kya hai, respect kya hai

04:05:58.040 --> 04:06:00.040
[Guest]: Respect itself is a, you know, why are we

04:06:00.040 --> 04:06:02.040
[Guest]: Reducing all the emotion we need to have

04:06:02.040 --> 04:06:04.040
[Guest]: As a society to respect

04:06:04.040 --> 04:06:06.040
[Guest]: Pyaar ki baat karo, sabse pyaar karo

04:06:06.040 --> 04:06:08.040
[Guest]: Wo toh hota nahi hai, izzat karo

04:06:08.040 --> 04:06:10.040
[Guest]: And particularly for young people

04:06:10.040 --> 04:06:12.040
[Guest]: Why is it so difficult for people to find their stories

04:06:12.040 --> 04:06:14.040
[Guest]: Because you are constantly told that you are

04:06:14.040 --> 04:06:16.040
[Guest]: Look at the stories of success

04:06:16.040 --> 04:06:18.040
[Guest]: Amit, that are out there in the world, right

04:06:18.040 --> 04:06:20.040
[Guest]: IIT mein tumh log

04:06:20.040 --> 04:06:22.040
[Guest]: Top karte ho, ya phir jo na coaching centres

04:06:22.040 --> 04:06:24.040
[Guest]: Mein top karte ho, tumhari hoarding lag jati hai

04:06:24.040 --> 04:06:26.040
[Guest]: And that's how people identify, look at these

04:06:26.040 --> 04:06:28.040
[Guest]: Four faces, and those faces will

04:06:28.040 --> 04:06:30.040
[Guest]: Look like they are, they have been

04:06:30.040 --> 04:06:32.040
[Guest]: All their

04:06:32.040 --> 04:06:34.040
[Guest]: Life has been, you know, taken

04:06:34.040 --> 04:06:36.040
[Guest]: Out of their faces, it's just miserable

04:06:36.040 --> 04:06:38.040
[Guest]: Faces of these young people who have

04:06:38.040 --> 04:06:40.040
[Guest]: Top 10 coaching centres, and that's how you become famous

04:06:40.040 --> 04:06:42.040
[Guest]: Anytime you are

04:06:42.040 --> 04:06:44.040
[Guest]: Asked, mainna TEDx's, you've seen

04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:46.040
[Guest]: The TEDx's, I've gone and given all these TEDx's

04:06:46.040 --> 04:06:48.040
[Guest]: And every TEDx ke baad mainna ek question

04:06:48.040 --> 04:06:50.040
[Guest]: Poochta ho, ki jo na, I've come to your

04:06:50.040 --> 04:06:52.040
[Guest]: Campus now, how many

04:06:52.040 --> 04:06:54.040
[Guest]: People in your campus have been on this stage

04:06:54.040 --> 04:06:56.040
[Guest]: They'll be like nobody, I'm saying

04:06:56.040 --> 04:06:58.040
[Guest]: Do you, are you saying that there is not

04:06:58.040 --> 04:07:00.040
[Guest]: A single person in your campus

04:07:00.040 --> 04:07:02.040
[Guest]: Whose story is worthy of being told

04:07:02.040 --> 04:07:04.040
[Guest]: On a stage like this, because

04:07:04.040 --> 04:07:06.040
[Guest]: That's not true, every person

04:07:06.040 --> 04:07:08.040
[Guest]: Has

04:07:08.040 --> 04:07:10.040
[Guest]: Had a battle that they fight to reach where

04:07:10.040 --> 04:07:12.040
[Guest]: They are, no matter what age it is

04:07:12.040 --> 04:07:14.040
[Guest]: You can be 12, you can be 15, and you'll

04:07:14.040 --> 04:07:16.040
[Guest]: Be fighting battles in your life

04:07:16.040 --> 04:07:18.040
[Guest]: And sometimes, you know, especially with your family

04:07:18.040 --> 04:07:20.040
[Guest]: And especially with your community and society

04:07:20.040 --> 04:07:22.040
[Guest]: There are much bigger battles, the Gen Z and

04:07:22.040 --> 04:07:24.040
[Guest]: Young people in India, they are fighting like

04:07:24.040 --> 04:07:26.040
[Guest]: X number of battles

04:07:26.040 --> 04:07:28.040
[Guest]: Of identity, where they are not

04:07:28.040 --> 04:07:30.040
[Guest]: Know what their identity is, but they are not allowed

04:07:30.040 --> 04:07:32.040
[Guest]: To live it, because we live in a conservative society

04:07:32.040 --> 04:07:34.040
[Guest]: How can, how dare you have an identity

04:07:34.040 --> 04:07:36.040
[Guest]: And not follow the identity we have for you

04:07:36.040 --> 04:07:38.040
[Guest]: Because that's the narrative as parents we have, that's the narrative

04:07:38.040 --> 04:07:40.040
[Guest]: As society we have for you, so it's a

04:07:40.040 --> 04:07:42.040
[Guest]: And every young person thinks, maybe

04:07:42.040 --> 04:07:44.040
[Guest]: If that is, I'm sorry I'm moving

04:07:44.040 --> 04:07:46.040
[Guest]: From like one thing to another

04:07:46.040 --> 04:07:48.040
[Guest]: But this idea of settle

04:07:48.040 --> 04:07:50.040
[Guest]: This idea of settle for me

04:07:50.040 --> 04:07:52.040
[Guest]: Is always like

04:07:52.040 --> 04:07:54.040
[Guest]: I mean settle is also a word we are using for stable

04:07:54.040 --> 04:07:56.040
[Guest]: But it is also a word we use for compromise

04:07:56.040 --> 04:07:58.040
[Guest]: And I've

04:07:58.040 --> 04:08:00.040
[Guest]: When people say settle karlo, settle karlo

04:08:00.040 --> 04:08:02.040
[Guest]: Settle karlo, actually

04:08:02.040 --> 04:08:04.040
[Guest]: It's not about stability, it is about compromise

04:08:04.040 --> 04:08:06.040
[Guest]: Ki tumne na apne mission statement pura kar liye

04:08:06.040 --> 04:08:08.040
[Guest]: Ab tum settle ho jao, settle ho jao matlab

04:08:08.040 --> 04:08:10.040
[Guest]: After a point of time, you need to

04:08:10.040 --> 04:08:12.040
[Guest]: You can have whatever idea you have of independence

04:08:12.040 --> 04:08:14.040
[Guest]: But after a point of time, you have to give in

04:08:14.040 --> 04:08:16.040
[Guest]: You have to compromise, and you have to be one in society

04:08:16.040 --> 04:08:18.040
[Guest]: And that's called settling

04:08:18.040 --> 04:08:20.040
[Guest]: I'm now settled, I'm

04:08:20.040 --> 04:08:22.040
[Guest]: One of society, and now my life is

04:08:22.040 --> 04:08:24.040
[Guest]: The same life that society

04:08:24.040 --> 04:08:26.040
[Guest]: And culture and patriarchy has asked me to live

04:08:26.040 --> 04:08:28.040
[Guest]: And that's the story of everybody

04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:30.040
[Guest]: You ultimately become a

04:08:32.040 --> 04:08:34.040
[Guest]: Large, one

04:08:34.040 --> 04:08:36.040
[Guest]: Some nobody

04:08:36.040 --> 04:08:38.040
[Guest]: In everybody

04:08:38.040 --> 04:08:40.040
[Guest]: Versus having an identity of your own

04:08:40.040 --> 04:08:42.040
[Guest]: And why is there so much anger?

04:08:42.040 --> 04:08:44.040
[Guest]: Why has there been so much toxicity

04:08:44.040 --> 04:08:46.040
[Guest]: Against, you know, on the internet

04:08:46.040 --> 04:08:48.040
[Guest]: All of this, it is coming from a place

04:08:48.040 --> 04:08:50.040
[Guest]: Where most of these people were always told

04:08:50.040 --> 04:08:52.040
[Guest]: That your identity is like

04:08:52.040 --> 04:08:54.040
[Guest]: A part of a collective

04:08:54.040 --> 04:08:56.040
[Guest]: So whenever a marginalized community wants to

04:08:56.040 --> 04:08:58.040
[Guest]: Assert their identity as an individual

04:08:58.040 --> 04:09:00.040
[Guest]: You can't have that, how can you have that?

04:09:00.040 --> 04:09:02.040
[Guest]: You don't get to have an identity today

04:09:02.040 --> 04:09:04.040
[Guest]: You are not going to

04:09:04.040 --> 04:09:06.040
[Guest]: You are not going to be able to

04:09:06.040 --> 04:09:08.040
[Guest]: Assert your individuality

04:09:08.040 --> 04:09:10.040
[Guest]: When I never got to do

04:09:10.040 --> 04:09:12.040
[Guest]: You're a feminist, you can't be a feminist

04:09:12.040 --> 04:09:14.040
[Guest]: How can you say you're a woman when we're all supposed to be

04:09:14.040 --> 04:09:16.040
[Guest]: Part of a collective, and a collective

04:09:16.040 --> 04:09:18.040
[Guest]: Which cannot question, which has to settle

04:09:18.040 --> 04:09:20.040
[Guest]: And which has to follow the rules given by society

04:09:20.040 --> 04:09:22.040
[Guest]: How can you be

04:09:22.040 --> 04:09:24.040
[Guest]: How can you say as a Muslim

04:09:24.040 --> 04:09:26.040
[Guest]: You require rights

04:09:26.040 --> 04:09:28.040
[Guest]: Well, you can't have that right

04:09:28.040 --> 04:09:30.040
[Guest]: Because, you know, as a society we have decided

04:09:30.040 --> 04:09:32.040
[Guest]: This is the way things are going to work

04:09:32.040 --> 04:09:34.040
[Guest]: So any right in our country

04:09:34.040 --> 04:09:36.040
[Guest]: Is not given

04:09:36.040 --> 04:09:38.040
[Guest]: Based on the fact that

04:09:38.040 --> 04:09:40.040
[Guest]: Our empathy is over

04:09:40.040 --> 04:09:42.040
[Guest]: Because our empathy

04:09:42.040 --> 04:09:44.040
[Guest]: Was already over

04:09:44.040 --> 04:09:46.040
[Guest]: The day we start being

04:09:46.040 --> 04:09:48.040
[Guest]: Compassionate to ourselves

04:09:48.040 --> 04:09:50.040
[Guest]: And recognizing that every one of us

04:09:50.040 --> 04:09:52.040
[Guest]: Also had a story of an obstacle we've overcome

04:09:52.040 --> 04:09:54.040
[Guest]: And give ourselves

04:09:54.040 --> 04:09:56.040
[Guest]: That leeway, that love, that compassion

04:09:56.040 --> 04:09:58.040
[Guest]: And say, you know what

04:09:58.040 --> 04:10:00.040
[Guest]: We don't have to be angry about this

04:10:00.040 --> 04:10:02.040
[Guest]: In fact, we can lean into some of these things

04:10:02.040 --> 04:10:04.040
[Guest]: Who said that even if you're 35

04:10:04.040 --> 04:10:06.040
[Guest]: You're 40, you're 45, you can't

04:10:06.040 --> 04:10:08.040
[Guest]: Start your life, or do something that you've

04:10:08.040 --> 04:10:10.040
[Guest]: Always wanted to do, who said, you'll be happier right now

04:10:10.040 --> 04:10:12.040
[Guest]: Do it now

04:10:12.040 --> 04:10:14.040
[Guest]: If you've never done it, do it now

04:10:14.040 --> 04:10:16.040
[Guest]: I've never gone to, I've never exercised

04:10:16.040 --> 04:10:18.040
[Guest]: I can get angry about like the system

04:10:18.040 --> 04:10:20.040
[Guest]: That forced me to do this, but I'm trying now

04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:22.040
[Guest]: Failing at it, but trying

04:10:22.040 --> 04:10:24.040
[Guest]: I've never cared about, I mean so many

04:10:24.040 --> 04:10:26.040
[Guest]: Different things, I've so many different things

04:10:26.040 --> 04:10:28.040
[Guest]: At this age that I'm now trying

04:10:28.040 --> 04:10:30.040
[Guest]: To kind of

04:10:30.040 --> 04:10:32.040
[Guest]: You know, incorporate

04:10:32.040 --> 04:10:34.040
[Guest]: Or inculcate, and just see how it works

04:10:34.040 --> 04:10:36.040
[Guest]: So what if I

04:10:36.040 --> 04:10:38.040
[Guest]: Lost, or I won't even say lost

04:10:38.040 --> 04:10:40.040
[Guest]: So what if there's a whole time of mine

04:10:40.040 --> 04:10:42.040
[Guest]: That I didn't do any of these things, life is very long

04:10:42.040 --> 04:10:44.040
[Guest]: You can still do it, you can

04:10:44.040 --> 04:10:46.040
[Guest]: Still have that Sunday that you want only for yourself

04:10:46.040 --> 04:10:48.040
[Guest]: You can still do whatever version

04:10:48.040 --> 04:10:50.040
[Guest]: Of self-care you call it

04:10:50.040 --> 04:10:52.040
[Guest]: You know, whatever it is

04:10:52.040 --> 04:10:54.040
[Guest]: You call self-care, you can still go for it, you don't

04:10:54.040 --> 04:10:56.040
[Guest]: Have to constantly

04:10:56.040 --> 04:10:58.040
[Guest]: Be burdened by, and

04:10:58.040 --> 04:11:00.040
[Guest]: Shamed, and judged by

04:11:00.040 --> 04:11:02.040
[Guest]: Society, for what your life

04:11:02.040 --> 04:11:04.040
[Guest]: Should be like, and what your story should be like

04:11:04.040 --> 04:11:06.040
[Guest]: It is your story, no matter what age you are

04:11:06.040 --> 04:11:08.040
[Guest]: I say this to young people, but I'm also now

04:11:08.040 --> 04:11:10.040
[Guest]: Saying it to anybody who's listening right now

04:11:10.040 --> 04:11:12.040
[Guest]: It is your story, it is your narrative

04:11:12.040 --> 04:11:14.040
[Guest]: You take back control

04:11:14.040 --> 04:11:16.040
[Guest]: You don't have to cede that

04:11:16.040 --> 04:11:18.040
[Guest]: Control, that you may have ceded

04:11:18.040 --> 04:11:20.040
[Guest]: For all your life right now, and you're

04:11:20.040 --> 04:11:22.040
[Guest]: Going to be happier for it, you're going to be less toxic

04:11:22.040 --> 04:11:24.040
[Guest]: You're going to be less angry, you're going to hate

04:11:24.040 --> 04:11:26.040
[Guest]: The world a little less, if you start being compassionate

04:11:26.040 --> 04:11:28.040
[Amit Varma]: To yourself. Really wise words

04:11:28.040 --> 04:11:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And I totally agree with you

04:11:30.040 --> 04:11:32.040
[Amit Varma]: About, you know, group rights

04:11:32.040 --> 04:11:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And thinking in collectives instead of thinking

04:11:34.040 --> 04:11:36.040
[Amit Varma]: As individuals and so on and so forth

04:11:36.040 --> 04:11:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And what you also say about

04:11:38.040 --> 04:11:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Everybody having a story is so true

04:11:40.040 --> 04:11:42.040
[Amit Varma]: The problem is that everybody has a story

04:11:42.040 --> 04:11:44.040
[Amit Varma]: But not everybody tells it, and maybe

04:11:44.040 --> 04:11:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Just telling yourself

04:11:46.040 --> 04:11:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Your story, maybe nobody else

04:11:48.040 --> 04:11:50.040
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to share it, but just telling yourself

04:11:50.040 --> 04:11:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Your story can give you clarity

04:11:52.040 --> 04:11:54.040
[Amit Varma]: About whether you're just living out a template

04:11:54.040 --> 04:11:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Or whether, you know

04:11:56.040 --> 04:11:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Is this really what you wanted to do?

04:11:58.040 --> 04:12:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Are these the parts you really wanted to

04:12:00.040 --> 04:12:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Go down along, and I also

04:12:02.040 --> 04:12:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Feel so strongly about

04:12:04.040 --> 04:12:06.040
[Amit Varma]: The last thing you said, that it's never too late

04:12:06.040 --> 04:12:08.040
[Amit Varma]: To start all of this, you know, I did an episode

04:12:08.040 --> 04:12:10.040
[Amit Varma]: With Kavita Rao, who's written a brilliant book

04:12:10.040 --> 04:12:12.040
[Amit Varma]: On lady doctors, and I think she

04:12:12.040 --> 04:12:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Mentioned in that, that her mother started learning

04:12:14.040 --> 04:12:16.040
[Amit Varma]: The sitar at 76, and in a couple

04:12:16.040 --> 04:12:18.040
[Unknown]: Of years she's really nailed it

04:12:18.040 --> 04:12:20.040
[Amit Varma]: I think of authors like, one of my favorite

04:12:20.040 --> 04:12:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Novelist, Penelope Fitzgerald, who started

04:12:22.040 --> 04:12:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Writing novels in her 60s, and won the

04:12:24.040 --> 04:12:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Booker Prize, and just wrote great books

04:12:26.040 --> 04:12:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And our mutual friend

04:12:28.040 --> 04:12:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Roshan Abbas

04:12:30.040 --> 04:12:32.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, has been educating

04:12:32.040 --> 04:12:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Me and enlightening me on how

04:12:34.040 --> 04:12:36.040
[Amit Varma]: People in our generation will live to 120

04:12:36.040 --> 04:12:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And healthy lives till 120

04:12:38.040 --> 04:12:40.040
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, he suddenly made me feel

04:12:40.040 --> 04:12:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Like a young buck again

04:12:42.040 --> 04:12:44.040
[Unknown]: So, and

04:12:44.040 --> 04:12:46.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, the mention of Roshan is a good

04:12:46.040 --> 04:12:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Way to segue into the

04:12:48.040 --> 04:12:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Next thing I want to talk about

04:12:50.040 --> 04:12:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Because earlier we were talking about Roshan

04:12:52.040 --> 04:12:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And Varun, and how kind

04:12:54.040 --> 04:12:56.040
[Amit Varma]: They both are, and kindness

04:12:56.040 --> 04:12:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Is, you know, a

04:12:58.040 --> 04:13:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Theme that you've spoken about a lot

04:13:00.040 --> 04:13:02.040
[Amit Varma]: As well, not

04:13:02.040 --> 04:13:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Just kindness to others, but kindness to

04:13:04.040 --> 04:13:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Yourself, and kindness perhaps as a habit

04:13:06.040 --> 04:13:08.040
[Amit Varma]: That you intentionally

04:13:08.040 --> 04:13:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Inculcate. You know, so tell me

04:13:10.040 --> 04:13:12.040
[Amit Varma]: A little bit about your

04:13:12.040 --> 04:13:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Thinking in this, because

04:13:14.040 --> 04:13:16.040
[Amit Varma]: We think of many qualities

04:13:16.040 --> 04:13:18.040
[Amit Varma]: In our lives. We think that

04:13:18.040 --> 04:13:20.040
[Amit Varma]: We have to be intelligent

04:13:20.040 --> 04:13:22.040
[Amit Varma]: This has to happen, that has to happen

04:13:22.040 --> 04:13:24.040
[Amit Varma]: We don't often think of kindness, or if we do

04:13:24.040 --> 04:13:26.040
[Amit Varma]: We think of kindness in a context

04:13:26.040 --> 04:13:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Of pity, where, you know

04:13:28.040 --> 04:13:30.040
[Amit Varma]: You can feel virtuous because you are

04:13:30.040 --> 04:13:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Helping someone by being kind, that kind of

04:13:32.040 --> 04:13:34.040
[Amit Varma]: A self-centered kindness

04:13:34.040 --> 04:13:36.040
[Amit Varma]: But, you have thought

04:13:36.040 --> 04:13:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Much more deeply about it, so

04:13:38.040 --> 04:13:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about when

04:13:40.040 --> 04:13:42.040
[Amit Varma]: You started thinking about it, what

04:13:42.040 --> 04:13:44.040
[Amit Varma]: The spurs were, and what other

04:13:44.040 --> 04:13:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Directions it took you into

04:13:46.040 --> 04:13:48.040
[Guest]: So much of my life's

04:13:48.040 --> 04:13:50.040
[Guest]: Work has been with young people

04:13:50.040 --> 04:13:52.040
[Guest]: And a lot of that

04:13:52.040 --> 04:13:54.040
[Guest]: Was me being kind

04:13:54.040 --> 04:13:56.040
[Guest]: To young people in some way

04:13:56.040 --> 04:13:58.040
[Guest]: Or offering safe spaces to

04:13:58.040 --> 04:14:00.040
[Guest]: Them, and a lot of that

04:14:00.040 --> 04:14:02.040
[Guest]: Is because I didn't get it, when I

04:14:02.040 --> 04:14:04.040
[Guest]: Was growing up. I was

04:14:04.040 --> 04:14:06.040
[Guest]: The

04:14:06.040 --> 04:14:08.040
[Guest]: You know

04:14:08.040 --> 04:14:10.040
[Guest]: I was

04:14:10.040 --> 04:14:12.040
[Guest]: Bullied a lot when I was in school

04:14:12.040 --> 04:14:14.040
[Guest]: Because I used to

04:14:14.040 --> 04:14:16.040
[Guest]: Write, I told you, you know, in

04:14:16.040 --> 04:14:18.040
[Guest]: Local magazines and newspapers, and people just

04:14:18.040 --> 04:14:20.040
[Guest]: For some reason associated

04:14:20.040 --> 04:14:22.040
[Guest]: That with narcissism

04:14:22.040 --> 04:14:24.040
[Guest]: Or just

04:14:24.040 --> 04:14:26.040
[Guest]: Had this idea that I am some kind of an

04:14:26.040 --> 04:14:28.040
[Guest]: Asshole who gives opinions

04:14:28.040 --> 04:14:30.040
[Guest]: Has opinions and gets them published

04:14:30.040 --> 04:14:32.040
[Guest]: You know, I've said it in one of my talks

04:14:32.040 --> 04:14:34.040
[Guest]: But like, it used to get so bad

04:14:34.040 --> 04:14:36.040
[Guest]: To me that, you know, I remember

04:14:36.040 --> 04:14:38.040
[Guest]: That I'd be in a

04:14:38.040 --> 04:14:40.040
[Guest]: You know

04:14:40.040 --> 04:14:42.040
[Guest]: An assembly

04:14:42.040 --> 04:14:44.040
[Guest]: A school assembly, and I'd

04:14:44.040 --> 04:14:46.040
[Guest]: Be standing at the back, and I used to

04:14:46.040 --> 04:14:48.040
[Guest]: Take part in a lot of extracurricular activities

04:14:48.040 --> 04:14:50.040
[Guest]: So if I win something, and my name is called

04:14:50.040 --> 04:14:52.040
[Guest]: The whole school would boo

04:14:52.040 --> 04:14:54.040
[Guest]: I'd just go from the back to the front

04:14:54.040 --> 04:14:56.040
[Guest]: And there's like booing, boo, and I'm like a

04:14:56.040 --> 04:14:58.040
[Guest]: 14 year old kid at that time, just

04:14:58.040 --> 04:15:00.040
[Guest]: Hearing all of this, and just being like, what is

04:15:00.040 --> 04:15:02.040
[Guest]: Why do people

04:15:02.040 --> 04:15:04.040
[Guest]: Need to be so unkind, right?

04:15:04.040 --> 04:15:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Sounds like Twitter, your school assembly

04:15:06.040 --> 04:15:08.040
[Guest]: Man, it was Twitter before Twitter

04:15:08.040 --> 04:15:10.040
[Guest]: Like, I used to have physical

04:15:10.040 --> 04:15:12.040
[Guest]: Trolls, forget like, people used

04:15:12.040 --> 04:15:14.040
[Guest]: To put in, I used to write, so I

04:15:14.040 --> 04:15:16.040
[Guest]: There was a newspaper called GDN

04:15:16.040 --> 04:15:18.040
[Guest]: Gulf Daily News, it used to

04:15:18.040 --> 04:15:20.040
[Guest]: Print letters to the editor, and after

04:15:20.040 --> 04:15:22.040
[Guest]: Young Times, I was also, I was so excited

04:15:22.040 --> 04:15:24.040
[Guest]: That my Young Times is getting published

04:15:24.040 --> 04:15:26.040
[Guest]: Which is a young magazine, I should also do it in a newspaper

04:15:26.040 --> 04:15:28.040
[Guest]: And I started writing these newspapers

04:15:28.040 --> 04:15:30.040
[Guest]: Letters, and

04:15:30.040 --> 04:15:32.040
[Guest]: Very quickly, like everybody in Bahrain came to

04:15:32.040 --> 04:15:34.040
[Guest]: Know me as like this

04:15:34.040 --> 04:15:36.040
[Guest]: 14 year old who writes

04:15:36.040 --> 04:15:38.040
[Guest]: Letters for newspapers, because they

04:15:38.040 --> 04:15:40.040
[Guest]: Started publishing my age, so

04:15:40.040 --> 04:15:42.040
[Guest]: Because my ID was

04:15:42.040 --> 04:15:44.040
[Guest]: Nikhil is cool 1986

04:15:44.040 --> 04:15:46.040
[Guest]: You know, for whatever it's worth

04:15:46.040 --> 04:15:48.040
[Guest]: The first ID that I ever

04:15:48.040 --> 04:15:50.040
[Guest]: Made, and Nikhil is

04:15:50.040 --> 04:15:52.040
[Guest]: Cool is what I used to

04:15:52.040 --> 04:15:54.040
[Guest]: Think of myself back then, but 1986

04:15:54.040 --> 04:15:56.040
[Guest]: Was something that the publishers then kind of

04:15:56.040 --> 04:15:58.040
[Guest]: Reached out and said, are you 14, and I said

04:15:58.040 --> 04:16:00.040
[Guest]: Yeah, and you know, and it just kind of

04:16:00.040 --> 04:16:02.040
[Guest]: They put 2 and 2 together, and they started publishing the age

04:16:02.040 --> 04:16:04.040
[Guest]: Which they have not published for anybody else

04:16:04.040 --> 04:16:06.040
[Guest]: Like, so it was just a weird thing that

04:16:06.040 --> 04:16:08.040
[Guest]: You know, they decided that they are going to publish

04:16:08.040 --> 04:16:10.040
[Guest]: My age, which kind of made me

04:16:10.040 --> 04:16:12.040
[Guest]: A target of like

04:16:12.040 --> 04:16:14.040
[Guest]: All kinds of people who would have other

04:16:14.040 --> 04:16:16.040
[Guest]: Opinions to me, right, who would just

04:16:16.040 --> 04:16:18.040
[Guest]: Be, and my opinion at that time was

04:16:18.040 --> 04:16:20.040
[Guest]: 14-15, I was writing about world politics

04:16:20.040 --> 04:16:22.040
[Guest]: In my head, I was like, oh, I know everything

04:16:22.040 --> 04:16:24.040
[Guest]: And I do admit there were stupid opinions

04:16:24.040 --> 04:16:26.040
[Guest]: And, and, but whatever

04:16:26.040 --> 04:16:28.040
[Guest]: It is, yeah, it's a 14-year-old writing, which is

04:16:28.040 --> 04:16:30.040
[Guest]: Also what I see right now, it's young people writing, it's

04:16:30.040 --> 04:16:32.040
[Guest]: Okay, allow us to be stupid, even if

04:16:32.040 --> 04:16:34.040
[Guest]: My opinion wasn't fully formed, at least I had

04:16:34.040 --> 04:16:36.040
[Guest]: An opinion and I was trying to form one

04:16:36.040 --> 04:16:38.040
[Guest]: You know, instead of encouraging, you are

04:16:38.040 --> 04:16:40.040
[Guest]: You know, and as I said, people were

04:16:40.040 --> 04:16:42.040
[Guest]: Trolling on

04:16:42.040 --> 04:16:44.040
[Guest]: Purpose, you know, like trolling in the sense

04:16:44.040 --> 04:16:46.040
[Guest]: And as I said, like, you know, at that time, imagine

04:16:46.040 --> 04:16:48.040
[Guest]: The effort, not everybody had email

04:16:48.040 --> 04:16:50.040
[Guest]: Computers were a privilege, people

04:16:50.040 --> 04:16:52.040
[Guest]: Were writing actual letters, letters were

04:16:52.040 --> 04:16:54.040
[Guest]: Being written and envelopes, they

04:16:54.040 --> 04:16:56.040
[Guest]: Were put in and people would go to post

04:16:56.040 --> 04:16:58.040
[Guest]: Offices to post them and then somewhere

04:16:58.040 --> 04:17:00.040
[Guest]: A publisher would receive it and there

04:17:00.040 --> 04:17:02.040
[Guest]: It would be written, Nikhil is an idiot, how dare Nikhil

04:17:02.040 --> 04:17:04.040
[Guest]: Say this, Nikhil is so stupid, why is a 14

04:17:04.040 --> 04:17:06.040
[Guest]: Year-old writing opinions, and I'm like, where do you

04:17:06.040 --> 04:17:08.040
[Guest]: Have so much free time? That's very committed trolls

04:17:08.040 --> 04:17:10.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, exactly, so I'm saying, I've seen that

04:17:10.040 --> 04:17:12.040
[Guest]: When I was so young, you know, and I

04:17:12.040 --> 04:17:14.040
[Guest]: And, and, and then because of me

04:17:14.040 --> 04:17:16.040
[Guest]: Brother started getting bullied, people started coming

04:17:16.040 --> 04:17:18.040
[Guest]: My younger brother, people started hitting him in school

04:17:18.040 --> 04:17:20.040
[Guest]: You know, because, okay, you are Nikhil's

04:17:20.040 --> 04:17:22.040
[Guest]: Brother, this slap, yeah, I was like

04:17:22.040 --> 04:17:24.040
[Guest]: This is, so I just

04:17:24.040 --> 04:17:26.040
[Guest]: I remember one day I was playing cricket and somebody came

04:17:26.040 --> 04:17:28.040
[Guest]: And threw a ball on me, when I was bowling

04:17:28.040 --> 04:17:30.040
[Guest]: I was like, who's thrown this ball and turns out it was not a ball

04:17:30.040 --> 04:17:32.040
[Guest]: It was a stone, then suddenly more rocks

04:17:32.040 --> 04:17:34.040
[Guest]: Came and thrown on me and they were screaming

04:17:34.040 --> 04:17:36.040
[Guest]: Nikhil Dhanjay, age 14, you're an asshole

04:17:36.040 --> 04:17:38.040
[Guest]: I'm like, what did I do? I don't even know

04:17:38.040 --> 04:17:40.040
[Guest]: What I did, I just wrote

04:17:40.040 --> 04:17:42.040
[Guest]: Opinions, why is that such a

04:17:42.040 --> 04:17:44.040
[Guest]: And whatever that opinion may be

04:17:44.040 --> 04:17:46.040
[Guest]: Whatever you may think of me

04:17:46.040 --> 04:17:48.040
[Guest]: Beyond that, you know, as

04:17:48.040 --> 04:17:50.040
[Guest]: A pompous narcissist was writing this opinion

04:17:50.040 --> 04:17:52.040
[Guest]: Why would you hate me so much?

04:17:52.040 --> 04:17:54.040
[Guest]: I just didn't get it, why is there

04:17:54.040 --> 04:17:56.040
[Guest]: So much unkindness, and I ran, I mean, I didn't

04:17:56.040 --> 04:17:58.040
[Guest]: I mean, I decided after 10th

04:17:58.040 --> 04:18:00.040
[Guest]: This happened in 9th and 10th, then 10th

04:18:00.040 --> 04:18:02.040
[Guest]: At the end of 10th, I decided that I'm going to

04:18:02.040 --> 04:18:04.040
[Guest]: Leave Bahrain, I'm going to go

04:18:04.040 --> 04:18:06.040
[Amit Varma]: To India and I'm going to do my further studies there

04:18:06.040 --> 04:18:08.040
[Amit Varma]: What was your answer to that

04:18:08.040 --> 04:18:10.040
[Guest]: Rhetorical question, why do they hate me?

04:18:10.040 --> 04:18:12.040
[Guest]: I'll tell you that, I'll come to that

04:18:12.040 --> 04:18:14.040
[Guest]: So, so, so

04:18:14.040 --> 04:18:16.040
[Guest]: I decided to leave India

04:18:16.040 --> 04:18:18.040
[Guest]: Sorry, leave Bahrain, and came to India

04:18:18.040 --> 04:18:20.040
[Guest]: Tried to get into

04:18:20.040 --> 04:18:22.040
[Guest]: DPS, DPS rejected me saying your marks are not

04:18:22.040 --> 04:18:24.040
[Guest]: Good enough, and then I got an admission

04:18:24.040 --> 04:18:26.040
[Guest]: In Mayo College, Ajmer

04:18:26.040 --> 04:18:28.040
[Guest]: And they were really like, they had seen my work

04:18:28.040 --> 04:18:30.040
[Guest]: That I had done in young times, immediately in the interview

04:18:30.040 --> 04:18:32.040
[Guest]: Around only said you're going to be the editor of our, you know

04:18:32.040 --> 04:18:34.040
[Guest]: I was like, cool, this is a place that gives me

04:18:34.040 --> 04:18:36.040
[Guest]: Respect, here I'll get everything, etc

04:18:36.040 --> 04:18:38.040
[Guest]: But, I remember

04:18:38.040 --> 04:18:40.040
[Guest]: Admission was done

04:18:40.040 --> 04:18:42.040
[Guest]: Everything was good, next morning

04:18:42.040 --> 04:18:44.040
[Guest]: My parents are going back from Ajmer

04:18:44.040 --> 04:18:46.040
[Guest]: To Karnal and then

04:18:46.040 --> 04:18:48.040
[Guest]: To Bahrain, and

04:18:48.040 --> 04:18:50.040
[Guest]: And in the night

04:18:50.040 --> 04:18:52.040
[Guest]: This is one of those things, you know, that kind of happens

04:18:52.040 --> 04:18:54.040
[Guest]: That I just prayed to God the first time, I was like, I don't know

04:18:54.040 --> 04:18:56.040
[Guest]: I know I've got an admission, but I started

04:18:56.040 --> 04:18:58.040
[Guest]: Really feeling like, as if I'm

04:18:58.040 --> 04:19:00.040
[Guest]: Running away from my

04:19:00.040 --> 04:19:02.040
[Guest]: You know, I was like, is this going to be my story

04:19:02.040 --> 04:19:04.040
[Guest]: Is my story going to be of the boy who ran away

04:19:04.040 --> 04:19:06.040
[Guest]: Because he was hated upon

04:19:06.040 --> 04:19:08.040
[Guest]: That cannot be my story, and I don't

04:19:08.040 --> 04:19:10.040
[Guest]: And I was trading in

04:19:10.040 --> 04:19:12.040
[Guest]: Two years more with my

04:19:12.040 --> 04:19:14.040
[Guest]: Brother, with my family, with my brother

04:19:14.040 --> 04:19:16.040
[Guest]: Because of getting

04:19:16.040 --> 04:19:18.040
[Guest]: Bullied, I was like, and then it was too

04:19:18.040 --> 04:19:20.040
[Guest]: Late, because I just got an admission, my parents

04:19:20.040 --> 04:19:22.040
[Guest]: Had paid the advance and what not, and I

04:19:22.040 --> 04:19:24.040
[Guest]: Prayed to God in the night, I was like, I don't know

04:19:24.040 --> 04:19:26.040
[Guest]: What happens, but tomorrow I just want to go back

04:19:26.040 --> 04:19:28.040
[Guest]: To my parents, I didn't have the courage to tell

04:19:28.040 --> 04:19:30.040
[Guest]: Them, but I prayed to

04:19:30.040 --> 04:19:32.040
[Guest]: God, do something, and next

04:19:32.040 --> 04:19:34.040
[Guest]: Morning, I don't know, this is

04:19:34.040 --> 04:19:36.040
[Guest]: One of the places where you believe the universe

04:19:36.040 --> 04:19:38.040
[Guest]: Actually listens or whatever, because next morning

04:19:38.040 --> 04:19:40.040
[Guest]: My parents had a conversation

04:19:40.040 --> 04:19:42.040
[Guest]: With the Dean, and the Dean

04:19:42.040 --> 04:19:44.040
[Guest]: For whatever reasons, I don't know if there's anyone

04:19:44.040 --> 04:19:46.040
[Guest]: From Mayo College that may have listened to this, just

04:19:46.040 --> 04:19:48.040
[Guest]: Scared the shit out of my parents as if

04:19:48.040 --> 04:19:50.040
[Guest]: Like this is going to be jail, they said like

04:19:50.040 --> 04:19:52.040
[Guest]: He said things like, you know, so

04:19:52.040 --> 04:19:54.040
[Guest]: You know, your kid

04:19:54.040 --> 04:19:56.040
[Guest]: Is overweight, he's going to get bullied a lot

04:19:56.040 --> 04:19:58.040
[Guest]: And you know, a lot of

04:19:58.040 --> 04:20:00.040
[Guest]: Kids have also tried to like harm themselves

04:20:00.040 --> 04:20:02.040
[Guest]: Just tell him not to harm himself, because that's okay

04:20:02.040 --> 04:20:04.040
[Guest]: It happens, you know, it's a boy's school, you're going to

04:20:04.040 --> 04:20:06.040
[Guest]: He's going to get used to it, it's like, what

04:20:06.040 --> 04:20:08.040
[Guest]: They're like, so obviously

04:20:08.040 --> 04:20:10.040
[Guest]: He has a mobile phone, he has good shoes

04:20:10.040 --> 04:20:12.040
[Guest]: You know, it might also get stolen, but that's also okay

04:20:12.040 --> 04:20:14.040
[Guest]: Don't worry about it, he will get to call

04:20:14.040 --> 04:20:16.040
[Guest]: For 30 minutes, and

04:20:16.040 --> 04:20:18.040
[Guest]: Sometimes when, you know, you know

04:20:18.040 --> 04:20:20.040
[Guest]: Boys also do play pranks, they

04:20:20.040 --> 04:20:22.040
[Guest]: Make sure that you're not able to call for the

04:20:22.040 --> 04:20:24.040
[Guest]: 30 minutes in a week, not in a day

04:20:24.040 --> 04:20:26.040
[Guest]: You know, so if you don't hear from him in 2-3 weeks

04:20:26.040 --> 04:20:28.040
[Guest]: That's okay, my mother was like

04:20:28.040 --> 04:20:30.040
[Guest]: What are you, is this jail or is this a school

04:20:30.040 --> 04:20:32.040
[Guest]: He's like, no, at the end of it, you'll be disciplined and he'll be

04:20:32.040 --> 04:20:34.040
[Guest]: A gentleman, but like this is how his life is going

04:20:34.040 --> 04:20:36.040
[Guest]: To be here, you get used to it, he'll get

04:20:36.040 --> 04:20:38.040
[Guest]: Beaten up, he'll get bullied, people will steal his things

04:20:38.040 --> 04:20:40.040
[Guest]: You know, we will

04:20:40.040 --> 04:20:42.040
[Guest]: You know, the PT instructors will make him thin

04:20:42.040 --> 04:20:44.040
[Unknown]: In the next 3-4 months, you know

04:20:44.040 --> 04:20:46.040
[Guest]: So don't worry about that, but yeah

04:20:46.040 --> 04:20:48.040
[Guest]: You're putting, the commitment is 2 years later

04:20:48.040 --> 04:20:50.040
[Guest]: He's going to be a gentleman, and my parents

04:20:50.040 --> 04:20:52.040
[Guest]: Are like, bro, what's going on

04:20:52.040 --> 04:20:54.040
[Guest]: They just had like, they talked to each other immediately

04:20:54.040 --> 04:20:56.040
[Guest]: Afterwards, and they looked at me

04:20:56.040 --> 04:20:58.040
[Guest]: And I was like, acting innocent as if

04:20:58.040 --> 04:21:00.040
[Guest]: Like, oh cool, I have no problem

04:21:00.040 --> 04:21:02.040
[Guest]: And then my mother just told my father, I don't think we should

04:21:02.040 --> 04:21:04.040
[Guest]: Make him stay, and then they asked me, what do you think

04:21:04.040 --> 04:21:06.040
[Guest]: Would you be comfortable going back? I said, yeah

04:21:06.040 --> 04:21:08.040
[Guest]: Actually, I don't mind, you know

04:21:08.040 --> 04:21:10.040
[Guest]: And then my parents just

04:21:10.040 --> 04:21:12.040
[Guest]: Like, just that day we were, I was like

04:21:12.040 --> 04:21:14.040
[Guest]: Dude, what is this miracle that has happened

04:21:14.040 --> 04:21:16.040
[Guest]: 6 months I had to homeschool

04:21:16.040 --> 04:21:18.040
[Guest]: And at the end of 6 months

04:21:18.040 --> 04:21:20.040
[Guest]: I went back for my second semester

04:21:20.040 --> 04:21:22.040
[Guest]: In 11th standard, I had taken science at that time

04:21:22.040 --> 04:21:24.040
[Guest]: So I went back and I remember the first day

04:21:24.040 --> 04:21:26.040
[Guest]: Back in the bus, I was very nervous

04:21:26.040 --> 04:21:28.040
[Guest]: After I had gone with all the hate and so many people

04:21:28.040 --> 04:21:30.040
[Guest]: Hated me, and I went and

04:21:30.040 --> 04:21:32.040
[Guest]: The school was fine, everything, nobody

04:21:32.040 --> 04:21:34.040
[Guest]: Like, even remembered or bothered

04:21:34.040 --> 04:21:36.040
[Guest]: Or whatever it is, everybody was being nice to me

04:21:36.040 --> 04:21:38.040
[Guest]: And then I kind of like, one of my

04:21:38.040 --> 04:21:40.040
[Guest]: First epiphanies at that time was

04:21:40.040 --> 04:21:42.040
[Guest]: I get it, you know, I am in science

04:21:42.040 --> 04:21:44.040
[Guest]: And the thing about science

04:21:44.040 --> 04:21:46.040
[Guest]: Students is, they hate themselves so much

04:21:46.040 --> 04:21:48.040
[Guest]: They don't have the time to hate anybody else

04:21:48.040 --> 04:21:50.040
[Guest]: And it's all the people who used to hate me

04:21:50.040 --> 04:21:52.040
[Guest]: Have gone to commerce, so I was like

04:21:52.040 --> 04:21:54.040
[Guest]: I am in science now, I am like, no one

04:21:54.040 --> 04:21:56.040
[Guest]: Cares, everyone is sad in their life, I didn't even

04:21:56.040 --> 04:21:58.040
[Guest]: Think about it, until one day

04:21:58.040 --> 04:22:00.040
[Guest]: I was in a bus

04:22:00.040 --> 04:22:02.040
[Guest]: And this

04:22:02.040 --> 04:22:04.040
[Guest]: Science friend of mine, who

04:22:04.040 --> 04:22:06.040
[Guest]: Had just made friends with recently

04:22:06.040 --> 04:22:08.040
[Guest]: Just kind of spoke to me

04:22:08.040 --> 04:22:10.040
[Guest]: And said, you know, so

04:22:10.040 --> 04:22:12.040
[Guest]: You were here, and in 6 months you were not here

04:22:12.040 --> 04:22:14.040
[Guest]: Like, what happened, where did you go

04:22:14.040 --> 04:22:16.040
[Guest]: And now, sometimes

04:22:16.040 --> 04:22:18.040
[Guest]: You are waiting for someone to ask you a question

04:22:18.040 --> 04:22:20.040
[Guest]: That you can like, offload on

04:22:20.040 --> 04:22:22.040
[Guest]: So, the bus took

04:22:22.040 --> 04:22:24.040
[Guest]: One and a half hours to get, one hour it would

04:22:24.040 --> 04:22:26.040
[Guest]: Take from our school to our home, I said

04:22:26.040 --> 04:22:28.040
[Guest]: One hour, come sit, I will tell you

04:22:28.040 --> 04:22:30.040
[Guest]: So I offloaded fully, I said

04:22:30.040 --> 04:22:32.040
[Guest]: This is what happened, I got bullied

04:22:32.040 --> 04:22:34.040
[Guest]: Threw stones at me, this, that

04:22:34.040 --> 04:22:36.040
[Guest]: And now then, I decided to come back, and now

04:22:36.040 --> 04:22:38.040
[Guest]: I am here, now he heard the whole

04:22:38.040 --> 04:22:40.040
[Guest]: Thing, and then this boy is just like, I am so sorry

04:22:40.040 --> 04:22:42.040
[Guest]: I am like, why are you sorry

04:22:42.040 --> 04:22:44.040
[Guest]: It's not like you have done something, and laughed out loud

04:22:44.040 --> 04:22:46.040
[Guest]: And then this guy just looks at me

04:22:46.040 --> 04:22:48.040
[Guest]: And says, actually I have

04:22:48.040 --> 04:22:50.040
[Guest]: I am like, what have you done

04:22:50.040 --> 04:22:52.040
[Guest]: And then he says

04:22:52.040 --> 04:22:54.040
[Guest]: Well, out of the many letters that were written

04:22:54.040 --> 04:22:56.040
[Guest]: Against you, I had written a

04:22:56.040 --> 04:22:58.040
[Guest]: Bunch of them

04:22:58.040 --> 04:23:00.040
[Guest]: And I am really confused, I am like

04:23:00.040 --> 04:23:02.040
[Guest]: First of all, I was like

04:23:02.040 --> 04:23:04.040
[Unknown]: You are from science, how could you do this

04:23:04.040 --> 04:23:06.040
[Guest]: So first my thing was, you are a science

04:23:06.040 --> 04:23:08.040
[Guest]: Student, how can you do this

04:23:08.040 --> 04:23:10.040
[Guest]: But my second thing was like, you didn't know me

04:23:10.040 --> 04:23:12.040
[Guest]: I have just come to know you

04:23:12.040 --> 04:23:14.040
[Guest]: Why would you hate me when you didn't know me

04:23:14.040 --> 04:23:16.040
[Guest]: And then his answer was

04:23:16.040 --> 04:23:18.040
[Guest]: Actually that only

04:23:18.040 --> 04:23:20.040
[Guest]: Well, I hated you, because

04:23:20.040 --> 04:23:22.040
[Guest]: I didn't know you, and I am like

04:23:22.040 --> 04:23:24.040
[Guest]: I heard this

04:23:24.040 --> 04:23:26.040
[Guest]: And again, the thoughts in my head

04:23:26.040 --> 04:23:28.040
[Guest]: At this point, I am trying to process what has happened

04:23:28.040 --> 04:23:30.040
[Guest]: And I just, in my head

04:23:30.040 --> 04:23:32.040
[Guest]: I am like, I have lost 6 months of my life

04:23:32.040 --> 04:23:34.040
[Guest]: I homeschooled in Karnal

04:23:34.040 --> 04:23:36.040
[Guest]: I stayed away from my parents

04:23:36.040 --> 04:23:38.040
[Guest]: Because there was no homeschooling in Bahrain

04:23:38.040 --> 04:23:40.040
[Guest]: So I did coaching for 6 months in Karnal

04:23:40.040 --> 04:23:42.040
[Guest]: I stayed away from my parents for 6 months

04:23:42.040 --> 04:23:44.040
[Guest]: We spent all of this money

04:23:44.040 --> 04:23:46.040
[Guest]: Going to India, Ajmer, coming back

04:23:46.040 --> 04:23:48.040
[Guest]: My brother got bullied, I got bullied

04:23:48.040 --> 04:23:50.040
[Guest]: Mental health, I didn't know what mental health was

04:23:50.040 --> 04:23:52.040
[Guest]: But I know that I was obviously hurting

04:23:52.040 --> 04:23:54.040
[Guest]: And after all of this

04:23:54.040 --> 04:23:56.040
[Guest]: This boy is just saying

04:23:56.040 --> 04:23:58.040
[Guest]: I hated you because I didn't know you

04:23:58.040 --> 04:24:00.040
[Guest]: And he was saying, I am sorry

04:24:00.040 --> 04:24:02.040
[Guest]: So in my head, I wanted to punch him

04:24:02.040 --> 04:24:04.040
[Guest]: That was the first thing I wanted to do

04:24:04.040 --> 04:24:06.040
[Guest]: I was like, f**k you for saying that

04:24:06.040 --> 04:24:08.040
[Guest]: You think sorry is going to cut it

04:24:08.040 --> 04:24:10.040
[Guest]: But somehow

04:24:10.040 --> 04:24:12.040
[Guest]: Or the other, again this is just an incident

04:24:12.040 --> 04:24:14.040
[Guest]: That has

04:24:14.040 --> 04:24:16.040
[Guest]: Just stayed with me so much

04:24:16.040 --> 04:24:18.040
[Guest]: Because in that moment

04:24:18.040 --> 04:24:20.040
[Guest]: I had the greatest epiphany

04:24:20.040 --> 04:24:22.040
[Guest]: Of my life, which is what I have also said

04:24:22.040 --> 04:24:24.040
[Guest]: In those talks that

04:24:24.040 --> 04:24:26.040
[Guest]: I realized that this boy

04:24:26.040 --> 04:24:28.040
[Guest]: After he came to know my story

04:24:28.040 --> 04:24:30.040
[Guest]: He kind of

04:24:30.040 --> 04:24:32.040
[Guest]: Had empathy for me

04:24:32.040 --> 04:24:34.040
[Guest]: And just somewhere I connected

04:24:34.040 --> 04:24:36.040
[Guest]: That, well

04:24:36.040 --> 04:24:38.040
[Guest]: So if you know someone's story

04:24:38.040 --> 04:24:40.040
[Guest]: You can't hate them

04:24:40.040 --> 04:24:42.040
[Guest]: If you know someone's story, you can't

04:24:42.040 --> 04:24:44.040
[Guest]: Misunderstand them

04:24:44.040 --> 04:24:46.040
[Guest]: If you know someone's story, you can't be angry at them

04:24:46.040 --> 04:24:48.040
[Guest]: If you know someone's story

04:24:48.040 --> 04:24:50.040
[Guest]: You can't reduce them to labels

04:24:50.040 --> 04:24:52.040
[Guest]: Which is what this boy had done to me

04:24:52.040 --> 04:24:54.040
[Guest]: And I asked him further, why did you do it?

04:24:54.040 --> 04:24:56.040
[Guest]: You didn't know me

04:24:56.040 --> 04:24:58.040
[Guest]: He was like, I just had an assumption

04:24:58.040 --> 04:25:00.040
[Guest]: After I read your articles, I thought you were this narcissist

04:25:00.040 --> 04:25:02.040
[Guest]: This pompous a**hole

04:25:02.040 --> 04:25:04.040
[Guest]: I was like

04:25:04.040 --> 04:25:06.040
[Guest]: Because you used to write 14 years old

04:25:06.040 --> 04:25:08.040
[Guest]: I was like, why do you need to tell your age

04:25:08.040 --> 04:25:10.040
[Guest]: Why do you need to tell everybody

04:25:10.040 --> 04:25:12.040
[Guest]: Show off that you are 14

04:25:12.040 --> 04:25:14.040
[Guest]: And on the basis of that

04:25:14.040 --> 04:25:16.040
[Guest]: You thought that I deserved hate

04:25:16.040 --> 04:25:18.040
[Guest]: I'm sorry man, I mean I've come to know you

04:25:18.040 --> 04:25:20.040
[Guest]: You are a really nice guy

04:25:20.040 --> 04:25:22.040
[Guest]: Now that I know you, I really wanted to say sorry

04:25:22.040 --> 04:25:24.040
[Guest]: So just the fact at that time

04:25:24.040 --> 04:25:26.040
[Guest]: That this boy actually decided

04:25:26.040 --> 04:25:28.040
[Guest]: He could have never told me

04:25:28.040 --> 04:25:30.040
[Guest]: But the fact that he decided to tell me

04:25:30.040 --> 04:25:32.040
[Guest]: And apologize to me

04:25:32.040 --> 04:25:34.040
[Guest]: Just in that moment

04:25:34.040 --> 04:25:36.040
[Guest]: I kind of

04:25:36.040 --> 04:25:38.040
[Guest]: I think my understanding of kindness happened

04:25:38.040 --> 04:25:40.040
[Guest]: That you know

04:25:40.040 --> 04:25:42.040
[Guest]: Stories bring empathy

04:25:42.040 --> 04:25:44.040
[Guest]: Stories make you kind

04:25:44.040 --> 04:25:46.040
[Guest]: If you hate each other

04:25:46.040 --> 04:25:48.040
[Guest]: There is no chance that you can hate each other

04:25:48.040 --> 04:25:50.040
[Guest]: And that kindness

04:25:50.040 --> 04:25:52.040
[Guest]: Is

04:25:52.040 --> 04:25:54.040
[Guest]: Again I said

04:25:54.040 --> 04:25:56.040
[Guest]: For whatever reasons from childhood

04:25:56.040 --> 04:25:58.040
[Guest]: I was always like, I'm going to be the opposite of what

04:25:58.040 --> 04:26:00.040
[Guest]: Has hurt me

04:26:00.040 --> 04:26:02.040
[Guest]: I'm going to be the opposite of what has pained me

04:26:02.040 --> 04:26:04.040
[Guest]: So if I got bullied

04:26:04.040 --> 04:26:06.040
[Guest]: I'm going to be kinder to everybody around me

04:26:06.040 --> 04:26:08.040
[Guest]: If I got hate

04:26:08.040 --> 04:26:10.040
[Guest]: I'm going to give as much love as possible

04:26:10.040 --> 04:26:12.040
[Guest]: If there are people who have looked down on me

04:26:12.040 --> 04:26:14.040
[Guest]: I'm not going to judge anybody

04:26:14.040 --> 04:26:16.040
[Guest]: And

04:26:16.040 --> 04:26:18.040
[Guest]: In my early years, in my job

04:26:18.040 --> 04:26:20.040
[Guest]: Even when I was at MTV

04:26:20.040 --> 04:26:22.040
[Guest]: I was the youngest person in almost every team

04:26:22.040 --> 04:26:24.040
[Guest]: At that time

04:26:24.040 --> 04:26:26.040
[Guest]: And it was very hard

04:26:26.040 --> 04:26:28.040
[Guest]: People would

04:26:28.040 --> 04:26:30.040
[Guest]: I told you I was making a show

04:26:30.040 --> 04:26:32.040
[Guest]: At 24, 25

04:26:32.040 --> 04:26:34.040
[Guest]: Now they gave me the title of producer

04:26:34.040 --> 04:26:36.040
[Guest]: At 25

04:26:36.040 --> 04:26:38.040
[Guest]: Created by 25

04:26:38.040 --> 04:26:40.040
[Guest]: And said that you make it now, you do it on your own

04:26:40.040 --> 04:26:42.040
[Guest]: I had never done this

04:26:42.040 --> 04:26:44.040
[Guest]: I said I need help, and then they got help for me

04:26:44.040 --> 04:26:46.040
[Guest]: But the help

04:26:46.040 --> 04:26:48.040
[Guest]: That came

04:26:48.040 --> 04:26:50.040
[Guest]: Were people who were just like

04:26:50.040 --> 04:26:52.040
[Guest]: If I would tell them that this is what I want to do

04:26:52.040 --> 04:26:54.040
[Guest]: You are 24, what do you know

04:26:54.040 --> 04:26:56.040
[Guest]: We have spent 15 years in the industry, you don't tell us what to do

04:26:56.040 --> 04:26:58.040
[Guest]: So

04:26:58.040 --> 04:27:00.040
[Guest]: I would see the show that I had written

04:27:00.040 --> 04:27:02.040
[Guest]: That they had asked me to produce

04:27:02.040 --> 04:27:04.040
[Guest]: Or asked me to lead

04:27:04.040 --> 04:27:06.040
[Guest]: I'm supposed to be the boss of that show

04:27:06.040 --> 04:27:08.040
[Guest]: The creator of that show, the showrunner of that show

04:27:08.040 --> 04:27:10.040
[Guest]: But at every situation

04:27:10.040 --> 04:27:12.040
[Guest]: Between the ages of 24 to 20

04:27:12.040 --> 04:27:14.040
[Guest]: It took 2 years for the show to be back and forth

04:27:14.040 --> 04:27:16.040
[Guest]: Back and forth

04:27:16.040 --> 04:27:18.040
[Guest]: At the end of it, I had become

04:27:18.040 --> 04:27:20.040
[Guest]: Like a really angry version of myself

04:27:20.040 --> 04:27:22.040
[Guest]: Because anytime I would try to put my point of view

04:27:22.040 --> 04:27:24.040
[Guest]: People would just say shut up

04:27:24.040 --> 04:27:26.040
[Guest]: You are too young to have a say

04:27:26.040 --> 04:27:28.040
[Guest]: And again

04:27:28.040 --> 04:27:30.040
[Guest]: I went through anxiety

04:27:30.040 --> 04:27:32.040
[Guest]: Again at that time without realizing what it is

04:27:32.040 --> 04:27:34.040
[Guest]: I was really angry, I was really unhappy

04:27:34.040 --> 04:27:36.040
[Guest]: And then when

04:27:36.040 --> 04:27:38.040
[Guest]: I got the opportunity to make these 6 films

04:27:38.040 --> 04:27:40.040
[Guest]: And now that

04:27:40.040 --> 04:27:42.040
[Guest]: I decided that

04:27:42.040 --> 04:27:44.040
[Guest]: Now if I am going to be with

04:27:44.040 --> 04:27:46.040
[Guest]: Work in any situation

04:27:46.040 --> 04:27:48.040
[Guest]: I am only going to work with good people if I can

04:27:48.040 --> 04:27:50.040
[Guest]: And I am only going to be kind

04:27:50.040 --> 04:27:52.040
[Guest]: Whatever anybody has given to me, I am going to be the opposite of that

04:27:52.040 --> 04:27:54.040
[Guest]: And every time I tried that

04:27:54.040 --> 04:27:56.040
[Guest]: It was just absolutely amazing

04:27:56.040 --> 04:27:58.040
[Guest]: As an experience

04:27:58.040 --> 04:28:00.040
[Guest]: We are making a film, we are making content

04:28:00.040 --> 04:28:02.040
[Guest]: We have come away, we have already fought

04:28:02.040 --> 04:28:04.040
[Guest]: All of these battles

04:28:04.040 --> 04:28:06.040
[Guest]: To get here

04:28:06.040 --> 04:28:08.040
[Guest]: And now why are we making this medium also toxic

04:28:08.040 --> 04:28:10.040
[Guest]: Just be nice to each other, how difficult is that

04:28:10.040 --> 04:28:12.040
[Guest]: It just became

04:28:12.040 --> 04:28:14.040
[Guest]: One of the most important tenets for me

04:28:14.040 --> 04:28:16.040
[Guest]: Kindness

04:28:16.040 --> 04:28:18.040
[Guest]: There is no

04:28:18.040 --> 04:28:20.040
[Guest]: And I just don't

04:28:20.040 --> 04:28:22.040
[Guest]: Buy into this idea that you have to be an asshole

04:28:22.040 --> 04:28:24.040
[Guest]: To be successful and I was always like

04:28:24.040 --> 04:28:26.040
[Guest]: I am going to prove it, no matter what happens

04:28:26.040 --> 04:28:28.040
[Guest]: I am going to be kind, I am going to be empathetic

04:28:28.040 --> 04:28:30.040
[Guest]: And I am going to be successful, now you tell me what you are going to do

04:28:30.040 --> 04:28:32.040
[Guest]: You know

04:28:32.040 --> 04:28:34.040
[Guest]: You say that I can't

04:28:34.040 --> 04:28:36.040
[Guest]: And Yuva is a for profit, it's not a non-profit

04:28:36.040 --> 04:28:38.040
[Guest]: We work on like social impact

04:28:38.040 --> 04:28:40.040
[Guest]: But I wanted to say, I was like I am going to make

04:28:40.040 --> 04:28:42.040
[Guest]: Make something on social impact

04:28:42.040 --> 04:28:44.040
[Guest]: To tell that you know social impact

04:28:44.040 --> 04:28:46.040
[Guest]: People look down

04:28:46.040 --> 04:28:48.040
[Guest]: They call NGO

04:28:48.040 --> 04:28:50.040
[Guest]: A vibe

04:28:50.040 --> 04:28:52.040
[Guest]: When I first started talking about it, people looked down

04:28:52.040 --> 04:28:54.040
[Guest]: As if NGOs are bad things, I am like NGOs are saving the world out there

04:28:54.040 --> 04:28:56.040
[Guest]: You know but

04:28:56.040 --> 04:28:58.040
[Guest]: If you start an NGO, there is nothing we can do with you

04:28:58.040 --> 04:29:00.040
[Guest]: I am like

04:29:00.040 --> 04:29:02.040
[Guest]: First of all, NGOs are not bad, second of all

04:29:02.040 --> 04:29:04.040
[Guest]: Why are you looking down on anything that has to do with social impact

04:29:04.040 --> 04:29:06.040
[Guest]: Who says that it is going to be

04:29:06.040 --> 04:29:08.040
[Guest]: The most boring, we are the most vibrant

04:29:08.040 --> 04:29:10.040
[Guest]: 26 people, all the average

04:29:10.040 --> 04:29:12.040
[Guest]: Of 25, the most vibrant office

04:29:12.040 --> 04:29:14.040
[Guest]: Till 7

04:29:14.040 --> 04:29:16.040
[Guest]: 7.30 people work

04:29:16.040 --> 04:29:18.040
[Guest]: Weekends we have off, Saturday Sunday

04:29:18.040 --> 04:29:20.040
[Guest]: We don't work, we have work life

04:29:20.040 --> 04:29:22.040
[Guest]: Balance and we are a team of 26 people

04:29:22.040 --> 04:29:24.040
[Guest]: And we are hitting like X number of crores

04:29:24.040 --> 04:29:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Of revenues every year now

04:29:26.040 --> 04:29:28.040
[Guest]: You even take weekdays off, like you have been here all day

04:29:28.040 --> 04:29:30.040
[Guest]: Exactly, it is a Wednesday

04:29:30.040 --> 04:29:32.040
[Guest]: I am able to do this

04:29:32.040 --> 04:29:34.040
[Guest]: And it is because it is possible

04:29:34.040 --> 04:29:36.040
[Guest]: It is possible

04:29:36.040 --> 04:29:38.040
[Guest]: You can be kind

04:29:38.040 --> 04:29:40.040
[Guest]: You can have a culture of like

04:29:40.040 --> 04:29:42.040
[Guest]: People supporting each other

04:29:42.040 --> 04:29:44.040
[Guest]: And in fact it is going to work a lot better for you than

04:29:44.040 --> 04:29:46.040
[Guest]: Any other culture

04:29:46.040 --> 04:29:48.040
[Guest]: People always are looking to

04:29:48.040 --> 04:29:50.040
[Guest]: We are no person is an island

04:29:50.040 --> 04:29:52.040
[Guest]: Like we are all here

04:29:52.040 --> 04:29:54.040
[Guest]: To make social bonds

04:29:54.040 --> 04:29:56.040
[Guest]: Then why the unkindness

04:29:56.040 --> 04:29:58.040
[Guest]: Have to be so hateful and so negative

04:29:58.040 --> 04:30:00.040
[Guest]: And try the other thing

04:30:00.040 --> 04:30:02.040
[Guest]: And it is hard, I am not saying kindness is not hard

04:30:02.040 --> 04:30:04.040
[Guest]: In many situations it is hard

04:30:04.040 --> 04:30:06.040
[Guest]: But I have found that when you persevere through those hard

04:30:06.040 --> 04:30:08.040
[Guest]: Situations, now on the other side is just

04:30:08.040 --> 04:30:10.040
[Guest]: Enormous amount of love

04:30:10.040 --> 04:30:12.040
[Guest]: When you persevere through

04:30:12.040 --> 04:30:14.040
[Guest]: The struggle, through the anger

04:30:14.040 --> 04:30:16.040
[Guest]: Through the hate, there is nothing but

04:30:16.040 --> 04:30:18.040
[Guest]: Love, compassion, happiness, hugs

04:30:18.040 --> 04:30:20.040
[Guest]: Empathy, all kinds of good things

04:30:20.040 --> 04:30:22.040
[Guest]: It is hard initially

04:30:22.040 --> 04:30:24.040
[Guest]: Absolutely, but if not us then who

04:30:24.040 --> 04:30:26.040
[Guest]: And now then when, it is as simple as that

04:30:26.040 --> 04:30:28.040
[Amit Varma]: In a beautiful talk you gave on this subject

04:30:28.040 --> 04:30:30.040
[Amit Varma]: You also spoke about

04:30:30.040 --> 04:30:32.040
[Amit Varma]: How the internet can have the opposite effect

04:30:32.040 --> 04:30:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Like you have got this great line

04:30:34.040 --> 04:30:36.040
[Amit Varma]: The more connected we get the more disconnected we get

04:30:36.040 --> 04:30:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And you also pointed out

04:30:38.040 --> 04:30:40.040
[Amit Varma]: How the meanest person on the internet

04:30:40.040 --> 04:30:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Gets the most retweets

04:30:42.040 --> 04:30:44.040
[Amit Varma]: The snarkiest person on the internet gets the most likes

04:30:44.040 --> 04:30:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And that is exactly

04:30:46.040 --> 04:30:48.040
[Amit Varma]: What happens because

04:30:48.040 --> 04:30:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Typically what we see on social media is

04:30:50.040 --> 04:30:52.040
[Amit Varma]: You are online

04:30:52.040 --> 04:30:54.040
[Amit Varma]: You want a sense of community and belonging

04:30:54.040 --> 04:30:56.040
[Amit Varma]: The easiest place to get it is

04:30:56.040 --> 04:30:58.040
[Amit Varma]: You join an ideological tribe

04:30:58.040 --> 04:31:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Incentives are you want to raise your status within that tribe

04:31:00.040 --> 04:31:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Easiest way to do so is

04:31:02.040 --> 04:31:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Attack people on the other side, never engage with

04:31:04.040 --> 04:31:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Argument, just attack

04:31:06.040 --> 04:31:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Attack people on your own side for not being pure enough

04:31:08.040 --> 04:31:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And it just becomes

04:31:10.040 --> 04:31:12.040
[Amit Varma]: So incredibly

04:31:12.040 --> 04:31:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Ugly and toxic and the opposite

04:31:14.040 --> 04:31:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Of kind and in a sense

04:31:16.040 --> 04:31:18.040
[Amit Varma]: It is not necessarily

04:31:18.040 --> 04:31:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Their fault, like sometimes I think that

04:31:20.040 --> 04:31:22.040
[Amit Varma]: The internet empowers the worst people

04:31:22.040 --> 04:31:24.040
[Amit Varma]: But other times I think that

04:31:24.040 --> 04:31:26.040
[Amit Varma]: There is no one called the worst people, everybody contains

04:31:26.040 --> 04:31:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Multitudes, these are incentives

04:31:28.040 --> 04:31:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Towards bad behaviour

04:31:30.040 --> 04:31:32.040
[Amit Varma]: You know so just thinking aloud

04:31:32.040 --> 04:31:34.040
[Amit Varma]: What incentives could be there towards

04:31:34.040 --> 04:31:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Kindness instead

04:31:36.040 --> 04:31:38.040
[Guest]: I am

04:31:38.040 --> 04:31:40.040
[Guest]: Going to now tell you

04:31:40.040 --> 04:31:42.040
[Guest]: Like a little

04:31:42.040 --> 04:31:44.040
[Guest]: Well of course I have held this opinion for a while

04:31:44.040 --> 04:31:46.040
[Guest]: But they solidified

04:31:46.040 --> 04:31:48.040
[Guest]: After the UR Roadshow

04:31:48.040 --> 04:31:50.040
[Guest]: UR Roadshow just for context

04:31:50.040 --> 04:31:52.040
[Guest]: I kind of went

04:31:52.040 --> 04:31:54.040
[Guest]: You mentioned this right

04:31:54.040 --> 04:31:56.040
[Guest]: When I started UR and this is after my

04:31:56.040 --> 04:31:58.040
[Guest]: Sabbatical, my 6 month thing that I took

04:31:58.040 --> 04:32:00.040
[Guest]: Off after YRF and I was just like

04:32:00.040 --> 04:32:02.040
[Guest]: Okay I need to find out what my story is

04:32:02.040 --> 04:32:04.040
[Guest]: And at that point of time I

04:32:04.040 --> 04:32:06.040
[Guest]: I knew that

04:32:06.040 --> 04:32:08.040
[Guest]: You know I wanted to work with young people

04:32:08.040 --> 04:32:10.040
[Guest]: Because I really, that was my safe space

04:32:10.040 --> 04:32:12.040
[Guest]: Honestly working with students, beautiful

04:32:12.040 --> 04:32:14.040
[Guest]: And my skill set and my understanding

04:32:14.040 --> 04:32:16.040
[Guest]: My passion is storytelling and

04:32:16.040 --> 04:32:18.040
[Guest]: A skill is also that

04:32:18.040 --> 04:32:20.040
[Guest]: How do I bring together

04:32:20.040 --> 04:32:22.040
[Guest]: My care and

04:32:22.040 --> 04:32:24.040
[Guest]: You know for young people

04:32:24.040 --> 04:32:26.040
[Guest]: My passion of like

04:32:26.040 --> 04:32:28.040
[Guest]: Storytelling and empathy

04:32:28.040 --> 04:32:30.040
[Guest]: And my skill set of you know

04:32:30.040 --> 04:32:32.040
[Guest]: Media and entertainment and bring it all together

04:32:32.040 --> 04:32:34.040
[Guest]: And UR really was born out of that

04:32:34.040 --> 04:32:36.040
[Guest]: With the two intents, one was

04:32:36.040 --> 04:32:38.040
[Guest]: Can we make important things interesting for young people

04:32:38.040 --> 04:32:40.040
[Guest]: That's like our core

04:32:40.040 --> 04:32:42.040
[Guest]: You know goal and the second thing is how can

04:32:42.040 --> 04:32:44.040
[Guest]: How can we make young people

04:32:44.040 --> 04:32:46.040
[Guest]: Feel less alone, which is my hypothesis

04:32:46.040 --> 04:32:48.040
[Guest]: After my you know

04:32:48.040 --> 04:32:50.040
[Guest]: Kindness project I realized every young person

04:32:50.040 --> 04:32:52.040
[Guest]: Has a lot to say but there's very few people

04:32:52.040 --> 04:32:54.040
[Guest]: Willing to listen, every young

04:32:54.040 --> 04:32:56.040
[Guest]: Person has so much inside of that

04:32:56.040 --> 04:32:58.040
[Guest]: The kind of stories I've heard during the

04:32:58.040 --> 04:33:00.040
[Guest]: Kindness project you know about

04:33:00.040 --> 04:33:02.040
[Guest]: I mean about attempted

04:33:02.040 --> 04:33:04.040
[Guest]: Suicide, about domestic violence, about

04:33:04.040 --> 04:33:06.040
[Guest]: And not just negative like

04:33:06.040 --> 04:33:08.040
[Guest]: You know the really positive stories

04:33:08.040 --> 04:33:10.040
[Guest]: Someone who's you know overcome drug addiction

04:33:10.040 --> 04:33:12.040
[Guest]: You know someone who's and every story

04:33:12.040 --> 04:33:14.040
[Guest]: In fact would end up with hope you know

04:33:14.040 --> 04:33:16.040
[Guest]: So I saw that there is a young generation

04:33:16.040 --> 04:33:18.040
[Guest]: Of young people, a generation of young people

04:33:18.040 --> 04:33:20.040
[Guest]: That's lonely and I want to go

04:33:20.040 --> 04:33:22.040
[Guest]: A little bit deeper into the loneliness actually

04:33:22.040 --> 04:33:24.040
[Guest]: Just for a second before I go into the roadshow

04:33:24.040 --> 04:33:26.040
[Guest]: When

04:33:26.040 --> 04:33:28.040
[Guest]: We were growing up you know

04:33:28.040 --> 04:33:30.040
[Guest]: With all of us you know every generation

04:33:30.040 --> 04:33:32.040
[Guest]: I think before this current generation

04:33:32.040 --> 04:33:34.040
[Guest]: Grew up in a time where we were

04:33:34.040 --> 04:33:36.040
[Guest]: Told, as I said we've discussed that you know there's stories

04:33:36.040 --> 04:33:38.040
[Guest]: That were given to us, structures that were given to us and we

04:33:38.040 --> 04:33:40.040
[Guest]: Believed these structures because

04:33:40.040 --> 04:33:42.040
[Guest]: How else, what else

04:33:42.040 --> 04:33:44.040
[Guest]: Would we do, how would we, what is the reason for us

04:33:44.040 --> 04:33:46.040
[Guest]: To not believe, even if we had an inkling

04:33:46.040 --> 04:33:48.040
[Guest]: That these structures don't work for us

04:33:48.040 --> 04:33:50.040
[Guest]: We just didn't know better right

04:33:50.040 --> 04:33:52.040
[Guest]: There was, you were a certain

04:33:52.040 --> 04:33:54.040
[Guest]: Community, your identity was

04:33:54.040 --> 04:33:56.040
[Guest]: You know me

04:33:56.040 --> 04:33:58.040
[Guest]: My people, my community

04:33:58.040 --> 04:34:00.040
[Guest]: My gender, whatever it is

04:34:00.040 --> 04:34:02.040
[Guest]: And you know just structures that you were told

04:34:02.040 --> 04:34:04.040
[Guest]: That you have to live in this

04:34:04.040 --> 04:34:06.040
[Guest]: There is only straight as a sexuality

04:34:06.040 --> 04:34:08.040
[Guest]: There is only your religion

04:34:08.040 --> 04:34:10.040
[Guest]: As a religion, that's important

04:34:10.040 --> 04:34:12.040
[Guest]: And that means everything to you

04:34:12.040 --> 04:34:14.040
[Guest]: There is, you can only marry this kind of a person

04:34:14.040 --> 04:34:16.040
[Guest]: You know

04:34:16.040 --> 04:34:18.040
[Guest]: Sorry, you can only

04:34:18.040 --> 04:34:20.040
[Guest]: Study in a certain kind of a

04:34:20.040 --> 04:34:22.040
[Guest]: You know, certain kind of a course you have to

04:34:22.040 --> 04:34:24.040
[Guest]: And certain milestones that you have to

04:34:24.040 --> 04:34:26.040
[Guest]: Achieve after which you settle and whatever right

04:34:26.040 --> 04:34:28.040
[Guest]: Those were the communities that

04:34:28.040 --> 04:34:30.040
[Guest]: Everyone without having

04:34:30.040 --> 04:34:32.040
[Guest]: A choice in found themselves, now the good

04:34:32.040 --> 04:34:34.040
[Guest]: The tough part

04:34:34.040 --> 04:34:36.040
[Guest]: About that was these communities were

04:34:36.040 --> 04:34:38.040
[Guest]: Always unhappy in some ways

04:34:38.040 --> 04:34:40.040
[Guest]: Purely because you know not

04:34:40.040 --> 04:34:42.040
[Guest]: Everybody was leading a narrative that was given to them

04:34:42.040 --> 04:34:44.040
[Guest]: But at the same time they were

04:34:44.040 --> 04:34:46.040
[Guest]: Communities, so you still had

04:34:46.040 --> 04:34:48.040
[Guest]: That you know bubble

04:34:48.040 --> 04:34:50.040
[Guest]: And that you know where you can

04:34:50.040 --> 04:34:52.040
[Guest]: If soft landing was there

04:34:52.040 --> 04:34:54.040
[Guest]: Even if you felt there was people to catch you

04:34:54.040 --> 04:34:56.040
[Guest]: Now what the internet did

04:34:56.040 --> 04:34:58.040
[Guest]: You know

04:34:58.040 --> 04:35:00.040
[Guest]: Was first and foremost

04:35:00.040 --> 04:35:02.040
[Guest]: And for this generation, let me come to this generation

04:35:02.040 --> 04:35:04.040
[Guest]: First and foremost because of

04:35:04.040 --> 04:35:06.040
[Guest]: You know

04:35:06.040 --> 04:35:08.040
[Guest]: If for me as a millennial growing up

04:35:08.040 --> 04:35:10.040
[Guest]: I did not know what my, I am trying to find

04:35:10.040 --> 04:35:12.040
[Guest]: My identity in a world before the internet

04:35:12.040 --> 04:35:14.040
[Guest]: And a world post the internet, before the internet

04:35:14.040 --> 04:35:16.040
[Guest]: I have told that this is life

04:35:16.040 --> 04:35:18.040
[Guest]: And after the internet I just go and google

04:35:18.040 --> 04:35:20.040
[Guest]: And I have just been told that life is not like that

04:35:20.040 --> 04:35:22.040
[Guest]: Life can be lived in many ways

04:35:22.040 --> 04:35:24.040
[Guest]: First I have to choose

04:35:24.040 --> 04:35:26.040
[Guest]: What do I believe more, do I believe what my parents told me

04:35:26.040 --> 04:35:28.040
[Guest]: And my society told me or do I have to believe the internet

04:35:28.040 --> 04:35:30.040
[Guest]: And then lots of people have made different choices

04:35:30.040 --> 04:35:32.040
[Guest]: I chose to believe that the internet

04:35:32.040 --> 04:35:34.040
[Guest]: Should be somewhere in the middle

04:35:34.040 --> 04:35:36.040
[Guest]: That my parents are also half right and the internet also has the other half

04:35:36.040 --> 04:35:38.040
[Guest]: But there are choices

04:35:38.040 --> 04:35:40.040
[Guest]: I believed in like

04:35:40.040 --> 04:35:42.040
[Guest]: Pre-internet Karan Johar

04:35:42.040 --> 04:35:44.040
[Guest]: You know Karan Johar once said

04:35:44.040 --> 04:35:46.040
[Guest]: You know in kuch kuch hota hai hum ek baar jeete hain

04:35:46.040 --> 04:35:48.040
[Guest]: Ek baar marte hain, shadi bhi ek baar hoti hain, pyaar bhi ek baar hoti hain

04:35:48.040 --> 04:35:50.040
[Guest]: Mere maan liya tha

04:35:50.040 --> 04:35:52.040
[Guest]: Mere zindagi mein yeh hi tha, ek baar jeenge, ek baar marte hain, ek baar shadi karenge, ek baar pyaar karenge

04:35:52.040 --> 04:35:54.040
[Guest]: I had one girlfriend in college

04:35:54.040 --> 04:35:56.040
[Guest]: If she wouldn't have left me

04:35:56.040 --> 04:35:58.040
[Guest]: I would have married her

04:35:58.040 --> 04:36:00.040
[Guest]: Then in college I made another girlfriend

04:36:00.040 --> 04:36:02.040
[Guest]: She is now with me for 16 years

04:36:02.040 --> 04:36:04.040
[Guest]: We have been together

04:36:04.040 --> 04:36:06.040
[Guest]: Since 16 years

04:36:06.040 --> 04:36:08.040
[Guest]: Because I genuinely believed that

04:36:08.040 --> 04:36:10.040
[Guest]: Now at some point in time tinder happened

04:36:10.040 --> 04:36:12.040
[Guest]: And then like a lot of people who may be married

04:36:12.040 --> 04:36:14.040
[Guest]: I mean I must have

04:36:14.040 --> 04:36:16.040
[Guest]: I have already gotten married when dating happened

04:36:16.040 --> 04:36:18.040
[Guest]: But I am saying for a lot of people it would have just become a choice

04:36:18.040 --> 04:36:20.040
[Guest]: I could have been with a partner for 8 years

04:36:20.040 --> 04:36:22.040
[Guest]: Not married and suddenly I get

04:36:22.040 --> 04:36:24.040
[Guest]: This plethora of options

04:36:24.040 --> 04:36:26.040
[Guest]: And all these choices that I have

04:36:26.040 --> 04:36:28.040
[Guest]: And now with these choices I have to choose

04:36:28.040 --> 04:36:30.040
[Guest]: Do I want to now with all these options available

04:36:30.040 --> 04:36:32.040
[Guest]: Do I want to swipe right constantly

04:36:32.040 --> 04:36:34.040
[Guest]: I choose and say

04:36:34.040 --> 04:36:36.040
[Guest]: This is my life, I understand why these options exist

04:36:36.040 --> 04:36:38.040
[Guest]: I understand they can be helpful

04:36:38.040 --> 04:36:40.040
[Guest]: But I have made my decision, I love this person

04:36:40.040 --> 04:36:42.040
[Guest]: And I am going to stay with this person

04:36:42.040 --> 04:36:44.040
[Guest]: And I don't want to look out or do anything

04:36:44.040 --> 04:36:46.040
[Guest]: My choice that I have made

04:36:48.040 --> 04:36:50.040
[Guest]: But with Gen Z, there are multitudes of choices

04:36:50.040 --> 04:36:52.040
[Guest]: That you get at a very early age

04:36:52.040 --> 04:36:54.040
[Guest]: So what that also means is

04:36:54.040 --> 04:36:56.040
[Guest]: Good thing wise, you can choose an identity immediately

04:36:56.040 --> 04:36:58.040
[Guest]: There are 20 identities

04:36:58.040 --> 04:37:00.040
[Guest]: And you are just like, you know what

04:37:00.040 --> 04:37:02.040
[Guest]: My parents say straight but I have googled

04:37:02.040 --> 04:37:04.040
[Guest]: And there is LGBTQ and I think I belong there

04:37:04.040 --> 04:37:06.040
[Guest]: And that's a community for me

04:37:06.040 --> 04:37:08.040
[Guest]: And I am going to belong to that community

04:37:08.040 --> 04:37:10.040
[Guest]: Parents might say that you have to only become an engineer

04:37:10.040 --> 04:37:12.040
[Guest]: And then you say, you know what

04:37:12.040 --> 04:37:14.040
[Guest]: I have seen a YouTuber becoming very successful

04:37:14.040 --> 04:37:16.040
[Guest]: So ok let them say what they want to

04:37:16.040 --> 04:37:18.040
[Guest]: Maybe I negotiate a little bit and I will on the side

04:37:18.040 --> 04:37:20.040
[Guest]: Start becoming a YouTuber

04:37:20.040 --> 04:37:22.040
[Guest]: Putting up vlogs etc and suddenly if I hit 1 million

04:37:22.040 --> 04:37:24.040
[Guest]: Go and tell, look at the money I am making

04:37:24.040 --> 04:37:26.040
[Guest]: 100 times more than an engineer will get in their first job

04:37:26.040 --> 04:37:28.040
[Guest]: So then my parents won't say anything

04:37:28.040 --> 04:37:30.040
[Guest]: So suddenly all of these choices have given power

04:37:30.040 --> 04:37:32.040
[Guest]: Suddenly all of these choices have given like you know

04:37:32.040 --> 04:37:34.040
[Guest]: A lot of, but at the same time on the other end

04:37:34.040 --> 04:37:36.040
[Guest]: Of it, these choices have also been very

04:37:36.040 --> 04:37:38.040
[Guest]: Have become

04:37:38.040 --> 04:37:40.040
[Guest]: It's become a paralysis when you have too much choice

04:37:40.040 --> 04:37:42.040
[Guest]: When there is, when you have

04:37:42.040 --> 04:37:44.040
[Guest]: If you choose one person

04:37:44.040 --> 04:37:46.040
[Guest]: With a dating app

04:37:46.040 --> 04:37:48.040
[Guest]: Swipe right, you are matched

04:37:48.040 --> 04:37:50.040
[Guest]: Suddenly you have another choice of another

04:37:50.040 --> 04:37:52.040
[Guest]: While the first sign of a problem

04:37:52.040 --> 04:37:54.040
[Guest]: In your relationship in that person

04:37:54.040 --> 04:37:56.040
[Guest]: In your back of your head you are like

04:37:56.040 --> 04:37:58.040
[Guest]: But I have more choices, I have

04:37:58.040 --> 04:38:00.040
[Guest]: I can swipe right again, so

04:38:00.040 --> 04:38:02.040
[Guest]: Where I have in 16 years had

04:38:02.040 --> 04:38:04.040
[Guest]: Thousands of ups and downs in my own

04:38:04.040 --> 04:38:06.040
[Guest]: Relationship with the one person that I have been in

04:38:06.040 --> 04:38:08.040
[Guest]: There are thousands of relationships

04:38:08.040 --> 04:38:10.040
[Guest]: That you know, one day

04:38:10.040 --> 04:38:12.040
[Guest]: Two day or whatever, I am just as an example

04:38:12.040 --> 04:38:14.040
[Guest]: Exaggerating, but thousands of options

04:38:14.040 --> 04:38:16.040
[Guest]: Of relationships that you have, you can have

04:38:16.040 --> 04:38:18.040
[Guest]: Different bad days with different people

04:38:18.040 --> 04:38:20.040
[Guest]: But you are not going to stick to anyone because

04:38:20.040 --> 04:38:22.040
[Guest]: There is always another option and then

04:38:22.040 --> 04:38:24.040
[Guest]: If you choose somebody

04:38:24.040 --> 04:38:26.040
[Guest]: It has to be, it's a choice that you maybe make

04:38:26.040 --> 04:38:28.040
[Guest]: After like 20 failures and you are just like

04:38:28.040 --> 04:38:30.040
[Guest]: I have to choose somebody and whatever and then maybe again

04:38:30.040 --> 04:38:32.040
[Guest]: You settle for a different reason, so it's a

04:38:32.040 --> 04:38:34.040
[Guest]: Choice has been a really tough thing

04:38:34.040 --> 04:38:36.040
[Guest]: Identity, finding an identity

04:38:36.040 --> 04:38:38.040
[Guest]: And finding communities

04:38:38.040 --> 04:38:40.040
[Guest]: For that identity has been a little bit of an obstacle

04:38:40.040 --> 04:38:42.040
[Guest]: Because again, internet gives you

04:38:42.040 --> 04:38:44.040
[Guest]: Identity but in your offline world your parents are

04:38:44.040 --> 04:38:46.040
[Guest]: Telling you this identity doesn't work

04:38:46.040 --> 04:38:48.040
[Guest]: If you want to be whatever

04:38:48.040 --> 04:38:50.040
[Guest]: Even let's talk about feminism only

04:38:50.040 --> 04:38:52.040
[Guest]: Let's talk about a girl who

04:38:52.040 --> 04:38:54.040
[Guest]: Now knows that when her

04:38:54.040 --> 04:38:56.040
[Guest]: Mother says that I don't want to

04:38:56.040 --> 04:38:58.040
[Guest]: I want you to cook and the girl says

04:38:58.040 --> 04:39:00.040
[Guest]: Well I am not going to cook

04:39:00.040 --> 04:39:02.040
[Guest]: And as I said I think everyone should

04:39:02.040 --> 04:39:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Learn to cook

04:39:04.040 --> 04:39:06.040
[Guest]: But if she says I don't want to cook because you cook

04:39:06.040 --> 04:39:08.040
[Guest]: And I don't want to be the idea

04:39:08.040 --> 04:39:10.040
[Guest]: Of stereotype of a woman and I don't want to cook

04:39:10.040 --> 04:39:12.040
[Guest]: Because I have to feed it to my husband

04:39:12.040 --> 04:39:14.040
[Guest]: So I don't want to learn right now, you can't say this

04:39:14.040 --> 04:39:16.040
[Guest]: Now the mother will get angry

04:39:16.040 --> 04:39:18.040
[Guest]: That I have to do it all my life

04:39:18.040 --> 04:39:20.040
[Guest]: You come to me and ask me to cook

04:39:20.040 --> 04:39:22.040
[Guest]: But when I ask you to cook

04:39:22.040 --> 04:39:24.040
[Guest]: You are not doing it, what kind of feminism is this

04:39:24.040 --> 04:39:26.040
[Guest]: Why do I have to be in the kitchen and make food for you then

04:39:26.040 --> 04:39:28.040
[Guest]: And the kid is like

04:39:28.040 --> 04:39:30.040
[Guest]: You don't be in the kitchen but she is like now I don't have an option

04:39:30.040 --> 04:39:32.040
[Guest]: Who is going to feed you

04:39:32.040 --> 04:39:34.040
[Guest]: Now it has become those things where the parents

04:39:34.040 --> 04:39:36.040
[Guest]: Are also getting angry at all of this

04:39:36.040 --> 04:39:38.040
[Guest]: In your offline world

04:39:38.040 --> 04:39:40.040
[Guest]: You can be whatever

04:39:40.040 --> 04:39:42.040
[Guest]: You can have a sense of your identity but your families

04:39:42.040 --> 04:39:44.040
[Guest]: And parents will not allow you to have that

04:39:44.040 --> 04:39:46.040
[Guest]: Not allow you to exercise that identity

04:39:46.040 --> 04:39:48.040
[Guest]: The story of that boy that I told you

04:39:48.040 --> 04:39:50.040
[Guest]: Who is gay in public but in private

04:39:50.040 --> 04:39:52.040
[Guest]: He has to be you know straight

04:39:52.040 --> 04:39:54.040
[Guest]: Because his family doesn't

04:39:54.040 --> 04:39:56.040
[Guest]: Look down upon that, judges him for that

04:39:56.040 --> 04:39:58.040
[Guest]: So what do these kids do, they find safe spaces

04:39:58.040 --> 04:40:00.040
[Guest]: On the internet, they try to find

04:40:00.040 --> 04:40:02.040
[Guest]: Communities on the internet because they are lonely

04:40:02.040 --> 04:40:04.040
[Guest]: And that loneliness is

04:40:04.040 --> 04:40:06.040
[Guest]: Eating everybody, where there was a generation

04:40:06.040 --> 04:40:08.040
[Guest]: Gap that always existed in every generation

04:40:08.040 --> 04:40:10.040
[Guest]: And this generation has become a communication

04:40:10.040 --> 04:40:12.040
[Guest]: Gap because of the different vocabularies

04:40:12.040 --> 04:40:14.040
[Guest]: These people have

04:40:14.040 --> 04:40:16.040
[Guest]: My parents and I for whatever it was

04:40:16.040 --> 04:40:18.040
[Guest]: Spoke in Hindi

04:40:18.040 --> 04:40:20.040
[Guest]: She would speak in Punjabi and I would speak in Hindi

04:40:20.040 --> 04:40:22.040
[Guest]: And there is one language

04:40:22.040 --> 04:40:24.040
[Guest]: Of communication, even anger is the same

04:40:24.040 --> 04:40:26.040
[Guest]: Language, the language of communication

04:40:26.040 --> 04:40:28.040
[Guest]: For this entire generation is emojis

04:40:28.040 --> 04:40:30.040
[Guest]: It is memes

04:40:30.040 --> 04:40:32.040
[Guest]: It is you know DMs

04:40:32.040 --> 04:40:34.040
[Guest]: It is

04:40:34.040 --> 04:40:36.040
[Guest]: Internet lingo which is

04:40:36.040 --> 04:40:38.040
[Guest]: And you can say that you know that's just words

04:40:38.040 --> 04:40:40.040
[Guest]: And that's just internet culture but that is their life

04:40:40.040 --> 04:40:42.040
[Guest]: That's how they communicate with each other

04:40:42.040 --> 04:40:44.040
[Guest]: When you are sad right now

04:40:44.040 --> 04:40:46.040
[Guest]: And again I am not saying this as like a

04:40:46.040 --> 04:40:48.040
[Guest]: I am not making fun of this

04:40:48.040 --> 04:40:50.040
[Guest]: But when a young person today is sad

04:40:50.040 --> 04:40:52.040
[Guest]: It's more likely that they will take a picture of themselves

04:40:52.040 --> 04:40:54.040
[Guest]: With tears and send it to a friend

04:40:54.040 --> 04:40:56.040
[Guest]: And say I am sad like this

04:40:56.040 --> 04:40:58.040
[Guest]: Versus earlier when I would you know

04:40:58.040 --> 04:41:00.040
[Guest]: Either call my friend and I don't know

04:41:00.040 --> 04:41:02.040
[Guest]: I mean I haven't cried too much, I have not done that

04:41:02.040 --> 04:41:04.040
[Guest]: As a man but I would call my friend and just

04:41:04.040 --> 04:41:06.040
[Guest]: Talk for some time or I meet someone

04:41:06.040 --> 04:41:08.040
[Guest]: And say I am feeling bad, let's go for a walk

04:41:08.040 --> 04:41:10.040
[Guest]: Let's go for a walk

04:41:10.040 --> 04:41:12.040
[Guest]: If I was stressed I would just say let's go for a walk

04:41:12.040 --> 04:41:14.040
[Guest]: And we would go and walk across the streets of Bahrain

04:41:14.040 --> 04:41:16.040
[Guest]: You know and that is how we would reconnect

04:41:16.040 --> 04:41:18.040
[Guest]: I am not saying it doesn't happen right now but it doesn't happen as much

04:41:18.040 --> 04:41:20.040
[Guest]: And the way that most people communicate

04:41:20.040 --> 04:41:22.040
[Guest]: Even their deepest darkest

04:41:22.040 --> 04:41:24.040
[Guest]: Emotions or the toughest emotions

04:41:24.040 --> 04:41:26.040
[Guest]: They have is through this internet

04:41:26.040 --> 04:41:28.040
[Guest]: Language so you don't even

04:41:28.040 --> 04:41:30.040
[Guest]: They don't have a vocabulary to express how they are feeling

04:41:30.040 --> 04:41:32.040
[Guest]: Because of the internet today

04:41:32.040 --> 04:41:34.040
[Guest]: And that is but anytime

04:41:34.040 --> 04:41:36.040
[Guest]: They would express themselves why am I

04:41:36.040 --> 04:41:38.040
[Guest]: Sad because my mother is

04:41:38.040 --> 04:41:40.040
[Guest]: You know my parents are patriarchal and I am not

04:41:40.040 --> 04:41:42.040
[Guest]: Allowed to you know

04:41:42.040 --> 04:41:44.040
[Guest]: Live the life that I want to, your parents will not understand

04:41:44.040 --> 04:41:46.040
[Guest]: That language, that's another language

04:41:46.040 --> 04:41:48.040
[Guest]: You are talking the language of labels which is

04:41:48.040 --> 04:41:50.040
[Guest]: Important for you to understand

04:41:50.040 --> 04:41:52.040
[Guest]: And be aware of but your parents will not

04:41:52.040 --> 04:41:54.040
[Guest]: Understand that, you are talking to them in a very

04:41:54.040 --> 04:41:56.040
[Guest]: It's alien to them

04:41:56.040 --> 04:41:58.040
[Guest]: So when this divide keeps getting bigger

04:41:58.040 --> 04:42:00.040
[Guest]: You are not able to talk to

04:42:00.040 --> 04:42:02.040
[Guest]: The people who are closest to you

04:42:02.040 --> 04:42:04.040
[Guest]: Who mean the most to you, who have

04:42:04.040 --> 04:42:06.040
[Guest]: Raised you and given you love

04:42:06.040 --> 04:42:08.040
[Guest]: And that's not the primary community

04:42:08.040 --> 04:42:10.040
[Guest]: Which was your parents

04:42:10.040 --> 04:42:12.040
[Guest]: Is getting more and more distant because of this

04:42:12.040 --> 04:42:14.040
[Guest]: Because of the internet in good and bad

04:42:14.040 --> 04:42:16.040
[Guest]: Ways, you look for this community online

04:42:16.040 --> 04:42:18.040
[Guest]: And when you go online

04:42:18.040 --> 04:42:20.040
[Guest]: You either find positive community sometimes

04:42:20.040 --> 04:42:22.040
[Guest]: Or you find other communities

04:42:22.040 --> 04:42:24.040
[Guest]: And when you are lonely you just want anyone

04:42:24.040 --> 04:42:26.040
[Guest]: Who will accept you and that's what's happening

04:42:26.040 --> 04:42:28.040
[Guest]: Right now, there are people out there

04:42:28.040 --> 04:42:30.040
[Guest]: Who recognize this or people out there

04:42:30.040 --> 04:42:32.040
[Guest]: Who are channelizing the loneliness

04:42:32.040 --> 04:42:34.040
[Guest]: In xyz ways and that

04:42:34.040 --> 04:42:36.040
[Guest]: Anger and that

04:42:36.040 --> 04:42:38.040
[Guest]: Need to find something

04:42:38.040 --> 04:42:40.040
[Guest]: That gives me, you know

04:42:40.040 --> 04:42:42.040
[Guest]: Where I feel less lonely

04:42:42.040 --> 04:42:44.040
[Guest]: And now for a lot of

04:42:44.040 --> 04:42:46.040
[Guest]: Again, now coming to the Yuva Roadshow

04:42:46.040 --> 04:42:48.040
[Guest]: When I

04:42:48.040 --> 04:42:50.040
[Guest]: So as I said, with Yuva

04:42:50.040 --> 04:42:52.040
[Guest]: When I started, one of the most important things I wanted to do

04:42:52.040 --> 04:42:54.040
[Guest]: Was create a platform that listens to young people

04:42:54.040 --> 04:42:56.040
[Guest]: And when you are listening to

04:42:56.040 --> 04:42:58.040
[Guest]: And I said this

04:42:58.040 --> 04:43:00.040
[Guest]: Before and I will say this again that you know

04:43:00.040 --> 04:43:02.040
[Guest]: I want to be a company that sits in Bombay

04:43:02.040 --> 04:43:04.040
[Guest]: And says we listen to young people

04:43:04.040 --> 04:43:06.040
[Guest]: Because I have taught 8 people in

04:43:06.040 --> 04:43:08.040
[Guest]: Whatever, x number of 100 people

04:43:08.040 --> 04:43:10.040
[Guest]: In Jai Hind College

04:43:10.040 --> 04:43:12.040
[Guest]: I want to, I can't say I represent India

04:43:12.040 --> 04:43:14.040
[Guest]: I am calling it Yuva, I am calling it a Hindi name

04:43:14.040 --> 04:43:16.040
[Guest]: I am calling it like

04:43:16.040 --> 04:43:18.040
[Guest]: When Yuva was named because Yuva has

04:43:18.040 --> 04:43:20.040
[Guest]: Pretty much been co-opted as an angry word

04:43:20.040 --> 04:43:22.040
[Guest]: By most political parties

04:43:22.040 --> 04:43:24.040
[Guest]: Yuva Sena and Fist and what not

04:43:24.040 --> 04:43:26.040
[Guest]: And I wanted to say that Yuva can also be heart

04:43:26.040 --> 04:43:28.040
[Guest]: You know and that is what I saw in my students

04:43:28.040 --> 04:43:30.040
[Guest]: And so we thought that we are not going to

04:43:30.040 --> 04:43:32.040
[Guest]: Sit in Bombay and decide like

04:43:32.040 --> 04:43:34.040
[Guest]: And say that we know young people, we are going to go across the country

04:43:34.040 --> 04:43:36.040
[Guest]: So between

04:43:36.040 --> 04:43:38.040
[Guest]: 2019 and 2020

04:43:38.040 --> 04:43:40.040
[Guest]: I went to over 120 colleges, I went to

04:43:40.040 --> 04:43:42.040
[Guest]: I went to 35 cities

04:43:42.040 --> 04:43:44.040
[Guest]: I went to IITs

04:43:44.040 --> 04:43:46.040
[Guest]: IIMs, AIIMs, NIFTs, NITs

04:43:46.040 --> 04:43:48.040
[Guest]: You know all kinds of colleges

04:43:48.040 --> 04:43:50.040
[Guest]: Government colleges, you know English speaking

04:43:50.040 --> 04:43:52.040
[Guest]: Hindi speaking, regional speaking colleges

04:43:52.040 --> 04:43:54.040
[Guest]: And just I spoke

04:43:54.040 --> 04:43:56.040
[Guest]: About gender, mental health and

04:43:56.040 --> 04:43:58.040
[Guest]: Stories and then I just

04:43:58.040 --> 04:44:00.040
[Guest]: Created these spaces where I ask people now

04:44:00.040 --> 04:44:02.040
[Guest]: I have told, I was vulnerable

04:44:02.040 --> 04:44:04.040
[Guest]: With them, I said this is what I

04:44:04.040 --> 04:44:06.040
[Guest]: This is my story, now I want to hear yours

04:44:06.040 --> 04:44:08.040
[Guest]: And here is what happens

04:44:08.040 --> 04:44:10.040
[Guest]: I mean it was the same kindness project

04:44:10.040 --> 04:44:12.040
[Guest]: Except that when kindness project I had 6 months to

04:44:12.040 --> 04:44:14.040
[Guest]: Earn the trust of my students for them

04:44:14.040 --> 04:44:16.040
[Guest]: To open up in the safe space that I have

04:44:16.040 --> 04:44:18.040
[Guest]: Whereas over here I had like 1 hour

04:44:18.040 --> 04:44:20.040
[Guest]: You know and in 1 hour I had to

04:44:20.040 --> 04:44:22.040
[Guest]: Say certain things for them to want to open

04:44:22.040 --> 04:44:24.040
[Guest]: Up in front of me and again I was doing it

04:44:24.040 --> 04:44:26.040
[Guest]: You know now when I look back also

04:44:26.040 --> 04:44:28.040
[Guest]: Sometimes I just feel like

04:44:28.040 --> 04:44:30.040
[Guest]: I know as a teacher that I have

04:44:30.040 --> 04:44:32.040
[Guest]: I have an understanding of young people

04:44:32.040 --> 04:44:34.040
[Guest]: I think I have the empathy to be able to hear them

04:44:34.040 --> 04:44:36.040
[Guest]: But I am not a trained professional

04:44:36.040 --> 04:44:38.040
[Guest]: And maybe the next time I do it I would want a trained

04:44:38.040 --> 04:44:40.040
[Guest]: Professional with me and you know

04:44:40.040 --> 04:44:42.040
[Guest]: Because yeah

04:44:42.040 --> 04:44:44.040
[Guest]: I just feel like maybe I should

04:44:44.040 --> 04:44:46.040
[Guest]: I didn't think of it at that time

04:44:46.040 --> 04:44:48.040
[Guest]: But having said that

04:44:48.040 --> 04:44:50.040
[Guest]: My intent was always to kind of just have

04:44:50.040 --> 04:44:52.040
[Guest]: These people open up because I felt like

04:44:52.040 --> 04:44:54.040
[Guest]: Not everyone has

04:44:54.040 --> 04:44:56.040
[Guest]: Even therapy is a privilege, you don't have access

04:44:56.040 --> 04:44:58.040
[Guest]: Everybody doesn't have access to therapy

04:44:58.040 --> 04:45:00.040
[Guest]: You tell a young person go and take therapy

04:45:00.040 --> 04:45:02.040
[Guest]: At the very least

04:45:02.040 --> 04:45:04.040
[Guest]: 250,000 rupees for a session

04:45:04.040 --> 04:45:06.040
[Guest]: And if you are doing 4 sessions

04:45:06.040 --> 04:45:08.040
[Guest]: You know 1000 rupees that's not affordable for

04:45:08.040 --> 04:45:10.040
[Guest]: In a month not affordable for most Indian students

04:45:10.040 --> 04:45:12.040
[Guest]: So in that situation

04:45:12.040 --> 04:45:14.040
[Guest]: What do they, where do they

04:45:14.040 --> 04:45:16.040
[Guest]: If they have to express what do they do

04:45:16.040 --> 04:45:18.040
[Guest]: And my thing to them was

04:45:18.040 --> 04:45:20.040
[Guest]: Talk to each other and listen to each other

04:45:20.040 --> 04:45:22.040
[Guest]: Lead with listening

04:45:22.040 --> 04:45:24.040
[Guest]: Care about the stories of the people around you

04:45:24.040 --> 04:45:26.040
[Guest]: But like let's create that safe space first

04:45:26.040 --> 04:45:28.040
[Guest]: And then you guys create it among yourselves

04:45:28.040 --> 04:45:30.040
[Guest]: Which has happened and I'll come to that

04:45:30.040 --> 04:45:32.040
[Guest]: But when you give young people a safe space

04:45:32.040 --> 04:45:34.040
[Guest]: So same kind of kindness project stories

04:45:34.040 --> 04:45:36.040
[Guest]: Beautiful stories I'll love to kind of tell you one

04:45:36.040 --> 04:45:38.040
[Guest]: But

04:45:38.040 --> 04:45:40.040
[Guest]: The larger thing

04:45:40.040 --> 04:45:42.040
[Guest]: That came out was

04:45:42.040 --> 04:45:44.040
[Guest]: As I said with

04:45:44.040 --> 04:45:46.040
[Guest]: Girls it was when given a safe space

04:45:46.040 --> 04:45:48.040
[Guest]: To talk about anything they choose to talk about sexual harassment

04:45:48.040 --> 04:45:50.040
[Guest]: Because that's the most pervasive

04:45:50.040 --> 04:45:52.040
[Guest]: Thing in their life unfortunately that's a

04:45:52.040 --> 04:45:54.040
[Guest]: Tragedy of a country at the same time

04:45:54.040 --> 04:45:56.040
[Guest]: As I said before they would

04:45:56.040 --> 04:45:58.040
[Guest]: Immediately after that story they would talk about

04:45:58.040 --> 04:46:00.040
[Guest]: Well that's the girl because of

04:46:00.040 --> 04:46:02.040
[Guest]: Which you know I'm here

04:46:02.040 --> 04:46:04.040
[Guest]: Today and I've survived and who's been my comfort

04:46:04.040 --> 04:46:06.040
[Guest]: It's a tribe it's a sisterhood

04:46:06.040 --> 04:46:08.040
[Guest]: It's the support group

04:46:08.040 --> 04:46:10.040
[Guest]: That girls have formed with each other

04:46:10.040 --> 04:46:12.040
[Guest]: They would talk about harassment they would talk about body issues

04:46:12.040 --> 04:46:14.040
[Guest]: They would talk about everything like you know girls have been

04:46:14.040 --> 04:46:16.040
[Guest]: Shamed into being a certain way

04:46:16.040 --> 04:46:18.040
[Guest]: You have to be fair you have to be thin you have to whatever

04:46:18.040 --> 04:46:20.040
[Guest]: Fit into an ideal for a boy that you will

04:46:20.040 --> 04:46:22.040
[Guest]: Ultimately marry but there are other

04:46:22.040 --> 04:46:24.040
[Guest]: Girls who are helping them cope with this

04:46:24.040 --> 04:46:26.040
[Guest]: And that's how they survive right

04:46:26.040 --> 04:46:28.040
[Guest]: With boys which I initially found

04:46:28.040 --> 04:46:30.040
[Guest]: Shocking but now unsurprising

04:46:30.040 --> 04:46:32.040
[Guest]: The biggest thing they would talk about

04:46:32.040 --> 04:46:34.040
[Guest]: When given a free space and a

04:46:34.040 --> 04:46:36.040
[Guest]: Safe space was loneliness

04:46:36.040 --> 04:46:38.040
[Guest]: Boys in engineering colleges

04:46:38.040 --> 04:46:40.040
[Guest]: Non-engineering colleges coming up to me

04:46:40.040 --> 04:46:42.040
[Guest]: Coming up in among

04:46:42.040 --> 04:46:44.040
[Guest]: 150 students and talking about how

04:46:44.040 --> 04:46:46.040
[Guest]: They are doctors

04:46:46.040 --> 04:46:48.040
[Guest]: Boys coming up which

04:46:48.040 --> 04:46:50.040
[Guest]: Scared the hell out of me

04:46:50.040 --> 04:46:52.040
[Guest]: Young boys coming up and saying

04:46:52.040 --> 04:46:54.040
[Guest]: I didn't want to be a doctor

04:46:54.040 --> 04:46:56.040
[Guest]: But my family forced me and now I'm here

04:46:56.040 --> 04:46:58.040
[Guest]: But everyday I'm depressed

04:46:58.040 --> 04:47:00.040
[Guest]: I don't want to do this

04:47:00.040 --> 04:47:02.040
[Guest]: But I will have to because my parents are doctors

04:47:02.040 --> 04:47:04.040
[Guest]: Their parents are doctors so now I have to be one

04:47:04.040 --> 04:47:06.040
[Guest]: You know and I'm hearing

04:47:06.040 --> 04:47:08.040
[Guest]: This across I don't know who to

04:47:08.040 --> 04:47:10.040
[Guest]: Talk to I feel sad

04:47:10.040 --> 04:47:12.040
[Guest]: But when I tell it to my friends they judge me

04:47:12.040 --> 04:47:14.040
[Guest]: They say are you a girl

04:47:14.040 --> 04:47:16.040
[Guest]: You know or if I told

04:47:16.040 --> 04:47:18.040
[Guest]: There's a boy who said you know in one of the cities

04:47:18.040 --> 04:47:20.040
[Guest]: Said that well I had a girlfriend who dumped me

04:47:20.040 --> 04:47:22.040
[Guest]: Because I used to cry and she said I want

04:47:22.040 --> 04:47:24.040
[Guest]: A man I don't want

04:47:24.040 --> 04:47:26.040
[Guest]: Like someone like you who's cry baby

04:47:26.040 --> 04:47:28.040
[Guest]: They were

04:47:28.040 --> 04:47:30.040
[Guest]: There's a boy who spoke about the fact that

04:47:30.040 --> 04:47:32.040
[Guest]: You know well I

04:47:32.040 --> 04:47:34.040
[Guest]: I don't want to objectify women

04:47:34.040 --> 04:47:36.040
[Guest]: But I have a group where they all do it

04:47:36.040 --> 04:47:38.040
[Guest]: And then the moment I speak about

04:47:38.040 --> 04:47:40.040
[Guest]: This they say that

04:47:40.040 --> 04:47:42.040
[Guest]: Then you f**k off from this group

04:47:42.040 --> 04:47:44.040
[Guest]: And then I ultimately did f**k off and I lost my

04:47:44.040 --> 04:47:46.040
[Guest]: Friends and I don't know now

04:47:46.040 --> 04:47:48.040
[Guest]: You know how do I

04:47:48.040 --> 04:47:50.040
[Guest]: What do I do I just

04:47:50.040 --> 04:47:52.040
[Guest]: Maybe I have

04:47:52.040 --> 04:47:54.040
[Guest]: My moral is intact

04:47:54.040 --> 04:47:56.040
[Guest]: But I've lost my friends so there is

04:47:56.040 --> 04:47:58.040
[Guest]: And so many boys

04:47:58.040 --> 04:48:00.040
[Guest]: You know the thing that

04:48:00.040 --> 04:48:02.040
[Guest]: In 2019 especially

04:48:02.040 --> 04:48:04.040
[Guest]: In the second roadshow I did two

04:48:04.040 --> 04:48:06.040
[Guest]: In the second roadshow

04:48:06.040 --> 04:48:08.040
[Guest]: The thing that just kind of

04:48:08.040 --> 04:48:10.040
[Guest]: Shocked me by surprise was the number of young people

04:48:10.040 --> 04:48:12.040
[Guest]: And young boys would come up to me

04:48:12.040 --> 04:48:14.040
[Guest]: To ask for a hug

04:48:14.040 --> 04:48:16.040
[Guest]: So many boys would come up to me and just say

04:48:16.040 --> 04:48:18.040
[Guest]: Can I have a hug

04:48:18.040 --> 04:48:20.040
[Guest]: And when I'd ask them sure I'd say sure

04:48:20.040 --> 04:48:22.040
[Guest]: And give them a hug and then say why did you ask

04:48:22.040 --> 04:48:24.040
[Guest]: Their answer was well

04:48:24.040 --> 04:48:26.040
[Guest]: I have never got one

04:48:26.040 --> 04:48:28.040
[Guest]: My parents have never

04:48:28.040 --> 04:48:30.040
[Guest]: Given me a hug

04:48:30.040 --> 04:48:32.040
[Guest]: No one has said I love you to me in my life

04:48:32.040 --> 04:48:34.040
[Guest]: Before

04:48:34.040 --> 04:48:36.040
[Guest]: I don't know where to find

04:48:36.040 --> 04:48:38.040
[Guest]: You know love or acceptance

04:48:38.040 --> 04:48:40.040
[Guest]: These were the answers that I was getting

04:48:40.040 --> 04:48:42.040
[Guest]: And that's what's

04:48:42.040 --> 04:48:44.040
[Guest]: Happening

04:48:44.040 --> 04:48:46.040
[Guest]: Offline

04:48:46.040 --> 04:48:48.040
[Guest]: Now these same people and this is where

04:48:48.040 --> 04:48:50.040
[Guest]: I will tell you over the next two years when I followed

04:48:50.040 --> 04:48:52.040
[Guest]: I followed back a lot of these kids

04:48:52.040 --> 04:48:54.040
[Guest]: A lot of these kids

04:48:54.040 --> 04:48:56.040
[Guest]: I saw that a bunch of the boys that I spoke to

04:48:56.040 --> 04:48:58.040
[Guest]: Who were lonely were moving

04:48:58.040 --> 04:49:00.040
[Guest]: Towards anti-feminist

04:49:00.040 --> 04:49:02.040
[Guest]: And right-wing

04:49:02.040 --> 04:49:04.040
[Guest]: Groups on the internet

04:49:04.040 --> 04:49:06.040
[Guest]: Especially with all the protests that happened

04:49:06.040 --> 04:49:08.040
[Guest]: They started commenting on

04:49:08.040 --> 04:49:10.040
[Guest]: I remember this one really

04:49:10.040 --> 04:49:12.040
[Guest]: I wrote a post about this

04:49:12.040 --> 04:49:14.040
[Guest]: Fake news organization on Instagram

04:49:14.040 --> 04:49:16.040
[Guest]: And this one boy who used to follow me

04:49:16.040 --> 04:49:18.040
[Guest]: Who I met in Gujarat or somewhere

04:49:18.040 --> 04:49:20.040
[Guest]: I don't know

04:49:20.040 --> 04:49:22.040
[Guest]: Maharashtra only I think somewhere

04:49:22.040 --> 04:49:24.040
[Guest]: Very sweet kid

04:49:24.040 --> 04:49:26.040
[Guest]: Told about loneliness

04:49:26.040 --> 04:49:28.040
[Guest]: Gave a hug etc

04:49:28.040 --> 04:49:30.040
[Guest]: At the end of this

04:49:30.040 --> 04:49:32.040
[Guest]: To talk against me

04:49:32.040 --> 04:49:34.040
[Guest]: The group, the fake news

04:49:34.040 --> 04:49:36.040
[Guest]: Organization wrote

04:49:36.040 --> 04:49:38.040
[Guest]: Against me and said this guy is an idiot

04:49:38.040 --> 04:49:40.040
[Guest]: And this guy who I was

04:49:40.040 --> 04:49:42.040
[Guest]: Still following wrote on that post

04:49:42.040 --> 04:49:44.040
[Guest]: Saying that well this guy Nikhil

04:49:44.040 --> 04:49:46.040
[Guest]: Is a snake and when he came to my

04:49:46.040 --> 04:49:48.040
[Guest]: College I thought as much

04:49:48.040 --> 04:49:50.040
[Guest]: But I didn't say it

04:49:50.040 --> 04:49:52.040
[Guest]: At that time

04:49:52.040 --> 04:49:54.040
[Guest]: You were in front of me

04:49:54.040 --> 04:49:56.040
[Guest]: Crying and asking me for a hug

04:49:56.040 --> 04:49:58.040
[Guest]: And this is what you are saying

04:49:58.040 --> 04:50:00.040
[Guest]: On the internet. Now I of course did not

04:50:00.040 --> 04:50:02.040
[Guest]: You know say screw you or like I don't

04:50:02.040 --> 04:50:04.040
[Guest]: You know whatever

04:50:04.040 --> 04:50:06.040
[Guest]: But I was just, this is what's happening

04:50:06.040 --> 04:50:08.040
[Guest]: These kids are lonely

04:50:08.040 --> 04:50:10.040
[Guest]: There is no way to address their loneliness

04:50:10.040 --> 04:50:12.040
[Guest]: There is no safe space created for them

04:50:12.040 --> 04:50:14.040
[Guest]: And

04:50:14.040 --> 04:50:16.040
[Guest]: In the worst impulses

04:50:16.040 --> 04:50:18.040
[Guest]: You know especially when

04:50:18.040 --> 04:50:20.040
[Guest]: They don't have anywhere to go to and anywhere to fit in

04:50:20.040 --> 04:50:22.040
[Guest]: They are finding these identities

04:50:22.040 --> 04:50:24.040
[Guest]: And that's what's happening to the world

04:50:24.040 --> 04:50:26.040
[Guest]: You have been constantly asked

04:50:26.040 --> 04:50:28.040
[Guest]: You know you are so lonely

04:50:28.040 --> 04:50:30.040
[Guest]: Because there are narratives that you have to follow

04:50:30.040 --> 04:50:32.040
[Guest]: When you try to fight those narratives

04:50:32.040 --> 04:50:34.040
[Guest]: You are pushed back against a wall

04:50:34.040 --> 04:50:36.040
[Guest]: So with the internet

04:50:36.040 --> 04:50:38.040
[Guest]: At least you don't have to worry about

04:50:38.040 --> 04:50:40.040
[Guest]: Finding someone offline because you are like

04:50:40.040 --> 04:50:42.040
[Guest]: I am not getting community offline, I don't want your community

04:50:42.040 --> 04:50:44.040
[Guest]: But online I am going to find

04:50:44.040 --> 04:50:46.040
[Guest]: The folks who are

04:50:46.040 --> 04:50:48.040
[Guest]: Who give me

04:50:48.040 --> 04:50:50.040
[Guest]: The respect

04:50:50.040 --> 04:50:52.040
[Guest]: Of being heard

04:50:52.040 --> 04:50:54.040
[Guest]: You know whatever I may say

04:50:54.040 --> 04:50:56.040
[Guest]: And a lot of these communities

04:50:56.040 --> 04:50:58.040
[Guest]: Are just angry communities

04:50:58.040 --> 04:51:00.040
[Guest]: There is a

04:51:00.040 --> 04:51:02.040
[Guest]: Someone who is very close to me

04:51:02.040 --> 04:51:04.040
[Guest]: Very very close to me, who I have lost

04:51:04.040 --> 04:51:06.040
[Guest]: In fact I made a film called Tasali Se

04:51:06.040 --> 04:51:08.040
[Guest]: You know on this

04:51:08.040 --> 04:51:10.040
[Guest]: But

04:51:10.040 --> 04:51:12.040
[Guest]: Who I think I have lost to

04:51:12.040 --> 04:51:14.040
[Guest]: Someone who I was very close to because

04:51:14.040 --> 04:51:16.040
[Guest]: Who has blocked me on all platforms because he said

04:51:16.040 --> 04:51:18.040
[Guest]: You have become too liberal

04:51:18.040 --> 04:51:20.040
[Guest]: Because this kid, he is my age

04:51:20.040 --> 04:51:22.040
[Guest]: But he has gone the other way

04:51:22.040 --> 04:51:24.040
[Guest]: And he is just constantly sharing hateful

04:51:24.040 --> 04:51:26.040
[Guest]: Posts and when I kind of

04:51:26.040 --> 04:51:28.040
[Guest]: Commented and said you know why are you doing this

04:51:28.040 --> 04:51:30.040
[Guest]: And just after a point

04:51:30.040 --> 04:51:32.040
[Guest]: He blocked me and said like

04:51:32.040 --> 04:51:34.040
[Guest]: Stop your liberal bullshit

04:51:34.040 --> 04:51:36.040
[Guest]: And I was just asking why you are being so hateful

04:51:36.040 --> 04:51:38.040
[Guest]: But I know his background

04:51:38.040 --> 04:51:40.040
[Guest]: And I know he has been lonely all his life

04:51:40.040 --> 04:51:42.040
[Guest]: He has been a single child, he has never

04:51:42.040 --> 04:51:44.040
[Guest]: Fit in, he had a lot of problems growing up

04:51:44.040 --> 04:51:46.040
[Guest]: You know and

04:51:46.040 --> 04:51:48.040
[Guest]: In different ways, lot of issues

04:51:48.040 --> 04:51:50.040
[Guest]: Which I don't want to get into but

04:51:50.040 --> 04:51:52.040
[Guest]: I know that this guy never fit in

04:51:52.040 --> 04:51:54.040
[Guest]: Anywhere and now he has found a

04:51:54.040 --> 04:51:56.040
[Guest]: Community, he is friends with

04:51:56.040 --> 04:51:58.040
[Guest]: The lot of the right wing

04:51:58.040 --> 04:52:00.040
[Guest]: You know, influencer people

04:52:00.040 --> 04:52:02.040
[Guest]: He is in a very big position right now

04:52:02.040 --> 04:52:04.040
[Guest]: And he is friends with a lot of these people

04:52:04.040 --> 04:52:06.040
[Guest]: I see him following them, they are following him back

04:52:06.040 --> 04:52:08.040
[Guest]: But he has found a community that now gives him that

04:52:08.040 --> 04:52:10.040
[Guest]: Respect

04:52:10.040 --> 04:52:12.040
[Guest]: Which is what everybody in our country

04:52:12.040 --> 04:52:14.040
[Guest]: Is ultimately looking for

04:52:14.040 --> 04:52:16.040
[Guest]: Respect the elders, how will I grow up?

04:52:16.040 --> 04:52:18.040
[Guest]: By joining the biggest

04:52:18.040 --> 04:52:20.040
[Guest]: Most loud, most vocal

04:52:20.040 --> 04:52:22.040
[Guest]: Most angry

04:52:22.040 --> 04:52:24.040
[Guest]: Community online

04:52:24.040 --> 04:52:26.040
[Guest]: And social media has

04:52:26.040 --> 04:52:28.040
[Guest]: Incentivized this

04:52:28.040 --> 04:52:30.040
[Guest]: And there is this book that I was telling you about

04:52:30.040 --> 04:52:32.040
[Guest]: Chaos Machine that I am reading right now

04:52:32.040 --> 04:52:34.040
[Guest]: It's just Max Fischer

04:52:34.040 --> 04:52:36.040
[Guest]: Fascinating, fascinating, fascinating book

04:52:36.040 --> 04:52:38.040
[Guest]: About how

04:52:38.040 --> 04:52:40.040
[Guest]: It's like the movie Social Dilemma

04:52:40.040 --> 04:52:42.040
[Guest]: But like a book but much much worse and much much more

04:52:42.040 --> 04:52:44.040
[Guest]: Detailed and he is given like a report

04:52:44.040 --> 04:52:46.040
[Guest]: A reportage of how

04:52:46.040 --> 04:52:48.040
[Guest]: Social media

04:52:48.040 --> 04:52:50.040
[Guest]: Systems in trying to

04:52:50.040 --> 04:52:52.040
[Guest]: In trying to maximize

04:52:52.040 --> 04:52:54.040
[Guest]: Their profits created

04:52:54.040 --> 04:52:56.040
[Guest]: Self

04:52:56.040 --> 04:52:58.040
[Guest]: Self coding

04:52:58.040 --> 04:53:00.040
[Guest]: Algorithms, AI algorithms

04:53:00.040 --> 04:53:02.040
[Guest]: That ultimately

04:53:02.040 --> 04:53:04.040
[Guest]: Started pushing people to extremes

04:53:04.040 --> 04:53:06.040
[Guest]: I stopped, I used to be

04:53:06.040 --> 04:53:08.040
[Guest]: Very active on Twitter

04:53:08.040 --> 04:53:10.040
[Guest]: I have stopped being very active, I have stopped giving my opinions

04:53:10.040 --> 04:53:12.040
[Guest]: I used to give a lot of opinions, a lot of threads

04:53:12.040 --> 04:53:14.040
[Guest]: A lot of people on Twitter know me through my thread

04:53:14.040 --> 04:53:16.040
[Guest]: I don't do it anymore because I realized that

04:53:16.040 --> 04:53:18.040
[Guest]: I was also

04:53:18.040 --> 04:53:20.040
[Guest]: Just honestly only seeing negativity

04:53:20.040 --> 04:53:22.040
[Guest]: Everywhere, ever since I

04:53:22.040 --> 04:53:24.040
[Guest]: Stopped doing that, you know

04:53:24.040 --> 04:53:26.040
[Guest]: And I started like retweeting like

04:53:26.040 --> 04:53:28.040
[Guest]: Wholesome stuff, started retweeting

04:53:28.040 --> 04:53:30.040
[Guest]: Movie stuff, the only suggestions that I get

04:53:30.040 --> 04:53:32.040
[Guest]: Now are all related to stuff

04:53:32.040 --> 04:53:34.040
[Guest]: Which is fun and passion, but the moment I was

04:53:34.040 --> 04:53:36.040
[Guest]: Talking about opinion, my opinion would be out of empathy

04:53:36.040 --> 04:53:38.040
[Guest]: But the suggested posts, the suggested

04:53:38.040 --> 04:53:40.040
[Guest]: People are all angry, angry, angry

04:53:40.040 --> 04:53:42.040
[Guest]: Angry, angry

04:53:42.040 --> 04:53:44.040
[Guest]: Because that is the thing that emotional

04:53:44.040 --> 04:53:46.040
[Guest]: Responses are what

04:53:46.040 --> 04:53:48.040
[Guest]: The algorithms figured

04:53:48.040 --> 04:53:50.040
[Guest]: Are the way to get people

04:53:50.040 --> 04:53:52.040
[Guest]: To retweet or share or stay

04:53:52.040 --> 04:53:54.040
[Guest]: There for the longest time

04:53:54.040 --> 04:53:56.040
[Guest]: And the algorithms have now

04:53:56.040 --> 04:53:58.040
[Guest]: Pulled our world in different directions

04:53:58.040 --> 04:54:00.040
[Guest]: Where even if, and there was this

04:54:00.040 --> 04:54:02.040
[Guest]: Incredible, one of the big

04:54:02.040 --> 04:54:04.040
[Guest]: Parts of the book which is just incredible

04:54:04.040 --> 04:54:06.040
[Guest]: Learning was, so these

04:54:06.040 --> 04:54:08.040
[Guest]: Researchers did this

04:54:08.040 --> 04:54:10.040
[Guest]: Whole study, bunch of researchers

04:54:10.040 --> 04:54:12.040
[Guest]: On YouTube, where they did this study

04:54:12.040 --> 04:54:14.040
[Guest]: Where they said like, if I just

04:54:14.040 --> 04:54:16.040
[Guest]: Start

04:54:16.040 --> 04:54:18.040
[Guest]: A trending, I click on a trending video

04:54:18.040 --> 04:54:20.040
[Guest]: On YouTube, and then just

04:54:20.040 --> 04:54:22.040
[Guest]: Let it autoplay, how much

04:54:22.040 --> 04:54:24.040
[Guest]: How many videos before I

04:54:24.040 --> 04:54:26.040
[Guest]: Get a conspiracy video or an extremist

04:54:26.040 --> 04:54:28.040
[Guest]: Video, and the answer was 5

04:54:28.040 --> 04:54:30.040
[Guest]: After 5

04:54:30.040 --> 04:54:32.040
[Guest]: Autoplay videos, even if you are

04:54:32.040 --> 04:54:34.040
[Guest]: If you have scrubbed clean, you are on a

04:54:34.040 --> 04:54:36.040
[Guest]: New YouTube channel, you have just seen a

04:54:36.040 --> 04:54:38.040
[Guest]: Trending YouTube video, it's the 6th video is an extremist

04:54:38.040 --> 04:54:40.040
[Guest]: Or conspiracy video, and after that

04:54:40.040 --> 04:54:42.040
[Guest]: Every video is a, which you

04:54:42.040 --> 04:54:44.040
[Guest]: Dive deeper and deeper and deeper into conspiracy

04:54:44.040 --> 04:54:46.040
[Guest]: And when you've created

04:54:46.040 --> 04:54:48.040
[Guest]: AIs and you've created, you know

04:54:48.040 --> 04:54:50.040
[Guest]: Not man-made

04:54:50.040 --> 04:54:52.040
[Guest]: Platforms, that

04:54:52.040 --> 04:54:54.040
[Guest]: And people have figured this, you know

04:54:54.040 --> 04:54:56.040
[Guest]: Amit, you would know

04:54:56.040 --> 04:54:58.040
[Guest]: This, having spent so much of your time

04:54:58.040 --> 04:55:00.040
[Guest]: Online, all the people who are

04:55:00.040 --> 04:55:02.040
[Guest]: You know, opinion

04:55:02.040 --> 04:55:04.040
[Guest]: Generators and you know

04:55:04.040 --> 04:55:06.040
[Guest]: On the internet, they figured it

04:55:06.040 --> 04:55:08.040
[Guest]: How is giving an opinion your

04:55:08.040 --> 04:55:10.040
[Guest]: Entire identity, and

04:55:10.040 --> 04:55:12.040
[Guest]: How is that every opinion, you have an opinion

04:55:12.040 --> 04:55:14.040
[Guest]: On every topic in the world, and every

04:55:14.040 --> 04:55:16.040
[Guest]: Time you have something nasty to say about it

04:55:16.040 --> 04:55:18.040
[Guest]: Because that is how you get engagement

04:55:18.040 --> 04:55:20.040
[Guest]: That is how you get more views, that is how

04:55:20.040 --> 04:55:22.040
[Guest]: You stay relevant, and that becomes your identity

04:55:22.040 --> 04:55:24.040
[Guest]: You are not getting

04:55:24.040 --> 04:55:26.040
[Guest]: Any bigger, you know one of the

04:55:26.040 --> 04:55:28.040
[Guest]: I had gone to the

04:55:28.040 --> 04:55:30.040
[Guest]: Such a random thing, I had gone to

04:55:30.040 --> 04:55:32.040
[Guest]: The partition

04:55:32.040 --> 04:55:34.040
[Guest]: Museum in Amritsar

04:55:34.040 --> 04:55:36.040
[Guest]: It was, it's a deeply

04:55:36.040 --> 04:55:38.040
[Guest]: Like emotional place, and again

04:55:38.040 --> 04:55:40.040
[Guest]: As someone whose family is shifted

04:55:40.040 --> 04:55:42.040
[Guest]: In the partition, I was always like

04:55:42.040 --> 04:55:44.040
[Guest]: What are my roots, and that's also maybe one of the

04:55:44.040 --> 04:55:46.040
[Guest]: Reasons my misfit thing has

04:55:46.040 --> 04:55:48.040
[Guest]: Always been there, but

04:55:48.040 --> 04:55:50.040
[Guest]: I was shocked to see

04:55:50.040 --> 04:55:52.040
[Guest]: That two or three of the

04:55:52.040 --> 04:55:54.040
[Guest]: Gifts to that museum

04:55:54.040 --> 04:55:56.040
[Guest]: Came from

04:55:56.040 --> 04:55:58.040
[Guest]: The

04:55:58.040 --> 04:56:00.040
[Guest]: The nastiest

04:56:00.040 --> 04:56:02.040
[Guest]: Angriest

04:56:02.040 --> 04:56:04.040
[Guest]: People on

04:56:04.040 --> 04:56:06.040
[Guest]: Twitter, I'm not going to name

04:56:06.040 --> 04:56:08.040
[Guest]: Them, but like

04:56:08.040 --> 04:56:10.040
[Guest]: Everyone knows them, and

04:56:10.040 --> 04:56:12.040
[Guest]: The moment you go there, you are just like

04:56:12.040 --> 04:56:14.040
[Guest]: It's almost two and two together

04:56:14.040 --> 04:56:16.040
[Guest]: It's almost like, oh now I get why

04:56:16.040 --> 04:56:18.040
[Guest]: She's so, I've said it's a

04:56:18.040 --> 04:56:20.040
[Guest]: Woman, but now you get why it's

04:56:20.040 --> 04:56:22.040
[Guest]: This person is so angry

04:56:22.040 --> 04:56:24.040
[Guest]: All the time, especially against

04:56:24.040 --> 04:56:26.040
[Guest]: Marginalized folks, because there's clearly

04:56:26.040 --> 04:56:28.040
[Guest]: A, there's a letter there, there's

04:56:28.040 --> 04:56:30.040
[Guest]: All the things that were robbed of this person

04:56:30.040 --> 04:56:32.040
[Guest]: During the partition from their grandparents, and that's

04:56:32.040 --> 04:56:34.040
[Guest]: Generational hate that she's carried

04:56:34.040 --> 04:56:36.040
[Guest]: Through it now, so you see

04:56:36.040 --> 04:56:38.040
[Guest]: That starting point, and now you see

04:56:38.040 --> 04:56:40.040
[Guest]: What it has become, but

04:56:40.040 --> 04:56:42.040
[Guest]: Earlier where for the longest time this person

04:56:42.040 --> 04:56:44.040
[Guest]: Wasn't speaking about it, the moment the internet

04:56:44.040 --> 04:56:46.040
[Guest]: Started incentivizing this

04:56:46.040 --> 04:56:48.040
[Guest]: Everyone says that

04:56:48.040 --> 04:56:50.040
[Guest]: We were always like this, we were always all hateful, I

04:56:50.040 --> 04:56:52.040
[Guest]: Don't agree, I

04:56:52.040 --> 04:56:54.040
[Guest]: Disagree very strongly

04:56:54.040 --> 04:56:56.040
[Guest]: We are not even

04:56:56.040 --> 04:56:58.040
[Guest]: Realizing how we are being gamed by

04:56:58.040 --> 04:57:00.040
[Guest]: Online system, when you go offline

04:57:00.040 --> 04:57:02.040
[Guest]: And you meet the same people in offline

04:57:02.040 --> 04:57:04.040
[Guest]: Settings, you could have the

04:57:04.040 --> 04:57:06.040
[Guest]: You can have the

04:57:06.040 --> 04:57:08.040
[Guest]: Absolute, and this happened in the second

04:57:08.040 --> 04:57:10.040
[Guest]: Roadshow for me, lot of kids who later would

04:57:10.040 --> 04:57:12.040
[Guest]: Troll me, I've met them offline

04:57:12.040 --> 04:57:14.040
[Guest]: They are the sweetest kids who have

04:57:14.040 --> 04:57:16.040
[Guest]: Genuine problems, and I don't hold it against

04:57:16.040 --> 04:57:18.040
[Guest]: Them, what their online identities have become

04:57:18.040 --> 04:57:20.040
[Guest]: Right now, and I know when I

04:57:20.040 --> 04:57:22.040
[Guest]: Go back and meet them the next time, they were still going to be

04:57:22.040 --> 04:57:24.040
[Guest]: Nice and kind to me, but on the internet

04:57:24.040 --> 04:57:26.040
[Guest]: They're incentivized to be

04:57:26.040 --> 04:57:28.040
[Guest]: You know, assholes

04:57:28.040 --> 04:57:30.040
[Guest]: Because, you know, the moment

04:57:30.040 --> 04:57:32.040
[Guest]: You do that, there are many other people

04:57:32.040 --> 04:57:34.040
[Guest]: Who laugh, who say ha ha ha

04:57:34.040 --> 04:57:36.040
[Guest]: Who might retweet, and then suddenly you realize

04:57:36.040 --> 04:57:38.040
[Guest]: This is my identity, I can, through this

04:57:38.040 --> 04:57:40.040
[Guest]: I can get more clout

04:57:40.040 --> 04:57:42.040
[Guest]: But ultimately it comes down to loneliness

04:57:42.040 --> 04:57:44.040
[Guest]: We are all extremely lonely

04:57:44.040 --> 04:57:46.040
[Guest]: Because of everything that's happening

04:57:46.040 --> 04:57:48.040
[Guest]: In our society, our country, our

04:57:48.040 --> 04:57:50.040
[Guest]: Gender, our, you know

04:57:50.040 --> 04:57:52.040
[Guest]: The narratives that we have been told

04:57:52.040 --> 04:57:54.040
[Guest]: And we are all trying to find ways

04:57:54.040 --> 04:57:56.040
[Guest]: Of feeling less alone

04:57:56.040 --> 04:57:58.040
[Guest]: And unfortunately

04:57:58.040 --> 04:58:00.040
[Guest]: The internet and social media has

04:58:00.040 --> 04:58:02.040
[Guest]: Incentivized

04:58:02.040 --> 04:58:04.040
[Guest]: Anger as the way to do that

04:58:04.040 --> 04:58:06.040
[Guest]: And find communities of anger

04:58:06.040 --> 04:58:08.040
[Guest]: That help you feel less alone

04:58:08.040 --> 04:58:10.040
[Guest]: And that toxicity

04:58:10.040 --> 04:58:12.040
[Guest]: Is now turning threatening

04:58:12.040 --> 04:58:14.040
[Guest]: And, you know, dividing countries, dividing

04:58:14.040 --> 04:58:16.040
[Guest]: Families, dividing people

04:58:16.040 --> 04:58:18.040
[Guest]: Apart, but I don't

04:58:18.040 --> 04:58:20.040
[Guest]: Because I have a little bit of self-awareness

04:58:20.040 --> 04:58:22.040
[Guest]: I'm still going to try

04:58:22.040 --> 04:58:24.040
[Guest]: And not judge the person who's

04:58:24.040 --> 04:58:26.040
[Guest]: Hating me, I'm not saying that

04:58:26.040 --> 04:58:28.040
[Guest]: I'm going to take that hit

04:58:28.040 --> 04:58:30.040
[Guest]: Because now after a lot of times, I mean for a very long time

04:58:30.040 --> 04:58:32.040
[Guest]: I was also trying to talk back

04:58:32.040 --> 04:58:34.040
[Guest]: But you realize the conditioning now has gone so

04:58:34.040 --> 04:58:36.040
[Guest]: Extreme, this

04:58:36.040 --> 04:58:38.040
[Guest]: Talking doesn't help at all, so now

04:58:38.040 --> 04:58:40.040
[Guest]: I restrict people, I don't want to block them

04:58:40.040 --> 04:58:42.040
[Guest]: Because again that gives them a certain satisfaction, they might

04:58:42.040 --> 04:58:44.040
[Guest]: Come back again, because that's also

04:58:44.040 --> 04:58:46.040
[Guest]: Incentivization, I got to this person

04:58:46.040 --> 04:58:48.040
[Guest]: So instead of blocking I might just restrict, the people might just

04:58:48.040 --> 04:58:50.040
[Guest]: Constantly keep commenting, I don't bother

04:58:50.040 --> 04:58:52.040
[Guest]: On that, I might mute

04:58:52.040 --> 04:58:54.040
[Guest]: People, I may not bother on that

04:58:54.040 --> 04:58:56.040
[Guest]: But I don't judge them and I don't look down

04:58:56.040 --> 04:58:58.040
[Guest]: On them, I just feel sad for

04:58:58.040 --> 04:59:00.040
[Guest]: You know, what is

04:59:00.040 --> 04:59:02.040
[Guest]: Our communities and what our society

04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Has become right now

04:59:04.040 --> 04:59:06.040
[Amit Varma]: So a few points I want to comment

04:59:06.040 --> 04:59:08.040
[Amit Varma]: On before my next question and one is

04:59:08.040 --> 04:59:10.040
[Amit Varma]: One thing that strikes me that you've said

04:59:10.040 --> 04:59:12.040
[Amit Varma]: That many feminist thinkers

04:59:12.040 --> 04:59:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Have said on the show before

04:59:14.040 --> 04:59:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Is the fact that women have the sisterhood

04:59:16.040 --> 04:59:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And men have nothing equivalent

04:59:18.040 --> 04:59:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Of that, so if

04:59:20.040 --> 04:59:22.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, so women can show solidarity

04:59:22.040 --> 04:59:24.040
[Amit Varma]: In different ways and find

04:59:24.040 --> 04:59:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Comfort in that, while men

04:59:26.040 --> 04:59:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Are essentially atomized and all

04:59:28.040 --> 04:59:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Alone and you know, so

04:59:30.040 --> 04:59:32.040
[Amit Varma]: What do you do, and as far as

04:59:32.040 --> 04:59:34.040
[Amit Varma]: This rudeness is concerned, like one of the

04:59:34.040 --> 04:59:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Things that astonishes me and I wonder

04:59:36.040 --> 04:59:38.040
[Amit Varma]: How people don't think about it a little bit more

04:59:38.040 --> 04:59:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Is that you are behaving

04:59:40.040 --> 04:59:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Constantly in ways that you would

04:59:42.040 --> 04:59:44.040
[Guest]: Never do offline, absolutely

04:59:44.040 --> 04:59:46.040
[Guest]: Absolutely, like for example

04:59:46.040 --> 04:59:48.040
[Amit Varma]: You and I could be at a party

04:59:48.040 --> 04:59:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And I could say something stupid

04:59:50.040 --> 04:59:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Right, but you are not going to call

04:59:52.040 --> 04:59:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Five other people and then point

04:59:54.040 --> 04:59:56.040
[Amit Varma]: To me and say that Amit just

04:59:56.040 --> 04:59:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Said and quote unquote and Amit is a

04:59:58.040 --> 05:00:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Moron and Amit is this

05:00:00.040 --> 05:00:02.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's a quote tweet

05:00:02.040 --> 05:00:04.040
[Amit Varma]: It just happens all

05:00:04.040 --> 05:00:06.040
[Amit Varma]: The freaking time and it just

05:00:06.040 --> 05:00:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Boggles my mind, I mean I block for rudeness

05:00:08.040 --> 05:00:10.040
[Amit Varma]: To matlab, if you've been rude to me

05:00:10.040 --> 05:00:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Or my friend or even a stranger, I see any

05:00:12.040 --> 05:00:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Rudeness, I just block

05:00:14.040 --> 05:00:16.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, there

05:00:16.040 --> 05:00:18.040
[Amit Varma]: For the grace of the flying spaghetti monster go I

05:00:18.040 --> 05:00:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Because you know

05:00:20.040 --> 05:00:22.040
[Amit Varma]: The incentives are like that, right

05:00:22.040 --> 05:00:24.040
[Amit Varma]: And I actually believe

05:00:24.040 --> 05:00:26.040
[Amit Varma]: That these are vocal minorities

05:00:26.040 --> 05:00:28.040
[Amit Varma]: That

05:00:28.040 --> 05:00:30.040
[Amit Varma]: There's a silent majority out there which is

05:00:30.040 --> 05:00:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Not like that, we just

05:00:32.040 --> 05:00:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Stay silent because why do you want to get into

05:00:34.040 --> 05:00:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Trouble, but which kind of stays

05:00:36.040 --> 05:00:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Chill and that kind of gives me hope

05:00:38.040 --> 05:00:40.040
[Amit Varma]: But my other question to you is about

05:00:40.040 --> 05:00:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Something that you've said in your talks and

05:00:42.040 --> 05:00:44.040
[Amit Varma]: That I want to explore one particular

05:00:44.040 --> 05:00:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Nuance of which is you've pointed

05:00:46.040 --> 05:00:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Out that what people in Gen Z

05:00:48.040 --> 05:00:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Have in common, all of them pretty much

05:00:50.040 --> 05:00:52.040
[Amit Varma]: The one thing they have in common is

05:00:52.040 --> 05:00:54.040
[Amit Varma]: That they're digital natives

05:00:54.040 --> 05:00:56.040
[Amit Varma]: But within that there's a further nuance

05:00:56.040 --> 05:00:58.040
[Amit Varma]: That they're digital natives

05:00:58.040 --> 05:01:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Divided into various tribes

05:01:00.040 --> 05:01:02.040
[Amit Varma]: By random algorithmic

05:01:02.040 --> 05:01:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Choices in the sense

05:01:04.040 --> 05:01:06.040
[Amit Varma]: That you imagine a 16 year old

05:01:06.040 --> 05:01:08.040
[Amit Varma]: First time he got a phone

05:01:08.040 --> 05:01:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Someone sends him a video of some

05:01:10.040 --> 05:01:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Conspiracy theory thing

05:01:12.040 --> 05:01:14.040
[Amit Varma]: And he watches that

05:01:14.040 --> 05:01:16.040
[Amit Varma]: All the recommendations will be based on that

05:01:16.040 --> 05:01:18.040
[Amit Varma]: Until he enters that and that is his

05:01:18.040 --> 05:01:20.040
[Amit Varma]: World and he knows no other world

05:01:20.040 --> 05:01:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And he thinks that everyone

05:01:22.040 --> 05:01:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Who is too liberal like you and me

05:01:24.040 --> 05:01:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Is evil, you know

05:01:26.040 --> 05:01:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Everyone who disagrees is either

05:01:28.040 --> 05:01:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Ignorant or they're plotting

05:01:30.040 --> 05:01:32.040
[Amit Varma]: They're anti-national

05:01:32.040 --> 05:01:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And you for no real fault

05:01:34.040 --> 05:01:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Of your own, you get trapped

05:01:36.040 --> 05:01:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Into these sort of

05:01:38.040 --> 05:01:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Into these bubbles, into these echo

05:01:40.040 --> 05:01:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Chambers and beyond

05:01:42.040 --> 05:01:44.040
[Amit Varma]: The point, it is not as if

05:01:44.040 --> 05:01:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Social media intended this

05:01:46.040 --> 05:01:48.040
[Amit Varma]: You are putting algorithms out

05:01:48.040 --> 05:01:50.040
[Amit Varma]: There to maximize engagement which is

05:01:50.040 --> 05:01:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Rational for them and somehow it has

05:01:52.040 --> 05:01:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Led us here, right

05:01:54.040 --> 05:01:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know what is

05:01:56.040 --> 05:01:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Your sense of this because

05:01:58.040 --> 05:02:00.040
[Amit Varma]: You've interacted

05:02:00.040 --> 05:02:02.040
[Amit Varma]: With so many young people like you just mentioned

05:02:02.040 --> 05:02:04.040
[Amit Varma]: You've interacted with people who

05:02:04.040 --> 05:02:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Were perfectly decent

05:02:06.040 --> 05:02:08.040
[Amit Varma]: And perfectly good and good human beings

05:02:08.040 --> 05:02:10.040
[Amit Varma]: You talk with stories when you meet them

05:02:10.040 --> 05:02:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And

05:02:12.040 --> 05:02:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Six months later they're part of this

05:02:14.040 --> 05:02:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Crazy tribe and then that makes you wonder

05:02:16.040 --> 05:02:18.040
[Amit Varma]: That is talking possible

05:02:18.040 --> 05:02:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Are we forever going to inhabit

05:02:20.040 --> 05:02:22.040
[Amit Varma]: This world full of narrative battles

05:02:22.040 --> 05:02:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Where we are always looking

05:02:24.040 --> 05:02:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Into our phone and fighting with someone

05:02:26.040 --> 05:02:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And giving in to the ugliness

05:02:28.040 --> 05:02:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Or have you also seen

05:02:30.040 --> 05:02:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Signs of movement the other way

05:02:32.040 --> 05:02:34.040
[Amit Varma]: That talking can help, that interacting

05:02:34.040 --> 05:02:36.040
[Guest]: In the concrete can help

05:02:36.040 --> 05:02:38.040
[Guest]: This is a great question

05:02:38.040 --> 05:02:40.040
[Guest]: For me to talk about a few stories

05:02:40.040 --> 05:02:42.040
[Guest]: From the roadshow and I'll tell you how

05:02:42.040 --> 05:02:44.040
[Guest]: Stories have

05:02:44.040 --> 05:02:46.040
[Guest]: So there's and I'm sure that he's also going to listen

05:02:46.040 --> 05:02:48.040
[Guest]: To this podcast because he listens to

05:02:48.040 --> 05:02:50.040
[Guest]: Everything that I kind

05:02:50.040 --> 05:02:52.040
[Guest]: Of speak on

05:02:52.040 --> 05:02:54.040
[Guest]: So there's this kid I met

05:02:54.040 --> 05:02:56.040
[Guest]: In a college in Gujarat

05:02:56.040 --> 05:02:58.040
[Guest]: On day one of

05:02:58.040 --> 05:03:00.040
[Guest]: This is the day one of the roadshow because we've not had

05:03:00.040 --> 05:03:02.040
[Guest]: Anything

05:03:02.040 --> 05:03:04.040
[Guest]: I spoke about labels, I spoke about

05:03:04.040 --> 05:03:06.040
[Guest]: And it was just

05:03:06.040 --> 05:03:08.040
[Guest]: It was one of those times where you know

05:03:08.040 --> 05:03:10.040
[Guest]: So it was the first college and like

05:03:10.040 --> 05:03:12.040
[Guest]: Just things had gone amiss in the

05:03:12.040 --> 05:03:14.040
[Guest]: Communication, first ever roadshow

05:03:14.040 --> 05:03:16.040
[Guest]: You guys, zero followers

05:03:16.040 --> 05:03:18.040
[Guest]: On Instagram at this point, our idea was

05:03:18.040 --> 05:03:20.040
[Guest]: On the roadshow we will start Instagram

05:03:20.040 --> 05:03:22.040
[Guest]: And get people to follow us

05:03:22.040 --> 05:03:24.040
[Guest]: So no one knows what

05:03:24.040 --> 05:03:26.040
[Guest]: This is, people don't have that context of me

05:03:26.040 --> 05:03:28.040
[Guest]: Also but whatever, I go and

05:03:28.040 --> 05:03:30.040
[Guest]: Because of one miscommunication no one

05:03:30.040 --> 05:03:32.040
[Guest]: Turns up in the first college, it's just like

05:03:32.040 --> 05:03:34.040
[Guest]: There were six kids who stay back to be like

05:03:34.040 --> 05:03:36.040
[Guest]: Okay, you know

05:03:36.040 --> 05:03:38.040
[Guest]: The committee that was supposed to

05:03:38.040 --> 05:03:40.040
[Guest]: Have other people, so they're like

05:03:40.040 --> 05:03:42.040
[Guest]: They left but we will listen to you

05:03:42.040 --> 05:03:44.040
[Guest]: Six people, so

05:03:44.040 --> 05:03:46.040
[Guest]: I said okay, there are six people so I'll talk to them

05:03:46.040 --> 05:03:48.040
[Guest]: I talked for an hour

05:03:48.040 --> 05:03:50.040
[Guest]: Then I said now I want to hear you and one of

05:03:50.040 --> 05:03:52.040
[Guest]: One of the boys and this boy is like this tall

05:03:52.040 --> 05:03:54.040
[Guest]: Kid wearing a biker jacket

05:03:54.040 --> 05:03:56.040
[Guest]: Who starts crying

05:03:56.040 --> 05:03:58.040
[Guest]: Now there is everybody

05:03:58.040 --> 05:04:00.040
[Guest]: Looking at him

05:04:00.040 --> 05:04:02.040
[Guest]: And staring at him

05:04:02.040 --> 05:04:04.040
[Guest]: And they're staring in almost like

05:04:04.040 --> 05:04:06.040
[Guest]: Disbelief, it's not like

05:04:06.040 --> 05:04:08.040
[Guest]: And I'm like, you're his friends

05:04:08.040 --> 05:04:10.040
[Guest]: You know

05:04:10.040 --> 05:04:12.040
[Guest]: At least give him a hug or support

05:04:12.040 --> 05:04:14.040
[Guest]: I can see that they're a bit wary of doing that

05:04:14.040 --> 05:04:16.040
[Guest]: So then

05:04:16.040 --> 05:04:18.040
[Guest]: I asked this kid

05:04:18.040 --> 05:04:20.040
[Guest]: Why are you crying?

05:04:20.040 --> 05:04:22.040
[Guest]: You know, would you like to share?

05:04:22.040 --> 05:04:24.040
[Guest]: And this

05:04:24.040 --> 05:04:26.040
[Guest]: Boy says that

05:04:26.040 --> 05:04:28.040
[Guest]: You know you were right about labels

05:04:28.040 --> 05:04:30.040
[Guest]: There is a label that I have

05:04:30.040 --> 05:04:32.040
[Guest]: That I've given myself

05:04:32.040 --> 05:04:34.040
[Guest]: And the world has given me

05:04:34.040 --> 05:04:36.040
[Guest]: But I want to tell I'm not that label

05:04:36.040 --> 05:04:38.040
[Guest]: I'm beyond that

05:04:38.040 --> 05:04:40.040
[Guest]: It's like what is this label?

05:04:40.040 --> 05:04:42.040
[Guest]: It's a label of a bully

05:04:42.040 --> 05:04:44.040
[Guest]: And I said okay, go on

05:04:44.040 --> 05:04:46.040
[Guest]: He's like, well I bully people

05:04:46.040 --> 05:04:48.040
[Guest]: I've bullied my friends

05:04:48.040 --> 05:04:50.040
[Guest]: That's why they're not coming to me because they know I bully

05:04:50.040 --> 05:04:52.040
[Guest]: You know, I bully my juniors

05:04:52.040 --> 05:04:54.040
[Guest]: But I want you to know that I'm not a bad person

05:04:54.040 --> 05:04:56.040
[Guest]: I'm like

05:04:56.040 --> 05:04:58.040
[Guest]: You know, I understand, I get it

05:04:58.040 --> 05:05:00.040
[Guest]: You know, and you don't have to tell me

05:05:00.040 --> 05:05:02.040
[Guest]: But if you know this, why do you bully?

05:05:02.040 --> 05:05:04.040
[Guest]: And then he said his story

05:05:04.040 --> 05:05:06.040
[Guest]: And it's just a bit of a trigger warning here

05:05:06.040 --> 05:05:08.040
[Guest]: You know, that it is

05:05:10.040 --> 05:05:12.040
[Guest]: Not something that everyone

05:05:12.040 --> 05:05:14.040
[Guest]: It'll be tough for some people to listen

05:05:14.040 --> 05:05:16.040
[Guest]: So he tells me his story and he tells me that

05:05:16.040 --> 05:05:18.040
[Guest]: About 8-9 years ago

05:05:18.040 --> 05:05:20.040
[Guest]: When he was younger as a kid

05:05:22.040 --> 05:05:24.040
[Guest]: He was molested by one of his father's

05:05:24.040 --> 05:05:26.040
[Guest]: Closest friends

05:05:28.040 --> 05:05:30.040
[Guest]: And because he was a boy

05:05:30.040 --> 05:05:32.040
[Guest]: He was just

05:05:32.040 --> 05:05:34.040
[Guest]: Like, how can I ever tell

05:05:34.040 --> 05:05:36.040
[Guest]: Anybody about this

05:05:36.040 --> 05:05:38.040
[Guest]: You know, and he's like

05:05:38.040 --> 05:05:40.040
[Guest]: Also this

05:05:40.040 --> 05:05:42.040
[Guest]: Man who was close to his father

05:05:42.040 --> 05:05:44.040
[Guest]: And he just didn't want to

05:05:44.040 --> 05:05:46.040
[Guest]: Want to tell, to disappoint

05:05:46.040 --> 05:05:48.040
[Guest]: His father or let him down

05:05:48.040 --> 05:05:50.040
[Guest]: So he just kept it inside, he didn't say to

05:05:50.040 --> 05:05:52.040
[Guest]: Anyone

05:05:52.040 --> 05:05:54.040
[Guest]: And he's like

05:05:54.040 --> 05:05:56.040
[Guest]: And that thing kept building in me

05:05:56.040 --> 05:05:58.040
[Guest]: And I got

05:05:58.040 --> 05:06:00.040
[Guest]: I was so ashamed of

05:06:00.040 --> 05:06:02.040
[Guest]: What I went through

05:06:02.040 --> 05:06:04.040
[Guest]: And what I allowed to happen to me

05:06:04.040 --> 05:06:06.040
[Guest]: That I realized that before

05:06:06.040 --> 05:06:08.040
[Guest]: Anybody can hurt me now, I will hurt them

05:06:08.040 --> 05:06:10.040
[Guest]: So I became a bully

05:06:10.040 --> 05:06:12.040
[Guest]: That if you can't touch me

05:06:12.040 --> 05:06:14.040
[Guest]: Because much before that

05:06:14.040 --> 05:06:16.040
[Guest]: I will screw you up

05:06:16.040 --> 05:06:18.040
[Guest]: And I constructed an identity around that

05:06:18.040 --> 05:06:20.040
[Guest]: And now that you've told me your story

05:06:20.040 --> 05:06:22.040
[Guest]: This is the first time

05:06:22.040 --> 05:06:24.040
[Guest]: I have ever told this to anybody

05:06:24.040 --> 05:06:26.040
[Guest]: And this is something I've heard a lot in the roadshow

05:06:26.040 --> 05:06:28.040
[Guest]: This is the first time I'm saying this

05:06:28.040 --> 05:06:30.040
[Guest]: To you or anybody

05:06:30.040 --> 05:06:32.040
[Guest]: So, I mean, I don't know what I want to do

05:06:32.040 --> 05:06:34.040
[Guest]: As like

05:06:34.040 --> 05:06:36.040
[Guest]: I think first of all professional help

05:06:36.040 --> 05:06:38.040
[Guest]: I talked about therapies, about professional help

05:06:38.040 --> 05:06:40.040
[Guest]: Counseling, etc, etc, but I said you should also

05:06:40.040 --> 05:06:42.040
[Guest]: At some point tell your parents whenever you're ready

05:06:42.040 --> 05:06:44.040
[Guest]: Because it clearly seems like you have

05:06:44.040 --> 05:06:46.040
[Guest]: This inside of you, you know

05:06:46.040 --> 05:06:48.040
[Guest]: And he's like

05:06:48.040 --> 05:06:50.040
[Guest]: Well, I'm ready now. I think I've said this

05:06:50.040 --> 05:06:52.040
[Guest]: Now so I feel better. I said, okay, great

05:06:52.040 --> 05:06:54.040
[Guest]: Whenever you want to go and tell your parents, do tell it

05:06:54.040 --> 05:06:56.040
[Guest]: He's like, yeah, that makes sense. He's like

05:06:56.040 --> 05:06:58.040
[Guest]: So can I go now? I said

05:06:58.040 --> 05:07:00.040
[Guest]: You want to go and tell now? He said, yeah, can I go now?

05:07:00.040 --> 05:07:02.040
[Guest]: I said, yeah, man, go for it, you know

05:07:02.040 --> 05:07:04.040
[Guest]: And then I was like

05:07:04.040 --> 05:07:06.040
[Guest]: Can I give you a hug? He says, yeah, of course

05:07:06.040 --> 05:07:08.040
[Guest]: You know, and I gave him a hug and I said

05:07:08.040 --> 05:07:10.040
[Guest]: Best of luck and just tell me, you know

05:07:10.040 --> 05:07:12.040
[Guest]: What happens at the end of this

05:07:12.040 --> 05:07:14.040
[Guest]: And this is my

05:07:14.040 --> 05:07:16.040
[Guest]: Instagram DM, etc

05:07:16.040 --> 05:07:18.040
[Guest]: And the night I got this message from him

05:07:18.040 --> 05:07:20.040
[Guest]: Day one of the road trip and that's when we know that

05:07:20.040 --> 05:07:22.040
[Guest]: What we were doing was worth it

05:07:22.040 --> 05:07:24.040
[Guest]: He sent me this beautiful message

05:07:24.040 --> 05:07:26.040
[Guest]: Where he said that

05:07:26.040 --> 05:07:28.040
[Guest]: Thanks Nikhil, I finally told

05:07:28.040 --> 05:07:30.040
[Guest]: My parents what I have inside for the last

05:07:30.040 --> 05:07:32.040
[Guest]: Eight years and they told me

05:07:32.040 --> 05:07:34.040
[Guest]: The words that I've been waiting to hear from them

05:07:34.040 --> 05:07:36.040
[Guest]: All my life, I think and the words

05:07:36.040 --> 05:07:38.040
[Guest]: Were it's not your fault

05:07:38.040 --> 05:07:40.040
[Guest]: And just hearing his parents

05:07:40.040 --> 05:07:42.040
[Guest]: Tell him that it's not his fault

05:07:42.040 --> 05:07:44.040
[Guest]: It was just something

05:07:44.040 --> 05:07:46.040
[Guest]: That

05:07:46.040 --> 05:07:48.040
[Guest]: Stayed with him

05:07:48.040 --> 05:07:50.040
[Guest]: Now this kid now said that

05:07:50.040 --> 05:07:52.040
[Guest]: I

05:07:52.040 --> 05:07:54.040
[Guest]: Sent me a message another one day later

05:07:54.040 --> 05:07:56.040
[Guest]: And said, I also want to tell you

05:07:56.040 --> 05:07:58.040
[Guest]: That when you gave me a hug the other day

05:07:58.040 --> 05:08:00.040
[Guest]: That's the first time anyone's ever hugged me

05:08:00.040 --> 05:08:02.040
[Guest]: No one's ever hugged me before

05:08:02.040 --> 05:08:04.040
[Guest]: So I just want to say

05:08:04.040 --> 05:08:06.040
[Guest]: Thank you for that, you know

05:08:06.040 --> 05:08:08.040
[Guest]: And I'd also said in a post after that

05:08:08.040 --> 05:08:10.040
[Guest]: Like, you know, love him, love you

05:08:10.040 --> 05:08:12.040
[Guest]: It's like no one's even said that to me, it's like

05:08:12.040 --> 05:08:14.040
[Guest]: Thank you for this, so thank you, etc, etc

05:08:14.040 --> 05:08:16.040
[Guest]: And I was just like man, this is insane

05:08:16.040 --> 05:08:18.040
[Guest]: So I kept in touch with this kid, you know

05:08:18.040 --> 05:08:20.040
[Guest]: I was curious about his life, etc

05:08:20.040 --> 05:08:22.040
[Guest]: Now this boy at this time was doing engineering

05:08:22.040 --> 05:08:24.040
[Guest]: In a college

05:08:24.040 --> 05:08:26.040
[Guest]: And after this incident

05:08:26.040 --> 05:08:28.040
[Guest]: He was so like

05:08:28.040 --> 05:08:30.040
[Guest]: Curious about why he behaved the way he behaved

05:08:30.040 --> 05:08:32.040
[Guest]: And I spoke about gender, he's like

05:08:32.040 --> 05:08:34.040
[Guest]: He would keep in touch with me, he's like

05:08:34.040 --> 05:08:36.040
[Guest]: I don't think I want to, you know, now

05:08:36.040 --> 05:08:38.040
[Guest]: Do engineering anymore, I want to

05:08:38.040 --> 05:08:40.040
[Guest]: Like, I want to find out why I was the way I was

05:08:40.040 --> 05:08:42.040
[Guest]: And he's like I want to get

05:08:42.040 --> 05:08:44.040
[Guest]: Into sociology, I was like

05:08:44.040 --> 05:08:46.040
[Guest]: Okay, you know, so he's like what do you think I should do

05:08:46.040 --> 05:08:48.040
[Guest]: I was like you should do what your heart says

05:08:48.040 --> 05:08:50.040
[Guest]: And this boy after that, after finishing engineering

05:08:50.040 --> 05:08:52.040
[Guest]: In this college, you know, in the pandemic

05:08:52.040 --> 05:08:54.040
[Guest]: Studied for, you know, and got

05:08:54.040 --> 05:08:56.040
[Guest]: Into JNU, you know

05:08:56.040 --> 05:08:58.040
[Guest]: And his whole life has

05:08:58.040 --> 05:09:00.040
[Guest]: Gone the other way, and he's studying

05:09:00.040 --> 05:09:02.040
[Guest]: Gender studies over there, because he wants

05:09:02.040 --> 05:09:04.040
[Guest]: To now, you know, figure

05:09:04.040 --> 05:09:06.040
[Guest]: Why did he go through everything

05:09:06.040 --> 05:09:08.040
[Guest]: He went through, and there was a whole story

05:09:08.040 --> 05:09:10.040
[Guest]: About his mother and his relationship

05:09:10.040 --> 05:09:12.040
[Guest]: And how it changed after that, you know

05:09:12.040 --> 05:09:14.040
[Guest]: And it's, and I kept in touch with him

05:09:14.040 --> 05:09:16.040
[Guest]: I'm still in touch with him, he's very very dear to me now

05:09:16.040 --> 05:09:18.040
[Guest]: And this is a boy

05:09:18.040 --> 05:09:20.040
[Guest]: Who, so on the same night

05:09:20.040 --> 05:09:22.040
[Guest]: You know, this was in a college, we did

05:09:22.040 --> 05:09:24.040
[Guest]: These open mics, so at, you are

05:09:24.040 --> 05:09:26.040
[Guest]: With the roadshow, so we would go to colleges and do this

05:09:26.040 --> 05:09:28.040
[Guest]: And then we'd also say, if somebody is afraid of

05:09:28.040 --> 05:09:30.040
[Guest]: In front of a student crowd

05:09:30.040 --> 05:09:32.040
[Guest]: Talk about your feelings, we are also doing these open mics

05:09:32.040 --> 05:09:34.040
[Guest]: These open mics are storytelling open mics

05:09:34.040 --> 05:09:36.040
[Guest]: They're not talent open mics

05:09:36.040 --> 05:09:38.040
[Guest]: So if you have a story, and there's nobody who has

05:09:38.040 --> 05:09:40.040
[Guest]: Heard it, come and share it, it was as simple as that

05:09:40.040 --> 05:09:42.040
[Guest]: So he came to a

05:09:42.040 --> 05:09:44.040
[Guest]: Open mic that day, I'm going to tell the second

05:09:44.040 --> 05:09:46.040
[Guest]: Story in a bit, but there was a second story

05:09:46.040 --> 05:09:48.040
[Guest]: Of a young boy who spoke about

05:09:48.040 --> 05:09:50.040
[Guest]: Being homosexual

05:09:50.040 --> 05:09:52.040
[Guest]: And bisexual, and

05:09:52.040 --> 05:09:54.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, what he went through because of that

05:09:54.040 --> 05:09:56.040
[Amit Varma]: This is Mohit

05:09:56.040 --> 05:09:58.040
[Guest]: Yeah, so at the end of it

05:09:58.040 --> 05:10:00.040
[Guest]: This boy goes up

05:10:00.040 --> 05:10:02.040
[Guest]: To Mohit, and tells him

05:10:02.040 --> 05:10:04.040
[Guest]: And I heard this, and I was not even

05:10:04.040 --> 05:10:06.040
[Guest]: Like, it just happened in my vicinity

05:10:06.040 --> 05:10:08.040
[Guest]: And I was just like, what is happening, so sweet

05:10:08.040 --> 05:10:10.040
[Guest]: He's like, Mohit, I just want to say that

05:10:10.040 --> 05:10:12.040
[Guest]: I've been homophobic before this

05:10:12.040 --> 05:10:14.040
[Guest]: But after hearing your story today

05:10:14.040 --> 05:10:16.040
[Guest]: I just want to have a chat with you

05:10:16.040 --> 05:10:18.040
[Guest]: Like over a cup of tea, you know, I just want to

05:10:18.040 --> 05:10:20.040
[Guest]: Hear more about your life and everything

05:10:20.040 --> 05:10:22.040
[Guest]: Is it okay if we chat?

05:10:22.040 --> 05:10:24.040
[Guest]: And he's like, yeah, I'll take your number, thank you for saying that, etc

05:10:24.040 --> 05:10:26.040
[Guest]: And he's like

05:10:26.040 --> 05:10:28.040
[Guest]: This one

05:10:28.040 --> 05:10:30.040
[Guest]: Conversation

05:10:30.040 --> 05:10:32.040
[Guest]: One conversation Amit has led into

05:10:32.040 --> 05:10:34.040
[Guest]: This boy's entire life

05:10:34.040 --> 05:10:36.040
[Guest]: You know, turning into empathy

05:10:36.040 --> 05:10:38.040
[Guest]: It's not that it's been easy, he's been very angry

05:10:38.040 --> 05:10:40.040
[Guest]: In the middle about what has happened

05:10:40.040 --> 05:10:42.040
[Guest]: And I've chatted with him through this, etc, etc

05:10:42.040 --> 05:10:44.040
[Guest]: But he's

05:10:44.040 --> 05:10:46.040
[Guest]: He put up the first

05:10:46.040 --> 05:10:48.040
[Guest]: His first Instagram post on that

05:10:48.040 --> 05:10:50.040
[Guest]: Day ever, where he wrote a poem

05:10:50.040 --> 05:10:52.040
[Guest]: And he wrote a poem about the fact

05:10:52.040 --> 05:10:54.040
[Guest]: That, you know, like

05:10:54.040 --> 05:10:56.040
[Guest]: Today I had

05:10:56.040 --> 05:10:58.040
[Guest]: This is a beautiful day, and today

05:10:58.040 --> 05:11:00.040
[Guest]: Because I was able to

05:11:00.040 --> 05:11:02.040
[Guest]: You know, go beyond my label and find out

05:11:02.040 --> 05:11:04.040
[Guest]: My story, you know, and

05:11:04.040 --> 05:11:06.040
[Guest]: And that's the potential

05:11:06.040 --> 05:11:08.040
[Guest]: Of storytelling, I'll tell you

05:11:08.040 --> 05:11:10.040
[Guest]: Mohit's story because for the people

05:11:10.040 --> 05:11:12.040
[Guest]: Which is a story which has also again

05:11:12.040 --> 05:11:14.040
[Guest]: Happened over 2-3 years, you know, and because

05:11:14.040 --> 05:11:16.040
[Guest]: I've kept in touch with these kids, Mohit came

05:11:16.040 --> 05:11:18.040
[Guest]: On the, you know, and I can take his

05:11:18.040 --> 05:11:20.040
[Guest]: Name because his story is also out there, so we would record

05:11:20.040 --> 05:11:22.040
[Guest]: These stories, ask in the open mics, you know

05:11:22.040 --> 05:11:24.040
[Guest]: We would say that if you're comfortable, we'll put it up

05:11:24.040 --> 05:11:26.040
[Guest]: And we take their consent again, just for everyone to know

05:11:26.040 --> 05:11:28.040
[Guest]: Not only on that day, but on the day

05:11:28.040 --> 05:11:30.040
[Guest]: Of uploading it, before we upload it, we would

05:11:30.040 --> 05:11:32.040
[Guest]: Take their consent and say, can you put the story up?

05:11:32.040 --> 05:11:34.040
[Guest]: Are you comfortable with that? Until they gave a go-ahead

05:11:34.040 --> 05:11:36.040
[Guest]: We would not put it up, and

05:11:36.040 --> 05:11:38.040
[Guest]: Only 2 people overall in our entire

05:11:38.040 --> 05:11:40.040
[Guest]: Roadshow have said no, everybody has said yes

05:11:40.040 --> 05:11:42.040
[Guest]: Because that's also power, I think, to be able

05:11:42.040 --> 05:11:44.040
[Guest]: To express, and it's a catharsis, and it's a

05:11:44.040 --> 05:11:46.040
[Guest]: Owning your story is a very important

05:11:46.040 --> 05:11:48.040
[Guest]: Thing, so

05:11:48.040 --> 05:11:50.040
[Guest]: Mohit's story was, he came and said

05:11:50.040 --> 05:11:52.040
[Guest]: Really sweet boy, 18 year old

05:11:52.040 --> 05:11:54.040
[Guest]: Came to the open mic, and he was

05:11:54.040 --> 05:11:56.040
[Guest]: Trembling, you know, and he first started reading

05:11:56.040 --> 05:11:58.040
[Guest]: A poem, and

05:11:58.040 --> 05:12:00.040
[Guest]: The poem was about bisexuality, so in the

05:12:00.040 --> 05:12:02.040
[Guest]: Middle of the poem, he just stops and says, I don't know

05:12:02.040 --> 05:12:04.040
[Guest]: If anybody caught that, but I'm bisexual

05:12:04.040 --> 05:12:06.040
[Guest]: And that's the poem, so we cheered for him

05:12:06.040 --> 05:12:08.040
[Guest]: He immediately said, woohoo

05:12:08.040 --> 05:12:10.040
[Guest]: And Mohit was

05:12:10.040 --> 05:12:12.040
[Guest]: Suddenly very surprised, he's like, wait, what?

05:12:14.040 --> 05:12:16.040
[Guest]: You know, and

05:12:16.040 --> 05:12:18.040
[Guest]: He's like, nobody has ever cheered for me before

05:12:18.040 --> 05:12:20.040
[Guest]: It's only been one friend, and now

05:12:20.040 --> 05:12:22.040
[Guest]: Second time this, can I please tell you all

05:12:22.040 --> 05:12:24.040
[Guest]: My story, and he's like, yeah, that's what we're here for

05:12:24.040 --> 05:12:26.040
[Guest]: In this story, poor guy, was the fact

05:12:26.040 --> 05:12:28.040
[Guest]: That, you know, at

05:12:28.040 --> 05:12:30.040
[Guest]: 15 or 16, his friends had found out

05:12:30.040 --> 05:12:32.040
[Guest]: That he's bisexual, they had

05:12:32.040 --> 05:12:34.040
[Guest]: Told everybody else, he got flashed

05:12:34.040 --> 05:12:36.040
[Guest]: In school, people made fun of him

05:12:36.040 --> 05:12:38.040
[Guest]: They made, and the

05:12:38.040 --> 05:12:40.040
[Guest]: Word of mouth reached his parents

05:12:40.040 --> 05:12:42.040
[Guest]: His father thought that there's something, you know

05:12:42.040 --> 05:12:44.040
[Guest]: He needs to go to a

05:12:44.040 --> 05:12:46.040
[Guest]: Doctor and get it checked, the mother also was

05:12:46.040 --> 05:12:48.040
[Guest]: Not completely understanding of what has happened

05:12:48.040 --> 05:12:50.040
[Guest]: And at the end of it

05:12:50.040 --> 05:12:52.040
[Guest]: He's like

05:12:52.040 --> 05:12:54.040
[Guest]: I just had one friend who was there for me

05:12:54.040 --> 05:12:56.040
[Guest]: And that's enough sometimes

05:12:56.040 --> 05:12:58.040
[Guest]: So, I'm just glad that today

05:12:58.040 --> 05:13:00.040
[Guest]: I found a safe space where somebody else is

05:13:00.040 --> 05:13:02.040
[Guest]: Rooted for me, thank you for doing that

05:13:02.040 --> 05:13:04.040
[Guest]: He was staying away from his parents at this time, he's like

05:13:04.040 --> 05:13:06.040
[Guest]: I can't stay with them anymore because

05:13:06.040 --> 05:13:08.040
[Guest]: You know, they think I'm abnormal

05:13:08.040 --> 05:13:10.040
[Guest]: Now, what has happened

05:13:10.040 --> 05:13:12.040
[Guest]: After this, is that few

05:13:12.040 --> 05:13:14.040
[Guest]: Days later, we put his story on the internet, right

05:13:14.040 --> 05:13:16.040
[Guest]: Now, when we put his

05:13:16.040 --> 05:13:18.040
[Guest]: Story online, and we checked with him, he said, yeah, please

05:13:18.040 --> 05:13:20.040
[Guest]: Go for it, there was a lot

05:13:20.040 --> 05:13:22.040
[Guest]: Of love and affection that he started

05:13:22.040 --> 05:13:24.040
[Guest]: Receiving in his DMs, it was one of our first

05:13:24.040 --> 05:13:26.040
[Guest]: Viral stories at Yuva, he started

05:13:26.040 --> 05:13:28.040
[Guest]: A lot of people started reaching out, saying

05:13:28.040 --> 05:13:30.040
[Guest]: To him that, listen

05:13:30.040 --> 05:13:32.040
[Guest]: You know, you don't have to feel alone

05:13:32.040 --> 05:13:34.040
[Guest]: You don't have to have a friend, you know, we have a

05:13:34.040 --> 05:13:36.040
[Guest]: LGBTQ Gujarat community, why don't you

05:13:36.040 --> 05:13:38.040
[Guest]: Join that, and he's like, wow

05:13:38.040 --> 05:13:40.040
[Guest]: And then there were people who reached out saying like, listen, I don't

05:13:40.040 --> 05:13:42.040
[Guest]: Understand what LGBTQ is, but you're a very

05:13:42.040 --> 05:13:44.040
[Guest]: Sweet boy, he showed me those messages, he's like

05:13:44.040 --> 05:13:46.040
[Guest]: You're such a sweet kid, I want to, I'm here if you

05:13:46.040 --> 05:13:48.040
[Guest]: Ever want to talk, there are

05:13:48.040 --> 05:13:50.040
[Guest]: Boys who had bullied him, they reached out

05:13:50.040 --> 05:13:52.040
[Guest]: To him saying, I'm sorry, you know, that

05:13:52.040 --> 05:13:54.040
[Guest]: This has happened, now what he did next

05:13:54.040 --> 05:13:56.040
[Guest]: Is just incredible, okay

05:13:56.040 --> 05:13:58.040
[Guest]: This boy, after

05:13:58.040 --> 05:14:00.040
[Guest]: That, Amit, because his

05:14:00.040 --> 05:14:02.040
[Guest]: Parents had kicked him out of his house, saying

05:14:02.040 --> 05:14:04.040
[Guest]: And he, you know, spoke about this, my parents

05:14:04.040 --> 05:14:06.040
[Guest]: Would say that, what will people say

05:14:06.040 --> 05:14:08.040
[Guest]: Right, you know, what will society

05:14:08.040 --> 05:14:10.040
[Guest]: Say, so they kicked him out for that reason

05:14:10.040 --> 05:14:12.040
[Guest]: That you stay alone somewhere

05:14:12.040 --> 05:14:14.040
[Guest]: He's like

05:14:14.040 --> 05:14:16.040
[Guest]: He took a printout of all the

05:14:16.040 --> 05:14:18.040
[Guest]: Screenshots, all the DMs that he got

05:14:18.040 --> 05:14:20.040
[Guest]: Put them in a scrapbook, and he

05:14:20.040 --> 05:14:22.040
[Guest]: Went back home to his parents

05:14:22.040 --> 05:14:24.040
[Guest]: Showed it to his mother

05:14:24.040 --> 05:14:26.040
[Guest]: And said, people are saying this

05:14:26.040 --> 05:14:28.040
[Guest]: Now what will you say

05:14:28.040 --> 05:14:30.040
[Guest]: Look at what the

05:14:30.040 --> 05:14:32.040
[Guest]: What the entire world is saying

05:14:32.040 --> 05:14:34.040
[Guest]: They are supporting me, why don't you

05:14:34.040 --> 05:14:36.040
[Guest]: And he's like

05:14:36.040 --> 05:14:38.040
[Guest]: At that moment, he's like

05:14:38.040 --> 05:14:40.040
[Guest]: My mother held my hand

05:14:40.040 --> 05:14:42.040
[Guest]: For very long, went

05:14:42.040 --> 05:14:44.040
[Guest]: Through every

05:14:44.040 --> 05:14:46.040
[Guest]: Stage of the scrapbook

05:14:46.040 --> 05:14:48.040
[Guest]: And then said, I'm gonna try

05:14:48.040 --> 05:14:50.040
[Guest]: And then I met him later, and he said, you know what

05:14:50.040 --> 05:14:52.040
[Guest]: She's now moved in with me

05:14:52.040 --> 05:14:54.040
[Guest]: She's supporting me, and

05:14:54.040 --> 05:14:56.040
[Guest]: I'm still like, my father is still not there yet

05:14:56.040 --> 05:14:58.040
[Guest]: But

05:14:58.040 --> 05:15:00.040
[Guest]: You know, the wonders that

05:15:00.040 --> 05:15:02.040
[Guest]: This one story has done to his life

05:15:02.040 --> 05:15:04.040
[Guest]: You know, and he's come

05:15:04.040 --> 05:15:06.040
[Guest]: By the way, he came with a cake to Bombay to

05:15:06.040 --> 05:15:08.040
[Guest]: Give it to us, and he wrote this beautiful letter for us

05:15:08.040 --> 05:15:10.040
[Guest]: Saying that, because of that story, my mother

05:15:10.040 --> 05:15:12.040
[Guest]: Today is like my friend again

05:15:12.040 --> 05:15:14.040
[Guest]: So, that's the power of it

05:15:14.040 --> 05:15:16.040
[Guest]: That's the power, there is

05:15:16.040 --> 05:15:18.040
[Guest]: One last, there is this one, again, Sahil

05:15:18.040 --> 05:15:20.040
[Guest]: Who's become like a really

05:15:20.040 --> 05:15:22.040
[Guest]: Dear friend now, sweetest kid

05:15:22.040 --> 05:15:24.040
[Guest]: You know, from

05:15:24.040 --> 05:15:26.040
[Guest]: IIIT Chennai, you know

05:15:26.040 --> 05:15:28.040
[Guest]: I had done a storytelling, so IIIT Chennai

05:15:28.040 --> 05:15:30.040
[Guest]: Became somehow like one of those

05:15:30.040 --> 05:15:32.040
[Guest]: You know, you have those dream sessions with

05:15:32.040 --> 05:15:34.040
[Guest]: 150 kids, we sat from 7pm

05:15:34.040 --> 05:15:36.040
[Guest]: In the night to 3am in the morning

05:15:36.040 --> 05:15:38.040
[Guest]: Every person spoke, I'm not joking

05:15:38.040 --> 05:15:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Every one of those 150 kids spoke that day

05:15:40.040 --> 05:15:42.040
[Amit Varma]: It was like a scene on the unseen recording

05:15:42.040 --> 05:15:44.040
[Guest]: It was insane, and at the end of it

05:15:44.040 --> 05:15:46.040
[Guest]: Right, so

05:15:46.040 --> 05:15:48.040
[Guest]: One year later, I went back

05:15:48.040 --> 05:15:50.040
[Guest]: Now, this kid came to me, Sahil

05:15:50.040 --> 05:15:52.040
[Guest]: And said that after that class, you know

05:15:52.040 --> 05:15:54.040
[Guest]: After every of these classes, there's a lot of

05:15:54.040 --> 05:15:56.040
[Guest]: Empathy, all these people, you know, start

05:15:56.040 --> 05:15:58.040
[Guest]: Again, hugs, catharsis

05:15:58.040 --> 05:16:00.040
[Guest]: Beautiful, he's like between the time that

05:16:00.040 --> 05:16:02.040
[Guest]: Had happened and this time, you know

05:16:02.040 --> 05:16:04.040
[Guest]: Unfortunately

05:16:04.040 --> 05:16:06.040
[Guest]: One of the kids

05:16:06.040 --> 05:16:08.040
[Guest]: You know, he's from Maharashtra

05:16:08.040 --> 05:16:10.040
[Guest]: And one of the other kids from Maharashtra

05:16:10.040 --> 05:16:12.040
[Guest]: Had passed away, because he drowned

05:16:12.040 --> 05:16:14.040
[Guest]: In, I think that's what it was, he drowned

05:16:14.040 --> 05:16:16.040
[Guest]: In a river nearby

05:16:16.040 --> 05:16:18.040
[Guest]: And he's like, none of us

05:16:18.040 --> 05:16:20.040
[Guest]: Just knew how to process this

05:16:20.040 --> 05:16:22.040
[Guest]: We were all kids from Maharashtra

05:16:22.040 --> 05:16:24.040
[Guest]: We used to have our own group

05:16:24.040 --> 05:16:26.040
[Guest]: And then just we stopped talking

05:16:26.040 --> 05:16:28.040
[Guest]: Because we were just sad

05:16:28.040 --> 05:16:30.040
[Guest]: And we didn't know how to process

05:16:30.040 --> 05:16:32.040
[Guest]: He's like, and then I remembered what happened

05:16:32.040 --> 05:16:34.040
[Guest]: In the day that we did that storytelling

05:16:34.040 --> 05:16:36.040
[Guest]: Thing in IIIT

05:16:36.040 --> 05:16:38.040
[Guest]: And he's like, I realized that maybe we need to

05:16:38.040 --> 05:16:40.040
[Guest]: Create a safe space, so he said

05:16:40.040 --> 05:16:42.040
[Guest]: That I created this

05:16:42.040 --> 05:16:44.040
[Guest]: Club name called

05:16:44.040 --> 05:16:46.040
[Guest]: Marathi Mitra Mandir

05:16:46.040 --> 05:16:48.040
[Guest]: And he's like, I would just tell everybody

05:16:48.040 --> 05:16:50.040
[Guest]: That we are part of the Marathi Mitra Mandir

05:16:50.040 --> 05:16:52.040
[Guest]: And we'll meet every night

05:16:52.040 --> 05:16:54.040
[Guest]: Just to share with us

05:16:54.040 --> 05:16:56.040
[Guest]: Just like we've done on the Rewa Rosh

05:16:56.040 --> 05:16:58.040
[Guest]: And he's like, when I did it in that way

05:16:58.040 --> 05:17:00.040
[Guest]: Suddenly every night

05:17:00.040 --> 05:17:02.040
[Guest]: All these kids who are telling them, let's talk

05:17:02.040 --> 05:17:04.040
[Guest]: And let's talk about how we're going through an express

05:17:04.040 --> 05:17:06.040
[Guest]: Would never do it

05:17:06.040 --> 05:17:08.040
[Guest]: All of these boys came and

05:17:08.040 --> 05:17:10.040
[Guest]: Started expressing and started

05:17:10.040 --> 05:17:12.040
[Guest]: Crying and started speaking

05:17:12.040 --> 05:17:14.040
[Guest]: Like about what happened

05:17:14.040 --> 05:17:16.040
[Guest]: And he's like, we were all able to process because of that

05:17:16.040 --> 05:17:18.040
[Guest]: One little thing that happened

05:17:18.040 --> 05:17:20.040
[Guest]: And there are

05:17:20.040 --> 05:17:22.040
[Guest]: So many more stories like this

05:17:22.040 --> 05:17:24.040
[Guest]: So so so many stories like this that

05:17:24.040 --> 05:17:26.040
[Guest]: I've heard across this and it's not just the stories

05:17:26.040 --> 05:17:28.040
[Guest]: Of what has happened on the road show

05:17:28.040 --> 05:17:30.040
[Guest]: But the stories of what has happened beyond

05:17:30.040 --> 05:17:32.040
[Guest]: And the stories of like when I would go

05:17:32.040 --> 05:17:34.040
[Guest]: Back or when I would hear from these kids again

05:17:34.040 --> 05:17:36.040
[Guest]: About all the wonderful

05:17:36.040 --> 05:17:38.040
[Guest]: Wonderful things in the way in which they have

05:17:38.040 --> 05:17:40.040
[Guest]: Used these safe spaces

05:17:40.040 --> 05:17:42.040
[Guest]: In the way that they become more empathetic

05:17:42.040 --> 05:17:44.040
[Guest]: In the way that they have created

05:17:44.040 --> 05:17:46.040
[Guest]: Safe spaces for others who have

05:17:46.040 --> 05:17:48.040
[Guest]: Passed it on, you know, if

05:17:48.040 --> 05:17:50.040
[Guest]: Anger begets anger, kindness begets

05:17:50.040 --> 05:17:52.040
[Guest]: Kindness, if

05:17:52.040 --> 05:17:54.040
[Guest]: Toxicity can grow, so can kindness

05:17:54.040 --> 05:17:56.040
[Guest]: You just need to

05:17:56.040 --> 05:17:58.040
[Guest]: You know, start that

05:17:58.040 --> 05:18:00.040
[Guest]: Start by listening, you start by

05:18:00.040 --> 05:18:02.040
[Guest]: Sharing, you start by

05:18:02.040 --> 05:18:04.040
[Guest]: Creating a safe space for someone else

05:18:04.040 --> 05:18:06.040
[Guest]: And someone will do the same for you

05:18:06.040 --> 05:18:08.040
[Guest]: I can promise that because that's really

05:18:08.040 --> 05:18:10.040
[Guest]: What I've seen, not just from the road show but from

05:18:10.040 --> 05:18:12.040
[Guest]: Everywhere else, the amount of

05:18:12.040 --> 05:18:14.040
[Guest]: You know, when the, when I spoke about

05:18:14.040 --> 05:18:16.040
[Guest]: My story of anxiety, you know, online

05:18:18.040 --> 05:18:20.040
[Guest]: I could not have, it was

05:18:20.040 --> 05:18:22.040
[Guest]: I was so nervous, I remember like I never

05:18:22.040 --> 05:18:24.040
[Guest]: And I got strength from my students because my students

05:18:24.040 --> 05:18:26.040
[Guest]: Said, would always talk about their stories

05:18:26.040 --> 05:18:28.040
[Guest]: I was like, man, maybe I should also share mine

05:18:28.040 --> 05:18:30.040
[Guest]: Because I've been going through

05:18:30.040 --> 05:18:32.040
[Guest]: Anxiety for the last

05:18:32.040 --> 05:18:34.040
[Guest]: 10-11 months at that time

05:18:34.040 --> 05:18:36.040
[Guest]: And all my social media posts show me

05:18:36.040 --> 05:18:38.040
[Guest]: As like this, like I'm happy, I'm

05:18:38.040 --> 05:18:40.040
[Guest]: Enjoying, my life is great

05:18:40.040 --> 05:18:42.040
[Guest]: How can I not

05:18:42.040 --> 05:18:44.040
[Guest]: I think I owe it to my students

05:18:44.040 --> 05:18:46.040
[Guest]: To talk about my truth as well

05:18:46.040 --> 05:18:48.040
[Guest]: So I wrote this long post

05:18:48.040 --> 05:18:50.040
[Guest]: Closed my eyes, published it, put it

05:18:50.040 --> 05:18:52.040
[Guest]: On Twitter

05:18:52.040 --> 05:18:54.040
[Guest]: And then I came back, I think after 2-3 hours

05:18:54.040 --> 05:18:56.040
[Guest]: And the responses

05:18:56.040 --> 05:18:58.040
[Guest]: Were just

05:18:58.040 --> 05:19:00.040
[Guest]: The

05:19:00.040 --> 05:19:02.040
[Guest]: Compassion

05:19:02.040 --> 05:19:04.040
[Guest]: The love, the kindness

05:19:04.040 --> 05:19:06.040
[Guest]: That I received from all kinds of people

05:19:08.040 --> 05:19:10.040
[Guest]: Who I knew, who I didn't know

05:19:10.040 --> 05:19:12.040
[Guest]: On the internet, the DMs

05:19:12.040 --> 05:19:14.040
[Guest]: Just non-stop like

05:19:14.040 --> 05:19:16.040
[Guest]: Thank you for sharing, you know

05:19:16.040 --> 05:19:18.040
[Guest]: I wish I could, one of my closest friends

05:19:18.040 --> 05:19:20.040
[Guest]: You know the funniest thing that happened

05:19:20.040 --> 05:19:22.040
[Guest]: One of my closest friends who

05:19:22.040 --> 05:19:24.040
[Guest]: I used to meet everyday during

05:19:24.040 --> 05:19:26.040
[Guest]: Every week, we were working together on something at Yashar

05:19:26.040 --> 05:19:28.040
[Guest]: Who has now become one of my

05:19:28.040 --> 05:19:30.040
[Guest]: Dearest, dearest friends, every week we would

05:19:30.040 --> 05:19:32.040
[Guest]: Meet, 2 boys

05:19:32.040 --> 05:19:34.040
[Guest]: 2 men, same age, same kind

05:19:34.040 --> 05:19:36.040
[Guest]: Of like both, you know

05:19:36.040 --> 05:19:38.040
[Guest]: Almost like very similar to each other in many different

05:19:38.040 --> 05:19:40.040
[Guest]: Ways, and after I put this

05:19:40.040 --> 05:19:42.040
[Guest]: Thing, he just came to me, he called me

05:19:42.040 --> 05:19:44.040
[Guest]: And he's like, I didn't know you had anxiety

05:19:44.040 --> 05:19:46.040
[Guest]: I said, why?

05:19:46.040 --> 05:19:48.040
[Guest]: He's like, I also have anxiety, I'm like what?

05:19:48.040 --> 05:19:50.040
[Guest]: He's like, yeah you've been going to a therapist

05:19:50.040 --> 05:19:52.040
[Guest]: I've also been going to a therapist, he's like

05:19:52.040 --> 05:19:54.040
[Guest]: I didn't know that I could share with you

05:19:54.040 --> 05:19:56.040
[Guest]: I was like, can you imagine, we've been

05:19:56.040 --> 05:19:58.040
[Guest]: Like meeting every week for

05:19:58.040 --> 05:20:00.040
[Guest]: 8 months, as 2 men

05:20:00.040 --> 05:20:02.040
[Guest]: Who've become friends with each other

05:20:02.040 --> 05:20:04.040
[Guest]: And we've not been able to say to each other

05:20:04.040 --> 05:20:06.040
[Guest]: That we have anxiety, because that's

05:20:06.040 --> 05:20:08.040
[Guest]: The kind of stigma, but when you share

05:20:08.040 --> 05:20:10.040
[Guest]: The kind of love and empathy that happens

05:20:10.040 --> 05:20:12.040
[Guest]: After that, and now I've become

05:20:12.040 --> 05:20:14.040
[Guest]: That person and we've become these people like

05:20:14.040 --> 05:20:16.040
[Guest]: He just like, every, randomly

05:20:16.040 --> 05:20:18.040
[Guest]: Once in a while, I get a I love you

05:20:18.040 --> 05:20:20.040
[Guest]: From him, that's it, nothing else

05:20:20.040 --> 05:20:22.040
[Guest]: No context, I love you

05:20:22.040 --> 05:20:24.040
[Guest]: I love you, that's it

05:20:24.040 --> 05:20:26.040
[Guest]: And why can't men do that?

05:20:26.040 --> 05:20:28.040
[Guest]: I just find it like, you know, one of the things

05:20:28.040 --> 05:20:30.040
[Guest]: On the internet, that just kind of pet peeves

05:20:30.040 --> 05:20:32.040
[Guest]: Of mine is like, always see, look at

05:20:32.040 --> 05:20:34.040
[Guest]: The way girls champion each other on

05:20:34.040 --> 05:20:36.040
[Guest]: Instagram comments, you put

05:20:36.040 --> 05:20:38.040
[Guest]: Anything, you can put a picture of a sandwich

05:20:38.040 --> 05:20:40.040
[Guest]: And you know the other girls would be like

05:20:40.040 --> 05:20:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Yas queen, eat this sandwich, go for it

05:20:42.040 --> 05:20:44.040
[Guest]: What a beautiful, beautiful thing

05:20:44.040 --> 05:20:46.040
[Guest]: Blah blah blah, guys can do

05:20:46.040 --> 05:20:48.040
[Guest]: Anything, I mean they can have

05:20:48.040 --> 05:20:50.040
[Guest]: Beautiful pictures, they can have

05:20:50.040 --> 05:20:52.040
[Guest]: Like, they can literally change the world and there

05:20:52.040 --> 05:20:54.040
[Guest]: Is still some other guy, one of his best friends in the comments

05:20:54.040 --> 05:20:56.040
[Guest]: Saying, idiot, you know

05:20:56.040 --> 05:20:58.040
[Guest]: What do you think of yourself, what kind of

05:20:58.040 --> 05:21:00.040
[Guest]: Asshole you are, you know, that's the

05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:02.040
[Guest]: So to speak love language

05:21:02.040 --> 05:21:04.040
[Guest]: You are not

05:21:04.040 --> 05:21:06.040
[Guest]: So few people, even right now

05:21:06.040 --> 05:21:08.040
[Guest]: As somebody who really talks a lot about

05:21:08.040 --> 05:21:10.040
[Guest]: Again, mental health, empathy, etc

05:21:10.040 --> 05:21:12.040
[Guest]: 70% of my

05:21:12.040 --> 05:21:14.040
[Guest]: Followers at this point are

05:21:14.040 --> 05:21:16.040
[Guest]: Women, 80-90%

05:21:16.040 --> 05:21:18.040
[Guest]: Of my comments are women

05:21:18.040 --> 05:21:20.040
[Guest]: And I might be talking about

05:21:20.040 --> 05:21:22.040
[Guest]: Masculinity, let me tell you that, I might

05:21:22.040 --> 05:21:24.040
[Guest]: Write a post about masculinity and there is like

05:21:24.040 --> 05:21:26.040
[Guest]: 90% women talking about it, you know

05:21:26.040 --> 05:21:28.040
[Guest]: Thank you for saying this, etc, where are the men?

05:21:28.040 --> 05:21:30.040
[Guest]: Why are you so afraid of talking, it's not like they are not

05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:32.040
[Guest]: Seen, I know that they are

05:21:32.040 --> 05:21:34.040
[Guest]: Seen, I know that, you know

05:21:34.040 --> 05:21:36.040
[Guest]: Because they comment on some other random

05:21:36.040 --> 05:21:38.040
[Guest]: Things I might do, but a few of them

05:21:38.040 --> 05:21:40.040
[Guest]: Who are comfortable with their masculinity

05:21:40.040 --> 05:21:42.040
[Guest]: Would probably even now send

05:21:42.040 --> 05:21:44.040
[Guest]: Hearts or whatever, but they would fit into

05:21:44.040 --> 05:21:46.040
[Guest]: Because he is a poet, that's why he is doing it

05:21:46.040 --> 05:21:48.040
[Guest]: There is a writer who might be doing this

05:21:48.040 --> 05:21:50.040
[Guest]: You know, but otherwise traditionally

05:21:50.040 --> 05:21:52.040
[Guest]: You just don't do it, but why?

05:21:52.040 --> 05:21:54.040
[Guest]: It's okay

05:21:54.040 --> 05:21:56.040
[Guest]: Go online and share love

05:21:56.040 --> 05:21:58.040
[Guest]: Put hearts, you know, let people

05:21:58.040 --> 05:22:00.040
[Guest]: Know that you love them

05:22:00.040 --> 05:22:02.040
[Guest]: Let boys know you love them

05:22:02.040 --> 05:22:04.040
[Guest]: Give them hugs, it's okay

05:22:04.040 --> 05:22:06.040
[Guest]: The world will become far more

05:22:06.040 --> 05:22:08.040
[Guest]: Non-toxic if we are able to put our

05:22:08.040 --> 05:22:10.040
[Guest]: Stories out there and we are able to

05:22:10.040 --> 05:22:12.040
[Guest]: Share it with people

05:22:12.040 --> 05:22:14.040
[Guest]: Because that's what stories do, they just bring

05:22:14.040 --> 05:22:16.040
[Guest]: This kind of incredible wave of empathy

05:22:16.040 --> 05:22:18.040
[Guest]: And love that all of us

05:22:18.040 --> 05:22:20.040
[Guest]: Need in our lives, but we need to

05:22:20.040 --> 05:22:22.040
[Guest]: Need to have that courage and one last point

05:22:22.040 --> 05:22:24.040
[Guest]: Right now, which is that

05:22:24.040 --> 05:22:26.040
[Guest]: This is also the power of the internet, right

05:22:26.040 --> 05:22:28.040
[Guest]: Where you have, where it can be used

05:22:28.040 --> 05:22:30.040
[Guest]: In all these terrible and negative ways

05:22:30.040 --> 05:22:32.040
[Guest]: You can also

05:22:32.040 --> 05:22:34.040
[Guest]: The incredible power of it is

05:22:34.040 --> 05:22:36.040
[Guest]: That you can also use it in incredibly

05:22:36.040 --> 05:22:38.040
[Guest]: Positive ways, you can

05:22:38.040 --> 05:22:40.040
[Guest]: Use this, if you don't have a community

05:22:40.040 --> 05:22:42.040
[Guest]: Start one, if you don't have

05:22:42.040 --> 05:22:44.040
[Guest]: If you've never heard a story like

05:22:44.040 --> 05:22:46.040
[Guest]: Yours, tell yours, if you've

05:22:46.040 --> 05:22:48.040
[Guest]: Not found

05:22:48.040 --> 05:22:50.040
[Guest]: The boys or the men

05:22:50.040 --> 05:22:52.040
[Guest]: You know, who

05:22:52.040 --> 05:22:54.040
[Guest]: Care for you, you know

05:22:54.040 --> 05:22:56.040
[Guest]: Put that on the internet and I'm sure

05:22:56.040 --> 05:22:58.040
[Guest]: That there'll be people out there who are also

05:22:58.040 --> 05:23:00.040
[Guest]: Feeling the same thing and that

05:23:00.040 --> 05:23:02.040
[Guest]: Has happened so often with me and I've seen

05:23:02.040 --> 05:23:04.040
[Guest]: It happen so often with others, I just

05:23:04.040 --> 05:23:06.040
[Guest]: Use it to the incredible

05:23:06.040 --> 05:23:08.040
[Guest]: Potential it has, you know, put

05:23:08.040 --> 05:23:10.040
[Guest]: Your story out there and you'll see that

05:23:10.040 --> 05:23:12.040
[Guest]: You know, more often than not, there are people who are

05:23:12.040 --> 05:23:14.040
[Guest]: Who will cheer for you

05:23:14.040 --> 05:23:16.040
[Guest]: Then like, you know, shut you down

05:23:16.040 --> 05:23:18.040
[Amit Varma]: So, if there are any male listeners listening

05:23:18.040 --> 05:23:20.040
[Amit Varma]: To this who are stimulated or moved by

05:23:20.040 --> 05:23:22.040
[Amit Varma]: This, please express it

05:23:22.040 --> 05:23:24.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, you can tweet

05:23:24.040 --> 05:23:26.040
[Amit Varma]: At us and so on

05:23:26.040 --> 05:23:28.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, so I

05:23:28.040 --> 05:23:30.040
[Amit Varma]: This has been a pet peeve of mine and something that I've

05:23:30.040 --> 05:23:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Realized that I've been guilty of as well

05:23:32.040 --> 05:23:34.040
[Amit Varma]: That men just don't express

05:23:34.040 --> 05:23:36.040
[Amit Varma]: The way they feel, especially to other men

05:23:36.040 --> 05:23:38.040
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode a while back with

05:23:38.040 --> 05:23:40.040
[Amit Varma]: A few months back with an old friend of mine

05:23:40.040 --> 05:23:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Chandra Raj Choudhary

05:23:42.040 --> 05:23:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And like

05:23:44.040 --> 05:23:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Conversations, it was very open and all of that

05:23:46.040 --> 05:23:48.040
[Amit Varma]: And later when my wife heard it, she was

05:23:48.040 --> 05:23:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, I didn't know you guys were so close

05:23:50.040 --> 05:23:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And I

05:23:52.040 --> 05:23:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And my reply was, we didn't know

05:23:54.040 --> 05:23:56.040
[Unknown]: That either, right

05:23:56.040 --> 05:23:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And so it's kind of

05:23:58.040 --> 05:24:00.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, you sort of

05:24:00.040 --> 05:24:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Realize that in so many ways

05:24:02.040 --> 05:24:04.040
[Amit Varma]: You hold back and the holding back

05:24:04.040 --> 05:24:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Just kind of hurts you

05:24:06.040 --> 05:24:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about

05:24:08.040 --> 05:24:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Anxiety, you know, one of the

05:24:10.040 --> 05:24:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Themes that you've spoken a lot about

05:24:12.040 --> 05:24:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Is mental health

05:24:14.040 --> 05:24:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And your journey towards understanding

05:24:16.040 --> 05:24:18.040
[Amit Varma]: That, like you said, started with

05:24:18.040 --> 05:24:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Your own issues, at a point

05:24:20.040 --> 05:24:22.040
[Amit Varma]: In time where you are

05:24:22.040 --> 05:24:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Incredibly successful, right

05:24:24.040 --> 05:24:26.040
[Amit Varma]: You are at Yash Raj, you've made

05:24:26.040 --> 05:24:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Four of the first ten web series in India

05:24:28.040 --> 05:24:30.040
[Amit Varma]: As it were, and everything's

05:24:30.040 --> 05:24:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Just going so great

05:24:32.040 --> 05:24:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And then this happens, and then

05:24:34.040 --> 05:24:36.040
[Amit Varma]: You kind of figure it out, and the thing is, for an earlier

05:24:36.040 --> 05:24:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Generation, there wouldn't even have been

05:24:38.040 --> 05:24:40.040
[Unknown]: A way to make sense of it

05:24:40.040 --> 05:24:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Because people would say

05:24:42.040 --> 05:24:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Why are you depressed

05:24:44.040 --> 05:24:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Or cheer up, or why are you feeling

05:24:46.040 --> 05:24:48.040
[Amit Varma]: This way, everything is fine, do yoga

05:24:48.040 --> 05:24:50.040
[Unknown]: You know, that kind of

05:24:50.040 --> 05:24:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Rubbish, tell me a little bit about

05:24:52.040 --> 05:24:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Your journey, specifically you mentioned that when you

05:24:54.040 --> 05:24:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Spoke to that friend of yours

05:24:56.040 --> 05:24:58.040
[Amit Varma]: You met her, and she told you

05:24:58.040 --> 05:25:00.040
[Unknown]: One, two, three, four, these are the things that

05:25:00.040 --> 05:25:02.040
[Unknown]: Happened, what were those things

05:25:02.040 --> 05:25:04.040
[Guest]: And what was it like?

05:25:04.040 --> 05:25:06.040
[Guest]: So, the way that I've now

05:25:06.040 --> 05:25:08.040
[Guest]: Found

05:25:08.040 --> 05:25:10.040
[Guest]: You know, to explain anxiety

05:25:10.040 --> 05:25:12.040
[Guest]: To someone, and now I've also realized it's a little

05:25:12.040 --> 05:25:14.040
[Guest]: Privileged, so to speak, but

05:25:14.040 --> 05:25:16.040
[Guest]: The easiest reference point for me was that

05:25:16.040 --> 05:25:18.040
[Guest]: If you've ever been on a plane

05:25:18.040 --> 05:25:20.040
[Guest]: You know, and you've had turbulence

05:25:20.040 --> 05:25:22.040
[Guest]: And then your heart sinks for a second

05:25:22.040 --> 05:25:24.040
[Guest]: You know

05:25:24.040 --> 05:25:26.040
[Guest]: Anxiety is like that sinking feeling

05:25:26.040 --> 05:25:28.040
[Guest]: But all the time

05:25:28.040 --> 05:25:30.040
[Guest]: It's your heart not stopping

05:25:30.040 --> 05:25:32.040
[Guest]: From sinking

05:25:32.040 --> 05:25:34.040
[Guest]: You know, it is

05:25:34.040 --> 05:25:36.040
[Guest]: What in

05:25:36.040 --> 05:25:38.040
[Guest]: Hindi sometimes, you know, we kind of

05:25:38.040 --> 05:25:40.040
[Guest]: Say it as ghavrat

05:25:40.040 --> 05:25:42.040
[Guest]: But, you know, because we don't have

05:25:42.040 --> 05:25:44.040
[Guest]: Vocabulary for what is anxiety

05:25:44.040 --> 05:25:46.040
[Guest]: So ghavrat bolte, which can also be nervousness

05:25:46.040 --> 05:25:48.040
[Guest]: But a lot of the times when people

05:25:48.040 --> 05:25:50.040
[Guest]: Say it, I think it is coming from a sense of

05:25:50.040 --> 05:25:52.040
[Guest]: Your heart sinking

05:25:52.040 --> 05:25:54.040
[Guest]: It is feeling

05:25:54.040 --> 05:25:56.040
[Guest]: Too overwhelmed

05:25:56.040 --> 05:25:58.040
[Guest]: Because you're not

05:25:58.040 --> 05:26:00.040
[Guest]: Able to feel

05:26:02.040 --> 05:26:04.040
[Guest]: The emotions you want to

05:26:04.040 --> 05:26:06.040
[Guest]: It is, you feel too much because

05:26:06.040 --> 05:26:08.040
[Guest]: You feel too little

05:26:08.040 --> 05:26:10.040
[Guest]: It is

05:26:10.040 --> 05:26:12.040
[Guest]: And it has a

05:26:12.040 --> 05:26:14.040
[Guest]: Reaction to your body also

05:26:14.040 --> 05:26:16.040
[Guest]: So for me

05:26:16.040 --> 05:26:18.040
[Guest]: To give you, you know, examples

05:26:18.040 --> 05:26:20.040
[Guest]: Anxiety

05:26:20.040 --> 05:26:22.040
[Guest]: Had turned into a way where

05:26:22.040 --> 05:26:24.040
[Guest]: It had turned so bad for me that

05:26:24.040 --> 05:26:26.040
[Guest]: If I would get up

05:26:26.040 --> 05:26:28.040
[Guest]: Let's assume at 7.30

05:26:28.040 --> 05:26:30.040
[Guest]: And I have to

05:26:30.040 --> 05:26:32.040
[Guest]: Get out of my house by 8.30

05:26:32.040 --> 05:26:34.040
[Guest]: To get to my office and I was living in Kandivali

05:26:34.040 --> 05:26:36.040
[Guest]: At that time my office was like an hour away

05:26:36.040 --> 05:26:38.040
[Guest]: Or something in Andheri

05:26:38.040 --> 05:26:40.040
[Guest]: So at 9.30 I have to get there

05:26:40.040 --> 05:26:42.040
[Guest]: But for that my Uber needs to arrive

05:26:42.040 --> 05:26:44.040
[Guest]: At a certain point and then I will get to office at 9.30

05:26:44.040 --> 05:26:46.040
[Guest]: And from 9.30 to 10 I had time

05:26:46.040 --> 05:26:48.040
[Guest]: For myself before the office

05:26:48.040 --> 05:26:50.040
[Guest]: Hour started and that was a very important time

05:26:50.040 --> 05:26:52.040
[Guest]: For me that I will organize myself and then

05:26:52.040 --> 05:26:54.040
[Guest]: This work will start. So this was the routine that I had

05:26:54.040 --> 05:26:56.040
[Guest]: When anxiety took over me

05:26:56.040 --> 05:26:58.040
[Guest]: If my Uber instead of

05:26:58.040 --> 05:27:00.040
[Guest]: Coming at 8.30

05:27:00.040 --> 05:27:02.040
[Guest]: Sometimes would just cancel

05:27:02.040 --> 05:27:04.040
[Guest]: 8.40

05:27:04.040 --> 05:27:06.040
[Guest]: 8.45 it came late

05:27:06.040 --> 05:27:08.040
[Guest]: I would not be able to

05:27:08.040 --> 05:27:10.040
[Guest]: You know

05:27:10.040 --> 05:27:12.040
[Guest]: Go to work that day because

05:27:12.040 --> 05:27:14.040
[Guest]: I would

05:27:14.040 --> 05:27:16.040
[Guest]: You know so

05:27:16.040 --> 05:27:18.040
[Guest]: There is a book

05:27:18.040 --> 05:27:20.040
[Guest]: Where I think one of the Green Brothers

05:27:20.040 --> 05:27:22.040
[Guest]: Called it Thought Spirals

05:27:22.040 --> 05:27:24.040
[Guest]: You know that your thoughts start

05:27:24.040 --> 05:27:26.040
[Guest]: Spiraling in such a huge way

05:27:26.040 --> 05:27:28.040
[Guest]: Where I am now in my head

05:27:28.040 --> 05:27:30.040
[Guest]: I am like ok now before the Uber has come

05:27:30.040 --> 05:27:32.040
[Guest]: I just see that ok it's going to be late by 5 minutes

05:27:32.040 --> 05:27:34.040
[Guest]: In my head I am like

05:27:34.040 --> 05:27:36.040
[Guest]: Ok so 5 minutes it's going to be late

05:27:36.040 --> 05:27:38.040
[Guest]: I am going to not be able to reach my office because the traffic

05:27:38.040 --> 05:27:40.040
[Guest]: Will increase. I will reach only by 9.45

05:27:40.040 --> 05:27:42.040
[Guest]: And you know before I can even

05:27:42.040 --> 05:27:44.040
[Guest]: You know get organized or whatever it is

05:27:44.040 --> 05:27:46.040
[Guest]: The meetings will start. So I would actually not get time

05:27:46.040 --> 05:27:48.040
[Guest]: To prep for those meetings and once the meetings

05:27:48.040 --> 05:27:50.040
[Guest]: Start then you know I am

05:27:50.040 --> 05:27:52.040
[Guest]: Anyway going to be unprepared and people

05:27:52.040 --> 05:27:54.040
[Guest]: Will find out that I am not good at what I do

05:27:54.040 --> 05:27:56.040
[Guest]: At the end of it you know they will come and tell me

05:27:56.040 --> 05:27:58.040
[Guest]: Because I have also been happening for so long

05:27:58.040 --> 05:28:00.040
[Guest]: And I am you know

05:28:00.040 --> 05:28:02.040
[Guest]: And maybe it will turn into

05:28:02.040 --> 05:28:04.040
[Guest]: A conversation about whether I deserve this job or not

05:28:04.040 --> 05:28:06.040
[Guest]: And I will probably get fired

05:28:06.040 --> 05:28:08.040
[Guest]: And this is

05:28:08.040 --> 05:28:10.040
[Guest]: How big you think when it comes to literally Uber

05:28:10.040 --> 05:28:12.040
[Guest]: Getting late and if it's going to get

05:28:12.040 --> 05:28:14.040
[Guest]: Fired what is the point of going

05:28:14.040 --> 05:28:16.040
[Guest]: What is the point of going on this job right now

05:28:16.040 --> 05:28:18.040
[Guest]: There is no point. I would much rather stay home

05:28:18.040 --> 05:28:20.040
[Guest]: And just like instead of facing the world

05:28:20.040 --> 05:28:22.040
[Guest]: I would much rather just sleep in my

05:28:22.040 --> 05:28:24.040
[Guest]: You know

05:28:24.040 --> 05:28:26.040
[Guest]: Bed today and just avoid

05:28:26.040 --> 05:28:28.040
[Guest]: Putting myself in the situation where I will

05:28:28.040 --> 05:28:30.040
[Guest]: Get fired

05:28:30.040 --> 05:28:32.040
[Guest]: And that's how badly it

05:28:32.040 --> 05:28:34.040
[Guest]: That's where it goes

05:28:34.040 --> 05:28:36.040
[Guest]: And it could start with just as simple as

05:28:36.040 --> 05:28:38.040
[Guest]: Uber getting late. Anxiety is when

05:28:38.040 --> 05:28:40.040
[Guest]: You have when somebody sends

05:28:40.040 --> 05:28:42.040
[Guest]: A message saying hi

05:28:42.040 --> 05:28:44.040
[Guest]: But doesn't say anything more than that

05:28:44.040 --> 05:28:46.040
[Guest]: And you start panicking

05:28:46.040 --> 05:28:48.040
[Guest]: What does this hi mean

05:28:48.040 --> 05:28:50.040
[Guest]: This person has said hey before

05:28:50.040 --> 05:28:52.040
[Guest]: But not hi before. Does this mean

05:28:52.040 --> 05:28:54.040
[Guest]: That there is some bad news

05:28:54.040 --> 05:28:56.040
[Guest]: Does this mean that I have offended this person

05:28:56.040 --> 05:28:58.040
[Guest]: Does this mean that

05:28:58.040 --> 05:29:00.040
[Guest]: There is something they want to say to me

05:29:00.040 --> 05:29:02.040
[Guest]: That they can't say and until I say it back

05:29:02.040 --> 05:29:04.040
[Guest]: You start. There is just so many

05:29:04.040 --> 05:29:06.040
[Guest]: Scenarios. Your head is

05:29:06.040 --> 05:29:08.040
[Guest]: Filled with scenarios of all

05:29:08.040 --> 05:29:10.040
[Guest]: The terrible things that

05:29:10.040 --> 05:29:12.040
[Guest]: Can happen to you because of

05:29:12.040 --> 05:29:14.040
[Guest]: Because of this one little thing

05:29:14.040 --> 05:29:16.040
[Guest]: That might go wrong and you are

05:29:16.040 --> 05:29:18.040
[Guest]: It's

05:29:18.040 --> 05:29:20.040
[Guest]: Unbearable. I mean it's not

05:29:20.040 --> 05:29:22.040
[Guest]: Something that I mean I went the one

05:29:22.040 --> 05:29:24.040
[Guest]: Year the first year. I still have anxiety

05:29:24.040 --> 05:29:26.040
[Guest]: But I don't. I mean it's not clinical now

05:29:26.040 --> 05:29:28.040
[Guest]: So there is of course it's a spectrum also

05:29:28.040 --> 05:29:30.040
[Guest]: Right. So you

05:29:30.040 --> 05:29:32.040
[Guest]: Sometimes when you have an exam the night before

05:29:32.040 --> 05:29:34.040
[Guest]: You get very. That's also anxiety

05:29:34.040 --> 05:29:36.040
[Guest]: But that's you know that will happen on

05:29:36.040 --> 05:29:38.040
[Guest]: You know you have a tough day at work. You have an appraisal

05:29:38.040 --> 05:29:40.040
[Guest]: Coming up. You are tense about it

05:29:40.040 --> 05:29:42.040
[Guest]: Those are all also anxieties

05:29:42.040 --> 05:29:44.040
[Guest]: But then when it becomes persistent

05:29:44.040 --> 05:29:46.040
[Guest]: When it becomes you know

05:29:46.040 --> 05:29:48.040
[Guest]: Relentless in many ways

05:29:48.040 --> 05:29:50.040
[Guest]: And it goes on for months and days

05:29:50.040 --> 05:29:52.040
[Guest]: And end. That can sometimes

05:29:52.040 --> 05:29:54.040
[Guest]: Be clinical. So

05:29:54.040 --> 05:29:56.040
[Guest]: And it's called generalized anxiety

05:29:56.040 --> 05:29:58.040
[Guest]: Disorder and so I was

05:29:58.040 --> 05:30:00.040
[Guest]: Diagnosed with that at some point

05:30:00.040 --> 05:30:02.040
[Guest]: But

05:30:02.040 --> 05:30:04.040
[Guest]: Before that it was just for me like my

05:30:04.040 --> 05:30:06.040
[Guest]: Just overthinking that's what I would think

05:30:06.040 --> 05:30:08.040
[Guest]: Of it. Why am I overthinking you know

05:30:08.040 --> 05:30:10.040
[Guest]: It wasn't overthinking. It was just my brain like

05:30:10.040 --> 05:30:12.040
[Guest]: Just absolutely

05:30:12.040 --> 05:30:14.040
[Guest]: Not pausing for breath

05:30:14.040 --> 05:30:16.040
[Guest]: You know it would just

05:30:16.040 --> 05:30:18.040
[Guest]: I would have to. I was telling you

05:30:18.040 --> 05:30:20.040
[Guest]: I was going to US for that event

05:30:20.040 --> 05:30:22.040
[Guest]: Goalkeepers and I was

05:30:22.040 --> 05:30:24.040
[Guest]: In. I was so

05:30:24.040 --> 05:30:26.040
[Guest]: Tense because I was just like

05:30:26.040 --> 05:30:28.040
[Guest]: Man I am going to. My

05:30:28.040 --> 05:30:30.040
[Guest]: Bag will not reach. It just

05:30:30.040 --> 05:30:32.040
[Guest]: Became a thing in me that you know and I have gone

05:30:32.040 --> 05:30:34.040
[Guest]: To. You know I have travelled internationally a lot

05:30:34.040 --> 05:30:36.040
[Guest]: I have grown up in of course in Bahrain so

05:30:36.040 --> 05:30:38.040
[Guest]: But I just said that I am going

05:30:38.040 --> 05:30:40.040
[Guest]: You know I will take a lot of my

05:30:40.040 --> 05:30:42.040
[Guest]: Clothes. I have you know bought

05:30:42.040 --> 05:30:44.040
[Guest]: New clothes for this but my bag

05:30:44.040 --> 05:30:46.040
[Guest]: Will get misplaced and if it get misplaced

05:30:46.040 --> 05:30:48.040
[Guest]: Then I will not have anything to wear

05:30:48.040 --> 05:30:50.040
[Guest]: And because I am overweight I will not find the right fit

05:30:50.040 --> 05:30:52.040
[Guest]: So when I go to the event I will not have clothes

05:30:52.040 --> 05:30:54.040
[Guest]: To wear so people maybe they won't

05:30:54.040 --> 05:30:56.040
[Guest]: Let me enter because it's a black tie event or whatever

05:30:56.040 --> 05:30:58.040
[Guest]: It is etc etc. So that is my

05:30:58.040 --> 05:31:00.040
[Guest]: I would have these conversations with my therapist

05:31:00.040 --> 05:31:02.040
[Guest]: And she just be like you know

05:31:02.040 --> 05:31:04.040
[Guest]: Of course she will get me to do breathing

05:31:04.040 --> 05:31:06.040
[Guest]: Exercises and then say you know

05:31:06.040 --> 05:31:08.040
[Guest]: What is so one of the things

05:31:08.040 --> 05:31:10.040
[Guest]: Then the exercises she would give me was like

05:31:10.040 --> 05:31:12.040
[Guest]: Think of the worst that could

05:31:12.040 --> 05:31:14.040
[Guest]: Happen and I would say okay this is the

05:31:14.040 --> 05:31:16.040
[Guest]: Worst that could happen. I will be

05:31:16.040 --> 05:31:18.040
[Guest]: It won't come and I will have to fly back

05:31:18.040 --> 05:31:20.040
[Guest]: Okay so if that is

05:31:20.040 --> 05:31:22.040
[Guest]: The worst that could happen is it really that bad

05:31:22.040 --> 05:31:24.040
[Guest]: And then when you start thinking okay

05:31:24.040 --> 05:31:26.040
[Guest]: Maybe it's not that bad

05:31:26.040 --> 05:31:28.040
[Guest]: Then you start getting a little calmer you know

05:31:28.040 --> 05:31:30.040
[Guest]: So I mean there are so many different things that

05:31:30.040 --> 05:31:32.040
[Guest]: Would work for different people but it was

05:31:32.040 --> 05:31:34.040
[Guest]: Unbearable for me

05:31:34.040 --> 05:31:36.040
[Guest]: I would have trouble breathing I would have trouble

05:31:36.040 --> 05:31:38.040
[Guest]: Getting off my bed you know on certain days

05:31:38.040 --> 05:31:40.040
[Guest]: I would have what I realized

05:31:40.040 --> 05:31:42.040
[Guest]: Later were panic attacks where

05:31:42.040 --> 05:31:44.040
[Guest]: Just you are frozen

05:31:44.040 --> 05:31:46.040
[Guest]: For like 20 minutes you feel like you are having a heart

05:31:46.040 --> 05:31:48.040
[Guest]: Attack and it's just your body

05:31:48.040 --> 05:31:50.040
[Guest]: Refusing to like give you the

05:31:50.040 --> 05:31:52.040
[Guest]: Your brain refusing

05:31:52.040 --> 05:31:54.040
[Guest]: To give signals to your body that it's okay to get up

05:31:54.040 --> 05:31:56.040
[Guest]: And you know because you are just like what is the

05:31:56.040 --> 05:31:58.040
[Guest]: Point everything sucks and everything is

05:31:58.040 --> 05:32:00.040
[Guest]: Terrible terrible terrible

05:32:00.040 --> 05:32:02.040
[Guest]: So it was it was I would sweat a lot

05:32:02.040 --> 05:32:04.040
[Guest]: I would constantly be sweating

05:32:04.040 --> 05:32:06.040
[Guest]: I was constantly be like you know

05:32:06.040 --> 05:32:08.040
[Guest]: I am not able to

05:32:08.040 --> 05:32:10.040
[Guest]: Things are going to go wrong so yeah

05:32:10.040 --> 05:32:12.040
[Guest]: Even now I know when I know

05:32:12.040 --> 05:32:14.040
[Guest]: I am getting anxious I know because when sweat happens

05:32:14.040 --> 05:32:16.040
[Guest]: You know my body my heart would start pacing

05:32:16.040 --> 05:32:18.040
[Guest]: So

05:32:18.040 --> 05:32:20.040
[Guest]: So these were the symbols

05:32:20.040 --> 05:32:22.040
[Guest]: And you know which I again a lot of my

05:32:22.040 --> 05:32:24.040
[Guest]: My wife you know

05:32:24.040 --> 05:32:26.040
[Guest]: Daisy

05:32:26.040 --> 05:32:28.040
[Guest]: Used to think

05:32:28.040 --> 05:32:30.040
[Guest]: That again it might have something to do with my heart

05:32:30.040 --> 05:32:32.040
[Guest]: Because again you know she is like

05:32:32.040 --> 05:32:34.040
[Guest]: You get it checked or whatever it is maybe it's a

05:32:34.040 --> 05:32:36.040
[Guest]: Cholesterol issue whatever it is

05:32:36.040 --> 05:32:38.040
[Guest]: She noticed it I wasn't even able to

05:32:38.040 --> 05:32:40.040
[Guest]: Notice it you know when you are in it you are not able

05:32:40.040 --> 05:32:42.040
[Guest]: To have that perspective

05:32:42.040 --> 05:32:44.040
[Guest]: She was the first person to notice and say I think something

05:32:44.040 --> 05:32:46.040
[Guest]: Going on with you why are you so like

05:32:46.040 --> 05:32:48.040
[Guest]: Tense all the time why are you sweating so much

05:32:48.040 --> 05:32:50.040
[Guest]: And sweating was the thing you should go to a doctor

05:32:50.040 --> 05:32:52.040
[Guest]: When I went to a doctor about this

05:32:52.040 --> 05:32:54.040
[Guest]: And she is like you don't have your heart is fine

05:32:54.040 --> 05:32:56.040
[Guest]: You have anxiety

05:32:56.040 --> 05:32:58.040
[Guest]: What does that mean

05:32:58.040 --> 05:33:00.040
[Guest]: You know so first they gave pills but I was like

05:33:00.040 --> 05:33:02.040
[Guest]: Okay let me just you know I also wanted

05:33:02.040 --> 05:33:04.040
[Guest]: To figure before I take pills

05:33:04.040 --> 05:33:06.040
[Guest]: Is there another alternate

05:33:06.040 --> 05:33:08.040
[Guest]: Or whatever it is you know

05:33:08.040 --> 05:33:10.040
[Guest]: And I mean

05:33:10.040 --> 05:33:12.040
[Guest]: Pills work for a lot of people I just

05:33:12.040 --> 05:33:14.040
[Guest]: Someone who wants to first see that if there is

05:33:14.040 --> 05:33:16.040
[Guest]: An either way and then kind of okay with pills

05:33:16.040 --> 05:33:18.040
[Guest]: Also so that's when therapy

05:33:18.040 --> 05:33:20.040
[Guest]: Was suggested to me and then it took me

05:33:20.040 --> 05:33:22.040
[Guest]: I think two more months after that point to actually

05:33:22.040 --> 05:33:24.040
[Guest]: Go to therapy because I was like

05:33:24.040 --> 05:33:26.040
[Guest]: I can't go to therapy

05:33:26.040 --> 05:33:28.040
[Guest]: If I am a man does that

05:33:28.040 --> 05:33:30.040
[Guest]: If I go to therapy that means I have to

05:33:30.040 --> 05:33:32.040
[Guest]: Admit that something is broken in me

05:33:32.040 --> 05:33:34.040
[Guest]: And can I

05:33:34.040 --> 05:33:36.040
[Guest]: You know and can I

05:33:36.040 --> 05:33:38.040
[Guest]: I am not comfortable with the idea

05:33:38.040 --> 05:33:40.040
[Guest]: That I am broken and need to be

05:33:40.040 --> 05:33:42.040
[Guest]: Fixed you know

05:33:42.040 --> 05:33:44.040
[Guest]: I am fine so what

05:33:44.040 --> 05:33:46.040
[Guest]: So many you know people go through

05:33:46.040 --> 05:33:48.040
[Guest]: All kinds of shit what is this

05:33:48.040 --> 05:33:50.040
[Guest]: I can't overcome like this little thing but it wasn't

05:33:50.040 --> 05:33:52.040
[Guest]: Little it was unbearable it was

05:33:52.040 --> 05:33:54.040
[Guest]: Unbearable I literally had to quit my job

05:33:54.040 --> 05:33:56.040
[Guest]: Take six months off

05:33:56.040 --> 05:33:58.040
[Guest]: Leave everything

05:33:58.040 --> 05:34:00.040
[Guest]: Take a sabbatical in my life

05:34:00.040 --> 05:34:02.040
[Guest]: Before I was able to feel you know

05:34:02.040 --> 05:34:04.040
[Guest]: Better and it's only when I started

05:34:04.040 --> 05:34:06.040
[Guest]: Working on something I cared about

05:34:06.040 --> 05:34:08.040
[Guest]: Working on like mental health

05:34:08.040 --> 05:34:10.040
[Guest]: And you know that I got a little bit of strength

05:34:10.040 --> 05:34:12.040
[Guest]: Back but it was

05:34:12.040 --> 05:34:14.040
[Guest]: It's hard it's very

05:34:14.040 --> 05:34:16.040
[Guest]: Very hard and there's not enough resources that

05:34:16.040 --> 05:34:18.040
[Guest]: You know so

05:34:18.040 --> 05:34:20.040
[Guest]: Unfortunately we don't even have

05:34:20.040 --> 05:34:22.040
[Guest]: Again as I said we don't have a vocabulary of mental

05:34:22.040 --> 05:34:24.040
[Guest]: Health in our country right

05:34:24.040 --> 05:34:26.040
[Guest]: In regional languages or even in Hindi

05:34:26.040 --> 05:34:28.040
[Guest]: What when you have

05:34:28.040 --> 05:34:30.040
[Guest]: Depression or anxiety what do you say

05:34:30.040 --> 05:34:32.040
[Guest]: There is no colloquial terms for it

05:34:32.040 --> 05:34:34.040
[Guest]: There is

05:34:34.040 --> 05:34:36.040
[Guest]: Which is mental health

05:34:36.040 --> 05:34:38.040
[Guest]: You know but no one

05:34:38.040 --> 05:34:40.040
[Guest]: Says

05:34:40.040 --> 05:34:42.040
[Guest]: That's not something you talk about right

05:34:42.040 --> 05:34:44.040
[Guest]: Depression is

05:34:44.040 --> 05:34:46.040
[Guest]: Dukh

05:34:46.040 --> 05:34:48.040
[Guest]: There is no word for it in that sense right

05:34:48.040 --> 05:34:50.040
[Guest]: There are clinical terms maybe

05:34:50.040 --> 05:34:52.040
[Guest]: But no colloquial terms so when you

05:34:52.040 --> 05:34:54.040
[Guest]: When you are sad

05:34:54.040 --> 05:34:56.040
[Guest]: You are sad but then

05:34:56.040 --> 05:34:58.040
[Guest]: Sadness, upset, depression

05:34:58.040 --> 05:35:00.040
[Guest]: Spectrum there is no

05:35:00.040 --> 05:35:02.040
[Guest]: Way of communicating how

05:35:02.040 --> 05:35:04.040
[Guest]: I am very sad but it's still

05:35:04.040 --> 05:35:06.040
[Guest]: Sad right you can be sad when

05:35:06.040 --> 05:35:08.040
[Guest]: You know you are you have a

05:35:08.040 --> 05:35:10.040
[Guest]: Heartbreak and you can also be sad

05:35:10.040 --> 05:35:12.040
[Guest]: When you know you are depressed for six months but

05:35:12.040 --> 05:35:14.040
[Guest]: How do you compare so

05:35:14.040 --> 05:35:16.040
[Guest]: And because of that it's been so

05:35:16.040 --> 05:35:18.040
[Guest]: Difficult to have conversations about mental health

05:35:18.040 --> 05:35:20.040
[Guest]: In our homes and our families

05:35:20.040 --> 05:35:22.040
[Guest]: Because your parents don't have terms for it

05:35:22.040 --> 05:35:24.040
[Guest]: And they think of it as a foreign thing

05:35:24.040 --> 05:35:26.040
[Guest]: We don't have it here

05:35:26.040 --> 05:35:28.040
[Guest]: It's a mental

05:35:28.040 --> 05:35:30.040
[Guest]: The moment you hear mental first thing people think is

05:35:30.040 --> 05:35:32.040
[Guest]: Like psycho the second thing

05:35:32.040 --> 05:35:34.040
[Guest]: Is like mental hospital

05:35:34.040 --> 05:35:36.040
[Guest]: Those are the

05:35:36.040 --> 05:35:38.040
[Guest]: I mean can you imagine

05:35:38.040 --> 05:35:40.040
[Guest]: It's so tragic that you know

05:35:40.040 --> 05:35:42.040
[Guest]: Last year

05:35:42.040 --> 05:35:44.040
[Guest]: You know last year

05:35:44.040 --> 05:35:46.040
[Guest]: When Sushant Singh Rajput

05:35:46.040 --> 05:35:48.040
[Guest]: Passed away you know

05:35:48.040 --> 05:35:50.040
[Guest]: Our country

05:35:50.040 --> 05:35:52.040
[Guest]: Concocted a narrative

05:35:52.040 --> 05:35:54.040
[Guest]: Of a conspiracy

05:35:54.040 --> 05:35:56.040
[Guest]: In his death

05:35:56.040 --> 05:35:58.040
[Guest]: Because we were unwilling to accept

05:35:58.040 --> 05:36:00.040
[Guest]: That he could have

05:36:00.040 --> 05:36:02.040
[Guest]: Died by suicide

05:36:02.040 --> 05:36:04.040
[Guest]: Because how can someone successful

05:36:04.040 --> 05:36:06.040
[Guest]: Want to do that there has to be

05:36:06.040 --> 05:36:08.040
[Guest]: Something nasty behind it

05:36:08.040 --> 05:36:10.040
[Guest]: But Robin Williams

05:36:10.040 --> 05:36:12.040
[Guest]: Has also done that unfortunately

05:36:12.040 --> 05:36:14.040
[Guest]: And there are a lot of other folks

05:36:14.040 --> 05:36:16.040
[Guest]: Who have spoken about it

05:36:16.040 --> 05:36:18.040
[Guest]: And attempted it and done it

05:36:18.040 --> 05:36:20.040
[Guest]: Because it's mental health can happen

05:36:20.040 --> 05:36:22.040
[Guest]: To anybody

05:36:22.040 --> 05:36:24.040
[Guest]: Issues can happen to anybody

05:36:24.040 --> 05:36:26.040
[Guest]: It does not discriminate

05:36:26.040 --> 05:36:28.040
[Guest]: It doesn't matter

05:36:28.040 --> 05:36:30.040
[Guest]: If you are at a low in your life

05:36:30.040 --> 05:36:32.040
[Guest]: It doesn't matter if you are high in your life

05:36:32.040 --> 05:36:34.040
[Guest]: You can have depression you can have anxiety

05:36:34.040 --> 05:36:36.040
[Guest]: And it's okay

05:36:36.040 --> 05:36:38.040
[Guest]: And you can go and get it treated

05:36:38.040 --> 05:36:40.040
[Guest]: You can go to a doctor

05:36:40.040 --> 05:36:42.040
[Guest]: Same thing that you know you go

05:36:42.040 --> 05:36:44.040
[Guest]: You go to a doctor when you have a cold

05:36:44.040 --> 05:36:46.040
[Guest]: Now you might go to

05:36:46.040 --> 05:36:48.040
[Guest]: Find out if it's a cold or it's a covid

05:36:48.040 --> 05:36:50.040
[Guest]: It could be a cold spectrum

05:36:50.040 --> 05:36:52.040
[Guest]: Right in the same way

05:36:52.040 --> 05:36:54.040
[Guest]: When you are having trouble

05:36:54.040 --> 05:36:56.040
[Guest]: With your mind sometimes you just

05:36:56.040 --> 05:36:58.040
[Guest]: Have to get a checkup to see that is it just

05:36:58.040 --> 05:37:00.040
[Guest]: You know a little tension

05:37:00.040 --> 05:37:02.040
[Guest]: A little stress

05:37:02.040 --> 05:37:04.040
[Guest]: Is it burnout or is it

05:37:04.040 --> 05:37:06.040
[Guest]: You know clinical depression

05:37:06.040 --> 05:37:08.040
[Guest]: Clinical anxiety and there are

05:37:08.040 --> 05:37:10.040
[Guest]: Ways of overcoming it

05:37:10.040 --> 05:37:12.040
[Guest]: But you need to be comfortable with having

05:37:12.040 --> 05:37:14.040
[Guest]: The conversation first which in our country

05:37:14.040 --> 05:37:16.040
[Guest]: In our society in our families

05:37:16.040 --> 05:37:18.040
[Guest]: We are so afraid of

05:37:18.040 --> 05:37:20.040
[Guest]: Anybody says it and it's

05:37:20.040 --> 05:37:22.040
[Guest]: Seen as like again in the roadshow

05:37:22.040 --> 05:37:24.040
[Guest]: So many kids have said that you know

05:37:24.040 --> 05:37:26.040
[Guest]: I harm myself because

05:37:26.040 --> 05:37:28.040
[Guest]: I told my parents I want therapy but

05:37:28.040 --> 05:37:30.040
[Guest]: They are saying you are not mental

05:37:30.040 --> 05:37:32.040
[Guest]: So then I need my pain to go away so I harm

05:37:32.040 --> 05:37:34.040
[Guest]: Myself these are the kind of things you are hearing

05:37:34.040 --> 05:37:36.040
[Guest]: In this country

05:37:36.040 --> 05:37:38.040
[Guest]: It's tough but as I

05:37:38.040 --> 05:37:40.040
[Guest]: Said you know I mean the more we talk

05:37:40.040 --> 05:37:42.040
[Guest]: About it the more normal it will be the more

05:37:42.040 --> 05:37:44.040
[Guest]: Normal it will be the more

05:37:44.040 --> 05:37:46.040
[Guest]: Unafraid we will be there are

05:37:46.040 --> 05:37:48.040
[Guest]: Statistics that say that mental health issues

05:37:48.040 --> 05:37:50.040
[Guest]: Have increased I don't think that

05:37:50.040 --> 05:37:52.040
[Guest]: They have increased I think we are just

05:37:52.040 --> 05:37:54.040
[Guest]: Talking about them more I think they are always

05:37:54.040 --> 05:37:56.040
[Guest]: There you know

05:37:56.040 --> 05:37:58.040
[Guest]: It's just that it's also how there are

05:37:58.040 --> 05:38:00.040
[Guest]: Statistics that say that there are more

05:38:00.040 --> 05:38:02.040
[Guest]: You know lgbtq people in the world right now

05:38:02.040 --> 05:38:04.040
[Guest]: No they have always been there they just started

05:38:04.040 --> 05:38:06.040
[Guest]: Coming out more right because

05:38:06.040 --> 05:38:08.040
[Guest]: Now it's a little bit normal to do that and

05:38:08.040 --> 05:38:10.040
[Guest]: In the same way it's a little bit normal to talk about mental health

05:38:10.040 --> 05:38:12.040
[Guest]: We have always been struggling mental health

05:38:12.040 --> 05:38:14.040
[Guest]: Our parents have struggled from mental health I have seen my

05:38:14.040 --> 05:38:16.040
[Guest]: Parents go through it as I said my father

05:38:16.040 --> 05:38:18.040
[Guest]: Used to go through something which

05:38:18.040 --> 05:38:20.040
[Guest]: I realized my father had anxiety when I got it

05:38:20.040 --> 05:38:22.040
[Guest]: All my life

05:38:22.040 --> 05:38:24.040
[Guest]: Growing up I used to get so angry

05:38:24.040 --> 05:38:26.040
[Guest]: At the way he would behave

05:38:26.040 --> 05:38:28.040
[Guest]: And then I had emotional breakdowns and I had

05:38:28.040 --> 05:38:30.040
[Guest]: I told you I can't

05:38:30.040 --> 05:38:32.040
[Guest]: Cry I had breakdowns where I was crying

05:38:32.040 --> 05:38:34.040
[Guest]: For three four days

05:38:34.040 --> 05:38:36.040
[Guest]: I just it was

05:38:36.040 --> 05:38:38.040
[Guest]: Crying there were times that I couldn't stop I would

05:38:38.040 --> 05:38:40.040
[Guest]: Want to stop but I just

05:38:40.040 --> 05:38:42.040
[Guest]: Couldn't it was so bad

05:38:42.040 --> 05:38:44.040
[Guest]: And

05:38:44.040 --> 05:38:46.040
[Guest]: And you know and

05:38:46.040 --> 05:38:48.040
[Guest]: Then I kind of recognized that well my father

05:38:48.040 --> 05:38:50.040
[Guest]: Has gone through things

05:38:50.040 --> 05:38:52.040
[Guest]: And I did not know and none of us were aware

05:38:52.040 --> 05:38:54.040
[Guest]: And we were

05:38:54.040 --> 05:38:56.040
[Guest]: Resented him for the way he was behaving

05:38:56.040 --> 05:38:58.040
[Guest]: But we didn't have

05:38:58.040 --> 05:39:00.040
[Guest]: The instruments or the

05:39:00.040 --> 05:39:02.040
[Guest]: Language to talk

05:39:02.040 --> 05:39:04.040
[Guest]: About what our parents have gone through

05:39:04.040 --> 05:39:06.040
[Guest]: So many old people

05:39:06.040 --> 05:39:08.040
[Guest]: Today are going through it

05:39:08.040 --> 05:39:10.040
[Guest]: In my family again there are people who

05:39:10.040 --> 05:39:12.040
[Guest]: Are because they are lonely in their

05:39:12.040 --> 05:39:14.040
[Guest]: Old age they are going

05:39:14.040 --> 05:39:16.040
[Guest]: Through it but we don't

05:39:16.040 --> 05:39:18.040
[Guest]: Talk about it and there are

05:39:18.040 --> 05:39:20.040
[Guest]: Very few support systems

05:39:20.040 --> 05:39:22.040
[Guest]: The mental health professionals

05:39:22.040 --> 05:39:24.040
[Guest]: That we have per person is just

05:39:24.040 --> 05:39:26.040
[Guest]: Such an abysmal number

05:39:26.040 --> 05:39:28.040
[Guest]: And again it's so still

05:39:28.040 --> 05:39:30.040
[Guest]: The point of entry is so expensive

05:39:30.040 --> 05:39:32.040
[Guest]: That

05:39:32.040 --> 05:39:34.040
[Guest]: I don't know I mean again so

05:39:34.040 --> 05:39:36.040
[Guest]: I still have hope I still again

05:39:36.040 --> 05:39:38.040
[Guest]: I feel like this generation is making it

05:39:38.040 --> 05:39:40.040
[Guest]: Normal to talk about these issues

05:39:40.040 --> 05:39:42.040
[Guest]: They are putting it out there

05:39:42.040 --> 05:39:44.040
[Guest]: Making it a conversation

05:39:44.040 --> 05:39:46.040
[Guest]: And through that I think like even

05:39:46.040 --> 05:39:48.040
[Guest]: Families now you know are

05:39:48.040 --> 05:39:50.040
[Guest]: Comfortable with I know

05:39:50.040 --> 05:39:52.040
[Guest]: Now some people who are older in the

05:39:52.040 --> 05:39:54.040
[Guest]: Parents age group who

05:39:54.040 --> 05:39:56.040
[Guest]: Have now expressed to the children saying that

05:39:56.040 --> 05:39:58.040
[Guest]: Yeah I'm okay with trying it

05:39:58.040 --> 05:40:00.040
[Guest]: More parents are joining it and I think

05:40:00.040 --> 05:40:02.040
[Guest]: Like we need to look out for the not only

05:40:02.040 --> 05:40:04.040
[Guest]: Our mental health or the mental health of younger folks

05:40:04.040 --> 05:40:06.040
[Guest]: But also the mental health of our older

05:40:06.040 --> 05:40:08.040
[Guest]: You know of older folks you know

05:40:08.040 --> 05:40:10.040
[Guest]: They are probably going through the toughest

05:40:10.040 --> 05:40:12.040
[Guest]: Transition since the pandemic imagine

05:40:12.040 --> 05:40:14.040
[Guest]: Having to stay

05:40:14.040 --> 05:40:16.040
[Guest]: Alone without your children not

05:40:16.040 --> 05:40:18.040
[Guest]: Being able to have that

05:40:18.040 --> 05:40:20.040
[Guest]: Love or hugs from them

05:40:20.040 --> 05:40:22.040
[Guest]: You know being able to touch them because of

05:40:22.040 --> 05:40:24.040
[Guest]: The danger that they might give you something

05:40:24.040 --> 05:40:26.040
[Guest]: How tough it must have been

05:40:26.040 --> 05:40:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And I guess

05:40:28.040 --> 05:40:30.040
[Amit Varma]: You know one of the common misconceptions

05:40:30.040 --> 05:40:32.040
[Amit Varma]: About the subject is

05:40:32.040 --> 05:40:34.040
[Amit Varma]: That the mind is something different from the

05:40:34.040 --> 05:40:36.040
[Guest]: Body there's a ghost in the machine

05:40:36.040 --> 05:40:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is no the mind is part of the

05:40:38.040 --> 05:40:40.040
[Amit Varma]: You know the brain is part of the body

05:40:40.040 --> 05:40:42.040
[Amit Varma]: You know shit happens like one of my

05:40:42.040 --> 05:40:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Favorite musicians Chris Cornell

05:40:44.040 --> 05:40:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Went because he started taking

05:40:46.040 --> 05:40:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Unrelated medication for something

05:40:48.040 --> 05:40:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Which caused him to be more suicidal

05:40:50.040 --> 05:40:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Thorachemical imbalance shifted

05:40:52.040 --> 05:40:54.040
[Amit Varma]: This happened that happened

05:40:54.040 --> 05:40:56.040
[Amit Varma]: So you would have asked

05:40:56.040 --> 05:40:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Yourself at some point what is causing this

05:40:58.040 --> 05:41:00.040
[Amit Varma]: What was the

05:41:00.040 --> 05:41:02.040
[Amit Varma]: You know what were the kind of

05:41:02.040 --> 05:41:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Answers that you looked at

05:41:04.040 --> 05:41:06.040
[Guest]: So there are two aspects to this and you know

05:41:06.040 --> 05:41:08.040
[Guest]: Again let me again start by saying

05:41:08.040 --> 05:41:10.040
[Guest]: That I am not a trained professional

05:41:10.040 --> 05:41:12.040
[Guest]: I only know I only have lived experience

05:41:12.040 --> 05:41:14.040
[Guest]: And I can only speak from that

05:41:14.040 --> 05:41:16.040
[Guest]: But there is of course this

05:41:16.040 --> 05:41:18.040
[Guest]: One

05:41:18.040 --> 05:41:20.040
[Guest]: You know medical thinking that says

05:41:20.040 --> 05:41:22.040
[Guest]: It is chemical imbalance only

05:41:22.040 --> 05:41:24.040
[Guest]: And then you take pills and you get better

05:41:24.040 --> 05:41:26.040
[Guest]: And then there is the psychotherapy

05:41:26.040 --> 05:41:28.040
[Guest]: You know line of thought

05:41:28.040 --> 05:41:30.040
[Guest]: Which sometimes you do with medicines

05:41:30.040 --> 05:41:32.040
[Guest]: And say you know it's both

05:41:32.040 --> 05:41:34.040
[Guest]: But the second one is more about

05:41:34.040 --> 05:41:36.040
[Guest]: Well it is suicidal it is coming from

05:41:36.040 --> 05:41:38.040
[Guest]: You know

05:41:38.040 --> 05:41:40.040
[Guest]: Deep seated

05:41:40.040 --> 05:41:42.040
[Guest]: Issues that could even have started in childhood

05:41:42.040 --> 05:41:44.040
[Guest]: That are now acting up

05:41:44.040 --> 05:41:46.040
[Guest]: So sometimes it is one or the other

05:41:46.040 --> 05:41:48.040
[Guest]: Sometimes it is both again

05:41:48.040 --> 05:41:50.040
[Guest]: And that's what I have been told and that's what

05:41:50.040 --> 05:41:52.040
[Guest]: I have found out

05:41:52.040 --> 05:41:54.040
[Guest]: I think that a lot of

05:41:54.040 --> 05:41:56.040
[Guest]: Mental health issues today

05:41:56.040 --> 05:41:58.040
[Guest]: Are not

05:41:58.040 --> 05:42:00.040
[Guest]: Just because of chemical imbalance

05:42:00.040 --> 05:42:02.040
[Guest]: Which is one extreme

05:42:02.040 --> 05:42:04.040
[Guest]: You know which is one in the spectrum

05:42:04.040 --> 05:42:06.040
[Guest]: There is that but that is when

05:42:06.040 --> 05:42:08.040
[Guest]: You it's really you know and sometimes it

05:42:08.040 --> 05:42:10.040
[Guest]: Borders then on mental illness

05:42:10.040 --> 05:42:12.040
[Guest]: You know where you do need medication

05:42:12.040 --> 05:42:14.040
[Guest]: To

05:42:14.040 --> 05:42:16.040
[Guest]: Help and that's completely okay right

05:42:16.040 --> 05:42:18.040
[Guest]: On the other hand what

05:42:18.040 --> 05:42:20.040
[Guest]: Depression anxiety in a lot of people today

05:42:20.040 --> 05:42:22.040
[Guest]: And these words are being thrown around a lot

05:42:22.040 --> 05:42:24.040
[Guest]: Without full context to them

05:42:24.040 --> 05:42:26.040
[Guest]: But

05:42:26.040 --> 05:42:28.040
[Guest]: They come from the lies

05:42:28.040 --> 05:42:30.040
[Guest]: This whole conversation that we have had

05:42:30.040 --> 05:42:32.040
[Guest]: Has been about that only

05:42:32.040 --> 05:42:34.040
[Guest]: I found out as I said in my therapy

05:42:34.040 --> 05:42:36.040
[Guest]: That it happened because I am a man

05:42:36.040 --> 05:42:38.040
[Guest]: Because I was I had

05:42:38.040 --> 05:42:40.040
[Guest]: Burdened myself to live

05:42:40.040 --> 05:42:42.040
[Guest]: The story

05:42:42.040 --> 05:42:44.040
[Guest]: That was told to me by society

05:42:44.040 --> 05:42:46.040
[Guest]: To such a large extent

05:42:46.040 --> 05:42:48.040
[Guest]: That I started getting anxiety

05:42:48.040 --> 05:42:50.040
[Guest]: About

05:42:50.040 --> 05:42:52.040
[Guest]: Where do I even go from here

05:42:52.040 --> 05:42:54.040
[Guest]: I have nothing left to do

05:42:54.040 --> 05:42:56.040
[Guest]: I have ticked off all the

05:42:56.040 --> 05:42:58.040
[Guest]: You know

05:42:58.040 --> 05:43:00.040
[Guest]: Check boxes that I was given as a

05:43:00.040 --> 05:43:02.040
[Guest]: Young kid as a man

05:43:02.040 --> 05:43:04.040
[Guest]: To fulfill by a certain age and I fulfilled

05:43:04.040 --> 05:43:06.040
[Guest]: It but now what

05:43:06.040 --> 05:43:08.040
[Guest]: Where do I go from here I am already

05:43:08.040 --> 05:43:10.040
[Guest]: At Yashraj I am 30 I have

05:43:10.040 --> 05:43:12.040
[Guest]: Become GM at Yashraj

05:43:12.040 --> 05:43:14.040
[Guest]: What next

05:43:14.040 --> 05:43:16.040
[Guest]: Maybe I become AVP maybe I become

05:43:16.040 --> 05:43:18.040
[Guest]: President or whatever

05:43:18.040 --> 05:43:20.040
[Guest]: I make more films I make more shows

05:43:20.040 --> 05:43:22.040
[Guest]: And that's it I just keep doing that

05:43:22.040 --> 05:43:24.040
[Guest]: Over and over again and sometimes that's enough right

05:43:24.040 --> 05:43:26.040
[Guest]: For a lot of people and that's enough

05:43:26.040 --> 05:43:28.040
[Guest]: But I was just like

05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:30.040
[Guest]: I had this idea that again

05:43:30.040 --> 05:43:32.040
[Guest]: Are you happy after retirement

05:43:32.040 --> 05:43:34.040
[Guest]: If you accomplish milestones there will be some

05:43:34.040 --> 05:43:36.040
[Guest]: Like joy at the end of it

05:43:36.040 --> 05:43:38.040
[Guest]: But there was no particular

05:43:38.040 --> 05:43:40.040
[Guest]: Joy after making those web shows

05:43:40.040 --> 05:43:42.040
[Guest]: Or making those things it was a

05:43:42.040 --> 05:43:44.040
[Guest]: Great thing

05:43:44.040 --> 05:43:46.040
[Guest]: But I had put all the burden

05:43:46.040 --> 05:43:48.040
[Guest]: Of my joy

05:43:48.040 --> 05:43:50.040
[Guest]: Linked to my success

05:43:50.040 --> 05:43:52.040
[Guest]: Because as a man that is what I was

05:43:52.040 --> 05:43:54.040
[Guest]: Told you hit these milestones

05:43:54.040 --> 05:43:56.040
[Guest]: And that is success and that success

05:43:56.040 --> 05:43:58.040
[Guest]: Is equal to happiness

05:43:58.040 --> 05:44:00.040
[Guest]: But I found out that to be patently false

05:44:00.040 --> 05:44:02.040
[Guest]: You know success and

05:44:02.040 --> 05:44:04.040
[Guest]: Happiness have nothing to do with each other

05:44:04.040 --> 05:44:06.040
[Guest]: And what is success

05:44:06.040 --> 05:44:08.040
[Guest]: This idea of success is flawed

05:44:08.040 --> 05:44:10.040
[Guest]: It's the stupidest idea in the world

05:44:10.040 --> 05:44:12.040
[Guest]: What is success

05:44:12.040 --> 05:44:14.040
[Guest]: It is

05:44:14.040 --> 05:44:16.040
[Guest]: It's so ridiculous

05:44:16.040 --> 05:44:18.040
[Guest]: That we have put we have

05:44:18.040 --> 05:44:20.040
[Guest]: Quantified success

05:44:20.040 --> 05:44:22.040
[Guest]: As

05:44:22.040 --> 05:44:24.040
[Guest]: Things you something

05:44:24.040 --> 05:44:26.040
[Guest]: You achieve if you do one two three

05:44:26.040 --> 05:44:28.040
[Guest]: Four steps you know

05:44:30.040 --> 05:44:32.040
[Guest]: And I can tell you

05:44:32.040 --> 05:44:34.040
[Guest]: Any person who becomes successful

05:44:34.040 --> 05:44:36.040
[Guest]: Is unhappy because there is always

05:44:36.040 --> 05:44:38.040
[Guest]: Another more successful person out there

05:44:38.040 --> 05:44:40.040
[Guest]: That he or she then compares themselves to

05:44:40.040 --> 05:44:42.040
[Guest]: And that's the

05:44:42.040 --> 05:44:44.040
[Guest]: And that's what it is

05:44:44.040 --> 05:44:46.040
[Guest]: Once you hit a milestone there are more milestones

05:44:46.040 --> 05:44:48.040
[Guest]: Once you hit your goals there are more goals

05:44:48.040 --> 05:44:50.040
[Guest]: Once you hit a certain kind of success

05:44:50.040 --> 05:44:52.040
[Guest]: There is more success

05:44:52.040 --> 05:44:54.040
[Guest]: Shahrukh Khan has had

05:44:54.040 --> 05:44:56.040
[Guest]: Many flops and he is Shahrukh Khan

05:44:56.040 --> 05:44:58.040
[Guest]: Amitabh Bachchan went through this

05:44:58.040 --> 05:45:00.040
[Guest]: Entire phase where he was

05:45:00.040 --> 05:45:02.040
[Guest]: He didn't have money and he was Amitabh Bachchan

05:45:02.040 --> 05:45:04.040
[Guest]: You know and I am giving you

05:45:04.040 --> 05:45:06.040
[Guest]: References from Bollywood but I am saying that

05:45:06.040 --> 05:45:08.040
[Guest]: Tell me one person who has always been successful

05:45:08.040 --> 05:45:10.040
[Guest]: And that's it he has made it

05:45:10.040 --> 05:45:12.040
[Guest]: And Khatam there is no such thing once you make it

05:45:12.040 --> 05:45:14.040
[Guest]: It's not over you still have to do

05:45:14.040 --> 05:45:16.040
[Guest]: Continue staying relevant I have to do more

05:45:16.040 --> 05:45:18.040
[Guest]: To continue being in that position

05:45:18.040 --> 05:45:20.040
[Guest]: So it's a never ending cycle

05:45:20.040 --> 05:45:22.040
[Guest]: It's a trap this idea

05:45:22.040 --> 05:45:24.040
[Guest]: Of success is a trap and the more

05:45:24.040 --> 05:45:26.040
[Guest]: You chase that idea the more you chase

05:45:26.040 --> 05:45:28.040
[Guest]: This thought that you know once I hit

05:45:28.040 --> 05:45:30.040
[Guest]: These X Y Z milestones

05:45:30.040 --> 05:45:32.040
[Guest]: Then I can be happy then you are

05:45:32.040 --> 05:45:34.040
[Guest]: Never going to be happy I am so sorry to say

05:45:34.040 --> 05:45:36.040
[Guest]: That but that's just how it is because

05:45:36.040 --> 05:45:38.040
[Guest]: You are always something else

05:45:38.040 --> 05:45:40.040
[Guest]: It happened with me when I was in

05:45:40.040 --> 05:45:42.040
[Guest]: School when I was told

05:45:42.040 --> 05:45:44.040
[Guest]: That you know well I mean everybody is told

05:45:44.040 --> 05:45:46.040
[Guest]: Right if you do 10th then

05:45:46.040 --> 05:45:48.040
[Guest]: You will be set for 12th

05:45:48.040 --> 05:45:50.040
[Guest]: But it also happens when

05:45:50.040 --> 05:45:52.040
[Guest]: You know if you are an overachiever

05:45:52.040 --> 05:45:54.040
[Guest]: Or whatever it is

05:45:54.040 --> 05:45:56.040
[Guest]: First your parents tell you to top in class

05:45:56.040 --> 05:45:58.040
[Guest]: Very good

05:45:58.040 --> 05:46:00.040
[Guest]: And then you top in class then you top in school

05:46:00.040 --> 05:46:02.040
[Guest]: Then you top in school

05:46:02.040 --> 05:46:04.040
[Guest]: Now you have to top in the district

05:46:04.040 --> 05:46:06.040
[Guest]: Now you have topped there but you have topped in India

05:46:06.040 --> 05:46:08.040
[Guest]: You have topped in India but

05:46:08.040 --> 05:46:10.040
[Guest]: Where are you when it comes to Harvard and international students

05:46:10.040 --> 05:46:12.040
[Guest]: You know who in the world

05:46:12.040 --> 05:46:14.040
[Guest]: Are you

05:46:14.040 --> 05:46:16.040
[Guest]: There is always going to be someone

05:46:16.040 --> 05:46:18.040
[Guest]: You will either compare yourself with

05:46:18.040 --> 05:46:20.040
[Guest]: Or others people will compare you with

05:46:20.040 --> 05:46:22.040
[Guest]: And it will never be enough

05:46:22.040 --> 05:46:24.040
[Guest]: It will never ever ever be enough

05:46:24.040 --> 05:46:26.040
[Guest]: And that is 99%

05:46:26.040 --> 05:46:28.040
[Guest]: Of the issues because of which we have mental health

05:46:28.040 --> 05:46:30.040
[Guest]: Issues in our country because we have this

05:46:30.040 --> 05:46:32.040
[Guest]: Conditioned idea

05:46:32.040 --> 05:46:34.040
[Guest]: Of what success should look like

05:46:34.040 --> 05:46:36.040
[Guest]: This will be the designation, this much money should be there

05:46:36.040 --> 05:46:38.040
[Guest]: Whatever it is but none

05:46:38.040 --> 05:46:40.040
[Guest]: Of that is success in my opinion

05:46:40.040 --> 05:46:42.040
[Guest]: And in my belief system

05:46:42.040 --> 05:46:44.040
[Guest]: I feel like success is

05:46:44.040 --> 05:46:46.040
[Guest]: Being able to

05:46:46.040 --> 05:46:48.040
[Guest]: You know live a day in which

05:46:48.040 --> 05:46:50.040
[Guest]: When you wake up in the morning you are happy to do whatever the hell

05:46:50.040 --> 05:46:52.040
[Guest]: You are doing that's success

05:46:52.040 --> 05:46:54.040
[Guest]: That's as it's as simple

05:46:54.040 --> 05:46:56.040
[Guest]: As that are you you call it

05:46:56.040 --> 05:46:58.040
[Guest]: Monday morning Monday blues or whatever it is

05:46:58.040 --> 05:47:00.040
[Guest]: I am not saying that you can't have them you can have them

05:47:00.040 --> 05:47:02.040
[Guest]: But you dislike your life because

05:47:02.040 --> 05:47:04.040
[Guest]: You have broken it into

05:47:04.040 --> 05:47:06.040
[Guest]: Like you know okay I go to

05:47:06.040 --> 05:47:08.040
[Guest]: Work and then I come to home and work

05:47:08.040 --> 05:47:10.040
[Guest]: Is bad and home is good and

05:47:10.040 --> 05:47:12.040
[Guest]: At the end of work if I am getting money then it's fine

05:47:12.040 --> 05:47:14.040
[Guest]: If the appraisal is good then it's fine

05:47:14.040 --> 05:47:16.040
[Guest]: But 80% of the you know

05:47:16.040 --> 05:47:18.040
[Guest]: Everybody is on autopilot

05:47:18.040 --> 05:47:20.040
[Guest]: Just living this hoping that you know

05:47:20.040 --> 05:47:22.040
[Guest]: Someday when I get this appraisal when I get this

05:47:22.040 --> 05:47:24.040
[Guest]: When I unlock this level of

05:47:24.040 --> 05:47:26.040
[Guest]: My career that's when happiness will come

05:47:26.040 --> 05:47:28.040
[Guest]: But that's none of that is

05:47:28.040 --> 05:47:30.040
[Guest]: How it is going to work out

05:47:30.040 --> 05:47:32.040
[Guest]: You need to

05:47:32.040 --> 05:47:34.040
[Guest]: Be at peace with the idea

05:47:34.040 --> 05:47:36.040
[Guest]: That

05:47:36.040 --> 05:47:38.040
[Guest]: Success is a notion

05:47:38.040 --> 05:47:40.040
[Guest]: That has been again put by a system

05:47:40.040 --> 05:47:42.040
[Guest]: That wants to

05:47:42.040 --> 05:47:44.040
[Guest]: Capitalist system that wants

05:47:44.040 --> 05:47:46.040
[Guest]: To continue running on the

05:47:46.040 --> 05:47:48.040
[Guest]: On your hamster wheel

05:47:48.040 --> 05:47:50.040
[Guest]: That is what success is

05:47:50.040 --> 05:47:52.040
[Guest]: If you have a family

05:47:52.040 --> 05:47:54.040
[Guest]: That you love and loves about you

05:47:54.040 --> 05:47:56.040
[Guest]: That loves you back that's success also

05:47:56.040 --> 05:47:58.040
[Guest]: If you have

05:47:58.040 --> 05:48:00.040
[Guest]: Something that you love doing that you find joy in

05:48:00.040 --> 05:48:02.040
[Guest]: That's success also

05:48:02.040 --> 05:48:04.040
[Guest]: If you you know and it could be anything

05:48:04.040 --> 05:48:06.040
[Guest]: If you have

05:48:06.040 --> 05:48:08.040
[Guest]: 1 lakh rupees but you are

05:48:08.040 --> 05:48:10.040
[Guest]: Happy in that 1 lakh rupees or you don't

05:48:10.040 --> 05:48:12.040
[Guest]: But you are

05:48:12.040 --> 05:48:14.040
[Guest]: Content in that

05:48:14.040 --> 05:48:16.040
[Guest]: 1 lakh rupees that's success

05:48:16.040 --> 05:48:18.040
[Guest]: There is no other thing

05:48:18.040 --> 05:48:20.040
[Guest]: And that's also happiness

05:48:20.040 --> 05:48:22.040
[Guest]: Happiness I feel again in my

05:48:22.040 --> 05:48:24.040
[Guest]: Personal opinion I just feel like you know

05:48:24.040 --> 05:48:26.040
[Guest]: We look for happiness in the big things but happiness

05:48:26.040 --> 05:48:28.040
[Guest]: Always in the smaller things

05:48:28.040 --> 05:48:30.040
[Guest]: It is in the joy of the present

05:48:30.040 --> 05:48:32.040
[Guest]: Versus the

05:48:32.040 --> 05:48:34.040
[Guest]: Idea of the future

05:48:34.040 --> 05:48:36.040
[Guest]: Versus the

05:48:36.040 --> 05:48:38.040
[Guest]: It's so hard for us to find it

05:48:38.040 --> 05:48:40.040
[Guest]: And some of this again coming back to how

05:48:40.040 --> 05:48:42.040
[Guest]: Internet you know the internet

05:48:42.040 --> 05:48:44.040
[Guest]: Today is all about what's next

05:48:44.040 --> 05:48:46.040
[Guest]: You are consuming things in a way

05:48:46.040 --> 05:48:48.040
[Guest]: Where

05:48:48.040 --> 05:48:50.040
[Guest]: You are making that victory

05:48:50.040 --> 05:48:52.040
[Guest]: It's like I am now watching

05:48:52.040 --> 05:48:54.040
[Guest]: One reel but this is fun

05:48:54.040 --> 05:48:56.040
[Guest]: I like it but I have to go to the next one

05:48:56.040 --> 05:48:58.040
[Guest]: Because that can be better

05:48:58.040 --> 05:49:00.040
[Guest]: Then I have to go to the next one that's better

05:49:00.040 --> 05:49:02.040
[Guest]: So you have also been conditioned to think that whatever is coming next is going to be

05:49:02.040 --> 05:49:04.040
[Guest]: Much better than the one

05:49:04.040 --> 05:49:06.040
[Guest]: How do you survive in the system

05:49:06.040 --> 05:49:08.040
[Guest]: Obviously everybody has anxiety

05:49:08.040 --> 05:49:10.040
[Guest]: And depression everybody is going through it

05:49:10.040 --> 05:49:12.040
[Guest]: Without even recognizing it because this is

05:49:12.040 --> 05:49:14.040
[Guest]: A system that is made to

05:49:14.040 --> 05:49:16.040
[Guest]: You know screw with your mental health

05:49:16.040 --> 05:49:18.040
[Guest]: You are not allowed to live in the present

05:49:18.040 --> 05:49:20.040
[Guest]: Imagine you are on twitter right now and you see that

05:49:20.040 --> 05:49:22.040
[Guest]: Okay there is you know unfortunately a

05:49:22.040 --> 05:49:24.040
[Guest]: A tragedy that has happened in an estate

05:49:24.040 --> 05:49:26.040
[Guest]: And you are seeing that

05:49:26.040 --> 05:49:28.040
[Guest]: Video of that tragedy and you are just feeling really

05:49:28.040 --> 05:49:30.040
[Guest]: Bad about it

05:49:30.040 --> 05:49:32.040
[Guest]: And before you can think or process

05:49:32.040 --> 05:49:34.040
[Guest]: The next tweet is about

05:49:34.040 --> 05:49:36.040
[Guest]: A film you love and a really funny

05:49:36.040 --> 05:49:38.040
[Guest]: Visual from that film and you are like oh

05:49:38.040 --> 05:49:40.040
[Guest]: Haha and before you can

05:49:40.040 --> 05:49:42.040
[Guest]: Think about that or stay on that

05:49:42.040 --> 05:49:44.040
[Guest]: There is someone that

05:49:44.040 --> 05:49:46.040
[Guest]: You know who has said something which has offended

05:49:46.040 --> 05:49:48.040
[Guest]: You and you are just like I am angry now

05:49:48.040 --> 05:49:50.040
[Guest]: And then again you are you see a cat

05:49:50.040 --> 05:49:52.040
[Guest]: Video and you are like oh so cute

05:49:52.040 --> 05:49:54.040
[Guest]: What you are your mind is

05:49:54.040 --> 05:49:56.040
[Guest]: Constantly

05:49:56.040 --> 05:49:58.040
[Guest]: In so many different

05:49:58.040 --> 05:50:00.040
[Guest]: Places because at the

05:50:00.040 --> 05:50:02.040
[Guest]: Same time you are constantly

05:50:02.040 --> 05:50:04.040
[Guest]: Chasing the next high

05:50:04.040 --> 05:50:06.040
[Guest]: That you are now conditioned

05:50:06.040 --> 05:50:08.040
[Guest]: Now we are society conditioned in a larger

05:50:08.040 --> 05:50:10.040
[Guest]: Way it is about you know

05:50:10.040 --> 05:50:12.040
[Guest]: After one year of hard work there is going

05:50:12.040 --> 05:50:14.040
[Guest]: To be appraisal where you will get the money

05:50:14.040 --> 05:50:16.040
[Guest]: And that's when if you are successful you will be

05:50:16.040 --> 05:50:18.040
[Guest]: Happy if you are unsuccessful you will be

05:50:18.040 --> 05:50:20.040
[Guest]: Unhappy that was society telling

05:50:20.040 --> 05:50:22.040
[Guest]: Us now social media apps are telling

05:50:22.040 --> 05:50:24.040
[Guest]: Us well in the same moment

05:50:24.040 --> 05:50:26.040
[Guest]: You know until you go to the next

05:50:26.040 --> 05:50:28.040
[Guest]: Video you will not be happy because the next video has

05:50:28.040 --> 05:50:30.040
[Guest]: Unlocked the happiness for you

05:50:30.040 --> 05:50:32.040
[Guest]: So it's a

05:50:32.040 --> 05:50:34.040
[Guest]: It's very tough

05:50:34.040 --> 05:50:36.040
[Guest]: I am just I get very like

05:50:36.040 --> 05:50:38.040
[Guest]: This is one of those areas that I get very worried about

05:50:38.040 --> 05:50:40.040
[Guest]: Because I feel like there is a

05:50:40.040 --> 05:50:42.040
[Guest]: Epidemic of

05:50:42.040 --> 05:50:44.040
[Guest]: You know

05:50:44.040 --> 05:50:46.040
[Guest]: Mental health you know

05:50:46.040 --> 05:50:48.040
[Guest]: Problems that a country

05:50:48.040 --> 05:50:50.040
[Guest]: And the world at this point is going through

05:50:50.040 --> 05:50:52.040
[Guest]: And we are not

05:50:52.040 --> 05:50:54.040
[Guest]: Talking about it enough

05:50:54.040 --> 05:50:56.040
[Guest]: We are not

05:50:56.040 --> 05:50:58.040
[Guest]: We are not even recognizing that

05:50:58.040 --> 05:51:00.040
[Guest]: This is mental health

05:51:00.040 --> 05:51:02.040
[Guest]: Our attention spans have gone

05:51:02.040 --> 05:51:04.040
[Guest]: For a toss

05:51:04.040 --> 05:51:06.040
[Guest]: We are constantly chasing

05:51:06.040 --> 05:51:08.040
[Guest]: The next high you know

05:51:08.040 --> 05:51:10.040
[Guest]: Relationships have been reduced to swipe right

05:51:10.040 --> 05:51:12.040
[Guest]: Swipe left you know

05:51:12.040 --> 05:51:14.040
[Guest]: Victory and defeat has been you know victory

05:51:14.040 --> 05:51:16.040
[Guest]: And like whatever you know and

05:51:16.040 --> 05:51:18.040
[Guest]: Dopamine is about scrolling up and

05:51:18.040 --> 05:51:20.040
[Guest]: Scrolling down how do you deal

05:51:20.040 --> 05:51:22.040
[Guest]: With this system and where are the support

05:51:22.040 --> 05:51:24.040
[Guest]: For this who is talking about it enough for us

05:51:24.040 --> 05:51:26.040
[Guest]: To kind of be like okay

05:51:26.040 --> 05:51:28.040
[Guest]: I am also going through this

05:51:28.040 --> 05:51:30.040
[Amit Varma]: See one thing

05:51:30.040 --> 05:51:32.040
[Amit Varma]: I can answer that how to

05:51:32.040 --> 05:51:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Avoid the Monday morning blues

05:51:34.040 --> 05:51:36.040
[Amit Varma]: And it's damn easy

05:51:36.040 --> 05:51:38.040
[Amit Varma]: You drink so much that you wake up on Tuesday

05:51:38.040 --> 05:51:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Right

05:51:40.040 --> 05:51:42.040
[Amit Varma]: So there is no question of Monday

05:51:42.040 --> 05:51:44.040
[Amit Varma]: This is the best

05:51:44.040 --> 05:51:46.040
[Amit Varma]: No no you know

05:51:46.040 --> 05:51:48.040
[Amit Varma]: There is this writer called Arthur Brooks

05:51:48.040 --> 05:51:50.040
[Amit Varma]: He has also written a book on happiness

05:51:50.040 --> 05:51:52.040
[Amit Varma]: But there is this essay of

05:51:52.040 --> 05:51:54.040
[Amit Varma]: His that you know with a particular

05:51:54.040 --> 05:51:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Insight that made an impact on me where he

05:51:56.040 --> 05:51:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Spoke about a study

05:51:58.040 --> 05:52:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Which traced the happiness of American

05:52:00.040 --> 05:52:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Men through their lives and his thing

05:52:02.040 --> 05:52:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Was that their happiness is at its lowest

05:52:04.040 --> 05:52:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Point when they are in their

05:52:06.040 --> 05:52:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Mid to late 40s and then

05:52:08.040 --> 05:52:10.040
[Amit Varma]: It starts going up and the reason

05:52:10.040 --> 05:52:12.040
[Amit Varma]: It starts going up is that is around

05:52:12.040 --> 05:52:14.040
[Amit Varma]: The time where you know all their lives have been

05:52:14.040 --> 05:52:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Conditioned that money will come, success will come

05:52:16.040 --> 05:52:18.040
[Amit Varma]: They will be happy that is around

05:52:18.040 --> 05:52:20.040
[Amit Varma]: The point that money came, success came

05:52:20.040 --> 05:52:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And then they realized that this

05:52:22.040 --> 05:52:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Is not happiness and then they turn

05:52:24.040 --> 05:52:26.040
[Amit Varma]: To whatever makes them happy and then they

05:52:26.040 --> 05:52:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Reach their peaks later and what you

05:52:28.040 --> 05:52:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Said about small joys is what I keep

05:52:30.040 --> 05:52:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Saying to people like in the

05:52:32.040 --> 05:52:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Sense that reaching middle age kind of

05:52:34.040 --> 05:52:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Taught me that that you know

05:52:36.040 --> 05:52:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Happiness doesn't come from

05:52:38.040 --> 05:52:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Achieving goals, happiness

05:52:40.040 --> 05:52:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Comes from just seeing what is around you

05:52:42.040 --> 05:52:44.040
[Guest]: And finding joy in that

05:52:44.040 --> 05:52:46.040
[Guest]: Something as mundane as air conditioning

05:52:46.040 --> 05:52:48.040
[Guest]: Which is a miracle

05:52:48.040 --> 05:52:50.040
[Guest]: Of modern technology

05:52:50.040 --> 05:52:52.040
[Guest]: Absolutely

05:52:52.040 --> 05:52:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And yeah so I would say that

05:52:54.040 --> 05:52:56.040
[Amit Varma]: At least mentally I have sorted that

05:52:56.040 --> 05:52:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Little bit out, I feel frustrated and angry

05:52:58.040 --> 05:53:00.040
[Amit Varma]: With myself because I haven't had the discipline

05:53:00.040 --> 05:53:02.040
[Amit Varma]: To do many things I want to do

05:53:02.040 --> 05:53:04.040
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time I am like thankful

05:53:04.040 --> 05:53:06.040
[Unknown]: Every day that I am getting good food

05:53:06.040 --> 05:53:08.040
[Amit Varma]: That I am listening to good music

05:53:08.040 --> 05:53:10.040
[Amit Varma]: You know

05:53:10.040 --> 05:53:12.040
[Amit Varma]: That there is a shower

05:53:12.040 --> 05:53:14.040
[Amit Varma]: You know I grew up in the 80s and the 90s

05:53:14.040 --> 05:53:16.040
[Unknown]: There was a bucket bath in India

05:53:16.040 --> 05:53:18.040
[Guest]: You could never imagine that a time will come

05:53:18.040 --> 05:53:20.040
[Guest]: Where we will shower everyday

05:53:20.040 --> 05:53:22.040
[Guest]: I have lived 4 years in a hostel

05:53:22.040 --> 05:53:24.040
[Amit Varma]: So I am very like totally know this

05:53:24.040 --> 05:53:26.040
[Amit Varma]: I know I probably take small joys to an

05:53:26.040 --> 05:53:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Extreme because I was hanging out with a couple of

05:53:28.040 --> 05:53:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Friends the other day

05:53:30.040 --> 05:53:32.040
[Amit Varma]: And I told them about

05:53:32.040 --> 05:53:34.040
[Amit Varma]: This awesome coffee body wash

05:53:34.040 --> 05:53:36.040
[Unknown]: Which I linked from the show notes

05:53:36.040 --> 05:53:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And I said it's the best shower gel I have ever used

05:53:38.040 --> 05:53:40.040
[Amit Varma]: And they were both

05:53:40.040 --> 05:53:42.040
[Amit Varma]: So amused, why could you

05:53:42.040 --> 05:53:44.040
[Guest]: You know so that's probably taking

05:53:44.040 --> 05:53:46.040
[Guest]: Small joys to an extreme

05:53:46.040 --> 05:53:48.040
[Guest]: You know you are

05:53:48.040 --> 05:53:50.040
[Guest]: Amit like I think that even the air

05:53:50.040 --> 05:53:52.040
[Guest]: Conditioning as you said right

05:53:52.040 --> 05:53:54.040
[Guest]: Most of us are not present for these

05:53:54.040 --> 05:53:56.040
[Guest]: Moments because our minds are always

05:53:56.040 --> 05:53:58.040
[Guest]: Attuned to be in the future

05:53:58.040 --> 05:54:00.040
[Guest]: To the next thing

05:54:00.040 --> 05:54:02.040
[Guest]: How many of us are really living

05:54:02.040 --> 05:54:04.040
[Guest]: And I say this about myself also

05:54:04.040 --> 05:54:06.040
[Guest]: I am not some saint or whatever it is

05:54:06.040 --> 05:54:08.040
[Guest]: I have struggled with the same thing

05:54:08.040 --> 05:54:10.040
[Guest]: Exactly the same thing

05:54:10.040 --> 05:54:12.040
[Guest]: And I have to catch myself

05:54:12.040 --> 05:54:14.040
[Guest]: And be like no I am going to be in the present now

05:54:14.040 --> 05:54:16.040
[Guest]: You know especially when there are

05:54:16.040 --> 05:54:18.040
[Guest]: When I am with people I love

05:54:18.040 --> 05:54:20.040
[Guest]: When I am watching something that I really enjoy

05:54:20.040 --> 05:54:22.040
[Guest]: When I am having an experience that I have

05:54:22.040 --> 05:54:24.040
[Guest]: Waited for

05:54:24.040 --> 05:54:26.040
[Guest]: As soon as my mind starts moving to the next thing

05:54:26.040 --> 05:54:28.040
[Guest]: I have to hold it back and be like

05:54:28.040 --> 05:54:30.040
[Guest]: No

05:54:30.040 --> 05:54:32.040
[Guest]: I have waited for this and I am going to enjoy the hell out of it

05:54:32.040 --> 05:54:34.040
[Guest]: And it could be a great thing

05:54:34.040 --> 05:54:36.040
[Guest]: I love like

05:54:36.040 --> 05:54:38.040
[Guest]: You know

05:54:38.040 --> 05:54:40.040
[Guest]: Bathtubs whenever I travel and I get to stay

05:54:40.040 --> 05:54:42.040
[Guest]: In a hotel when there is a bathtub

05:54:42.040 --> 05:54:44.040
[Guest]: I get so happy

05:54:44.040 --> 05:54:46.040
[Guest]: And you know earlier

05:54:46.040 --> 05:54:48.040
[Guest]: It was and this is one of the things

05:54:48.040 --> 05:54:50.040
[Guest]: Again you start recognizing yourself

05:54:50.040 --> 05:54:52.040
[Guest]: Because earlier

05:54:52.040 --> 05:54:54.040
[Guest]: I would just be like

05:54:54.040 --> 05:54:56.040
[Guest]: I don't have time now

05:54:56.040 --> 05:54:58.040
[Guest]: Lots of work has happened so I will do it in the morning

05:54:58.040 --> 05:55:00.040
[Guest]: Before going from the hotel

05:55:00.040 --> 05:55:02.040
[Guest]: And then in the morning you get late

05:55:02.040 --> 05:55:04.040
[Guest]: And then you just miss out

05:55:04.040 --> 05:55:06.040
[Guest]: And now if I get to a hotel

05:55:06.040 --> 05:55:08.040
[Unknown]: There is a bathtub

05:55:08.040 --> 05:55:10.040
[Guest]: I am not missing this opportunity

05:55:10.040 --> 05:55:12.040
[Guest]: I am going to

05:55:12.040 --> 05:55:14.040
[Guest]: Have this warm lovely

05:55:14.040 --> 05:55:16.040
[Guest]: Luxurious bath

05:55:16.040 --> 05:55:18.040
[Guest]: In this whatever

05:55:18.040 --> 05:55:20.040
[Guest]: Bathtub in a mid

05:55:20.040 --> 05:55:22.040
[Guest]: Hotel because

05:55:22.040 --> 05:55:24.040
[Guest]: It makes me happy and I know it

05:55:24.040 --> 05:55:26.040
[Guest]: And that is happiness also

05:55:26.040 --> 05:55:28.040
[Guest]: The happiness can be as

05:55:28.040 --> 05:55:30.040
[Guest]: Beautiful and lovely as

05:55:30.040 --> 05:55:32.040
[Guest]: Spending time with the people you love

05:55:32.040 --> 05:55:34.040
[Guest]: Or pursuing a habit

05:55:34.040 --> 05:55:36.040
[Guest]: Or a passion

05:55:36.040 --> 05:55:38.040
[Guest]: That you love

05:55:38.040 --> 05:55:40.040
[Guest]: Nothing makes me happier than being in a writer's room

05:55:40.040 --> 05:55:42.040
[Guest]: And jamming on stories

05:55:42.040 --> 05:55:44.040
[Guest]: Happiest high that I have in my work days

05:55:44.040 --> 05:55:46.040
[Guest]: At the same time

05:55:46.040 --> 05:55:48.040
[Guest]: I have started recognizing that even on

05:55:48.040 --> 05:55:50.040
[Guest]: You know tough days at work

05:55:50.040 --> 05:55:52.040
[Guest]: Sometimes you know happiness can be

05:55:52.040 --> 05:55:54.040
[Guest]: Just the fact that you have someone to share it with

05:55:54.040 --> 05:55:56.040
[Guest]: And that's also happiness

05:55:56.040 --> 05:55:58.040
[Guest]: It's not about having the

05:55:58.040 --> 05:56:00.040
[Guest]: Best day ever but it's also

05:56:00.040 --> 05:56:02.040
[Guest]: It's about finding

05:56:02.040 --> 05:56:04.040
[Guest]: Something you know lovely in

05:56:04.040 --> 05:56:06.040
[Guest]: Even the tough times

05:56:06.040 --> 05:56:08.040
[Guest]: And I am not talking about toxic positivity

05:56:08.040 --> 05:56:10.040
[Guest]: I am just talking about the fact that we just

05:56:10.040 --> 05:56:12.040
[Guest]: Need to be more present to be able

05:56:12.040 --> 05:56:14.040
[Guest]: To appreciate

05:56:14.040 --> 05:56:16.040
[Guest]: The

05:56:16.040 --> 05:56:18.040
[Guest]: Life that we are all leading

05:56:18.040 --> 05:56:20.040
[Guest]: We have so much privilege

05:56:20.040 --> 05:56:22.040
[Guest]: Constantly we should be

05:56:22.040 --> 05:56:24.040
[Guest]: Feeling gratitude

05:56:24.040 --> 05:56:26.040
[Guest]: Thank god we have this privilege

05:56:26.040 --> 05:56:28.040
[Guest]: In a country where

05:56:28.040 --> 05:56:30.040
[Guest]: Maximum number of people don't have this

05:56:30.040 --> 05:56:32.040
[Amit Varma]: You know so

05:56:32.040 --> 05:56:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Not only should we be feeling gratitude

05:56:34.040 --> 05:56:36.040
[Amit Varma]: We should be feeling gratitude at the fact that we are

05:56:36.040 --> 05:56:38.040
[Guest]: Feeling gratitude

05:56:38.040 --> 05:56:40.040
[Guest]: I am kidding

05:56:40.040 --> 05:56:42.040
[Guest]: You are right

05:56:42.040 --> 05:56:44.040
[Guest]: There are levels to this of course

05:56:44.040 --> 05:56:46.040
[Guest]: There are nuances to this but Amit you are absolutely right

05:56:46.040 --> 05:56:48.040
[Guest]: You know we don't have this self awareness

05:56:48.040 --> 05:56:50.040
[Guest]: Most of the times right now

05:56:50.040 --> 05:56:52.040
[Guest]: You know and again

05:56:52.040 --> 05:56:54.040
[Guest]: So much of that really comes down to the fact that we don't

05:56:54.040 --> 05:56:56.040
[Guest]: We don't question things

05:56:56.040 --> 05:56:58.040
[Guest]: We are just following like

05:56:58.040 --> 05:57:00.040
[Guest]: Until I hit

05:57:00.040 --> 05:57:02.040
[Guest]: That 30 and then anxiety

05:57:02.040 --> 05:57:04.040
[Guest]: Happened and 30 also by the way it's a marker

05:57:04.040 --> 05:57:06.040
[Guest]: Right that marker also

05:57:06.040 --> 05:57:08.040
[Guest]: Was one of the reasons for the anxiety

05:57:08.040 --> 05:57:10.040
[Guest]: That I have hit 30 you know

05:57:10.040 --> 05:57:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And what have I done with my life

05:57:12.040 --> 05:57:14.040
[Guest]: You kids

05:57:14.040 --> 05:57:16.040
[Guest]: What should I say

05:57:16.040 --> 05:57:18.040
[Guest]: Yeah so it was

05:57:18.040 --> 05:57:20.040
[Guest]: And that those markers and then

05:57:20.040 --> 05:57:22.040
[Guest]: The last 5-6 years it's only now that

05:57:22.040 --> 05:57:24.040
[Guest]: My self awareness started I am telling you like

05:57:24.040 --> 05:57:26.040
[Guest]: I don't know

05:57:26.040 --> 05:57:28.040
[Guest]: I mean I will tell you something off the record I want to say it on the record

05:57:28.040 --> 05:57:30.040
[Amit Varma]: But I will say something after this

05:57:30.040 --> 05:57:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Okay I will wait

05:57:32.040 --> 05:57:34.040
[Amit Varma]: I will wait

05:57:34.040 --> 05:57:36.040
[Amit Varma]: To hear that no no

05:57:36.040 --> 05:57:38.040
[Amit Varma]: You are vegetarian of course but non-veg listeners

05:57:38.040 --> 05:57:40.040
[Amit Varma]: May appreciate my feeling

05:57:40.040 --> 05:57:42.040
[Amit Varma]: That sometimes I will order a non-veg dish

05:57:42.040 --> 05:57:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And I will be eating it and half way through the dish

05:57:44.040 --> 05:57:46.040
[Amit Varma]: If you ask me Amit are you eating chicken or mutton

05:57:46.040 --> 05:57:48.040
[Amit Varma]: I will then have to look down

05:57:48.040 --> 05:57:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And focus to figure that out

05:57:50.040 --> 05:57:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Because I am so absent minded

05:57:52.040 --> 05:57:54.040
[Amit Varma]: It's like or if you

05:57:54.040 --> 05:57:56.040
[Guest]: Might go to a really good restaurant

05:57:56.040 --> 05:57:58.040
[Guest]: As long as you are happy about it

05:57:58.040 --> 05:58:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah but it's like your mind is somewhere else

05:58:00.040 --> 05:58:02.040
[Amit Varma]: It's on that hedonistic treadmill

05:58:02.040 --> 05:58:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And you are like

05:58:04.040 --> 05:58:06.040
[Amit Varma]: So here is my next question

05:58:06.040 --> 05:58:08.040
[Amit Varma]: About mental health that you pointed out

05:58:08.040 --> 05:58:10.040
[Amit Varma]: That to a certain extent it could be

05:58:10.040 --> 05:58:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Physiological in terms of chemical imbalance

05:58:12.040 --> 05:58:14.040
[Amit Varma]: To a certain extent it's not

05:58:14.040 --> 05:58:16.040
[Amit Varma]: That there are these roles that we are

05:58:16.040 --> 05:58:18.040
[Amit Varma]: Trapped in and all the pressures

05:58:18.040 --> 05:58:20.040
[Amit Varma]: We feel for that so now

05:58:20.040 --> 05:58:22.040
[Amit Varma]: You know one good advice

05:58:22.040 --> 05:58:24.040
[Amit Varma]: About if you have mental health

05:58:24.040 --> 05:58:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Issues what should you do is seek help

05:58:26.040 --> 05:58:28.040
[Amit Varma]: See a therapist all that

05:58:28.040 --> 05:58:30.040
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that

05:58:30.040 --> 05:58:32.040
[Amit Varma]: If some of it is caused

05:58:32.040 --> 05:58:34.040
[Amit Varma]: By these social pressures

05:58:34.040 --> 05:58:36.040
[Amit Varma]: By these situations by these circumstances

05:58:36.040 --> 05:58:38.040
[Amit Varma]: What advice would you give

05:58:38.040 --> 05:58:40.040
[Amit Varma]: To people listening to this

05:58:40.040 --> 05:58:42.040
[Amit Varma]: To be able to mitigate that aspect

05:58:42.040 --> 05:58:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Of the problem

05:58:44.040 --> 05:58:46.040
[Guest]: You know I think acknowledgement is the first step

05:58:46.040 --> 05:58:48.040
[Guest]: It's a very important step

05:58:50.040 --> 05:58:52.040
[Guest]: Discomfort is

05:58:52.040 --> 05:58:54.040
[Guest]: The first step for

05:58:54.040 --> 05:58:56.040
[Guest]: Change

05:58:56.040 --> 05:58:58.040
[Guest]: Discomfort is the first step

05:58:58.040 --> 05:59:00.040
[Guest]: For

05:59:00.040 --> 05:59:02.040
[Guest]: Getting better you know

05:59:02.040 --> 05:59:04.040
[Guest]: You have to stay in that discomfort

05:59:04.040 --> 05:59:06.040
[Guest]: We are not ready to

05:59:08.040 --> 05:59:10.040
[Guest]: It's not easy when your whole life

05:59:10.040 --> 05:59:12.040
[Guest]: You believed in one truth

05:59:12.040 --> 05:59:14.040
[Guest]: To suddenly be like

05:59:14.040 --> 05:59:16.040
[Guest]: Actually there is some other truth

05:59:16.040 --> 05:59:18.040
[Guest]: It's so difficult

05:59:18.040 --> 05:59:20.040
[Guest]: Even therapy or whatever

05:59:20.040 --> 05:59:22.040
[Guest]: You know you take any of these things

05:59:22.040 --> 05:59:24.040
[Guest]: But you learn it's not easy for you to process

05:59:24.040 --> 05:59:26.040
[Guest]: You are talking about things that you

05:59:26.040 --> 05:59:28.040
[Guest]: Really like buried deep

05:59:28.040 --> 05:59:30.040
[Guest]: Inside and then you just

05:59:30.040 --> 05:59:32.040
[Guest]: Hidden them inside and repressed them inside

05:59:32.040 --> 05:59:34.040
[Guest]: This is not you know

05:59:34.040 --> 05:59:36.040
[Guest]: I am not this

05:59:36.040 --> 05:59:38.040
[Guest]: To for me Amit

05:59:38.040 --> 05:59:40.040
[Guest]: It sounds like it's not a big deal

05:59:40.040 --> 05:59:42.040
[Guest]: It might not be a big deal for a lot of people

05:59:42.040 --> 05:59:44.040
[Guest]: But to me to be told that my entire identity

05:59:44.040 --> 05:59:46.040
[Guest]: The reason that I have so much

05:59:46.040 --> 05:59:48.040
[Guest]: Issues in my life is because I am a man

05:59:48.040 --> 05:59:50.040
[Guest]: Was a slap on my face

05:59:50.040 --> 05:59:52.040
[Guest]: Because all my life I have tried

05:59:52.040 --> 05:59:54.040
[Guest]: Not to be one

05:59:54.040 --> 05:59:56.040
[Guest]: And when I say not to be a man

05:59:56.040 --> 05:59:58.040
[Guest]: I am talking about gender roles right now

05:59:58.040 --> 06:00:00.040
[Guest]: I am not going to fit

06:00:00.040 --> 06:00:02.040
[Guest]: Into what a man's roles

06:00:02.040 --> 06:00:04.040
[Guest]: And I realized that I was

06:00:04.040 --> 06:00:06.040
[Guest]: Even trying consciously

06:00:06.040 --> 06:00:08.040
[Guest]: To not emulate

06:00:08.040 --> 06:00:10.040
[Guest]: What I thought a man was supposed to be

06:00:10.040 --> 06:00:12.040
[Guest]: Because of what I saw my father be

06:00:12.040 --> 06:00:14.040
[Guest]: I was still

06:00:14.040 --> 06:00:16.040
[Guest]: Living the narrative of a man only

06:00:16.040 --> 06:00:18.040
[Guest]: And it was such a difficult thing for me to grapple

06:00:18.040 --> 06:00:20.040
[Guest]: With so difficult

06:00:20.040 --> 06:00:22.040
[Guest]: So it is you have to be

06:00:22.040 --> 06:00:24.040
[Guest]: Comfortable with discomfort

06:00:24.040 --> 06:00:26.040
[Guest]: You have to be okay with

06:00:26.040 --> 06:00:28.040
[Guest]: Pain you have to

06:00:28.040 --> 06:00:30.040
[Guest]: Acknowledge it you have to process it

06:00:30.040 --> 06:00:32.040
[Guest]: You have to stay with it

06:00:32.040 --> 06:00:34.040
[Guest]: And it's only after that can change begin

06:00:34.040 --> 06:00:36.040
[Guest]: Until you are

06:00:36.040 --> 06:00:38.040
[Guest]: Until you

06:00:38.040 --> 06:00:40.040
[Guest]: Recognize and are

06:00:40.040 --> 06:00:42.040
[Guest]: Okay with it

06:00:42.040 --> 06:00:44.040
[Guest]: It's okay to

06:00:44.040 --> 06:00:46.040
[Guest]: It really is

06:00:46.040 --> 06:00:48.040
[Guest]: Okay to be told that

06:00:48.040 --> 06:00:50.040
[Guest]: I know it's difficult the pain is very very hard

06:00:50.040 --> 06:00:52.040
[Guest]: Sometimes

06:00:52.040 --> 06:00:54.040
[Guest]: But it's

06:00:54.040 --> 06:00:56.040
[Guest]: Okay

06:00:56.040 --> 06:00:58.040
[Guest]: If you find something about yourself

06:00:58.040 --> 06:01:00.040
[Guest]: That you may not necessarily like

06:01:00.040 --> 06:01:02.040
[Guest]: You don't have to be

06:01:02.040 --> 06:01:04.040
[Guest]: Ashamed of yourself

06:01:04.040 --> 06:01:06.040
[Guest]: You don't have to look down on yourself

06:01:06.040 --> 06:01:08.040
[Guest]: You don't have to judge yourself

06:01:08.040 --> 06:01:10.040
[Guest]: We judge others very quickly

06:01:10.040 --> 06:01:12.040
[Guest]: But most of all we judge ourselves

06:01:12.040 --> 06:01:14.040
[Guest]: The most of all

06:01:14.040 --> 06:01:16.040
[Guest]: I mean there is a thing called

06:01:16.040 --> 06:01:18.040
[Guest]: In therapy terms

06:01:18.040 --> 06:01:20.040
[Guest]: Negative self talk right

06:01:20.040 --> 06:01:22.040
[Guest]: I didn't realize I do it

06:01:22.040 --> 06:01:24.040
[Guest]: So many times my therapist has said

06:01:24.040 --> 06:01:26.040
[Guest]: Stop saying that about yourself

06:01:26.040 --> 06:01:28.040
[Guest]: I did this so stupid of me

06:01:28.040 --> 06:01:30.040
[Guest]: Why are you saying that

06:01:30.040 --> 06:01:32.040
[Guest]: I didn't even realize I have said that

06:01:32.040 --> 06:01:34.040
[Guest]: Because in my head I am just like

06:01:34.040 --> 06:01:36.040
[Guest]: I did something stupid

06:01:36.040 --> 06:01:38.040
[Guest]: No

06:01:38.040 --> 06:01:40.040
[Guest]: You are human you have made a mistake and it's okay

06:01:40.040 --> 06:01:42.040
[Guest]: Why are you constantly

06:01:42.040 --> 06:01:44.040
[Guest]: Telling yourself that you are an idiot

06:01:44.040 --> 06:01:46.040
[Guest]: Because you did something

06:01:46.040 --> 06:01:48.040
[Guest]: You think is wrong

06:01:48.040 --> 06:01:50.040
[Guest]: That's the human experience

06:01:50.040 --> 06:01:52.040
[Guest]: It's okay

06:01:52.040 --> 06:01:54.040
[Guest]: You know I don't have advice

06:01:54.040 --> 06:01:56.040
[Guest]: I don't believe in the idea of

06:01:56.040 --> 06:01:58.040
[Guest]: Giving advice I can share my stories

06:01:58.040 --> 06:02:00.040
[Unknown]: If that resonate with you

06:02:00.040 --> 06:02:02.040
[Guest]: That's amazing

06:02:02.040 --> 06:02:04.040
[Guest]: But yeah I just feel like

06:02:04.040 --> 06:02:06.040
[Guest]: Everybody has to find what works for them

06:02:06.040 --> 06:02:08.040
[Guest]: That's what mental health is

06:02:08.040 --> 06:02:10.040
[Guest]: There is no one glove fit all

06:02:10.040 --> 06:02:12.040
[Guest]: Solution to mental health

06:02:12.040 --> 06:02:14.040
[Guest]: For me when I was going through anxiety

06:02:14.040 --> 06:02:16.040
[Guest]: The things that started helping me

06:02:16.040 --> 06:02:18.040
[Guest]: So anxiety also happens

06:02:18.040 --> 06:02:20.040
[Guest]: When you feel like you are losing control

06:02:20.040 --> 06:02:22.040
[Guest]: There is no

06:02:22.040 --> 06:02:24.040
[Guest]: Like the pandemic

06:02:24.040 --> 06:02:26.040
[Guest]: Why did the pandemic make so many people anxious

06:02:26.040 --> 06:02:28.040
[Guest]: Because suddenly you had lost control

06:02:28.040 --> 06:02:30.040
[Guest]: Of the way

06:02:30.040 --> 06:02:32.040
[Guest]: You lost control of your reality

06:02:32.040 --> 06:02:34.040
[Guest]: A life that you were leading till then

06:02:34.040 --> 06:02:36.040
[Guest]: Was taken away from you

06:02:36.040 --> 06:02:38.040
[Guest]: You don't have any control anymore

06:02:38.040 --> 06:02:40.040
[Guest]: The government has control

06:02:40.040 --> 06:02:42.040
[Guest]: And you have to just stay in your

06:02:42.040 --> 06:02:44.040
[Guest]: Because that's just how it is

06:02:44.040 --> 06:02:46.040
[Guest]: We don't even know how long

06:02:46.040 --> 06:02:48.040
[Guest]: And you have to cede control

06:02:48.040 --> 06:02:50.040
[Guest]: It's very tough to kind of

06:02:50.040 --> 06:02:52.040
[Guest]: Constantly trying to control every truth of your life

06:02:52.040 --> 06:02:54.040
[Guest]: To kind of have that taken away

06:02:54.040 --> 06:02:56.040
[Guest]: So what

06:02:56.040 --> 06:02:58.040
[Guest]: My therapist would tell me

06:02:58.040 --> 06:03:00.040
[Guest]: And what I started kind of doing was

06:03:00.040 --> 06:03:02.040
[Guest]: How do you find little things in your routine

06:03:02.040 --> 06:03:04.040
[Guest]: That you can control

06:03:04.040 --> 06:03:06.040
[Guest]: So that becomes your thing

06:03:06.040 --> 06:03:08.040
[Guest]: I have this

06:03:08.040 --> 06:03:10.040
[Guest]: Everything else might be out of my control

06:03:10.040 --> 06:03:12.040
[Guest]: But this I have

06:03:12.040 --> 06:03:14.040
[Guest]: So reading for me became like a really big

06:03:14.040 --> 06:03:16.040
[Guest]: I really picked up reading again

06:03:16.040 --> 06:03:18.040
[Guest]: Because I have read over the last two and a half years

06:03:18.040 --> 06:03:20.040
[Guest]: In the pandemic particularly

06:03:20.040 --> 06:03:22.040
[Guest]: That in the morning

06:03:22.040 --> 06:03:24.040
[Guest]: I'd get up and just read

06:03:24.040 --> 06:03:26.040
[Guest]: I started waking up really early

06:03:26.040 --> 06:03:28.040
[Guest]: And looking at I have a

06:03:28.040 --> 06:03:30.040
[Guest]: Fortunately a view of the sunrise

06:03:30.040 --> 06:03:32.040
[Guest]: Live opposite RA

06:03:32.040 --> 06:03:34.040
[Guest]: So I can see the sun come up from my window

06:03:34.040 --> 06:03:36.040
[Guest]: So I just started waking up in the morning

06:03:36.040 --> 06:03:38.040
[Guest]: And every morning I just see the sunrise

06:03:38.040 --> 06:03:40.040
[Guest]: Because it was just for me it was

06:03:40.040 --> 06:03:42.040
[Guest]: Like no matter what happens

06:03:42.040 --> 06:03:44.040
[Guest]: With the pandemic this is going to happen every day

06:03:44.040 --> 06:03:46.040
[Guest]: This is the truth that will

06:03:46.040 --> 06:03:48.040
[Guest]: No matter what

06:03:48.040 --> 06:03:50.040
[Guest]: You know it will continue

06:03:50.040 --> 06:03:52.040
[Guest]: You know I

06:03:52.040 --> 06:03:54.040
[Guest]: I did not speak I used to speak to my mother

06:03:54.040 --> 06:03:56.040
[Guest]: Once in a week or twice in a week at that time

06:03:56.040 --> 06:03:58.040
[Guest]: I used to think of myself as that busy

06:03:58.040 --> 06:04:00.040
[Guest]: In the pandemic I have spoken

06:04:00.040 --> 06:04:02.040
[Guest]: Since the pandemic I have spoken to my mother

06:04:02.040 --> 06:04:04.040
[Guest]: On video call every single day

06:04:04.040 --> 06:04:06.040
[Guest]: In the last three years because

06:04:06.040 --> 06:04:08.040
[Guest]: I was so anxious about the fact that

06:04:08.040 --> 06:04:10.040
[Guest]: They live in Bahrain and suddenly

06:04:10.040 --> 06:04:12.040
[Guest]: You know the flights were

06:04:12.040 --> 06:04:14.040
[Guest]: Cancelled and you didn't

06:04:14.040 --> 06:04:16.040
[Guest]: Know when your air travel was gone

06:04:16.040 --> 06:04:18.040
[Guest]: And my parents were staying separately in Bahrain

06:04:18.040 --> 06:04:20.040
[Guest]: And I am staying in Bombay

06:04:20.040 --> 06:04:22.040
[Guest]: And I was in

06:04:22.040 --> 06:04:24.040
[Guest]: Such a bad place

06:04:24.040 --> 06:04:26.040
[Guest]: Such a bad place that I couldn't

06:04:26.040 --> 06:04:28.040
[Guest]: Like for the first month of the

06:04:28.040 --> 06:04:30.040
[Guest]: Pandemic I am not joking I couldn't get up from my bed

06:04:30.040 --> 06:04:32.040
[Guest]: I was just anxious

06:04:32.040 --> 06:04:34.040
[Guest]: So badly because I was like what is going to happen to my parents

06:04:34.040 --> 06:04:36.040
[Guest]: They are in Bahrain

06:04:36.040 --> 06:04:38.040
[Guest]: I am not there to help them

06:04:38.040 --> 06:04:40.040
[Guest]: I am not there to you know quote unquote protect them

06:04:40.040 --> 06:04:42.040
[Guest]: What choices have I made

06:04:42.040 --> 06:04:44.040
[Guest]: In my life that have led to this moment where

06:04:44.040 --> 06:04:46.040
[Guest]: The world has stopped and I am away from my parents

06:04:46.040 --> 06:04:48.040
[Guest]: It was so tough for me

06:04:48.040 --> 06:04:50.040
[Guest]: So tough for me and then I just

06:04:50.040 --> 06:04:52.040
[Guest]: You know thought that maybe I should just

06:04:52.040 --> 06:04:54.040
[Guest]: Talk to my parents everyday

06:04:54.040 --> 06:04:56.040
[Guest]: And then I started having like these video calls with her

06:04:56.040 --> 06:04:58.040
[Guest]: I have never done video calls before

06:04:58.040 --> 06:05:00.040
[Guest]: And then just seeing my mother's face everyday

06:05:00.040 --> 06:05:02.040
[Guest]: My father and I also became closer actually during the pandemic

06:05:02.040 --> 06:05:04.040
[Guest]: Just looked at each other

06:05:04.040 --> 06:05:06.040
[Guest]: And my brother was in the US

06:05:06.040 --> 06:05:08.040
[Guest]: All four of us would get on these video calls and then just

06:05:08.040 --> 06:05:10.040
[Guest]: There was so much

06:05:10.040 --> 06:05:12.040
[Guest]: I don't know just felt

06:05:12.040 --> 06:05:14.040
[Guest]: Peaceful and calm just looking at each other's faces

06:05:14.040 --> 06:05:16.040
[Guest]: Doing that you know we are okay

06:05:16.040 --> 06:05:18.040
[Guest]: And that's something we could control

06:05:18.040 --> 06:05:20.040
[Guest]: We could call each other everyday

06:05:20.040 --> 06:05:22.040
[Guest]: Look at each other's faces and feel peaceful

06:05:22.040 --> 06:05:24.040
[Guest]: So walking

06:05:24.040 --> 06:05:26.040
[Guest]: Was something that I told you

06:05:26.040 --> 06:05:28.040
[Guest]: Actually I want to say this on record also

06:05:28.040 --> 06:05:30.040
[Guest]: Your episodes really

06:05:30.040 --> 06:05:32.040
[Guest]: I am not joking about this

06:05:32.040 --> 06:05:34.040
[Guest]: Your episodes really helped me during some

06:05:34.040 --> 06:05:36.040
[Guest]: Tough days on the pandemic because

06:05:36.040 --> 06:05:38.040
[Guest]: I did not have the

06:05:38.040 --> 06:05:40.040
[Guest]: I did not have

06:05:40.040 --> 06:05:42.040
[Guest]: The will to

06:05:42.040 --> 06:05:44.040
[Guest]: Even go for that walk because I was so in such

06:05:44.040 --> 06:05:46.040
[Guest]: Bad shape and then you know

06:05:46.040 --> 06:05:48.040
[Guest]: I restarted

06:05:48.040 --> 06:05:50.040
[Guest]: When Prem Banekar came on your podcast

06:05:50.040 --> 06:05:52.040
[Guest]: And I was like well here is a man I admire

06:05:52.040 --> 06:05:54.040
[Guest]: Here is another man I admire and they are going to be talking and it's a long conversation

06:05:54.040 --> 06:05:56.040
[Guest]: Maybe this is the reason for me to get out of bed

06:05:56.040 --> 06:05:58.040
[Guest]: And I remember that day I went

06:05:58.040 --> 06:06:00.040
[Guest]: For this really long walk

06:06:00.040 --> 06:06:02.040
[Guest]: And then I came back and I sat in the garden

06:06:02.040 --> 06:06:04.040
[Guest]: Of my building where I had never done before

06:06:04.040 --> 06:06:06.040
[Guest]: My building had a garden and I just never sat there

06:06:06.040 --> 06:06:08.040
[Guest]: And I sat, they have a swing

06:06:08.040 --> 06:06:10.040
[Guest]: And I just sat for the swing and till like

06:06:10.040 --> 06:06:12.040
[Guest]: I think till the

06:06:12.040 --> 06:06:14.040
[Guest]: Episode had ended I just sat there

06:06:14.040 --> 06:06:16.040
[Guest]: And I was just breathed a little more

06:06:16.040 --> 06:06:18.040
[Guest]: And I was like okay

06:06:18.040 --> 06:06:20.040
[Guest]: There is something to do, something to look forward to

06:06:20.040 --> 06:06:22.040
[Guest]: Something to break the monotony of the pandemic

06:06:22.040 --> 06:06:24.040
[Guest]: During that time so you have to

06:06:24.040 --> 06:06:26.040
[Guest]: Find what works for you you know

06:06:26.040 --> 06:06:28.040
[Guest]: And everybody like my wife

06:06:28.040 --> 06:06:30.040
[Guest]: She also got very anxious during the pandemic

06:06:30.040 --> 06:06:32.040
[Guest]: And I can say this because she is so comfortable

06:06:32.040 --> 06:06:34.040
[Guest]: Talking about it

06:06:34.040 --> 06:06:36.040
[Guest]: But she took to painting

06:06:36.040 --> 06:06:38.040
[Guest]: And she was

06:06:38.040 --> 06:06:40.040
[Guest]: She has become a master painter

06:06:40.040 --> 06:06:42.040
[Guest]: She started an Instagram page and she put a painting

06:06:42.040 --> 06:06:44.040
[Guest]: People are like please sell this to us and she is like I don't want to sell this

06:06:44.040 --> 06:06:46.040
[Guest]: I am just doing it for you know

06:06:46.040 --> 06:06:48.040
[Guest]: We are just saying anxiety journaling she was saying anxiety painting

06:06:48.040 --> 06:06:50.040
[Guest]: And it was just

06:06:50.040 --> 06:06:52.040
[Guest]: Gorgeous paintings of flowers and what not

06:06:52.040 --> 06:06:54.040
[Guest]: I am like how are you, what

06:06:54.040 --> 06:06:56.040
[Guest]: My pandemic is

06:06:56.040 --> 06:06:58.040
[Guest]: We are just struggling to reach 4 pages

06:06:58.040 --> 06:07:00.040
[Guest]: Your pandemic is you making this

06:07:00.040 --> 06:07:02.040
[Guest]: Turn your passion into this high art

06:07:02.040 --> 06:07:04.040
[Guest]: What is going on so it is

06:07:04.040 --> 06:07:06.040
[Guest]: That was also like

06:07:06.040 --> 06:07:08.040
[Guest]: How great you are dealing with your

06:07:08.040 --> 06:07:10.040
[Guest]: Anxiety and look like how tough it is

06:07:10.040 --> 06:07:12.040
[Guest]: For me but as I said everybody has different ways

06:07:12.040 --> 06:07:14.040
[Guest]: Of dealing with it and we just need to

06:07:14.040 --> 06:07:16.040
[Guest]: Allow ourselves to find what it is that

06:07:16.040 --> 06:07:18.040
[Guest]: Can help us the most

06:07:18.040 --> 06:07:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about

06:07:20.040 --> 06:07:22.040
[Amit Varma]: The subject that you have spoken about elsewhere

06:07:22.040 --> 06:07:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Also about creativity as therapy

06:07:24.040 --> 06:07:26.040
[Amit Varma]: You know you mentioned that

06:07:26.040 --> 06:07:28.040
[Unknown]: Daisy took to painting and that really helped her

06:07:28.040 --> 06:07:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And

06:07:30.040 --> 06:07:32.040
[Amit Varma]: You know and I have heard other people talk about

06:07:32.040 --> 06:07:34.040
[Amit Varma]: How writing can be like therapy especially people

06:07:34.040 --> 06:07:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Who are kind of journaling everyday

06:07:36.040 --> 06:07:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And all that so and I would

06:07:38.040 --> 06:07:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Imagine that it would

06:07:40.040 --> 06:07:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Not just be actual creativity

06:07:42.040 --> 06:07:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Alone that would be therapeutic

06:07:44.040 --> 06:07:46.040
[Amit Varma]: But even reading

06:07:46.040 --> 06:07:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Books or watching the stories of others

06:07:48.040 --> 06:07:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Could also help what is your

06:07:50.040 --> 06:07:52.040
[Guest]: Sort of experience

06:07:52.040 --> 06:07:54.040
[Guest]: I have watched so many sitcoms I finished like

06:07:54.040 --> 06:07:56.040
[Guest]: Schitt's Creek I think everybody

06:07:56.040 --> 06:07:58.040
[Guest]: Has watched Schitt's Creek during the pandemic

06:07:58.040 --> 06:08:00.040
[Guest]: You know Kim's Convenience I went back to

06:08:00.040 --> 06:08:02.040
[Guest]: The office saw Parks and Rec

06:08:02.040 --> 06:08:04.040
[Guest]: I had finished I had not seen Parks and Rec

06:08:04.040 --> 06:08:06.040
[Guest]: End to end I used to I had seen a lot of episodes

06:08:06.040 --> 06:08:08.040
[Guest]: In between I saw all of it

06:08:08.040 --> 06:08:10.040
[Guest]: For first 6 months every

06:08:10.040 --> 06:08:12.040
[Guest]: I was just finishing sitcoms

06:08:12.040 --> 06:08:14.040
[Guest]: Because I just needed to

06:08:14.040 --> 06:08:16.040
[Guest]: And it was the opposite in the beginning you know in the beginning

06:08:16.040 --> 06:08:18.040
[Guest]: I had to make sense of what was happening

06:08:18.040 --> 06:08:20.040
[Guest]: I just I needed my

06:08:20.040 --> 06:08:22.040
[Guest]: Mind to make sense of like

06:08:22.040 --> 06:08:24.040
[Guest]: What is happening and I am somebody who needed

06:08:24.040 --> 06:08:26.040
[Guest]: Who had kind of

06:08:26.040 --> 06:08:28.040
[Guest]: So I am someone who was very

06:08:28.040 --> 06:08:30.040
[Guest]: Active on Twitter and then when

06:08:30.040 --> 06:08:32.040
[Guest]: China thing happened I had

06:08:32.040 --> 06:08:34.040
[Guest]: Already my anxiety so my

06:08:34.040 --> 06:08:36.040
[Guest]: Anxiety now works in a way where it is

06:08:36.040 --> 06:08:38.040
[Guest]: A warning to me the moment I started getting anxious I am just

06:08:38.040 --> 06:08:40.040
[Guest]: Like okay there is why

06:08:40.040 --> 06:08:42.040
[Guest]: Why am I getting anxious what is going to happen and it

06:08:42.040 --> 06:08:44.040
[Guest]: Is almost like a prediction for me that there is something

06:08:44.040 --> 06:08:46.040
[Guest]: Whether in my life and in this case

06:08:46.040 --> 06:08:48.040
[Guest]: The world that there is something so I started getting

06:08:48.040 --> 06:08:50.040
[Guest]: Anxiety after reading like I was like

06:08:50.040 --> 06:08:52.040
[Guest]: And I started going deep into like

06:08:52.040 --> 06:08:54.040
[Guest]: Okay what is this going to mean and I knew

06:08:54.040 --> 06:08:56.040
[Guest]: At that time that covid is

06:08:56.040 --> 06:08:58.040
[Guest]: So I am actually making my anxiety work for me

06:08:58.040 --> 06:09:00.040
[Guest]: Like become very smart with it like

06:09:00.040 --> 06:09:02.040
[Guest]: I knew that covid is going to come to India

06:09:02.040 --> 06:09:04.040
[Guest]: Also I realized that the way it is shaping

06:09:04.040 --> 06:09:06.040
[Guest]: Up it is not far away people were

06:09:06.040 --> 06:09:08.040
[Guest]: Like still not okay whatever whatever

06:09:08.040 --> 06:09:10.040
[Guest]: I had given my team

06:09:10.040 --> 06:09:12.040
[Guest]: Work from home

06:09:12.040 --> 06:09:14.040
[Guest]: My team was bunch of 10

06:09:14.040 --> 06:09:16.040
[Guest]: People at that time now we are 26 but at that time

06:09:16.040 --> 06:09:18.040
[Guest]: Just 10 young people but most of them

06:09:18.040 --> 06:09:20.040
[Guest]: Are from different parts of the country so

06:09:20.040 --> 06:09:22.040
[Guest]: Because of my anxiety because of what I was going

06:09:22.040 --> 06:09:24.040
[Guest]: Through you know I kind of told

06:09:24.040 --> 06:09:26.040
[Guest]: My team to go from work from home

06:09:26.040 --> 06:09:28.040
[Guest]: And that also happened because

06:09:28.040 --> 06:09:30.040
[Guest]: Parents of one those kids were also getting

06:09:30.040 --> 06:09:32.040
[Guest]: Very anxious I said okay let's just start work from home

06:09:32.040 --> 06:09:34.040
[Guest]: When at a time when nobody

06:09:34.040 --> 06:09:36.040
[Guest]: Was at that time kind of doing it

06:09:36.040 --> 06:09:38.040
[Guest]: The decision I am really proud

06:09:38.040 --> 06:09:40.040
[Guest]: Of is the fact that I just asked

06:09:40.040 --> 06:09:42.040
[Guest]: The kids who were from different parts of the country

06:09:42.040 --> 06:09:44.040
[Guest]: To go back to their homes I was just like

06:09:44.040 --> 06:09:46.040
[Guest]: I think the flights I don't know when this will

06:09:46.040 --> 06:09:48.040
[Guest]: Hit us when if it hits

06:09:48.040 --> 06:09:50.040
[Guest]: Us and we get into lockdowns in India also

06:09:50.040 --> 06:09:52.040
[Guest]: Flights will stop and you will not be able to go

06:09:52.040 --> 06:09:54.040
[Guest]: To your homes so I didn't go to my own

06:09:54.040 --> 06:09:56.040
[Guest]: Home which I then later

06:09:56.040 --> 06:09:58.040
[Guest]: Really regretted but I

06:09:58.040 --> 06:10:00.040
[Guest]: You know send my kids to you

06:10:00.040 --> 06:10:02.040
[Guest]: Know their homes and I am so glad

06:10:02.040 --> 06:10:04.040
[Guest]: That you know the anxiety worked for me in that sense

06:10:04.040 --> 06:10:06.040
[Guest]: But yeah so I feel like

06:10:06.040 --> 06:10:08.040
[Guest]: Everybody

06:10:08.040 --> 06:10:10.040
[Guest]: Has you know a

06:10:10.040 --> 06:10:12.040
[Guest]: Different way of

06:10:12.040 --> 06:10:14.040
[Guest]: Dealing with it I have

06:10:14.040 --> 06:10:16.040
[Guest]: Found you know again as you

06:10:16.040 --> 06:10:18.040
[Guest]: Said reading for me was

06:10:18.040 --> 06:10:20.040
[Guest]: I would

06:10:20.040 --> 06:10:22.040
[Guest]: Get lost in the

06:10:22.040 --> 06:10:24.040
[Guest]: I picked up fiction so

06:10:24.040 --> 06:10:26.040
[Guest]: And I was not reading fiction I was reading

06:10:26.040 --> 06:10:28.040
[Guest]: A lot of non-fiction for a very long time

06:10:28.040 --> 06:10:30.040
[Guest]: I also made a really stupid tweet about that once you

06:10:30.040 --> 06:10:32.040
[Guest]: Start reading fiction you can never read non-fiction I got really

06:10:32.040 --> 06:10:34.040
[Guest]: Trolled for it during the pandemic

06:10:34.040 --> 06:10:36.040
[Guest]: Really trolled

06:10:36.040 --> 06:10:38.040
[Guest]: Shiv Ramdas was the first one who said

06:10:38.040 --> 06:10:40.040
[Guest]: You are an idiot

06:10:40.040 --> 06:10:42.040
[Guest]: But

06:10:42.040 --> 06:10:44.040
[Guest]: But I

06:10:44.040 --> 06:10:46.040
[Guest]: Picked up fiction and it just helped me get lost

06:10:46.040 --> 06:10:48.040
[Guest]: In the lives of others

06:10:48.040 --> 06:10:50.040
[Guest]: I also you know sorry I also said

06:10:50.040 --> 06:10:52.040
[Guest]: I forgot to tell about that when the pandemic

06:10:52.040 --> 06:10:54.040
[Guest]: Started because I needed to make sense of it

06:10:54.040 --> 06:10:56.040
[Guest]: I was like what other

06:10:56.040 --> 06:10:58.040
[Guest]: Event has happened in the world that was

06:10:58.040 --> 06:11:00.040
[Guest]: Unprecedented and my head was world war

06:11:00.040 --> 06:11:02.040
[Guest]: I was like I have while

06:11:02.040 --> 06:11:04.040
[Guest]: You know there is there were people

06:11:04.040 --> 06:11:06.040
[Guest]: Who also lived through the world war

06:11:06.040 --> 06:11:08.040
[Guest]: World war 1 and world war 2 and while

06:11:08.040 --> 06:11:10.040
[Guest]: I had seen I mean of course everybody knows about it

06:11:10.040 --> 06:11:12.040
[Guest]: In whatever way I knew

06:11:12.040 --> 06:11:14.040
[Guest]: There was a documentary on Netflix and I was like let me

06:11:14.040 --> 06:11:16.040
[Guest]: Just go watch this whole documentary so I saw

06:11:16.040 --> 06:11:18.040
[Guest]: 10 hour documentary on the world wars

06:11:18.040 --> 06:11:20.040
[Guest]: And it gave me

06:11:20.040 --> 06:11:22.040
[Guest]: So much context in feeling better

06:11:22.040 --> 06:11:24.040
[Guest]: Later because what it did was it helped

06:11:24.040 --> 06:11:26.040
[Guest]: Me understand well you think

06:11:26.040 --> 06:11:28.040
[Guest]: Of the world war as this one event right

06:11:28.040 --> 06:11:30.040
[Guest]: But it was also from

06:11:30.040 --> 06:11:32.040
[Guest]: You know x

06:11:32.040 --> 06:11:34.040
[Guest]: Year to x year it was

06:11:34.040 --> 06:11:36.040
[Guest]: A period of 5 to 6 years

06:11:36.040 --> 06:11:38.040
[Guest]: Where people were living

06:11:38.040 --> 06:11:40.040
[Guest]: In war in war

06:11:40.040 --> 06:11:42.040
[Guest]: Time and I was just thinking

06:11:42.040 --> 06:11:44.040
[Guest]: You know because I need to make sense I

06:11:44.040 --> 06:11:46.040
[Guest]: Immediately realized that there is going to be

06:11:46.040 --> 06:11:48.040
[Guest]: This pandemic is not getting over in 3 weeks or 3 months

06:11:48.040 --> 06:11:50.040
[Guest]: It is going to go on

06:11:50.040 --> 06:11:52.040
[Guest]: So a lot of people had anxiety later

06:11:52.040 --> 06:11:54.040
[Guest]: When it didn't stop I had anxiety initial

06:11:54.040 --> 06:11:56.040
[Guest]: To prepare for the fact that 2-3 years

06:11:56.040 --> 06:11:58.040
[Guest]: Is going to go on and I was reading

06:11:58.040 --> 06:12:00.040
[Guest]: Some of the top science writers

06:12:00.040 --> 06:12:02.040
[Guest]: Zainab Tufekhi

06:12:02.040 --> 06:12:04.040
[Guest]: This

06:12:04.040 --> 06:12:06.040
[Guest]: New Yorker writer I forgot his name

06:12:06.040 --> 06:12:08.040
[Guest]: Fantastic writer from New Yorker

06:12:08.040 --> 06:12:10.040
[Guest]: Writing a book just incredible

06:12:10.040 --> 06:12:12.040
[Guest]: Incredible

06:12:12.040 --> 06:12:14.040
[Guest]: You know writer so just reading their things

06:12:14.040 --> 06:12:16.040
[Guest]: And preparing myself and then just needed to make

06:12:16.040 --> 06:12:18.040
[Guest]: Sense of the world that you know people

06:12:18.040 --> 06:12:20.040
[Guest]: Have in the past also gone through

06:12:20.040 --> 06:12:22.040
[Guest]: Historically it is really

06:12:22.040 --> 06:12:24.040
[Guest]: Troubled times and they made it to the other side

06:12:24.040 --> 06:12:26.040
[Guest]: We are also going through these troubled times I am sure

06:12:26.040 --> 06:12:28.040
[Guest]: We are going to make it that was my way of dealing

06:12:28.040 --> 06:12:30.040
[Guest]: With it content storytelling filmmaking

06:12:30.040 --> 06:12:32.040
[Guest]: Always becomes my go to

06:12:32.040 --> 06:12:34.040
[Guest]: You know reading became again

06:12:34.040 --> 06:12:36.040
[Guest]: Stories just getting lost in the stories

06:12:36.040 --> 06:12:38.040
[Guest]: Became a whole thing journalism

06:12:38.040 --> 06:12:40.040
[Guest]: Journaling for me

06:12:42.040 --> 06:12:44.040
[Guest]: I when I started journaling

06:12:44.040 --> 06:12:46.040
[Guest]: It is just a lot of negative emotion that I put out

06:12:46.040 --> 06:12:48.040
[Guest]: So while it is cathartic

06:12:48.040 --> 06:12:50.040
[Guest]: For a lot of people to be able to let it all out

06:12:50.040 --> 06:12:52.040
[Guest]: I see for me it just becomes a little bit

06:12:52.040 --> 06:12:54.040
[Guest]: More like

06:12:54.040 --> 06:12:56.040
[Guest]: I feel like I go deeper

06:12:56.040 --> 06:12:58.040
[Guest]: Into it so I just you know I did this

06:12:58.040 --> 06:13:00.040
[Guest]: Another one lovely thing which

06:13:00.040 --> 06:13:02.040
[Guest]: Really helped me I my mother

06:13:02.040 --> 06:13:04.040
[Guest]: I would tell my mother to

06:13:04.040 --> 06:13:06.040
[Guest]: My mother would also

06:13:06.040 --> 06:13:08.040
[Guest]: From the Guru Granth Sahib she kind of

06:13:08.040 --> 06:13:10.040
[Guest]: You know read

06:13:10.040 --> 06:13:12.040

[Guest]: Just say that you know why don't you send me every morning

06:13:14.040 --> 06:13:16.040
[Guest]: A voice note because I really needed help I didn't

[Guest]: Know what to do I was like can you send me a voice note

06:13:18.040 --> 06:13:20.040
[Guest]: Every morning from something from the Guru Granth Sahib

06:13:20.040 --> 06:13:22.040
[Guest]: And just explain it in your own words

06:13:22.040 --> 06:13:24.040
[Guest]: She does that quite a lot you know

06:13:24.040 --> 06:13:26.040
[Guest]: So then yeah I have this bunch of voice

06:13:26.040 --> 06:13:28.040
[Guest]: Notes from my mother during the pandemic for like

06:13:28.040 --> 06:13:30.040
[Guest]: Two weeks three weeks three weeks when a very tough

06:13:30.040 --> 06:13:32.040
[Guest]: Time every morning I'd wake up I'd see the

06:13:32.040 --> 06:13:34.040
[Guest]: Sun I'd hear my mother's voice note

06:13:34.040 --> 06:13:36.040
[Guest]: I would read a book and then

06:13:36.040 --> 06:13:38.040
[Guest]: I would feel a little bit more prepared about the day

06:13:38.040 --> 06:13:40.040
[Guest]: So it's

06:13:40.040 --> 06:13:42.040
[Guest]: Creative I mean again I think that

06:13:42.040 --> 06:13:44.040
[Guest]: I

06:13:44.040 --> 06:13:46.040
[Guest]: Wouldn't want to say as if

06:13:46.040 --> 06:13:48.040
[Guest]: It's everybody can you

06:13:48.040 --> 06:13:50.040
[Guest]: Know creativity can help everyone because honestly

06:13:50.040 --> 06:13:52.040
[Guest]: I don't know you know

06:13:52.040 --> 06:13:54.040
[Guest]: It is it is said that it helps everyone

06:13:54.040 --> 06:13:56.040
[Guest]: I have seen it help me in

06:13:56.040 --> 06:13:58.040
[Guest]: My own life I've seen it help

06:13:58.040 --> 06:14:00.040
[Guest]: My wife but at the same time not

06:14:00.040 --> 06:14:02.040
[Guest]: Everybody needs to have that

06:14:02.040 --> 06:14:04.040
[Guest]: Pressure of kind of being creative

06:14:04.040 --> 06:14:06.040
[Guest]: If you have

06:14:06.040 --> 06:14:08.040
[Guest]: Cooking is such a thing that

06:14:08.040 --> 06:14:10.040
[Guest]: A lot of people took to

06:14:10.040 --> 06:14:12.040
[Guest]: During the pandemic to really get

06:14:12.040 --> 06:14:14.040
[Guest]: Over the anxieties and I'm not talking about like

06:14:14.040 --> 06:14:16.040
[Guest]: Banana bread and you know or whatever

06:14:16.040 --> 06:14:18.040
[Guest]: But genuinely so many

06:14:18.040 --> 06:14:20.040
[Guest]: Friends that I know so many

06:14:20.040 --> 06:14:22.040
[Guest]: Men that I know were like you know washing utensils

06:14:22.040 --> 06:14:24.040
[Guest]: Became like a peaceful

06:14:24.040 --> 06:14:26.040
[Guest]: Activity for so many of us you know

06:14:26.040 --> 06:14:28.040
[Guest]: So many people I was for me

06:14:28.040 --> 06:14:30.040
[Guest]: So I just I just started enjoying

06:14:30.040 --> 06:14:32.040
[Guest]: Washing dishes as I just like the

06:14:32.040 --> 06:14:34.040
[Guest]: Routine of doing it the thing that you can control

06:14:34.040 --> 06:14:36.040
[Guest]: That there's a stain you finish it and

06:14:36.040 --> 06:14:38.040
[Guest]: Go away it just helps you the anxiety

06:14:38.040 --> 06:14:40.040
[Guest]: So it could be different things

06:14:40.040 --> 06:14:42.040
[Guest]: You have to you know find what works for you

06:14:42.040 --> 06:14:44.040
[Guest]: But of course you know take that

06:14:44.040 --> 06:14:46.040
[Guest]: Advice from a trained professional

06:14:46.040 --> 06:14:48.040
[Guest]: And you know

06:14:48.040 --> 06:14:50.040
[Guest]: When it comes to lived experience it's you

06:14:50.040 --> 06:14:52.040
[Guest]: Will always have a different experience from somebody

06:14:52.040 --> 06:14:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Else so my next question is

06:14:54.040 --> 06:14:56.040
[Amit Varma]: About comes from this lovely piece you wrote

06:14:56.040 --> 06:14:58.040
[Amit Varma]: About the pretense

06:14:58.040 --> 06:15:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Of being okay right

06:15:00.040 --> 06:15:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Where you've sort of

06:15:02.040 --> 06:15:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Spoken about

06:15:04.040 --> 06:15:06.040
[Amit Varma]: How you know there's a certain

06:15:06.040 --> 06:15:08.040
[Amit Varma]: It's almost as if you're role playing

06:15:08.040 --> 06:15:10.040
[Amit Varma]: For the world and for ourselves and

06:15:10.040 --> 06:15:12.040
[Amit Varma]: It's a constant act and we're

06:15:12.040 --> 06:15:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Not even aware of it ourselves and

06:15:14.040 --> 06:15:16.040
[Amit Varma]: You speak about it you know

06:15:16.040 --> 06:15:18.040
[Amit Varma]: You bring up the Will Smith

06:15:18.040 --> 06:15:20.040
[Unknown]: Incident you know the slap at the

06:15:20.040 --> 06:15:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Oscars and you know you

06:15:22.040 --> 06:15:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Quoted the writer Heidi Moore

06:15:24.040 --> 06:15:26.040
[Amit Varma]: About how what that actually did was

06:15:26.040 --> 06:15:28.040
[Amit Varma]: It broke that fourth wall where

06:15:28.040 --> 06:15:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Suddenly Will Smith is not playing a role of being

06:15:30.040 --> 06:15:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Himself but he's come out

06:15:32.040 --> 06:15:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Of that and he's showing whatever so

06:15:34.040 --> 06:15:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Even if you find it ugly and rude

06:15:36.040 --> 06:15:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Or repulsive or whatever

06:15:38.040 --> 06:15:40.040
[Amit Varma]: He's broken that fourth wall and there is something

06:15:40.040 --> 06:15:42.040
[Amit Varma]: There and something had happened to a friend

06:15:42.040 --> 06:15:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Of mine about which I wrote a newsletter post

06:15:44.040 --> 06:15:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Also where he was at a

06:15:46.040 --> 06:15:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Disco and

06:15:48.040 --> 06:15:50.040
[Amit Varma]: He was at the stage where he was at

06:15:50.040 --> 06:15:52.040
[Amit Varma]: The stage of weight loss where his

06:15:52.040 --> 06:15:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Pants weren't exactly fitting

06:15:54.040 --> 06:15:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Right so you know they would

06:15:56.040 --> 06:15:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Keep slipping and he would pull them up

06:15:58.040 --> 06:16:00.040
[Amit Varma]: So he was dancing with a girl

06:16:00.040 --> 06:16:02.040
[Amit Varma]: And the pant fell down

06:16:02.040 --> 06:16:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And he was damn embarrassed and the girl said

06:16:04.040 --> 06:16:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Don't worry that's happened to me also

06:16:06.040 --> 06:16:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Which is possibly just a way of making him feel better

06:16:08.040 --> 06:16:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And my friend was really embarrassed about it

06:16:10.040 --> 06:16:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And I was like you know what

06:16:12.040 --> 06:16:14.040
[Amit Varma]: This is actually a beautiful moment

06:16:14.040 --> 06:16:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Because in a

06:16:16.040 --> 06:16:18.040
[Amit Varma]: Disco you know you have

06:16:18.040 --> 06:16:20.040
[Amit Varma]: That whole dance going on

06:16:20.040 --> 06:16:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Everything is so performative

06:16:22.040 --> 06:16:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Everybody is kind of playing a role

06:16:24.040 --> 06:16:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Nobody is really being themselves unless they are too drunk

06:16:26.040 --> 06:16:28.040
[Amit Varma]: In which case they are being too themselves

06:16:28.040 --> 06:16:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And the dropping of the pant is

06:16:30.040 --> 06:16:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Almost like a delightful moment

06:16:32.040 --> 06:16:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Of kind of breaking through

06:16:34.040 --> 06:16:36.040
[Amit Varma]: That where you know

06:16:36.040 --> 06:16:38.040
[Amit Varma]: You are kind of embarrassed but

06:16:38.040 --> 06:16:40.040
[Amit Varma]: You know but everyone around you

06:16:40.040 --> 06:16:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Because of mirror neurons

06:16:42.040 --> 06:16:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Because of suddenly they can empathize

06:16:44.040 --> 06:16:46.040
[Amit Varma]: You know every man is imagining fuck that could have been me

06:16:46.040 --> 06:16:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Right for a moment that is broken

06:16:48.040 --> 06:16:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And there is a certain charm to that

06:16:50.040 --> 06:16:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Do you think about this sometimes

06:16:52.040 --> 06:16:54.040
[Amit Varma]: That we are all

06:16:54.040 --> 06:16:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Playing a role for ourselves

06:16:56.040 --> 06:16:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And for the people in our lives

06:16:58.040 --> 06:17:00.040
[Amit Varma]: And that there should be

06:17:00.040 --> 06:17:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Sort of an intentional effort

06:17:02.040 --> 06:17:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Of getting past it

06:17:04.040 --> 06:17:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Of just you know in whatever way we can

06:17:06.040 --> 06:17:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Because on the one hand

06:17:08.040 --> 06:17:10.040
[Amit Varma]: There is that larger

06:17:10.040 --> 06:17:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Layer that we break through

06:17:12.040 --> 06:17:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Which is a layer of oh I am expected to be a man

06:17:14.040 --> 06:17:16.040
[Amit Varma]: I am supposed to be this and it's a social thing

06:17:16.040 --> 06:17:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And it's all encompassing

06:17:18.040 --> 06:17:20.040
[Amit Varma]: But let's say we get past that

06:17:20.040 --> 06:17:22.040
[Amit Varma]: But even then there is that

06:17:22.040 --> 06:17:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Dilemma about what is the authentic self

06:17:24.040 --> 06:17:26.040
[Amit Varma]: You know you might think you know yourself

06:17:26.040 --> 06:17:28.040
[Amit Varma]: But maybe you are playing a role to yourself

06:17:28.040 --> 06:17:30.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know and

06:17:30.040 --> 06:17:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Given the kind of self reflection that you have done

06:17:32.040 --> 06:17:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And that your writing shows

06:17:34.040 --> 06:17:36.040
[Amit Varma]: You know what are your thoughts

06:17:36.040 --> 06:17:38.040
[Guest]: It's a very existential question

06:17:38.040 --> 06:17:40.040
[Guest]: You know and

06:17:40.040 --> 06:17:42.040
[Guest]: I honestly feel like

06:17:42.040 --> 06:17:44.040
[Guest]: Everyone will have a different answer

06:17:44.040 --> 06:17:46.040
[Guest]: To this purely because

06:17:48.040 --> 06:17:50.040
[Guest]: Okay as an example

06:17:50.040 --> 06:17:52.040
[Guest]: I have and I will talk about

06:17:52.040 --> 06:17:54.040
[Guest]: This purely because

06:17:54.040 --> 06:17:56.040
[Guest]: This is just you know

06:17:56.040 --> 06:17:58.040
[Guest]: The most easy way for me to communicate

06:17:58.040 --> 06:18:00.040
[Guest]: This but

06:18:00.040 --> 06:18:02.040
[Guest]: I have just never understood

06:18:02.040 --> 06:18:04.040
[Guest]: Why we are

06:18:04.040 --> 06:18:06.040
[Guest]: Why we have hierarchies at work

06:18:06.040 --> 06:18:08.040
[Guest]: And

06:18:08.040 --> 06:18:10.040
[Guest]: And I say hierarchies I don't

06:18:10.040 --> 06:18:12.040
[Guest]: You know I don't begrudge experience

06:18:12.040 --> 06:18:14.040
[Guest]: I think experience is great

06:18:14.040 --> 06:18:16.040
[Guest]: I think we should give a certain kind of respect

06:18:16.040 --> 06:18:18.040
[Guest]: To experience and lean into

06:18:18.040 --> 06:18:20.040
[Guest]: Experience wherever possible

06:18:20.040 --> 06:18:22.040
[Guest]: But why is the youngest employee

06:18:22.040 --> 06:18:24.040
[Guest]: At an office treated differently

06:18:24.040 --> 06:18:26.040
[Guest]: From the oldest employee at the office

06:18:26.040 --> 06:18:28.040
[Guest]: Or the person may not be the oldest

06:18:28.040 --> 06:18:30.040
[Guest]: But the person in the

06:18:30.040 --> 06:18:32.040
[Guest]: A position of a certain salary

06:18:32.040 --> 06:18:34.040
[Guest]: Why is the salary

06:18:34.040 --> 06:18:36.040
[Guest]: A marker of the kind of respect that you give people

06:18:36.040 --> 06:18:38.040
[Guest]: I have never understood that

06:18:38.040 --> 06:18:40.040
[Guest]: Why is it that we

06:18:40.040 --> 06:18:42.040
[Guest]: In the same office

06:18:42.040 --> 06:18:44.040
[Guest]: The same person can speak to their boss

06:18:44.040 --> 06:18:46.040
[Guest]: In a certain way and speak to their subordinate

06:18:46.040 --> 06:18:48.040
[Guest]: In a certain way

06:18:48.040 --> 06:18:50.040
[Guest]: It's never made sense to me

06:18:50.040 --> 06:18:52.040
[Guest]: In fact it's made me so

06:18:52.040 --> 06:18:54.040
[Guest]: It's really made me angry

06:18:54.040 --> 06:18:56.040
[Guest]: Many many times

06:18:56.040 --> 06:18:58.040
[Guest]: We have a team

06:18:58.040 --> 06:19:00.040
[Guest]: You know of

06:19:00.040 --> 06:19:02.040
[Guest]: People from all over the country

06:19:02.040 --> 06:19:04.040
[Guest]: We also have an office boy

06:19:06.040 --> 06:19:08.040
[Guest]: And I don't again

06:19:08.040 --> 06:19:10.040
[Guest]: It's conditioning

06:19:10.040 --> 06:19:12.040
[Guest]: That when you're taking a picture of the whole team

06:19:12.040 --> 06:19:14.040
[Guest]: The team is not calling

06:19:14.040 --> 06:19:16.040
[Guest]: The office boy. Why?

06:19:16.040 --> 06:19:18.040
[Guest]: He's also 23

06:19:18.040 --> 06:19:20.040
[Guest]: He's also a young person like us and he's part of our company

06:19:20.040 --> 06:19:22.040
[Guest]: Why are we not

06:19:22.040 --> 06:19:24.040
[Guest]: Calling him for the picture? Now again I don't want to

06:19:24.040 --> 06:19:26.040
[Guest]: Make this again

06:19:26.040 --> 06:19:28.040
[Guest]: I don't want to make it sound like right now I'm like

06:19:28.040 --> 06:19:30.040
[Guest]: You know

06:19:30.040 --> 06:19:32.040
[Guest]: It's not about I mean right now

06:19:32.040 --> 06:19:34.040
[Guest]: I'm not even talking about class or you know

06:19:34.040 --> 06:19:36.040
[Guest]: Cast I'm talking while of course that plays a part

06:19:36.040 --> 06:19:38.040
[Guest]: In it. I'm just

06:19:38.040 --> 06:19:40.040
[Guest]: Talking about the roles

06:19:40.040 --> 06:19:42.040
[Guest]: That we are conditioned

06:19:42.040 --> 06:19:44.040
[Guest]: To you know

06:19:44.040 --> 06:19:46.040
[Guest]: Play right?

06:19:46.040 --> 06:19:48.040
[Guest]: In all these systems. As an example

06:19:48.040 --> 06:19:50.040
[Guest]: The

06:19:50.040 --> 06:19:52.040
[Guest]: Accounts team you will not call for a picture

06:19:52.040 --> 06:19:54.040
[Guest]: Right? So it's also the same thing

06:19:54.040 --> 06:19:56.040
[Guest]: It's just like they work in accounts

06:19:56.040 --> 06:19:58.040
[Guest]: They're not like as fun as we are or whatever

06:19:58.040 --> 06:20:00.040
[Guest]: It is and it is in different ways

06:20:00.040 --> 06:20:02.040
[Guest]: Sometimes ageism is a thing that you know you kind of have

06:20:02.040 --> 06:20:04.040
[Guest]: And you don't call the

06:20:04.040 --> 06:20:06.040
[Guest]: You know people who are actually older as part

06:20:06.040 --> 06:20:08.040
[Guest]: Of whatever it is right?

06:20:08.040 --> 06:20:10.040
[Guest]: But overall I just see these

06:20:10.040 --> 06:20:12.040
[Guest]: Why is it that

06:20:12.040 --> 06:20:14.040
[Guest]: And I don't want to be

06:20:14.040 --> 06:20:16.040
[Guest]: I don't want to sound like a bleeding heart

06:20:16.040 --> 06:20:18.040
[Guest]: Or you know whatever. I don't want to sound like I am

06:20:18.040 --> 06:20:20.040
[Guest]: Even when I sound it

06:20:20.040 --> 06:20:22.040
[Guest]: It just sounds like I don't know

06:20:22.040 --> 06:20:24.040
[Guest]: What do I think of myself but

06:20:24.040 --> 06:20:26.040
[Guest]: I just don't. But it's true

06:20:26.040 --> 06:20:28.040
[Guest]: I just don't like it when

06:20:28.040 --> 06:20:30.040
[Guest]: The watchman or the

06:20:30.040 --> 06:20:32.040
[Guest]: In any of my societies calls me sir

06:20:32.040 --> 06:20:34.040
[Guest]: I am like why are you calling me sir?

06:20:34.040 --> 06:20:36.040
[Guest]: My name is this

06:20:36.040 --> 06:20:38.040
[Guest]: I know your name. You will call me by my name right?

06:20:38.040 --> 06:20:40.040
[Guest]: So you know they get awkward about it

06:20:40.040 --> 06:20:42.040
[Guest]: And I feel so bad

06:20:42.040 --> 06:20:44.040
[Guest]: And again I am not

06:20:46.040 --> 06:20:48.040
[Guest]: It just sounds like

06:20:48.040 --> 06:20:50.040
[Guest]: This whatever bleeding heart savior

06:20:50.040 --> 06:20:52.040
[Guest]: Kind of a. No that's not the narrative

06:20:52.040 --> 06:20:54.040
[Guest]: I just find in any

06:20:54.040 --> 06:20:56.040
[Guest]: Situation just it to be horrible

06:20:56.040 --> 06:20:58.040
[Guest]: That we have these social

06:20:58.040 --> 06:21:00.040
[Guest]: Structures, these social

06:21:00.040 --> 06:21:02.040
[Guest]: Constructs that

06:21:02.040 --> 06:21:04.040
[Guest]: We believe in and that we

06:21:04.040 --> 06:21:06.040
[Guest]: You know put. Why

06:21:06.040 --> 06:21:08.040
[Guest]: Is it I mean of course these are

06:21:08.040 --> 06:21:10.040
[Guest]: Casteist things but you know

06:21:10.040 --> 06:21:12.040
[Guest]: Why do we have separate utensils for people

06:21:12.040 --> 06:21:14.040
[Guest]: Who come from outside and you know

06:21:14.040 --> 06:21:16.040
[Guest]: So it is

06:21:16.040 --> 06:21:18.040
[Guest]: The same person in your family

06:21:18.040 --> 06:21:20.040
[Guest]: Can be the sweetest to everyone

06:21:20.040 --> 06:21:22.040
[Guest]: But suddenly when there is a worker who comes from outside

06:21:22.040 --> 06:21:24.040
[Guest]: You will you know be a

06:21:24.040 --> 06:21:26.040
[Guest]: Certain way with that person because you have an idea

06:21:26.040 --> 06:21:28.040
[Guest]: These people

06:21:28.040 --> 06:21:30.040
[Guest]: And it's not

06:21:30.040 --> 06:21:32.040
[Guest]: Just as I said casteism it is anything

06:21:32.040 --> 06:21:34.040
[Guest]: It can be just power. I think power dynamics

06:21:34.040 --> 06:21:36.040
[Guest]: Overall everywhere is just the reason

06:21:36.040 --> 06:21:38.040
[Guest]: While some of it is classism

06:21:38.040 --> 06:21:40.040
[Guest]: Casteism you know different different things

06:21:40.040 --> 06:21:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Religion, gender all of these

06:21:42.040 --> 06:21:44.040
[Guest]: Issues that kind of you know play

06:21:44.040 --> 06:21:46.040
[Guest]: But a lot of it is just power structures

06:21:46.040 --> 06:21:48.040
[Guest]: Everything comes down to power

06:21:48.040 --> 06:21:50.040
[Guest]: And the roles we play come down to like

06:21:50.040 --> 06:21:52.040
[Guest]: Who is more power. Respect the elders

06:21:52.040 --> 06:21:54.040
[Guest]: Always. Elders, elders, elders

06:21:54.040 --> 06:21:56.040
[Guest]: Where are you elder?

06:21:56.040 --> 06:21:58.040
[Guest]: In every situation it is decided

06:21:58.040 --> 06:22:00.040
[Guest]: How to respect

06:22:00.040 --> 06:22:02.040
[Guest]: How much respect you should get

06:22:02.040 --> 06:22:04.040
[Guest]: It will depend upon you know how

06:22:04.040 --> 06:22:06.040
[Guest]: What is your level

06:22:06.040 --> 06:22:08.040
[Guest]: Of you know

06:22:08.040 --> 06:22:10.040
[Guest]: Being big or bigger

06:22:10.040 --> 06:22:12.040
[Guest]: Or power

06:22:12.040 --> 06:22:14.040
[Guest]: And that is why I think that's the pretense

06:22:14.040 --> 06:22:16.040
[Guest]: What power do we have

06:22:16.040 --> 06:22:18.040
[Guest]: You think

06:22:18.040 --> 06:22:20.040
[Guest]: That you know having x amount of money

06:22:20.040 --> 06:22:22.040
[Guest]: Gives you power

06:22:22.040 --> 06:22:24.040
[Guest]: You know if

06:22:24.040 --> 06:22:26.040
[Guest]: There is a pandemic you are home

06:22:26.040 --> 06:22:28.040
[Guest]: Where you have a helicopter to go

06:22:28.040 --> 06:22:30.040
[Guest]: As an example

06:22:30.040 --> 06:22:32.040
[Guest]: But

06:22:32.040 --> 06:22:34.040
[Guest]: There is no such thing as true power

06:22:34.040 --> 06:22:36.040
[Guest]: There is genuinely

06:22:36.040 --> 06:22:38.040
[Guest]: This idea also of power

06:22:38.040 --> 06:22:40.040
[Guest]: Is such a stupid idea

06:22:40.040 --> 06:22:42.040
[Guest]: Who has true power

06:22:42.040 --> 06:22:44.040
[Guest]: Even if you say that

06:22:44.040 --> 06:22:46.040
[Guest]: This government has x amount

06:22:46.040 --> 06:22:48.040
[Guest]: Of power. Everyday they have to fight

06:22:48.040 --> 06:22:50.040
[Guest]: For it. Is that really power?

06:22:50.040 --> 06:22:52.040
[Guest]: You know. And we are all going to die

06:22:52.040 --> 06:22:54.040
[Guest]: And this world

06:22:54.040 --> 06:22:56.040
[Guest]: Is like dying. Climate change is happening

06:22:56.040 --> 06:22:58.040
[Guest]: What is power?

06:22:58.040 --> 06:23:00.040
[Guest]: What are you going to do with this idea of power?

06:23:00.040 --> 06:23:02.040
[Guest]: What do you get in a situation where you

06:23:02.040 --> 06:23:04.040
[Guest]: Feel yourself as the bigger person

06:23:04.040 --> 06:23:06.040
[Guest]: You show someone

06:23:06.040 --> 06:23:08.040
[Guest]: Smaller than you

06:23:08.040 --> 06:23:10.040
[Guest]: What is the joy that you get? There is no joy in that

06:23:10.040 --> 06:23:12.040
[Guest]: In fact it is just a stupid thing

06:23:12.040 --> 06:23:14.040
[Guest]: That you kind of do because it is a role that you think you have to play

06:23:14.040 --> 06:23:16.040
[Guest]: Because somebody played that role

06:23:16.040 --> 06:23:18.040
[Guest]: With you when you were in that place

06:23:18.040 --> 06:23:20.040
[Guest]: I didn't bully

06:23:20.040 --> 06:23:22.040
[Guest]: Anybody because

06:23:22.040 --> 06:23:24.040
[Guest]: Even if I got bullied

06:23:24.040 --> 06:23:26.040
[Guest]: I didn't bully someone

06:23:26.040 --> 06:23:28.040
[Guest]: On the other hand there are people who bully

06:23:28.040 --> 06:23:30.040
[Guest]: When ragging used to happen in college

06:23:30.040 --> 06:23:32.040
[Guest]: Even people who I used to really respect

06:23:32.040 --> 06:23:34.040
[Guest]: You know suddenly would rag and hit

06:23:34.040 --> 06:23:36.040
[Guest]: Juniors. I would be like why do you do this?

06:23:36.040 --> 06:23:38.040
[Guest]: This is the system

06:23:38.040 --> 06:23:40.040
[Guest]: Everyone ragged us

06:23:40.040 --> 06:23:42.040
[Guest]: So we have to do the same. I am like why?

06:23:42.040 --> 06:23:44.040
[Guest]: Why doesn't it stop with you?

06:23:44.040 --> 06:23:46.040
[Guest]: And on the other hand I have a friend

06:23:46.040 --> 06:23:48.040
[Guest]: Who is a very dear friend

06:23:48.040 --> 06:23:50.040
[Guest]: But had so much love and respect for

06:23:50.040 --> 06:23:52.040
[Guest]: Because he was the one who in his

06:23:52.040 --> 06:23:54.040
[Guest]: We used to call it GTs

06:23:54.040 --> 06:23:56.040
[Guest]: Get-togethers but whatever

06:23:56.040 --> 06:23:58.040
[Guest]: Maharashtra GT

06:23:58.040 --> 06:24:00.040
[Guest]: Bangalore GT

06:24:00.040 --> 06:24:02.040
[Guest]: So seniors from the same GT

06:24:02.040 --> 06:24:04.040
[Guest]: Would hit juniors from the same GT

06:24:04.040 --> 06:24:06.040
[Guest]: If somebody from another GT

06:24:06.040 --> 06:24:08.040
[Guest]: Comes and rags you then there is a

06:24:08.040 --> 06:24:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Panga and a war that happens

06:24:10.040 --> 06:24:12.040
[Guest]: These boys belong to us. Exactly

06:24:12.040 --> 06:24:14.040
[Guest]: How can you hit them?

06:24:14.040 --> 06:24:16.040
[Guest]: But you know

06:24:16.040 --> 06:24:18.040
[Guest]: We used to beat

06:24:18.040 --> 06:24:20.040
[Guest]: First you need to learn subservience

06:24:20.040 --> 06:24:22.040
[Guest]: First you need to learn subservience

06:24:22.040 --> 06:24:24.040
[Guest]: You need to learn that

06:24:24.040 --> 06:24:26.040
[Guest]: I am your senior so I need to be spoken to

06:24:26.040 --> 06:24:28.040
[Guest]: In a certain respect and you will do whatever

06:24:28.040 --> 06:24:30.040
[Guest]: The hell I want you to do and then I will be your best friend

06:24:30.040 --> 06:24:32.040
[Guest]: But first you have to go through

06:24:32.040 --> 06:24:34.040
[Guest]: Torture for me to then come to

06:24:34.040 --> 06:24:36.040
[Guest]: Tough love. What is this nonsense?

06:24:36.040 --> 06:24:38.040
[Guest]: And I just

06:24:38.040 --> 06:24:40.040
[Guest]: So much respect for a friend who kind of fought

06:24:40.040 --> 06:24:42.040
[Guest]: With his entire GT and said

06:24:42.040 --> 06:24:44.040
[Guest]: We are not going to beat our juniors

06:24:44.040 --> 06:24:46.040
[Guest]: So what if he got beaten up

06:24:46.040 --> 06:24:48.040
[Guest]: And he finally stopped the system

06:24:48.040 --> 06:24:50.040
[Guest]: And that is

06:24:50.040 --> 06:24:52.040
[Guest]: I mean I don't know if it continued after

06:24:52.040 --> 06:24:54.040
[Guest]: He went and somebody in the third year said

06:24:54.040 --> 06:24:56.040
[Guest]: No I want to continue it. I hope not

06:24:56.040 --> 06:24:58.040
[Guest]: But the fact that there was a person

06:24:58.040 --> 06:25:00.040
[Guest]: Who fought back and you know

06:25:00.040 --> 06:25:02.040
[Guest]: It was a close bunch of 5-6 people from

06:25:02.040 --> 06:25:04.040
[Guest]: Bangalore GT who just decided they will not do it

06:25:04.040 --> 06:25:06.040
[Guest]: Karnataka GT. We will not do it

06:25:06.040 --> 06:25:08.040
[Guest]: And so much respect

06:25:08.040 --> 06:25:10.040
[Guest]: So it is

06:25:10.040 --> 06:25:12.040
[Guest]: The buck has to stop somewhere

06:25:12.040 --> 06:25:14.040
[Guest]: The pretence has to stop somewhere

06:25:14.040 --> 06:25:16.040
[Guest]: Why are we pretending? What are you getting out of it?

06:25:16.040 --> 06:25:18.040
[Guest]: What do you get out of these

06:25:18.040 --> 06:25:20.040
[Guest]: Power structures which make you feel better

06:25:20.040 --> 06:25:22.040
[Guest]: Instead of that just spend your time

06:25:22.040 --> 06:25:24.040
[Guest]: With people you love

06:25:24.040 --> 06:25:26.040
[Guest]: Spend your time doing things that you care about

06:25:26.040 --> 06:25:28.040
[Guest]: Instead of these false senses

06:25:28.040 --> 06:25:30.040
[Guest]: Of like

06:25:30.040 --> 06:25:32.040
[Guest]: What will make you feel

06:25:32.040 --> 06:25:34.040
[Guest]: Superior in some way or the other

06:25:34.040 --> 06:25:36.040
[Guest]: So all of these places

06:25:36.040 --> 06:25:38.040
[Guest]: All of these structures where there is

06:25:38.040 --> 06:25:40.040
[Guest]: A hierarchy. I just

06:25:40.040 --> 06:25:42.040
[Guest]: Reject them. And again I don't feel

06:25:42.040 --> 06:25:44.040
[Guest]: Like. I don't say this. I feel

06:25:44.040 --> 06:25:46.040
[Guest]: Like you know

06:25:46.040 --> 06:25:48.040
[Guest]: We still have

06:25:48.040 --> 06:25:50.040
[Guest]: Designations in Yuva. It's not like we don't have that

06:25:50.040 --> 06:25:52.040
[Guest]: I also recognize that

06:25:52.040 --> 06:25:54.040
[Guest]: Everybody is so conditioned to believe that okay this is

06:25:54.040 --> 06:25:56.040
[Guest]: How we are unlocking the next level

06:25:56.040 --> 06:25:58.040
[Guest]: Of our career if there is a designation shift

06:25:58.040 --> 06:26:00.040
[Guest]: So great. I told you like I mean

06:26:00.040 --> 06:26:02.040
[Guest]: Again I can't talk about it on the podcast but

06:26:02.040 --> 06:26:04.040
[Guest]: The way I think of leadership

06:26:04.040 --> 06:26:06.040
[Guest]: In terms of I don't want to stay you know

06:26:06.040 --> 06:26:08.040
[Guest]: In Yuva as a leader for very long and I

06:26:08.040 --> 06:26:10.040
[Guest]: Want to continue. Pass it on to the next

06:26:10.040 --> 06:26:12.040
[Guest]: Young person. Why should I be

06:26:12.040 --> 06:26:14.040
[Guest]: CEO of a company

06:26:14.040 --> 06:26:16.040
[Guest]: Called Yuva for x amount of years

06:26:16.040 --> 06:26:18.040
[Guest]: What is the power in calling yourself CEO

06:26:18.040 --> 06:26:20.040
[Guest]: I'm still going to be founder. I'm still going to. It's still my company

06:26:20.040 --> 06:26:22.040
[Guest]: But someone else can

06:26:22.040 --> 06:26:24.040
[Guest]: Genuinely run it as a

06:26:24.040 --> 06:26:26.040
[Guest]: Young thought maybe much better than I

06:26:26.040 --> 06:26:28.040
[Guest]: Could. And I need to pass the baton

06:26:28.040 --> 06:26:30.040
[Guest]: On because if I have the privilege

06:26:30.040 --> 06:26:32.040
[Guest]: What am I you know doing with it if not

06:26:32.040 --> 06:26:34.040
[Guest]: Passing it on you know and

06:26:34.040 --> 06:26:36.040
[Guest]: It is

06:26:36.040 --> 06:26:38.040
[Guest]: If I'm stupid enough to think that

06:26:38.040 --> 06:26:40.040
[Guest]: I'm only here because of my own work

06:26:40.040 --> 06:26:42.040
[Guest]: That is actually

06:26:42.040 --> 06:26:44.040
[Guest]: Just that's just nothing

06:26:44.040 --> 06:26:46.040
[Guest]: But narcissism. There is

06:26:46.040 --> 06:26:48.040
[Guest]: Nobody makes it on

06:26:48.040 --> 06:26:50.040
[Guest]: Their own

06:26:50.040 --> 06:26:52.040
[Guest]: You could have systems you can say

06:26:52.040 --> 06:26:54.040
[Guest]: That have been against you but at the

06:26:54.040 --> 06:26:56.040
[Guest]: Same time there are also been places which have been

06:26:56.040 --> 06:26:58.040
[Guest]: For you. There have been that few people who

06:26:58.040 --> 06:27:00.040
[Guest]: Give you that you

06:27:00.040 --> 06:27:02.040
[Guest]: Know in small

06:27:02.040 --> 06:27:04.040
[Guest]: Different ways. I can't you know

06:27:04.040 --> 06:27:06.040
[Guest]: I just can't

06:27:06.040 --> 06:27:08.040
[Guest]: Forget the kind

06:27:08.040 --> 06:27:10.040
[Guest]: Kindness of people

06:27:10.040 --> 06:27:12.040
[Guest]: At different places in my life and could be

06:27:12.040 --> 06:27:14.040
[Guest]: Something really small. I told you what

06:27:14.040 --> 06:27:16.040
[Guest]: One of my friends told me just such a kind

06:27:16.040 --> 06:27:18.040
[Guest]: Thing that I needed at a tough time

06:27:18.040 --> 06:27:20.040
[Guest]: That you know somebody just said something

06:27:20.040 --> 06:27:22.040
[Guest]: And I just felt like okay. Thank you for saying that

06:27:22.040 --> 06:27:24.040
[Guest]: You didn't need to say that to me, but you've done

06:27:24.040 --> 06:27:26.040
[Guest]: It and I feel so much gratitude that there

06:27:26.040 --> 06:27:28.040
[Guest]: Are people like that who could you know

06:27:28.040 --> 06:27:30.040
[Guest]: There was a time where my brother

06:27:30.040 --> 06:27:32.040
[Guest]: Was in Bombay and he was looking for a job and he

06:27:32.040 --> 06:27:34.040
[Guest]: Had come from

06:27:34.040 --> 06:27:36.040
[Guest]: And he was going through a lot. I told you it's not in a good

06:27:36.040 --> 06:27:38.040
[Guest]: Place you know mental health wise and

06:27:38.040 --> 06:27:40.040
[Guest]: And I just didn't know because he

06:27:40.040 --> 06:27:42.040
[Guest]: Was in a he wanted in a different industry. I

06:27:42.040 --> 06:27:44.040
[Guest]: Don't know how to get him a job. I was in just

06:27:44.040 --> 06:27:46.040
[Guest]: Two or three years. I put out like a post and they

06:27:46.040 --> 06:27:48.040
[Guest]: Just people who

06:27:48.040 --> 06:27:50.040
[Guest]: Because of whatever they kind of thought about

06:27:50.040 --> 06:27:52.040
[Guest]: Me just

06:27:52.040 --> 06:27:54.040
[Guest]: I don't consider like even friends but just

06:27:54.040 --> 06:27:56.040
[Guest]: Some acquaintances that I've been polite

06:27:56.040 --> 06:27:58.040
[Guest]: And kind with who just

06:27:58.040 --> 06:28:00.040
[Guest]: Said give it to us and we'll pass it on and

06:28:00.040 --> 06:28:02.040
[Guest]: I just did it and someone somewhere

06:28:02.040 --> 06:28:04.040
[Guest]: Found him a job and I was like I don't even

06:28:04.040 --> 06:28:06.040
[Guest]: Know you that well, but you've just really

06:28:06.040 --> 06:28:08.040
[Guest]: Gone out there and

06:28:08.040 --> 06:28:10.040
[Guest]: I when it's you know, I'd be like thank you for

06:28:10.040 --> 06:28:12.040
[Guest]: Being and they're just like no you're a decent person

06:28:12.040 --> 06:28:14.040
[Guest]: And so I've also seen it, you know

06:28:14.040 --> 06:28:16.040
[Guest]: Just coming back that

06:28:16.040 --> 06:28:18.040
[Guest]: Decency or whatever and a very basic

06:28:18.040 --> 06:28:20.040
[Guest]: And this is not something to

06:28:20.040 --> 06:28:22.040
[Guest]: It's sad that this is the

06:28:22.040 --> 06:28:24.040
[Guest]: Bar the bar is that it's just

06:28:24.040 --> 06:28:26.040
[Guest]: Decent that is this so much gratitude

06:28:26.040 --> 06:28:28.040
[Guest]: That people have you know

06:28:28.040 --> 06:28:30.040
[Guest]: It's so sad. There's so many times, you know, I've had

06:28:30.040 --> 06:28:32.040
[Guest]: Like on my sets or something, you know people coming up

06:28:32.040 --> 06:28:34.040
[Guest]: And say, you know key

06:28:34.040 --> 06:28:36.040
[Guest]: Producers don't behave in

06:28:36.040 --> 06:28:38.040
[Guest]: This way, you know you

06:28:38.040 --> 06:28:40.040
[Guest]: Thank you for like being nice and I'm like that's just

06:28:40.040 --> 06:28:42.040
[Guest]: It is sad that this these words

06:28:42.040 --> 06:28:44.040
[Guest]: Are being said because

06:28:44.040 --> 06:28:46.040
[Guest]: I'm just being a decent

06:28:46.040 --> 06:28:48.040
[Guest]: Human being. I'm not doing anything extra

06:28:48.040 --> 06:28:50.040
[Guest]: You know, but I used to have so much gratitude

06:28:50.040 --> 06:28:52.040
[Guest]: For people who who in this

06:28:52.040 --> 06:28:54.040
[Guest]: World, which is so toxic

06:28:54.040 --> 06:28:56.040
[Guest]: You know would would be

06:28:56.040 --> 06:28:58.040
[Guest]: Mind in different ways that I used to I mean I

06:28:58.040 --> 06:29:00.040
[Guest]: Stopped it now and I wish I had

06:29:00.040 --> 06:29:02.040
[Guest]: More time to do it but for about 7 years

06:29:02.040 --> 06:29:04.040
[Guest]: In my life between 2000

06:29:04.040 --> 06:29:06.040
[Guest]: And I think

06:29:06.040 --> 06:29:08.040
[Guest]: 11 to 2018 or

06:29:08.040 --> 06:29:10.040
[Guest]: 19 I mean after you I had to stop everything is so

06:29:10.040 --> 06:29:12.040
[Guest]: Much work that I was going and making

06:29:12.040 --> 06:29:14.040
[Guest]: Putting it together, but I used to send this

06:29:14.040 --> 06:29:16.040
[Guest]: Annual letter of thank you

06:29:16.040 --> 06:29:18.040

06:29:26.040 --> 06:29:28.040
[Guest]: And thank you for all the people who have like been

06:29:52.040 --> 06:29:54.040
[Guest]: Great person. Please continue being kind to

06:29:54.040 --> 06:29:56.040
[Guest]: Others, you know, and and kindness

06:29:56.040 --> 06:29:58.040
[Guest]: Matters, you know, and it's just

06:29:58.040 --> 06:30:00.040
[Guest]: Still something like sometimes a lot of people come to

06:30:00.040 --> 06:30:02.040
[Guest]: Me and say did you did I do something bad

06:30:02.040 --> 06:30:04.040
[Guest]: If you remove me for your list. I said no, I don't have

06:30:04.040 --> 06:30:06.040
[Guest]: I'm not sent it out in the last five years

06:30:06.040 --> 06:30:08.040
[Guest]: I'm sorry. It's not that I've removed you

06:30:08.040 --> 06:30:10.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't remove anyone once they're on the list. See all

06:30:10.040 --> 06:30:12.040
[Amit Varma]: These people have been kind to you and now they're feeling

06:30:12.040 --> 06:30:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Anxiety. Why aren't they on the list? What happened?

06:30:14.040 --> 06:30:16.040
[Guest]: What happened?

06:30:16.040 --> 06:30:18.040
[Guest]: So so

06:30:18.040 --> 06:30:20.040
[Guest]: But but yeah, I just feel like

06:30:20.040 --> 06:30:22.040
[Guest]: We need to acknowledge those people who are

06:30:22.040 --> 06:30:24.040
[Guest]: You saying it's tough to be attending and I I completely

06:30:24.040 --> 06:30:26.040
[Guest]: Agree on it. It is very tough to be authentic

06:30:26.040 --> 06:30:28.040
[Guest]: You know the world wants to

06:30:28.040 --> 06:30:30.040
[Guest]: Fit into boxes. It will try everything

06:30:30.040 --> 06:30:32.040
[Guest]: To ensure that you're in one

06:30:32.040 --> 06:30:34.040
[Guest]: They will every little pressure

06:30:34.040 --> 06:30:36.040
[Guest]: Every pressure from everywhere

06:30:36.040 --> 06:30:38.040
[Guest]: Will will will try to do that

06:30:38.040 --> 06:30:40.040
[Guest]: But I can tell you that

06:30:40.040 --> 06:30:42.040
[Guest]: If you have privilege if you have a little bit of

06:30:42.040 --> 06:30:44.040
[Guest]: Power and in my life, I've seen that the

06:30:44.040 --> 06:30:46.040
[Guest]: Moment I've had these privileges and powers

06:30:46.040 --> 06:30:48.040
[Guest]: Use it to do something good

06:30:48.040 --> 06:30:50.040
[Guest]: Because what is the point otherwise, right?

06:30:50.040 --> 06:30:52.040
[Guest]: I've started Yuva as a

06:30:52.040 --> 06:30:54.040
[Guest]: Company and the kind of culture we have

06:30:54.040 --> 06:30:56.040
[Guest]: The reason that we have this culture right now is

06:30:56.040 --> 06:30:58.040
[Guest]: Because I never got this culture in you know

06:30:58.040 --> 06:31:00.040
[Guest]: And while again Yashraj was

06:31:00.040 --> 06:31:02.040
[Guest]: Still a place which was really like kind to

06:31:02.040 --> 06:31:04.040
[Guest]: Me but culturally I just

06:31:04.040 --> 06:31:06.040
[Guest]: Feel like what we are trying to do at Yuva is

06:31:06.040 --> 06:31:08.040
[Guest]: Not something I've gotten anywhere and today

06:31:08.040 --> 06:31:10.040
[Guest]: The kind of young people who work with us, you know

06:31:10.040 --> 06:31:12.040
[Guest]: We've it's a four-year company

06:31:12.040 --> 06:31:14.040
[Guest]: About

06:31:14.040 --> 06:31:16.040
[Guest]: Seven people have been here from three plus years

06:31:16.040 --> 06:31:18.040
[Guest]: You know and and all of them

06:31:18.040 --> 06:31:20.040
[Guest]: Started at 23-24 and they're now

06:31:20.040 --> 06:31:22.040
[Guest]: 27 and some of them are now in leadership positions

06:31:22.040 --> 06:31:24.040
[Guest]: You're getting great money also and

06:31:24.040 --> 06:31:26.040
[Guest]: They're just not leaving and touch wood and the reason

06:31:26.040 --> 06:31:28.040
[Guest]: For that is they just they they have had

06:31:28.040 --> 06:31:30.040
[Guest]: Different jobs and they're like we will never

06:31:30.040 --> 06:31:32.040
[Guest]: Have a place which as a culture

06:31:32.040 --> 06:31:34.040
[Guest]: Like this right and it is

06:31:34.040 --> 06:31:36.040
[Guest]: And they've created that they have

06:31:36.040 --> 06:31:38.040
[Guest]: Bought into that idea that this culture is important

06:31:38.040 --> 06:31:40.040
[Guest]: So it's not just me saying that

06:31:40.040 --> 06:31:42.040
[Guest]: Because you know everybody else has to

06:31:42.040 --> 06:31:44.040
[Guest]: Buy into that idea and be that kind

06:31:44.040 --> 06:31:46.040
[Guest]: And nice to each other we don't touch

06:31:46.040 --> 06:31:48.040
[Guest]: Wood again we don't have any

06:31:48.040 --> 06:31:50.040
[Guest]: Politics at Yuva why should we

06:31:50.040 --> 06:31:52.040
[Guest]: Because we don't we are very honest and transparent

06:31:52.040 --> 06:31:54.040
[Guest]: In the systems that we have there is no politics

06:31:54.040 --> 06:31:56.040
[Guest]: No one's bitching about anybody else at least

06:31:56.040 --> 06:31:58.040
[Guest]: At least not that I know of right but

06:31:58.040 --> 06:32:00.040
[Guest]: Like I don't you know you see it toxic

06:32:00.040 --> 06:32:02.040
[Guest]: Teams you see what is toxic in

06:32:02.040 --> 06:32:04.040
[Guest]: This team there is just a lot of love

06:32:04.040 --> 06:32:06.040
[Guest]: And empathy for each other I see

06:32:06.040 --> 06:32:08.040
[Guest]: That I see people stepping up for

06:32:08.040 --> 06:32:10.040
[Guest]: Each other I see people looking out

06:32:10.040 --> 06:32:12.040
[Guest]: For each other this is you know

06:32:12.040 --> 06:32:14.040
[Guest]: Just small little things that I see that

06:32:14.040 --> 06:32:16.040
[Guest]: Just makes me so happy like this boy who

06:32:16.040 --> 06:32:18.040
[Guest]: I really you know

06:32:18.040 --> 06:32:20.040
[Guest]: Adore if he hears this who is

06:32:20.040 --> 06:32:22.040
[Guest]: From Kolkata and he's

06:32:22.040 --> 06:32:24.040
[Guest]: Been with us now for two and a half years and he's still

06:32:24.040 --> 06:32:26.040
[Guest]: 22 so he's been with us since college

06:32:26.040 --> 06:32:28.040
[Guest]: He was part of the first roadshow then he

06:32:28.040 --> 06:32:30.040
[Guest]: You know he got a job which

06:32:30.040 --> 06:32:32.040
[Guest]: Was making a lot more we couldn't afford

06:32:32.040 --> 06:32:34.040
[Guest]: That at that point of time now he's grown

06:32:34.040 --> 06:32:36.040
[Guest]: And he's got more money now but he's trusted

06:32:36.040 --> 06:32:38.040
[Guest]: Us you know he's very smart very smart kid

06:32:38.040 --> 06:32:40.040
[Guest]: And he's trusted I feel like his talent with us he feels

06:32:40.040 --> 06:32:42.040
[Guest]: Like I oversell his talent but he's

06:32:42.040 --> 06:32:44.040
[Guest]: Very talented and he had

06:32:44.040 --> 06:32:46.040
[Guest]: His birthday you know and he

06:32:46.040 --> 06:32:48.040
[Guest]: Was first birthday away from home

06:32:48.040 --> 06:32:50.040
[Guest]: You know and I was just

06:32:50.040 --> 06:32:52.040
[Guest]: I wanted to and I was like

06:32:52.040 --> 06:32:54.040
[Guest]: What are you doing he's like I'm not doing anything and I wanted

06:32:54.040 --> 06:32:56.040
[Guest]: To kind of that day I had to

06:32:56.040 --> 06:32:58.040
[Guest]: I think I was traveling or something I wanted to be with

06:32:58.040 --> 06:33:00.040
[Guest]: Him but I couldn't I told my team I said like

06:33:00.040 --> 06:33:02.040
[Guest]: Guys first birthday you all have

06:33:02.040 --> 06:33:04.040
[Guest]: To you know take him out etc and it was

06:33:04.040 --> 06:33:06.040
[Guest]: Not like meant to be like just over

06:33:06.040 --> 06:33:08.040
[Guest]: In lunch and said it and that night

06:33:08.040 --> 06:33:10.040
[Guest]: All the other young people took him out

06:33:10.040 --> 06:33:12.040
[Guest]: Yeah whatever class they had they all cancelled

06:33:12.040 --> 06:33:14.040
[Guest]: And they were just they celebrated went to

06:33:14.040 --> 06:33:16.040
[Guest]: Marine Drive because he said I never seen Marine Drive

06:33:16.040 --> 06:33:18.040
[Guest]: So they all went to Marine Drive with him and chilled

06:33:18.040 --> 06:33:20.040
[Guest]: With him I saw in the stories and I was just like this is so

06:33:20.040 --> 06:33:22.040
[Guest]: Sweet you didn't have to do it

06:33:22.040 --> 06:33:24.040
[Guest]: I just said it upar upar se but they

06:33:24.040 --> 06:33:26.040
[Guest]: Left everything said yes we will do it and that's the

06:33:26.040 --> 06:33:28.040
[Guest]: You know touch wood like that's the culture that

06:33:28.040 --> 06:33:30.040
[Guest]: We have at Yuva and I've not had that

06:33:30.040 --> 06:33:32.040
[Guest]: Culture you know and any of the organization

06:33:32.040 --> 06:33:34.040
[Guest]: People kind of looking out for each other in this way

06:33:34.040 --> 06:33:36.040
[Guest]: You know but why can't that be a culture

06:33:36.040 --> 06:33:38.040
[Guest]: So again these pretenses are

06:33:38.040 --> 06:33:40.040
[Guest]: There because we have

06:33:40.040 --> 06:33:42.040
[Guest]: Lived in a world where people have

06:33:42.040 --> 06:33:44.040
[Guest]: You know lauded these pretenses

06:33:44.040 --> 06:33:46.040
[Guest]: Over us

06:33:46.040 --> 06:33:48.040
[Guest]: It is not easy to break through these pretenses

06:33:48.040 --> 06:33:50.040
[Guest]: It's really hard work I've not talked

06:33:50.040 --> 06:33:52.040
[Guest]: Enough about you know some of the

06:33:52.040 --> 06:33:54.040
[Guest]: Really tough times that I've faced in

06:33:54.040 --> 06:33:56.040
[Guest]: My work environments but

06:33:56.040 --> 06:33:58.040
[Guest]: I have faced a lot of tough times

06:33:58.040 --> 06:34:00.040
[Guest]: Including my own company in year one at Yuva

06:34:00.040 --> 06:34:02.040
[Guest]: Was a disaster I

06:34:02.040 --> 06:34:04.040
[Guest]: Can acknowledge it now

06:34:04.040 --> 06:34:06.040
[Guest]: But it was a just

06:34:06.040 --> 06:34:08.040
[Guest]: My understanding

06:34:08.040 --> 06:34:10.040
[Guest]: Of what empathy should look like at the

06:34:10.040 --> 06:34:12.040
[Guest]: Workplace just was a

06:34:12.040 --> 06:34:14.040
[Guest]: Absolute wrong decision

06:34:14.040 --> 06:34:16.040
[Guest]: I think empathy should come with

06:34:16.040 --> 06:34:18.040
[Guest]: Also professionalism and discipline

06:34:18.040 --> 06:34:20.040
[Guest]: I had completely

06:34:20.040 --> 06:34:22.040
[Guest]: Ignored that aspect of you know

06:34:22.040 --> 06:34:24.040
[Guest]: Work and just said like

06:34:24.040 --> 06:34:26.040
[Guest]: If as long as there is empathy

06:34:26.040 --> 06:34:28.040
[Guest]: In the team it's a great team but obviously

06:34:28.040 --> 06:34:30.040
[Guest]: It was a great team but it was not a team that was

06:34:30.040 --> 06:34:32.040
[Guest]: Working as hard it should be

06:34:32.040 --> 06:34:34.040
[Guest]: So it's a big disaster

06:34:34.040 --> 06:34:36.040
[Guest]: I failed spectacularly

06:34:36.040 --> 06:34:38.040
[Guest]: As like a leader or entrepreneur in the first

06:34:38.040 --> 06:34:40.040
[Guest]: Year and a half but then I've

06:34:40.040 --> 06:34:42.040
[Guest]: Learned from mistakes tried to

06:34:42.040 --> 06:34:44.040
[Guest]: Re you know kind of had

06:34:44.040 --> 06:34:46.040
[Guest]: A 2.0 of

06:34:46.040 --> 06:34:48.040
[Guest]: Yuva you know and try to get

06:34:48.040 --> 06:34:50.040
[Guest]: New people try to try and now it's

06:34:50.040 --> 06:34:52.040
[Guest]: Worked you know touch wood now three and a half years it's been

06:34:52.040 --> 06:34:54.040
[Guest]: Now where we have a very solid

06:34:54.040 --> 06:34:56.040
[Guest]: Team and very solid work culture

06:34:56.040 --> 06:34:58.040
[Guest]: But yeah it's tough

06:34:58.040 --> 06:35:00.040
[Guest]: No one says it's easy but when you hit

06:35:00.040 --> 06:35:02.040
[Guest]: Go to the other side it's worth

06:35:02.040 --> 06:35:04.040
[Guest]: It it's worth it in such I'm

06:35:04.040 --> 06:35:06.040
[Guest]: Able to be here on a workday because my team

06:35:06.040 --> 06:35:08.040
[Guest]: Is kick ass I've told them I'm

06:35:08.040 --> 06:35:10.040
[Guest]: On your podcast and I don't even have

06:35:10.040 --> 06:35:12.040
[Guest]: To like and it's not like you know anybody

06:35:12.040 --> 06:35:14.040
[Guest]: Is like oh look at this he's the CEO

06:35:14.040 --> 06:35:16.040
[Guest]: Of the company and he's going and chilling in a podcast

06:35:16.040 --> 06:35:18.040
[Guest]: I have to work nothing like that

06:35:18.040 --> 06:35:20.040
[Guest]: Because we look after them there's a boy from

06:35:20.040 --> 06:35:22.040
[Guest]: Our team in the last two weeks he's been

06:35:22.040 --> 06:35:24.040
[Guest]: Ill and this

06:35:24.040 --> 06:35:26.040
[Guest]: We welcomed him back with flowers and

06:35:26.040 --> 06:35:28.040
[Guest]: Thank you for being alive like we've not

06:35:28.040 --> 06:35:30.040
[Guest]: We were never going to question

06:35:30.040 --> 06:35:32.040
[Guest]: And so many the same kid

06:35:32.040 --> 06:35:34.040
[Guest]: Okay I was talking about

06:35:34.040 --> 06:35:36.040
[Guest]: He was feeling lonely Durga Pooja is very

06:35:36.040 --> 06:35:38.040
[Guest]: Important from Kolkata right so he was being lonely

06:35:38.040 --> 06:35:40.040
[Guest]: He's like can I go home for a month

06:35:40.040 --> 06:35:42.040
[Guest]: And work from home from there

06:35:42.040 --> 06:35:44.040
[Guest]: Now he's very important because he's done

06:35:44.040 --> 06:35:46.040
[Guest]: A lot of good work

06:35:46.040 --> 06:35:48.040
[Guest]: In among the younger kids there is he's

06:35:48.040 --> 06:35:50.040
[Guest]: A lot of responsibility that we put on him

06:35:50.040 --> 06:35:52.040
[Guest]: We kind of spoke to each other and then we were

06:35:52.040 --> 06:35:54.040
[Guest]: Like you know we will miss him on these things or whatever

06:35:54.040 --> 06:35:56.040
[Guest]: It is but then we also realize that he's

06:35:56.040 --> 06:35:58.040
[Guest]: Been such an important part of you are you

06:35:58.040 --> 06:36:00.040
[Guest]: Know if he wants this one thing

06:36:00.040 --> 06:36:02.040
[Guest]: Let's make it happen for him right

06:36:02.040 --> 06:36:04.040
[Guest]: And then we said okay go ahead you know

06:36:04.040 --> 06:36:06.040
[Guest]: And and he's just

06:36:06.040 --> 06:36:08.040
[Guest]: I mean

06:36:08.040 --> 06:36:10.040
[Guest]: What else are we here for you know if you're

06:36:10.040 --> 06:36:12.040
[Guest]: Not here to like look after each other so

06:36:12.040 --> 06:36:14.040
[Guest]: It's just

06:36:14.040 --> 06:36:16.040
[Guest]: There's a lot of pretense

06:36:16.040 --> 06:36:18.040
[Guest]: But

06:36:18.040 --> 06:36:20.040
[Guest]: Beyond that lies love

06:36:20.040 --> 06:36:22.040
[Guest]: So let's stop

06:36:22.040 --> 06:36:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Pretending

06:36:24.040 --> 06:36:26.040
[Amit Varma]: So much to learn from all of this and I love the

06:36:26.040 --> 06:36:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Idea of the annual thank you letter you know

06:36:28.040 --> 06:36:30.040
[Amit Varma]: When you mentioned that I said my first

06:36:30.040 --> 06:36:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Thought was

06:36:32.040 --> 06:36:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And my second thought was

06:36:34.040 --> 06:36:36.040
[Amit Varma]: But

06:36:36.040 --> 06:36:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know before

06:36:38.040 --> 06:36:40.040
[Amit Varma]: We you know as we are on the

06:36:40.040 --> 06:36:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Closing stretch and we've already spoken for

06:36:42.040 --> 06:36:44.040
[Amit Varma]: More than six hours and I haven't asked you about you

06:36:44.040 --> 06:36:46.040
[Unknown]: So I want to ask you about that

06:36:46.040 --> 06:36:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about

06:36:48.040 --> 06:36:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the impetus behind starting

06:36:50.040 --> 06:36:52.040
[Amit Varma]: You are especially since

06:36:52.040 --> 06:36:54.040
[Amit Varma]: You know the kind of purpose driven content

06:36:54.040 --> 06:36:56.040
[Amit Varma]: That you wanted to make

06:36:56.040 --> 06:36:58.040
[Amit Varma]: You were already making it in a sense

06:36:58.040 --> 06:37:00.040
[Amit Varma]: You know in any case that purpose driven

06:37:00.040 --> 06:37:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Content is not preachy

06:37:02.040 --> 06:37:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Content or anything it is just content

06:37:04.040 --> 06:37:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Which is on those themes

06:37:06.040 --> 06:37:08.040
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise as great story telling and

06:37:08.040 --> 06:37:10.040
[Amit Varma]: So on and so forth and you were already

06:37:10.040 --> 06:37:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Doing that at Yash Raj before this

06:37:12.040 --> 06:37:14.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know why did you feel

06:37:14.040 --> 06:37:16.040
[Amit Varma]: The need

06:37:16.040 --> 06:37:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And I love the

06:37:18.040 --> 06:37:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Decision to make it a for profit by the way

06:37:20.040 --> 06:37:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Which you know because if you

06:37:22.040 --> 06:37:24.040
[Amit Varma]: If one has a confidence that we are bringing

06:37:24.040 --> 06:37:26.040
[Unknown]: Value to people then why not

06:37:26.040 --> 06:37:28.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about

06:37:28.040 --> 06:37:30.040
[Amit Varma]: The thoughts that went into your forming it

06:37:30.040 --> 06:37:32.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know

06:37:32.040 --> 06:37:34.040
[Amit Varma]: What do you see your mission as how is that evolved

06:37:34.040 --> 06:37:36.040
[Guest]: What's the journey been like

06:37:36.040 --> 06:37:38.040
[Guest]: So let me talk

06:37:38.040 --> 06:37:40.040
[Guest]: Let me talk about a show that we made at Yash Raj

06:37:40.040 --> 06:37:42.040
[Guest]: Called Man's World

06:37:42.040 --> 06:37:44.040
[Guest]: It was a show about gender equality

06:37:44.040 --> 06:37:46.040
[Guest]: But we had this outrageous idea

06:37:46.040 --> 06:37:48.040
[Guest]: So Richard Curtis

06:37:48.040 --> 06:37:50.040
[Guest]: The man behind

06:37:50.040 --> 06:37:52.040
[Guest]: Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral

06:37:52.040 --> 06:37:54.040
[Guest]: Notting Hill

06:37:54.040 --> 06:37:56.040
[Guest]: Runs this organization called

06:37:56.040 --> 06:37:58.040
[Guest]: Project Everyone which is the media partner

06:37:58.040 --> 06:38:00.040
[Guest]: Of the SDGs the Global Goals

06:38:00.040 --> 06:38:02.040
[Guest]: The United Nations Media Partner

06:38:02.040 --> 06:38:04.040
[Guest]: So his organization

06:38:04.040 --> 06:38:06.040
[Guest]: Does all the content across the

06:38:06.040 --> 06:38:08.040
[Guest]: World when it comes to SDGs

06:38:08.040 --> 06:38:10.040
[Guest]: Or oversees it

06:38:10.040 --> 06:38:12.040
[Guest]: Creatively fantastic organization

06:38:12.040 --> 06:38:14.040
[Guest]: Fantastic people have worked with them

06:38:14.040 --> 06:38:16.040
[Guest]: Multiple times now that was the first

06:38:16.040 --> 06:38:18.040
[Guest]: We had got an email from Richard Curtis in our inbox

06:38:18.040 --> 06:38:20.040
[Guest]: Saying like we want to make

06:38:20.040 --> 06:38:22.040
[Guest]: Something in India around gender equality

06:38:22.040 --> 06:38:24.040
[Guest]: You know it is SDG

06:38:24.040 --> 06:38:26.040
[Guest]: And we would love

06:38:26.040 --> 06:38:28.040
[Guest]: To work with Yash Raj Films and can we

06:38:28.040 --> 06:38:30.040
[Guest]: Do a preachy

06:38:30.040 --> 06:38:32.040
[Guest]: Sorry didn't say preachy can we do like a

06:38:32.040 --> 06:38:34.040
[Guest]: Two minute video around

06:38:34.040 --> 06:38:36.040
[Guest]: Gender equality and we came back and said

06:38:36.040 --> 06:38:38.040
[Guest]: Like these two minute videos even

06:38:38.040 --> 06:38:40.040
[Guest]: Let's get big stars we just said like they become very preachy

06:38:40.040 --> 06:38:42.040
[Guest]: You can have the biggest stars

06:38:42.040 --> 06:38:44.040
[Guest]: But they will never have the impact

06:38:44.040 --> 06:38:46.040
[Guest]: You know if you want to especially you want to reach out

06:38:46.040 --> 06:38:48.040
[Guest]: They wanted to reach out to young people

06:38:48.040 --> 06:38:50.040
[Guest]: If you want to reach out to young people right now

06:38:50.040 --> 06:38:52.040
[Guest]: The cool thing is you know

06:38:52.040 --> 06:38:54.040
[Guest]: YouTube has become really big in India

06:38:54.040 --> 06:38:56.040
[Guest]: And we didn't have a YouTube channel at that time

06:38:56.040 --> 06:38:58.040
[Guest]: So we didn't have like or an active YouTube channel let's say

06:38:58.040 --> 06:39:00.040
[Guest]: And we had this

06:39:00.040 --> 06:39:02.040
[Guest]: Thought where we said that what if

06:39:02.040 --> 06:39:04.040
[Guest]: We did

06:39:04.040 --> 06:39:06.040
[Guest]: Permanent Roommates had just

06:39:06.040 --> 06:39:08.040
[Guest]: Come out I was very excited about the potential

06:39:08.040 --> 06:39:10.040
[Guest]: I had been brought on to make

06:39:10.040 --> 06:39:12.040
[Guest]: Films at Y Films which is the youth wing of Yash Raj

06:39:12.040 --> 06:39:14.040
[Guest]: Films but

06:39:14.040 --> 06:39:16.040
[Guest]: I had been told that I am now

06:39:16.040 --> 06:39:18.040
[Guest]: Also going to be leading the digital efforts

06:39:18.040 --> 06:39:20.040
[Guest]: And

06:39:20.040 --> 06:39:22.040
[Guest]: I was very excited about that so I said like as part of this

06:39:22.040 --> 06:39:24.040
[Guest]: What if we kind of did a web show around this

06:39:24.040 --> 06:39:26.040
[Guest]: And then my boss and I at that time

06:39:26.040 --> 06:39:28.040
[Guest]: Kind of jammed and there was a story that had come

06:39:28.040 --> 06:39:30.040
[Guest]: To us a series of sketches about gender

06:39:30.040 --> 06:39:32.040
[Guest]: But like with the world

06:39:32.040 --> 06:39:34.040
[Guest]: Inverted what if women were in the place

06:39:34.040 --> 06:39:36.040
[Guest]: Of men and men were in the place of women

06:39:36.040 --> 06:39:38.040
[Guest]: And then we said what if this wasn't a series of sketches

06:39:38.040 --> 06:39:40.040
[Guest]: But like a fiction show about

06:39:40.040 --> 06:39:42.040
[Guest]: A man who is misogynistic

06:39:42.040 --> 06:39:44.040
[Guest]: And dislikes women and thinks that

06:39:44.040 --> 06:39:46.040
[Guest]: Women have it too easy

06:39:46.040 --> 06:39:48.040
[Guest]: Why do you have

06:39:48.040 --> 06:39:50.040
[Guest]: Seats reserved for you in the buses

06:39:50.040 --> 06:39:52.040
[Guest]: Why do you get menstrual leaves

06:39:52.040 --> 06:39:54.040
[Guest]: Why is mother India why is there no father India

06:39:54.040 --> 06:39:56.040
[Guest]: All kinds of stupid things right

06:39:56.040 --> 06:39:58.040
[Guest]: And then he prays to the god and says

06:39:58.040 --> 06:40:00.040
[Guest]: If

06:40:00.040 --> 06:40:02.040
[Guest]: If the world flipped

06:40:02.040 --> 06:40:04.040
[Guest]: And you know and men were

06:40:04.040 --> 06:40:06.040
[Guest]: Women and women were women I wouldn't complain this much

06:40:06.040 --> 06:40:08.040
[Guest]: And cut to the world flips and he wakes up

06:40:08.040 --> 06:40:10.040
[Guest]: And realizes that now men are in the minority

06:40:10.040 --> 06:40:12.040
[Guest]: So to speak

06:40:12.040 --> 06:40:14.040
[Guest]: And are the oppressed community

06:40:14.040 --> 06:40:16.040
[Guest]: Women are like now people in power

06:40:16.040 --> 06:40:18.040
[Guest]: And the next three episodes

06:40:18.040 --> 06:40:20.040
[Guest]: Four episodes are about what happens there

06:40:20.040 --> 06:40:22.040
[Guest]: And every situation

06:40:22.040 --> 06:40:24.040
[Guest]: That women are in we kind of put a man

06:40:24.040 --> 06:40:26.040
[Guest]: In it and it's funny and it's also horrific

06:40:26.040 --> 06:40:28.040
[Guest]: Because he is going out

06:40:28.040 --> 06:40:30.040
[Guest]: In the night

06:40:30.040 --> 06:40:32.040
[Guest]: Wearing a low cut v-neck

06:40:32.040 --> 06:40:34.040
[Guest]: And there is a girl who is harassing him

06:40:34.040 --> 06:40:36.040
[Guest]: And then when he goes to the

06:40:36.040 --> 06:40:38.040
[Guest]: Police station the police

06:40:38.040 --> 06:40:40.040
[Guest]: The woman on the police station says what were you wearing

06:40:40.040 --> 06:40:42.040
[Guest]: So it's it's you know

06:40:42.040 --> 06:40:44.040
[Guest]: You laugh at it because it's

06:40:44.040 --> 06:40:46.040
[Guest]: A man and it's funny right

06:40:46.040 --> 06:40:48.040
[Guest]: But then it's also horrifying because this is what happens with women in India

06:40:48.040 --> 06:40:50.040
[Guest]: You know and she is

06:40:50.040 --> 06:40:52.040
[Guest]: Watching like a video

06:40:52.040 --> 06:40:54.040
[Guest]: You know which is so anyway

06:40:54.040 --> 06:40:56.040
[Guest]: Not to go too deep into it a lot of interesting

[Guest]: Pratish Nandy so many people

06:41:00.040 --> 06:41:02.040
[Guest]: When the show came out

06:41:02.040 --> 06:41:04.040
[Guest]: They asked us this

06:41:04.040 --> 06:41:06.040
[Guest]: True story so they had asked

06:41:06.040 --> 06:41:08.040
[Guest]: What is the what do you think you will get

06:41:08.040 --> 06:41:10.040
[Guest]: As views and this is now we are talking about

[Guest]: Wasn't like numbers and targets and what

06:41:18.040 --> 06:41:20.040
[Guest]: And we said we think we will get

06:41:20.040 --> 06:41:22.040
[Guest]: Like over a period of five episodes

06:41:22.040 --> 06:41:24.040
[Guest]: Six episodes and we've got all of these

06:41:24.040 --> 06:41:26.040

[Guest]: Including the trailer

06:41:32.040 --> 06:41:34.040
[Guest]: Next morning I remember we came to

[Guest]: Office after the show had launched 24 hours later

06:41:36.040 --> 06:41:38.040
[Guest]: And then all of us were staring at each other's faces

06:41:38.040 --> 06:41:40.040
[Guest]: Because we had crossed

06:41:40.040 --> 06:41:42.040
[Guest]: 1 million in 24

06:41:42.040 --> 06:41:44.040

[Guest]: This show had gone viral

06:41:50.040 --> 06:41:52.040
[Guest]: It was one of the first viral pieces of content

06:41:52.040 --> 06:41:54.040
[Guest]: At that time and we were

06:41:54.040 --> 06:41:56.040

[Guest]: And it just and then you knew what happened

[Guest]: For finally making

06:42:26.040 --> 06:42:28.040
[Guest]: Something that you know

06:42:28.040 --> 06:42:30.040

[Guest]: Me understand my mother better you know

[Guest]: Of course there was also misogyny

06:42:40.040 --> 06:42:42.040
[Guest]: But not at that scale that is there right now

06:42:42.040 --> 06:42:44.040
[Guest]: You know the internet as I said

06:42:44.040 --> 06:42:46.040
[Guest]: Discussed empowered a certain kind of

06:42:46.040 --> 06:42:48.040
[Guest]: Idea

[Guest]: Girls had come to that room

06:43:58.040 --> 06:44:00.040
[Guest]: Because somebody had told them

06:44:00.040 --> 06:44:02.040
[Guest]: That the person behind man's world was

06:44:02.040 --> 06:44:04.040

[Guest]: So bad I don't have the picture we didn't have place to

06:44:12.040 --> 06:44:14.040
[Guest]: Sit we just it was not expected

06:44:14.040 --> 06:44:16.040
[Guest]: It was supposed to be a small thing about 4-5

06:44:16.040 --> 06:44:18.040
[Guest]: People 500 girls had turned

06:44:18.040 --> 06:44:20.040
[Guest]: Up literally it was full full

06:44:20.040 --> 06:44:22.040
[Guest]: Hard plate room and I'm standing there and I'm just like

06:44:22.040 --> 06:44:24.040
[Guest]: What is happening and they're just like we everybody

06:44:24.040 --> 06:44:26.040

[Guest]: Has helped us explain you know

06:44:32.040 --> 06:44:34.040
[Guest]: Inequality to people that we know

06:44:34.040 --> 06:44:36.040
[Guest]: This that and I

06:44:36.040 --> 06:44:38.040
[Guest]: Was like man this is is this the power

06:44:38.040 --> 06:44:40.040
[Guest]: Of like I mean I had this

06:44:40.040 --> 06:44:42.040
[Guest]: Idea and hypothesis that you know this is

06:44:42.040 --> 06:44:44.040
[Guest]: What can happen but this

06:44:44.040 --> 06:44:46.040
[Guest]: Is insane

06:44:46.040 --> 06:44:48.040
[Guest]: And I just realized that this is this

06:44:48.040 --> 06:44:50.040
[Guest]: True potential you know we don't we can't just

06:44:50.040 --> 06:44:52.040
[Guest]: Start this conversation on the internet

06:44:52.040 --> 06:44:54.040
[Guest]: And then like stop it there we

06:44:54.040 --> 06:44:56.040
[Guest]: Need to talk we need to do these things

06:44:56.040 --> 06:44:58.040
[Guest]: Mindfully offline and

06:44:58.040 --> 06:45:00.040
[Guest]: And I tried doing that at Yashraj you know

06:45:00.040 --> 06:45:02.040
[Guest]: I tried I had a big vision for what

06:45:02.040 --> 06:45:04.040
[Guest]: Twyfels could be all the shows we did

06:45:04.040 --> 06:45:06.040
[Guest]: Were about socially conscious issues

06:45:06.040 --> 06:45:08.040
[Guest]: Ladyzoom was about you know it was

06:45:08.040 --> 06:45:10.040
[Guest]: A feminist show was India's first

06:45:10.040 --> 06:45:12.040
[Guest]: Show genuinely India's first

06:45:12.040 --> 06:45:14.040
[Guest]: Show featuring women in

06:45:14.040 --> 06:45:16.040
[Guest]: The lead and it was English language

06:45:16.040 --> 06:45:18.040
[Guest]: And we spoke about at that time about

06:45:18.040 --> 06:45:20.040
[Guest]: You know abortions and about sexual

06:45:20.040 --> 06:45:22.040
[Guest]: Harassment and about all the you know

06:45:22.040 --> 06:45:24.040
[Guest]: Issues that now we are talking a lot more about

06:45:24.040 --> 06:45:26.040
[Guest]: When it comes to women Shreya Dhanwantri

06:45:26.040 --> 06:45:28.040
[Guest]: And Sabha Azad were in that show that

06:45:28.040 --> 06:45:30.040
[Guest]: Became again a huge success to an

06:45:30.040 --> 06:45:32.040
[Guest]: Extended Indie wire called it one of the best shows

06:45:32.040 --> 06:45:34.040
[Guest]: In the world at that time organically

06:45:34.040 --> 06:45:36.040
[Guest]: Picked it up we didn't have a say in that so

06:45:36.040 --> 06:45:38.040
[Guest]: Six pack band we made which is India's first

06:45:38.040 --> 06:45:40.040
[Guest]: Transgender pop group won the Khan

06:45:40.040 --> 06:45:42.040
[Guest]: Grand Prix class lion

06:45:42.040 --> 06:45:44.040
[Guest]: Bang Baja Baraat of course became very popular

06:45:44.040 --> 06:45:46.040
[Guest]: One of these shows

06:45:46.040 --> 06:45:48.040
[Guest]: I tried very

06:45:48.040 --> 06:45:50.040
[Guest]: Hard within the wiref ecosystem

06:45:50.040 --> 06:45:52.040
[Guest]: To go beyond what we are doing on the

06:45:52.040 --> 06:45:54.040
[Guest]: Internet I was like the potential for this is

06:45:54.040 --> 06:45:56.040
[Guest]: To have these conversations offline

06:45:56.040 --> 06:45:58.040
[Guest]: To take these shows

06:45:58.040 --> 06:46:00.040
[Guest]: Take them to colleges

06:46:00.040 --> 06:46:02.040
[Guest]: Take them to because again I worked so

06:46:02.040 --> 06:46:04.040
[Guest]: Closely with young people across you know I was like

06:46:04.040 --> 06:46:06.040
[Guest]: Yeah man this they can genuinely have an

06:46:06.040 --> 06:46:08.040
[Guest]: Impact I wanted to at some

06:46:08.040 --> 06:46:10.040
[Guest]: Point turn what we were doing into like

06:46:10.040 --> 06:46:12.040
[Guest]: A maybe e-magazine an offline

06:46:12.040 --> 06:46:14.040
[Guest]: Magazine have people talking about

06:46:14.040 --> 06:46:16.040
[Guest]: These issues in a larger way

06:46:16.040 --> 06:46:18.040
[Guest]: How can we create impact was always the

06:46:18.040 --> 06:46:20.040
[Guest]: Thing that you know became

06:46:20.040 --> 06:46:22.040
[Guest]: Especially with young people between you but

06:46:22.040 --> 06:46:24.040
[Guest]: Of course that's not the business model of Yashraj

06:46:24.040 --> 06:46:26.040
[Guest]: Why would they spend this kind of I felt like

06:46:26.040 --> 06:46:28.040
[Guest]: Wirefilms had that kind of it could have been

06:46:28.040 --> 06:46:30.040
[Guest]: That but it was not the priority

06:46:30.040 --> 06:46:32.040
[Guest]: And I understand that I don't begrudge that but I

06:46:32.040 --> 06:46:34.040
[Guest]: And then when I got anxiety

06:46:34.040 --> 06:46:36.040
[Guest]: You know we were also

06:46:36.040 --> 06:46:38.040
[Guest]: We were at a place where unfortunately Yashraj

06:46:38.040 --> 06:46:40.040
[Guest]: Was looting a lot of money in the film business

06:46:40.040 --> 06:46:42.040
[Guest]: A lot of their films had flopped and suddenly you know

06:46:42.040 --> 06:46:44.040
[Guest]: Wirefilms was not

06:46:44.040 --> 06:46:46.040
[Guest]: Earlier

06:46:46.040 --> 06:46:48.040
[Guest]: The very kind Aditya Chopra

06:46:48.040 --> 06:46:50.040
[Guest]: Had pretty much given

06:46:50.040 --> 06:46:52.040
[Guest]: Us full creative freedom to

06:46:52.040 --> 06:46:54.040
[Guest]: Make whatever we wanted on the internet and was

06:46:54.040 --> 06:46:56.040
[Guest]: So supportive and so sweet to us

06:46:56.040 --> 06:46:58.040
[Guest]: You know he's I mean

06:46:58.040 --> 06:47:00.040
[Guest]: Genuinely one of the nicest I can't

06:47:00.040 --> 06:47:02.040
[Guest]: Believe that someone at his level of like fame

06:47:02.040 --> 06:47:04.040
[Guest]: And like power is

06:47:04.040 --> 06:47:06.040
[Guest]: So sweet and graceful to

06:47:06.040 --> 06:47:08.040
[Guest]: Just young people in his

06:47:08.040 --> 06:47:10.040
[Guest]: Organization he's so sweet

06:47:10.040 --> 06:47:12.040
[Guest]: To you know

06:47:12.040 --> 06:47:14.040
[Guest]: Who had been always so supportive kind of

06:47:14.040 --> 06:47:16.040
[Guest]: Just obviously was much busier

06:47:16.040 --> 06:47:18.040
[Guest]: Figuring larger work

06:47:18.040 --> 06:47:20.040
[Guest]: At Wiref and and Wirefilms

06:47:20.040 --> 06:47:22.040
[Guest]: Was not the priority at that time and you know

06:47:22.040 --> 06:47:24.040
[Guest]: And I was just

06:47:24.040 --> 06:47:26.040
[Guest]: Impatient because I realized that

06:47:26.040 --> 06:47:28.040
[Guest]: There is something here but we can we had

06:47:28.040 --> 06:47:30.040
[Guest]: Made we had hit

06:47:30.040 --> 06:47:32.040
[Guest]: Two two and a half million subscribers again in

06:47:32.040 --> 06:47:34.040
[Guest]: 2015-16

06:47:34.040 --> 06:47:36.040
[Guest]: Everything we were doing it was

06:47:36.040 --> 06:47:38.040
[Guest]: Like the most successful

06:47:38.040 --> 06:47:40.040
[Guest]: Period of my life and career where

06:47:40.040 --> 06:47:42.040
[Guest]: Anything we were doing was turning into gold

06:47:42.040 --> 06:47:44.040
[Guest]: And I just

06:47:44.040 --> 06:47:46.040
[Guest]: Felt like you know and then I

06:47:46.040 --> 06:47:48.040
[Guest]: Got anxiety which you know

06:47:48.040 --> 06:47:50.040
[Guest]: Because if I mean

06:47:50.040 --> 06:47:52.040
[Guest]: And when I took that sabbatical

06:47:52.040 --> 06:47:54.040
[Guest]: And then I went again to these colleges

06:47:54.040 --> 06:47:56.040
[Guest]: In different parts of India

06:47:56.040 --> 06:47:58.040
[Guest]: Before even you I kind of went outside

06:47:58.040 --> 06:48:00.040
[Guest]: And met a lot of young people in different colleges

06:48:00.040 --> 06:48:02.040
[Guest]: In India I just knew that that's

06:48:02.040 --> 06:48:04.040
[Guest]: That's where the kindness project had happened that

06:48:04.040 --> 06:48:06.040
[Guest]: Had become a transformative experience for me

06:48:06.040 --> 06:48:08.040
[Guest]: I knew the power of offline communities

06:48:08.040 --> 06:48:10.040
[Guest]: And I wanted to say like there needs to

06:48:10.040 --> 06:48:12.040
[Guest]: Be we can't every

06:48:12.040 --> 06:48:14.040
[Guest]: Young platform in our country is a one way communication

06:48:14.040 --> 06:48:16.040
[Guest]: It's like we are putting online things

06:48:16.040 --> 06:48:18.040
[Guest]: And this is to people come

06:48:18.040 --> 06:48:20.040
[Guest]: And comment on it but we don't interact with them

06:48:20.040 --> 06:48:22.040
[Guest]: We needed to have a platform that actually

06:48:22.040 --> 06:48:24.040
[Guest]: Listens to young people we needed to have

06:48:24.040 --> 06:48:26.040
[Guest]: Two way communication that here's what we are

06:48:26.040 --> 06:48:28.040
[Guest]: Doing now we're going to go offline and talk about it

06:48:28.040 --> 06:48:30.040
[Guest]: And now we're going to have conversations about it

06:48:30.040 --> 06:48:32.040
[Guest]: You know and and that's the

06:48:32.040 --> 06:48:34.040
[Guest]: That's what I wanted to do when I started

06:48:34.040 --> 06:48:36.040
[Guest]: You know and again this was

06:48:36.040 --> 06:48:38.040
[Guest]: All an idea so just to also tell

06:48:38.040 --> 06:48:40.040
[Guest]: You the small back story of

06:48:40.040 --> 06:48:42.040
[Guest]: I had a friend called Amritpal Bindra

06:48:42.040 --> 06:48:44.040
[Guest]: Who was also the producer of

06:48:44.040 --> 06:48:46.040
[Guest]: Bang Baja Baraat and along

06:48:46.040 --> 06:48:48.040
[Guest]: You know I mean his production had made it

06:48:48.040 --> 06:48:50.040
[Guest]: And Pappu and Papa

06:48:50.040 --> 06:48:52.040
[Guest]: And we had become really thick because of the shows

06:48:52.040 --> 06:48:54.040
[Guest]: That we did together

06:48:54.040 --> 06:48:56.040
[Guest]: Anand Tiwari who is the director of

06:48:56.040 --> 06:48:58.040
[Guest]: You know Bang Baja Baraat again all three of us had become very close

06:48:58.040 --> 06:49:00.040
[Guest]: And once I was

06:49:00.040 --> 06:49:02.040
[Guest]: Done with you know when I was

06:49:02.040 --> 06:49:04.040
[Guest]: This is a true story like

06:49:04.040 --> 06:49:06.040
[Guest]: When I told my

06:49:06.040 --> 06:49:08.040
[Guest]: Therapist said that you're not emotional

06:49:08.040 --> 06:49:10.040
[Guest]: At the end of it she also said that

06:49:10.040 --> 06:49:12.040
[Guest]: You know what I'm giving you an exercise

06:49:12.040 --> 06:49:14.040
[Guest]: You have to find a male friend of yours

06:49:14.040 --> 06:49:16.040
[Guest]: And you have to go and tell that person

06:49:16.040 --> 06:49:18.040
[Guest]: You know what you're going through you know

06:49:18.040 --> 06:49:20.040
[Guest]: And I just chose Amrit Bindra

06:49:20.040 --> 06:49:22.040

[Guest]: For about

06:49:28.040 --> 06:49:30.040
[Guest]: Much longer than I think the serial

06:49:30.040 --> 06:49:32.040
[Guest]: Unseen podcast I just started

06:49:32.040 --> 06:49:34.040

06:49:34.040 --> 06:49:36.040
[Guest]: How I'm feeling and then for

06:49:36.040 --> 06:49:38.040
[Guest]: 7-8 hours I was just talking

06:49:38.040 --> 06:49:40.040
[Guest]: About like you know

06:49:40.040 --> 06:49:42.040
[Guest]: What I'm going through how anxious I am

06:49:42.040 --> 06:49:44.040
[Guest]: And how I want to do all of these things

06:49:44.040 --> 06:49:46.040
[Guest]: For young people and all these ideas that I had

06:49:46.040 --> 06:49:48.040
[Guest]: But I was like how can I do it I don't think

06:49:48.040 --> 06:49:50.040
[Guest]: They get the potential I was really frustrated I was like

06:49:50.040 --> 06:49:52.040
[Guest]: I want to do more things etc so

06:49:52.040 --> 06:49:54.040
[Guest]: Amrit very patiently sweetly listened to me that night

06:49:54.040 --> 06:49:56.040
[Guest]: And you know just was a good friend

06:49:56.040 --> 06:49:58.040
[Guest]: To me he had other plans he cancelled them all so just come

06:49:58.040 --> 06:50:00.040
[Guest]: And you know and the next morning he

06:50:00.040 --> 06:50:02.040
[Guest]: Said okay let me think over what you've said and I want

06:50:02.040 --> 06:50:04.040
[Guest]: To kind of come to you with a solution

06:50:04.040 --> 06:50:06.040
[Guest]: So I said I don't know what solution

06:50:06.040 --> 06:50:08.040
[Guest]: He will have but 2 days later he called me and said

06:50:08.040 --> 06:50:10.040
[Guest]: You know I've been thinking about it what if whatever

06:50:10.040 --> 06:50:12.040
[Guest]: You said is a company

06:50:12.040 --> 06:50:14.040
[Guest]: And I said that I don't know

06:50:14.040 --> 06:50:16.040
[Guest]: What how to do a company I'm middle class

06:50:16.040 --> 06:50:18.040
[Guest]: I don't know everything I'm too scared to

06:50:18.040 --> 06:50:20.040
[Guest]: You know do something like that he said

06:50:20.040 --> 06:50:22.040
[Guest]: He's like you don't worry

06:50:22.040 --> 06:50:24.040
[Guest]: We will raise the money what needed to

06:50:24.040 --> 06:50:26.040
[Guest]: Actually started and you just

06:50:26.040 --> 06:50:28.040
[Guest]: Run it you know you are

06:50:28.040 --> 06:50:30.040
[Guest]: All the things that you're saying that

06:50:30.040 --> 06:50:32.040
[Guest]: Should be the thing that you know

06:50:32.040 --> 06:50:34.040
[Guest]: Make it a company

06:50:34.040 --> 06:50:36.040
[Guest]: Make it a movement do what you can with it

06:50:36.040 --> 06:50:38.040
[Guest]: And I was so scared of it and

06:50:38.040 --> 06:50:40.040
[Guest]: This is before the sabbatical and everything

06:50:40.040 --> 06:50:42.040
[Guest]: And then I went I quit I went on sabbatical and I

06:50:42.040 --> 06:50:44.040
[Guest]: Think in the 2 months or 3 months I realized

06:50:44.040 --> 06:50:46.040
[Guest]: That whatever options

06:50:46.040 --> 06:50:48.040
[Guest]: I had in front of me the only

06:50:48.040 --> 06:50:50.040
[Guest]: Option that seemed like

06:50:50.040 --> 06:50:52.040
[Guest]: You know something which

06:50:52.040 --> 06:50:54.040
[Guest]: So for me Yuva

06:50:54.040 --> 06:50:56.040
[Guest]: I decided to start Yuva when

06:50:56.040 --> 06:50:58.040
[Guest]: In my head I made peace with the fact that

06:50:58.040 --> 06:51:00.040
[Guest]: Even if it fails it will be worth it

06:51:00.040 --> 06:51:02.040
[Guest]: It was not because I thought that it would

06:51:02.040 --> 06:51:04.040
[Guest]: Succeed but because I thought that if it fails

06:51:04.040 --> 06:51:06.040
[Guest]: It will still be worth it

06:51:06.040 --> 06:51:08.040
[Guest]: And yeah I came back and I

06:51:08.040 --> 06:51:10.040
[Guest]: Said and I didn't we didn't have a name at that time

06:51:10.040 --> 06:51:12.040
[Guest]: So I came back and met him and I said

06:51:12.040 --> 06:51:14.040
[Guest]: I have a name and he said what is the name I said Yuva

06:51:14.040 --> 06:51:16.040
[Guest]: And they loved the name and said let's do it

06:51:16.040 --> 06:51:18.040
[Guest]: And I had this vision that I made like this is what this

06:51:18.040 --> 06:51:20.040
[Guest]: For the next 10 years this is what

06:51:20.040 --> 06:51:22.040
[Guest]: Yuva will do and it's so

06:51:22.040 --> 06:51:24.040
[Guest]: It's so I'm so grateful that you know

06:51:24.040 --> 06:51:26.040
[Guest]: All the like out of all the things that we're doing most of

06:51:26.040 --> 06:51:28.040
[Guest]: Those things you know at this in 4 years

06:51:28.040 --> 06:51:30.040
[Guest]: And and the idea for Yuva

06:51:30.040 --> 06:51:32.040
[Guest]: Was as I said a platform that listens

06:51:32.040 --> 06:51:34.040
[Guest]: But just

06:51:34.040 --> 06:51:36.040
[Guest]: As I said we wanted to be the intersection of

06:51:36.040 --> 06:51:38.040
[Guest]: What is important what is interesting so what Yuva

06:51:38.040 --> 06:51:40.040
[Guest]: Really does now and the multiple

06:51:40.040 --> 06:51:42.040
[Guest]: Things that we do and again I'm very

06:51:42.040 --> 06:51:44.040
[Guest]: Proud of my team to be able to you know

06:51:44.040 --> 06:51:46.040
[Guest]: Do all of these things at one

06:51:46.040 --> 06:51:48.040
[Guest]: End we are doing research you know so we

06:51:48.040 --> 06:51:50.040

[Guest]: Incredible you know how honest these young people

06:53:40.040 --> 06:53:42.040
[Guest]: Are and then we presented it to the

06:53:42.040 --> 06:53:44.040
[Guest]: Government and you know now they have to figure out

06:53:44.040 --> 06:53:46.040
[Guest]: What all they want to incorporate from it that's up to

06:53:46.040 --> 06:53:48.040
[Guest]: Them but that's the level

06:53:48.040 --> 06:53:50.040

[Guest]: Open and honest communication about

06:54:44.040 --> 06:54:46.040
[Guest]: Why is it so difficult for

06:54:46.040 --> 06:54:48.040
[Guest]: So many of us to recognize what

06:54:48.040 --> 06:54:50.040
[Guest]: Consent is you know that's

06:54:50.040 --> 06:54:52.040

[Guest]: Dasara and Bill and Melinda Gates foundation

06:54:58.040 --> 06:55:00.040
[Guest]: Over the next two years to

06:55:00.040 --> 06:55:02.040
[Guest]: Put together a community

06:55:02.040 --> 06:55:04.040
[Guest]: Of 1 million young people online

06:55:04.040 --> 06:55:06.040

06:55:06.040 --> 06:55:08.040
[Guest]: And care about SRH

06:55:08.040 --> 06:55:10.040
[Guest]: In accessible and talk about

06:55:10.040 --> 06:55:12.040
[Guest]: In an accessible ways how can we make

06:55:12.040 --> 06:55:14.040

[Guest]: Around that accessible for young

06:55:16.040 --> 06:55:18.040
[Guest]: People and over the next two years

06:55:18.040 --> 06:55:20.040
[Guest]: We have put together platforms called

06:55:20.040 --> 06:55:22.040
[Guest]: Youth K Bol across Josh app twitter

06:55:22.040 --> 06:55:24.040
[Guest]: Instagram that we are going to be populating

[Guest]: And going to be making content around for

06:55:26.040 --> 06:55:28.040
[Guest]: Two years we are doing offline events will be doing

06:55:28.040 --> 06:55:30.040
[Guest]: Podcasts but for two years the

06:55:30.040 --> 06:55:32.040
[Guest]: Ideas at the end of these two years we should have a

06:55:32.040 --> 06:55:34.040
[Guest]: Community of young people

06:55:34.040 --> 06:55:36.040
[Guest]: That is constantly talking

06:55:36.040 --> 06:55:38.040
[Guest]: About SRH

06:55:38.040 --> 06:55:40.040
[Guest]: You know talking about it in meaningful ways and then

06:55:40.040 --> 06:55:42.040
[Guest]: Of course being champions where they will talk about it offline

06:55:42.040 --> 06:55:44.040
[Guest]: In their own families and lives etc right

06:55:44.040 --> 06:55:46.040
[Guest]: So that's campaigns as a separate

06:55:46.040 --> 06:55:48.040
[Guest]: Team that is working again offline

06:55:48.040 --> 06:55:50.040

[Guest]: Made she was the director on that I'm

07:02:32.040 --> 07:02:34.040
[Guest]: Filming with her so so yeah I'm

07:02:34.040 --> 07:02:36.040
[Guest]: Always it's always going to be about

07:02:36.040 --> 07:02:38.040
[Guest]: Even the work that we're doing it's never going

07:02:38.040 --> 07:02:40.040
[Guest]: To be just me it's always going to be one young person

07:02:40.040 --> 07:02:42.040
[Guest]: At least more young people associated with that work

07:02:42.040 --> 07:02:44.040
[Guest]: And and using

07:02:44.040 --> 07:02:46.040
[Guest]: Their help and working with them

07:02:46.040 --> 07:02:48.040
[Guest]: With my experience and their understanding

07:02:48.040 --> 07:02:50.040
[Guest]: And insight of you know of

07:02:50.040 --> 07:02:52.040
[Guest]: Being part of the generation how can we capture these

07:02:52.040 --> 07:02:54.040
[Guest]: Stories in a way that

07:02:54.040 --> 07:02:56.040
[Guest]: As I said again I'm repeating this

07:02:56.040 --> 07:02:58.040
[Guest]: Sounding like a broken record but like

07:02:58.040 --> 07:03:00.040
[Guest]: Make someone somewhere feel less alone

07:03:00.040 --> 07:03:02.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean you can't give a physical

07:03:02.040 --> 07:03:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Hug to everybody but you know

07:03:04.040 --> 07:03:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Virtually if you just fulfill that same

07:03:06.040 --> 07:03:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Function it kind of

07:03:08.040 --> 07:03:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Means a lot so I'll end the show by

07:03:10.040 --> 07:03:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Asking you to recommend

07:03:12.040 --> 07:03:14.040
[Amit Varma]: For me and my listeners books

07:03:14.040 --> 07:03:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Films music that you absolutely love and

07:03:16.040 --> 07:03:18.040
[Guest]: Would want everyone to this is something

07:03:18.040 --> 07:03:20.040
[Guest]: That I've also thought about a lot because I was like

07:03:20.040 --> 07:03:22.040
[Guest]: I don't know what all I can say

07:03:22.040 --> 07:03:24.040
[Guest]: But

07:03:24.040 --> 07:03:26.040
[Guest]: In the book section there

07:03:26.040 --> 07:03:28.040
[Guest]: Is a book I'm sure you must have read

07:03:28.040 --> 07:03:30.040
[Guest]: Or if you haven't I'm going to gift it to you

07:03:30.040 --> 07:03:32.040
[Guest]: It's called Humankind

07:03:32.040 --> 07:03:34.040
[Guest]: By Rutger Bregman have you read it?

07:03:34.040 --> 07:03:36.040
[Amit Varma]: I just bought it on Kindle

07:03:36.040 --> 07:03:38.040
[Amit Varma]: After I saw your video on Chalchitra

07:03:38.040 --> 07:03:40.040
[Guest]: It is

07:03:40.040 --> 07:03:42.040
[Guest]: It is the most hopeful

07:03:42.040 --> 07:03:44.040
[Guest]: Book that I have read

07:03:44.040 --> 07:03:46.040
[Guest]: In my life

07:03:46.040 --> 07:03:48.040
[Guest]: It has now become like

07:03:48.040 --> 07:03:50.040
[Guest]: I mean I want to meet Rutger Bregman

07:03:50.040 --> 07:03:52.040
[Guest]: And I want to like thank him

07:03:52.040 --> 07:03:54.040
[Guest]: I want to shake his hand although I've had

07:03:54.040 --> 07:03:56.040
[Guest]: Very weird experience with

07:03:56.040 --> 07:03:58.040
[Guest]: People I look up to so

07:03:58.040 --> 07:04:00.040
[Guest]: I hope this is a positive experience

07:04:00.040 --> 07:04:02.040
[Guest]: But I really want to tell him that

07:04:02.040 --> 07:04:04.040
[Guest]: I'm a huge fan and

07:04:04.040 --> 07:04:06.040
[Guest]: Fortunately I've been able to do that with a lot of people

07:04:06.040 --> 07:04:08.040
[Guest]: I admire and

07:04:08.040 --> 07:04:10.040
[Guest]: His book is essentially

07:04:10.040 --> 07:04:12.040
[Guest]: Optimism about

07:04:12.040 --> 07:04:14.040
[Guest]: The world

07:04:14.040 --> 07:04:16.040
[Guest]: From a lens of kindness saying that you know we've

07:04:16.040 --> 07:04:18.040
[Guest]: Historically kind of told

07:04:18.040 --> 07:04:20.040
[Guest]: The narrative that we have built is

07:04:20.040 --> 07:04:22.040
[Guest]: That the world is unkind

07:04:22.040 --> 07:04:24.040
[Guest]: But actually

07:04:24.040 --> 07:04:26.040
[Guest]: You know I will

07:04:26.040 --> 07:04:28.040
[Guest]: Prove to you and he's an economist by the way

07:04:28.040 --> 07:04:30.040
[Guest]: So he's a very well known

07:04:30.040 --> 07:04:32.040
[Guest]: Economist who's also gone

07:04:32.040 --> 07:04:34.040
[Guest]: Viral for like being at

07:04:34.040 --> 07:04:36.040
[Guest]: Davos and like

07:04:36.040 --> 07:04:38.040
[Guest]: Shutting down billionaires so he's

07:04:38.040 --> 07:04:40.040
[Guest]: Really cool person

07:04:40.040 --> 07:04:42.040
[Guest]: Not very old again I think

07:04:42.040 --> 07:04:44.040
[Guest]: Late 30s if I'm not wrong

07:04:44.040 --> 07:04:46.040
[Guest]: And he's yeah his book

07:04:46.040 --> 07:04:48.040
[Guest]: Is basically he's just trying to prove

07:04:48.040 --> 07:04:50.040
[Guest]: Through a series of you know

07:04:50.040 --> 07:04:52.040
[Guest]: Real world incidents that we all

07:04:52.040 --> 07:04:54.040
[Guest]: Know of and then shining a different light

07:04:54.040 --> 07:04:56.040
[Guest]: At them and saying I'll tell you why this was

07:04:56.040 --> 07:04:58.040
[Guest]: More kindness than unkindness

07:04:58.040 --> 07:05:00.040
[Guest]: As an example he's spoken about the Stanford prison

07:05:00.040 --> 07:05:02.040
[Guest]: Experiment which all of us know as one of the

07:05:02.040 --> 07:05:04.040
[Guest]: You know

07:05:04.040 --> 07:05:06.040
[Guest]: Like a really terrible

07:05:06.040 --> 07:05:08.040
[Guest]: Psychological

07:05:08.040 --> 07:05:10.040
[Guest]: You know event that has happened

07:05:10.040 --> 07:05:12.040
[Guest]: An experiment that has happened and he's

07:05:12.040 --> 07:05:14.040
[Guest]: Talked about how like there was

07:05:14.040 --> 07:05:16.040
[Guest]: Some kindness going on there which I mean

07:05:16.040 --> 07:05:18.040
[Guest]: Incredible I can't even explain

07:05:18.040 --> 07:05:20.040
[Amit Varma]: So so great such a great book

07:05:20.040 --> 07:05:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Didn't they find out that that was shady and it was

07:05:22.040 --> 07:05:24.040
[Guest]: Partly faked I think something came

07:05:24.040 --> 07:05:26.040
[Guest]: It talks about that also so there is a

07:05:26.040 --> 07:05:28.040
[Guest]: There is a what the

07:05:28.040 --> 07:05:30.040
[Guest]: Real experiment actually you know what it

07:05:30.040 --> 07:05:32.040
[Guest]: There is I mean I can't without

07:05:32.040 --> 07:05:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Giving it away we'll all read the book

07:05:34.040 --> 07:05:36.040
[Guest]: Superb absolutely incredible book

07:05:36.040 --> 07:05:38.040
[Guest]: That has I think had the

07:05:38.040 --> 07:05:40.040
[Guest]: Biggest impact on my life I think of recent

07:05:40.040 --> 07:05:42.040
[Guest]: Times there is also a book that I've just

07:05:42.040 --> 07:05:44.040
[Guest]: Finished reading and I mean just finish

07:05:44.040 --> 07:05:46.040
[Guest]: Finishing reading which I've just now incredibly

07:05:46.040 --> 07:05:48.040
[Guest]: Like and I'm gonna just

07:05:48.040 --> 07:05:50.040
[Guest]: Recommend recent books because I feel like

07:05:50.040 --> 07:05:52.040
[Guest]: That's the easiest thing to do

07:05:52.040 --> 07:05:54.040
[Guest]: And you know that doesn't otherwise I get

07:05:54.040 --> 07:05:56.040
[Guest]: Too divided and I start getting anxious

07:05:56.040 --> 07:05:58.040
[Guest]: Virtual can I name but

07:05:58.040 --> 07:06:00.040
[Guest]: I'm just reading this book I've

07:06:00.040 --> 07:06:02.040
[Guest]: Mentioned before Chaos Machine

07:06:02.040 --> 07:06:04.040
[Guest]: By Max Fischer which is

07:06:04.040 --> 07:06:06.040
[Guest]: I think essential reading for

07:06:06.040 --> 07:06:08.040
[Guest]: Everybody about

07:06:08.040 --> 07:06:10.040
[Guest]: The way the internet

07:06:10.040 --> 07:06:12.040
[Guest]: And social media has is ruining

07:06:12.040 --> 07:06:14.040
[Guest]: Society and you know and

07:06:14.040 --> 07:06:16.040
[Guest]: Shoving us into

07:06:16.040 --> 07:06:18.040
[Guest]: Division and polarization

07:06:18.040 --> 07:06:20.040
[Guest]: Incredible book incredibly

07:06:20.040 --> 07:06:22.040
[Guest]: Researched

07:06:22.040 --> 07:06:24.040
[Guest]: Absolutely incredible

07:06:24.040 --> 07:06:26.040
[Guest]: I mean you've

07:06:26.040 --> 07:06:28.040
[Guest]: You've already spoken about Shayana's but I just

07:06:28.040 --> 07:06:30.040
[Guest]: Her book was

07:06:30.040 --> 07:06:32.040
[Guest]: So I mean again gender

07:06:32.040 --> 07:06:34.040
[Guest]: And Shahrukh Khan

07:06:34.040 --> 07:06:36.040
[Guest]: Such a beautiful beautiful

07:06:36.040 --> 07:06:38.040
[Guest]: Book that I've read

07:06:38.040 --> 07:06:40.040
[Guest]: Another book in the not in the

07:06:40.040 --> 07:06:42.040
[Guest]: Same lines but called Invisible Women

07:06:42.040 --> 07:06:44.040
[Guest]: I'm sure it's been recommended earlier

07:06:44.040 --> 07:06:46.040
[Guest]: As well and

07:06:46.040 --> 07:06:48.040
[Guest]: Opened my mind

07:06:48.040 --> 07:06:50.040
[Guest]: And how you know from a lens

07:06:50.040 --> 07:06:52.040
[Guest]: Of the fact that every space that

07:06:52.040 --> 07:06:54.040
[Guest]: We occupy has

07:06:54.040 --> 07:06:56.040
[Guest]: Been created of and for

07:06:56.040 --> 07:06:58.040
[Guest]: And by men and

07:06:58.040 --> 07:07:00.040
[Guest]: Just things that I never thought

07:07:00.040 --> 07:07:02.040
[Guest]: Even as someone who looks at gender

07:07:02.040 --> 07:07:04.040
[Guest]: Very always sees gender in different

07:07:04.040 --> 07:07:06.040
[Guest]: Places I never thought of

07:07:06.040 --> 07:07:08.040
[Guest]: Things like how when

07:07:08.040 --> 07:07:10.040
[Guest]: In a

07:07:10.040 --> 07:07:12.040
[Guest]: In a club the

07:07:12.040 --> 07:07:14.040
[Guest]: Sizes given to the male and female

07:07:14.040 --> 07:07:16.040
[Guest]: Toilets are the same

07:07:16.040 --> 07:07:18.040
[Guest]: I mean the question was why are there more

07:07:18.040 --> 07:07:20.040
[Guest]: Women have longer lines in clubs

07:07:20.040 --> 07:07:22.040
[Guest]: Than men do why do so many women

07:07:22.040 --> 07:07:24.040
[Guest]: Want to pee and men don't want to pee

07:07:24.040 --> 07:07:26.040
[Guest]: But men because we have urinals there can be

07:07:26.040 --> 07:07:28.040
[Guest]: Five urinals at a club but for the

07:07:28.040 --> 07:07:30.040
[Guest]: Same type in the same

07:07:30.040 --> 07:07:32.040
[Guest]: Area which is also given

07:07:32.040 --> 07:07:34.040
[Guest]: By men designed by

07:07:34.040 --> 07:07:36.040
[Guest]: Men women will have only three

07:07:36.040 --> 07:07:38.040
[Guest]: Toilets sit down

07:07:38.040 --> 07:07:40.040
[Guest]: Toilets and because of that

07:07:40.040 --> 07:07:42.040
[Guest]: The lines are longer

07:07:42.040 --> 07:07:44.040
[Guest]: And you just

07:07:44.040 --> 07:07:46.040
[Guest]: Don't even think of architecture

07:07:46.040 --> 07:07:48.040
[Guest]: In a capacity of gender

07:07:48.040 --> 07:07:50.040
[Guest]: And there's just so much

07:07:50.040 --> 07:07:52.040
[Guest]: I mean it's an incredible book I read

07:07:52.040 --> 07:07:54.040
[Guest]: It really opened my mind

07:07:54.040 --> 07:07:56.040
[Guest]: I'll also

07:07:56.040 --> 07:07:58.040
[Guest]: Name a memoir

07:07:58.040 --> 07:08:00.040
[Guest]: You know

07:08:00.040 --> 07:08:02.040
[Guest]: Will Smith's book

07:08:02.040 --> 07:08:04.040
[Guest]: It is

07:08:04.040 --> 07:08:06.040
[Guest]: It is so sensitively written

07:08:06.040 --> 07:08:08.040
[Guest]: And it is also about

07:08:08.040 --> 07:08:10.040
[Guest]: Gender the entire book is about like

07:08:10.040 --> 07:08:12.040
[Guest]: You know what you've seen

07:08:12.040 --> 07:08:14.040
[Guest]: Will Smith

07:08:14.040 --> 07:08:16.040
[Guest]: Literally his book starts with assault

07:08:16.040 --> 07:08:18.040
[Guest]: It starts with how

07:08:18.040 --> 07:08:20.040
[Guest]: First line of the book is how his father

07:08:20.040 --> 07:08:22.040
[Guest]: Hit his mother

07:08:22.040 --> 07:08:24.040
[Guest]: And how that has

07:08:24.040 --> 07:08:26.040
[Guest]: Impacted him all his life this book is about violence

07:08:26.040 --> 07:08:28.040
[Guest]: And you know

07:08:28.040 --> 07:08:30.040
[Guest]: And trying to deal with that violence

07:08:30.040 --> 07:08:32.040
[Guest]: It's so introspective so

07:08:32.040 --> 07:08:34.040
[Guest]: Personal so well written

07:08:34.040 --> 07:08:36.040
[Guest]: I'm shocked that a celebrity at his level

07:08:36.040 --> 07:08:38.040
[Guest]: Has gone so deep

07:08:38.040 --> 07:08:40.040
[Guest]: And been so transparent

07:08:40.040 --> 07:08:42.040
[Guest]: About

07:08:42.040 --> 07:08:44.040
[Guest]: Again his identity

07:08:44.040 --> 07:08:46.040
[Guest]: From the lens of gender

07:08:46.040 --> 07:08:48.040
[Guest]: So and it'll help you understand

07:08:48.040 --> 07:08:50.040
[Guest]: What has happened in the Oscar stage

07:08:50.040 --> 07:08:52.040
[Guest]: So I mean that's

07:08:52.040 --> 07:08:54.040
[Guest]: Clickbaity reason why you should read it but otherwise

07:08:54.040 --> 07:08:56.040
[Guest]: It's just an absolutely great book

07:08:56.040 --> 07:08:58.040
[Guest]: Yeah okay so

07:08:58.040 --> 07:09:00.040
[Guest]: The last book I would recommend again

07:09:00.040 --> 07:09:02.040
[Guest]: You know is a book

07:09:02.040 --> 07:09:04.040
[Guest]: By Ayaad Akhtar called

07:09:04.040 --> 07:09:06.040
[Guest]: Leggies or elegies

07:09:06.040 --> 07:09:08.040
[Guest]: I don't know how to pronounce it

07:09:08.040 --> 07:09:10.040
[Guest]: And it is it's a book

07:09:10.040 --> 07:09:12.040
[Guest]: About the Muslim identity

[Guest]: Were great but

07:18:10.040 --> 07:18:12.040
[Guest]: The scale at which the series was made

07:18:12.040 --> 07:18:14.040
[Guest]: Incredible

07:18:14.040 --> 07:18:16.040
[Guest]: Every in every I think like

07:18:16.040 --> 07:18:18.040

07:18:18.040 --> 07:18:20.040
[Guest]: You know shows about or shows or movies

07:18:20.040 --> 07:18:22.040
[Guest]: About like good and evil

07:18:22.040 --> 07:18:24.040
[Guest]: You know shows

07:18:24.040 --> 07:18:26.040
[Guest]: Or movies that where

07:18:26.040 --> 07:18:28.040
[Guest]: You know that the director believes that

07:18:28.040 --> 07:18:30.040
[Guest]: You know they're making good but you kind of know

07:18:30.040 --> 07:18:32.040
[Guest]: That you know they lean towards the evil

07:18:32.040 --> 07:18:34.040
[Guest]: And kind of know that yeah you can't help it evil is around

07:18:34.040 --> 07:18:36.040
[Guest]: And then just you know stuff

07:18:36.040 --> 07:18:38.040
[Guest]: That makes you believe that you know there is goodness

07:18:38.040 --> 07:18:40.040
[Guest]: Always going to that is going to outlast

07:18:40.040 --> 07:18:42.040
[Guest]: And this is just a film that

07:18:42.040 --> 07:18:44.040
[Guest]: Fills me with hope a series that fills me with hope

07:18:44.040 --> 07:18:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And there's a great inspiring line in it

07:18:46.040 --> 07:18:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Which young people everywhere should take out from

[Guest]: All those who wander are not lost

07:18:50.040 --> 07:18:52.040
[Guest]: All those who wander are not lost absolutely

07:18:52.040 --> 07:18:54.040
[Guest]: I mean Sam for me like

07:18:54.040 --> 07:18:56.040
[Guest]: I mean of course just Sam as a character

07:18:56.040 --> 07:18:58.040
[Guest]: Is I think the greatest

07:18:58.040 --> 07:19:00.040
[Guest]: One of the greatest characters ever made

07:19:00.040 --> 07:19:02.040
[Guest]: You know to

07:19:02.040 --> 07:19:04.040

[Guest]: He's lifted you know

07:19:08.040 --> 07:19:10.040
[Guest]: His character has lifted

07:19:10.040 --> 07:19:12.040
[Guest]: This entire series you know because

07:19:12.040 --> 07:19:14.040
[Guest]: You think that heroism is about

07:19:14.040 --> 07:19:16.040
[Guest]: You know Aragon and Frodo you know going from

07:19:16.040 --> 07:19:18.040
[Guest]: One place to another but true heroism

07:19:18.040 --> 07:19:20.040
[Guest]: Is also like just the courage to

07:19:20.040 --> 07:19:22.040
[Guest]: Support and show love to

07:19:22.040 --> 07:19:24.040
[Guest]: The people who are you know

07:19:24.040 --> 07:19:26.040
[Guest]: Doing something tough isn't that like

07:19:26.040 --> 07:19:28.040
[Guest]: A bigger heroism where you're not even

07:19:28.040 --> 07:19:30.040
[Guest]: Getting the credit for it but you're just there

07:19:30.040 --> 07:19:32.040

[Guest]: Yeah man it's just it's so beautiful you know

07:19:34.040 --> 07:19:36.040
[Guest]: What is it's it's Frodo is the guy who

07:19:36.040 --> 07:19:38.040
[Guest]: Took it to the ring but Sam without Sam he could

07:19:38.040 --> 07:19:40.040
[Guest]: Not have happened and Sam I think is

07:19:40.040 --> 07:19:42.040

[Unknown]: Just

07:21:10.040 --> 07:21:12.040
[Guest]: My you know I was

07:21:12.040 --> 07:21:14.040
[Guest]: Talking to someone the other day and I was talking about how

07:21:14.040 --> 07:21:16.040
[Guest]: You know the earlier like I

07:21:16.040 --> 07:21:18.040
[Guest]: Talk about identity of young people and I was so

07:21:18.040 --> 07:21:20.040
[Guest]: Funny as talking about how you know earlier

07:21:20.040 --> 07:21:22.040
[Guest]: You know for Millennials it was very difficult

07:21:22.040 --> 07:21:24.040
[Guest]: To find out identities and then we'd

07:21:24.040 --> 07:21:26.040
[Guest]: Find something to kind of relate to

07:21:26.040 --> 07:21:28.040
[Guest]: That will make our own identity so for some

07:21:28.040 --> 07:21:30.040
[Guest]: People for example films became like their identity

07:21:30.040 --> 07:21:32.040
[Guest]: And like you know they'd stick to like I was

07:21:32.040 --> 07:21:34.040
[Guest]: Talking about Star Wars fandom you know that being

07:21:34.040 --> 07:21:36.040
[Guest]: Star Wars fan is something else etc etc

07:21:36.040 --> 07:21:38.040
[Guest]: And then just struck me and I was just like

07:21:38.040 --> 07:21:40.040
[Guest]: And for example me

07:21:40.040 --> 07:21:42.040
[Guest]: Who has his entire identity

07:21:42.040 --> 07:21:44.040
[Guest]: On the internet is Taneja

07:21:44.040 --> 07:21:46.040
[Guest]: You know I am that person

07:21:46.040 --> 07:21:48.040
[Guest]: I am the person who decided

07:21:48.040 --> 07:21:50.040
[Guest]: That pop culture that's where I find comfort

07:21:50.040 --> 07:21:52.040

[Guest]: And I just find a lot of joy and comfort

07:22:00.040 --> 07:22:02.040
[Guest]: In being surrounded by

07:22:02.040 --> 07:22:04.040
[Guest]: You know things that I

07:22:04.040 --> 07:22:06.040

[Guest]: Naz Apna Apna is just the thing

07:22:10.040 --> 07:22:12.040
[Guest]: That has made me the happiest I might have watched it about a hundred

07:22:12.040 --> 07:22:14.040
[Guest]: Times I can

[Guest]: Narrate I can narrate the whole film

07:22:16.040 --> 07:22:18.040
