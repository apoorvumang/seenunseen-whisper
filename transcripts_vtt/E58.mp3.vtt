00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
[Amit Varma]: What is India's population? If you Google it, the number you will get is just over 1.3

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.160
[Amit Varma]: billion people. But is that the real number? Think of it this way. Almost half of that

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.300
[Amit Varma]: number is women. And in our country, women are treated as second class citizens. In most

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.920
[Amit Varma]: of India, it's understood that a woman's destiny is to one day get married and raise a family.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.600
[Amit Varma]: The education of women, the education of girls rather, or their skilling, is not given enough

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.480
[Amit Varma]: importance. And if they do ever end up getting into the workforce, they are already at a

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.580
[Amit Varma]: huge disadvantage. Simply put, half the productive resources of our country are not treated as

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.520
[Amit Varma]: productive resources at all. In fact, all our citizens are condescended to and restrained

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.240
[Amit Varma]: by a parasitic Maybab government. And whatever we achieve as a society is in spite of the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.120
[Amit Varma]: state. But leave that aside for the moment. My point is that because of the way we treat

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.080
[Amit Varma]: our women, we are functioning at any given point in time, at just half our capacity,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.840
[Amit Varma]: at best. And this is not just a function of our cultural norms. This is embedded in the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:21.680
[Unknown]: law. Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma. Welcome to The Scene and

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.080
[Amit Varma]: the Unseen. Before we begin, a word from the sponsor of this episode, and indeed the last

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.080
[Amit Varma]: few episodes. Indian Colors is a company that licenses art from contemporary Indian artists

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.600
[Amit Varma]: and adapts it to objects of everyday use. They have home decor, like cushion covers

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.080
[Amit Varma]: and table runners. They have accessories like tote bags. And what I particularly like is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.960
[Amit Varma]: their wearables, their kaftans, shrugs and stoles. This allows people like me, who can't

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.360
[Amit Varma]: actually afford to buy expensive paintings to hang on the walls, to surround myself with

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.080
[Amit Varma]: art at an affordable price. And even wear some of it, their kaftans are damn comfortable.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Artists get royalties on each product sold, just like authors do for books. And some of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.080
[Amit Varma]: their artists include Sameer Mondal, Dhruvi Acharya, Brinda Miller, Shruti Nelson and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.720
[Amit Varma]: Harin Vakil. They've just got a new collection of stoles out with some funky designs by Deepak

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.520
[Amit Varma]: Shinde and Dilip Sharma. You must check that out. Head on over to IndianColors.com, that's

[Amit Varma]: Colors with an OU, to check out their offerings and use the code IVM20. That's IVM for Indus

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.320

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.240
[Amit Varma]: with an OU. And now, on to today's episode. Later this week, on March 8th, we have something

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.200
[Amit Varma]: called Women's Day. On the same day, as it happens, a Supreme Court hearing is scheduled

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.760
[Amit Varma]: of the infamous Hadiya case. Now, it's long been my case that our laws are deeply misogynistic.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I'll launch into a rant about this at the start of my conversation in this episode.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And many of these are laws in the Indian Penal Code framed in the 19th century by the British.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.160
[Amit Varma]: One could argue that they exist today only because of the inertia of the system. Well,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.880
[Amit Varma]: it is my case that such misogyny exists not just in outdated laws, but also in the minds

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.360
[Amit Varma]: of lawmakers and the judiciary today. And the Hadiya case is but one example of that.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.280
[Amit Varma]: My guests on the show today are two friends of mine who feel as strongly about this as

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.760
[Amit Varma]: I do. Madhav Chandravarkar is a lawyer, a legal expert and a fellow at the Takshashila

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.240
[Amit Varma]: Institution in Bangalore. And he suggested the topic for today's episode. Hamsini Hariharan

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.040
[Amit Varma]: is my colleague at Pragati, the magazine I edit at thinkpragati.com and herself the host

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.640
[Amit Varma]: of a fantastic podcast called the Pragati Podcast. Here's a conversation I had with

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
[Unknown]: them.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.320
[Amit Varma]: Hamsini, Madhav, welcome to the show.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320
[Guest 1]: Thanks so much, Amit.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320
[Guest 1]: Thanks Amit.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.240
[Amit Varma]: For my listeners, I should inform you that Hamsini also hosts an excellent podcast called

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.760
[Amit Varma]: the Pragati Podcast at thinkpragati.com. So do check that out. And because she's such

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.240
[Amit Varma]: a great host, and especially because she knows a lot more than I do about the subject at

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.880
[Amit Varma]: hand today, I've requested her to co-host the show with me, which doesn't mean she'll

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.600
[Amit Varma]: only be asking questions. She's got some great insights in the subjects. But apart from that,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.800
[Amit Varma]: she will also know what are the right questions to ask Madhav. Now, before I dive into this

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.600
[Amit Varma]: episode, I just want to go on a bit of a rant. I did an episode a few weeks ago with your

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.200
[Amit Varma]: Takshashila colleague Manasa Venkatraman on how prostitution should be legalized. Aside

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.360
[Amit Varma]: the subject of that, one of the things we examined in that episode was a misogyny in

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.240
[Amit Varma]: the Indian laws. And these are laws that I mean, this is the Indian Penal Code, which

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.240
[Amit Varma]: we inherited from the British. So very briefly, there's 497 adultery. Now this is I'm not

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.040
[Amit Varma]: going to read this out because it has victorial language, which is an aesthetic affront to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.700
[Amit Varma]: my editorial sensibilities. But the upshot of this is that when adultery is committed,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.640
[Amit Varma]: the male adulterer who has slept with the wife of someone else is considered at fault

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.280
[Amit Varma]: because he slept with that woman without the consent of her husband, as if she is a husband's

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.560
[Amit Varma]: property. And there's this another law 498, which is enticing or taking away or detaining

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.160
[Amit Varma]: with criminal intent, a married woman, which really amounts to saying the same thing. I

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.160
[Amit Varma]: encourage you to look these up. But basically, she has no agency whatsoever. Now, this might

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.080
[Amit Varma]: seem like an old story. Okay, these are really old laws. We've got them from two centuries

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.600
[Amit Varma]: ago from the British. But the misogyny that is reflected in these ancient laws carries

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.800
[Amit Varma]: down to the present day in the mindset of our lawmakers and our judiciary. And that's

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.040
[Amit Varma]: what we're talking about today.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, we still have a Victorian morality that's sort of reflected in our laws, even though

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.280
[Guest 1]: it's two centuries later. But Madhav, you're the lawyer in the room, right? So suppose

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.960
[Guest 1]: I'm married, and my husband is committing adultery or flirting with another woman, then

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.880
[Guest 2]: can I initiate charges against him?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.680
[Guest 2]: No, I was just about to interject when Amit was saying, you don't have any right to initiate

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.120
[Guest 2]: criminal proceedings against your husband for sleeping with another man's wife.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.640
[Amit Varma]: But a husband would be able to initiate.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.680
[Guest 1]: And that's because I don't count in this equation. Is that how it works?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.680
[Guest 2]: Well, yeah, I mean, your agency is irrelevant, because not only can you not object if your

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.560
[Guest 2]: husband sleeps around with another woman, you can't object if your husband decides to

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.800
[Guest 1]: sleep with you against your consent.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.640
[Guest 1]: That's true. Marital rape is an inherent problem. And agency is something that I think we're

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.200
[Guest 1]: going to be referring through all of this podcast, because whether it's in society and

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.520
[Guest 1]: apparently by law, a woman's agency in India is of very, very little value. But moving

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.560
[Guest 1]: on from adultery to the very recent cases, Amit, Madhav and I were talking about the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.040
[Guest 1]: triple talaq judgment recently, and how it's supposed to be a champion of women and particularly

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.680
[Guest 1]: Muslim women. So does it live up to everything it's supposed to be a champion of?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.320
[Guest 2]: Not really, because the grounds which they used to dismiss triple talaq were not really

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:06.040
[Guest 2]: about the decisional autonomy of the women involved, but just a question of whether it

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.680
[Guest 2]: was a quote, unquote, essential religious practice in Muslim personal law. So they said

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.960
[Guest 2]: that it wasn't. And therefore, it was could be subject to constitutional scrutiny. When

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.680
[Guest 2]: I think the reasoning that they should have gone with was that regardless of whether it's

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.040
[Guest 2]: an essential part of a religion or not, any religious practice must subscribe and fall

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.440
[Guest 2]: under constitutional principles like equality, and the right to life, to which triple talaq

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.560
[Guest 2]: clearly does not and that should have been the argument that they made, but they didn't.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Your broader point there is that and this is something the Constitution should really

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.160
[Amit Varma]: have made clear that there are no exceptions at all to the values in the Constitution,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.780
[Amit Varma]: whatever religious practices any of our religions might have, if they go against the principles

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.960
[Amit Varma]: we outlined in the Constitution, then they're unlawful period, right?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.080
[Guest 2]: So, that would be an idealistic and the preferable way of interpreting it, but that is unfortunately

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.280
[Guest 2]: not the current legal position in practice.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.160
[Guest 1]: Okay, so the judiciary basically passed the buck onto the parliament, right?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.440
[Guest 2]: Yeah, meaning they said that while they've pronounced on this, nothing prevents the parliament

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.840
[Guest 1]: from passing a law.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.720
[Guest 2]: Okay, so what did the parliament then do?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:37.360
[Guest 2]: So the parliament saw this as a clear opportunity, perhaps to reap political benefits, I don't

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.840
[Guest 2]: know, but they passed a triple talaq bill, as it is colloquially known, the actual title

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.440
[Guest 2]: is the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.720
[Guest 2]: Okay, so judging by that title, you would think that they deal with not only triple

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.600
[Guest 2]: talaq, but all the various issues that Muslim women and Muslim women groups have been talking

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600
[Guest 2]: about for a while, like polygamy or nikkah halala.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.880
[Guest 2]: But there's no mention of those practices at all.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:13.200
[Guest 2]: And the Muslim women groups were not consulted in the actual construction of the bill, nor

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.760
[Guest 2]: were their comments actively sought, which makes you question whether the bill was actually

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.720
[Guest 2]: to protect Muslim women or not.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.840
[Guest 2]: Maybe they had some more nefarious ulterior motives.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.840
[Amit Varma]: It sounds like the legislature mansplaining as a whole to Muslim women that you are pronouncing

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.040
[Amit Varma]: something that is supposed to be in their favor to benefit them, but you don't actually

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.040
[Amit Varma]: consult them.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.040
[Amit Varma]: They're not a party at the table.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.920
[Guest 2]: Yeah, it's a we know best approach.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.720
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I mean, again, this is about agency of Muslim women, right?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.680
[Guest 1]: If they're not consulted, if the bill is being passed only on one front and does not take

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.400
[Guest 1]: into all their other concerns, then it's not really the progressive bill that they're posturing

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.360
[Guest 1]: it as, which makes me wonder, is this even about women?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.280
[Guest 1]: This debate doesn't seem to be about women at all.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.440
[Amit Varma]: In which case you wonder, then why bring the bill about?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we can speculate on what the intent might be.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they're posturing to their base.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it's all just optics and so on and so forth.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.440
[Amit Varma]: But the fact that the people directly affected by the bill, on whose behalf you claim to

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.160
[Amit Varma]: be speaking, aren't actually a party at the table.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.680
[Amit Varma]: The most important stakeholder isn't consulted.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Seems bizarre to me and a continuation of how women are constantly considered not capable

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.640
[Amit Varma]: of agency and treated in a patronizing way.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.080
[Guest 1]: Yeah, that's the thing.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.880
[Guest 1]: This is not something that's new, again, in Indian society or law, I'm guessing.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.800
[Guest 1]: Because women are generally seen as, you know, malleable, for example.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.040
[Guest 1]: And there was a more recent case, wasn't it?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.320
[Guest 1]: Was it the Farooqui case?

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.740
[Guest 2]: Yeah, Mahmood Farooqui, the co director of Peopley Life.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:55.600
[Guest 2]: So he was convicted by the trial court, but it was overturned by the High Court on extremely

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.480
[Guest 2]: weak grounds, where basically, they tried to be woke in many ways, they tried to talk

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.280
[Guest 2]: about global debates about affirmative consent and whatnot.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.080
[Guest 2]: But then they also have a sentence that basically says sometimes a no means a yes.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.840
[Guest 1]: Wait, mother, take a step back, what is the case?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840
[Guest 2]: What happened?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.640
[Guest 2]: So the case was that there was a international scholar from Columbia who'd come to do some

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:33.560
[Guest 2]: research, she'd gotten in touch with someone to speak to Mahmood Farooqui, because he is

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.360
[Guest 2]: one of the premier people on the Dastogi.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.360
[Guest 2]: Dastan Goi.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, if I remember correctly, she was introduced by Danish Hussain, who's a friend

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.000
[Amit Varma]: who used to run Dastan Goi along with Mahmood Farooqui.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.080
[Amit Varma]: And despite being a close friend of Mahmood Farooqui became a witness for the prosecution.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080
[Guest 2]: Okay, exactly.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:57.280
[Guest 2]: So, so she'd gotten in touch, they'd met a couple of times, I think most of the times

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.200
[Guest 2]: that the scholar and Farooqui had met, he had been inebriated.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest 2]: So there were some prior instances of him being inebriated before the actual event took

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
[Guest 2]: place.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.320
[Guest 2]: Plus, I think they seem to have a mutual attraction to one another.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.120
[Guest 2]: I think they may have exchanged some kisses at a party.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.360
[Guest 1]: How does any of this matter?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.440
[Guest 1]: This is not a gossip rag.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.440
[Guest 1]: But how is any of this pertinent to the Supreme Court judgment?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.720
[Guest 2]: So it's pertinent to the High Court judgment, I'll get into the Supreme Court later.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:34.840
[Guest 2]: But the High Court, this was basically Farooqui in the High Court, hired like the best lawyers,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.840
[Amit Varma]: it was in the Delhi High Court.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.640
[Amit Varma]: But let's first continue, let's first rewind and continue with the narrative you were telling

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.400
[Amit Varma]: us of what actually happened in the case.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:48.240
[Guest 2]: Okay, so basically, they had these sort of interactions beforehand.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:56.680
[Guest 2]: And then Farooqui invited her to come over, she was, and then to come over and Danish

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.120
[Guest 2]: would be accompanying them.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.560
[Guest 2]: And then subsequently changed the invitation to say, Oh, I forgot, I have to go for a wedding.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.360
[Guest 2]: So the scholars under the impression that she would be going to a wedding with Farooqui

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.520
[Guest 2]: and his wife.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.320
[Guest 2]: However, when she reached, though the wife was there, two people were exiting beforehand,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.880
[Guest 2]: people that she'd never met before.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.420
[Guest 2]: And there was a short period where she was alone with Farooqui and Farooqui was described

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.580
[Guest 2]: as being extremely drunk.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.960
[Guest 2]: She called Danish because I think she was a little unsure because this was the first

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.760
[Guest 2]: time that she'd met Farooqui where no one else was there.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.200
[Guest 2]: All the other interactions, other people were present, whether it was at a party or not.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.520
[Guest 2]: And he then said he was unable to come.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.760
[Guest 2]: And then he was also extremely drunk.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:02.220
[Guest 2]: He has admitted in the course of the proceedings and in interactions with her to be bipolar.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:08.120
[Guest 2]: And he was crying and apparently was crying to the extent that he had snot in his mustache

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:20.300
[Guest 2]: and a very unappealing, is in a very unappealing state of, which is actually is made relevant

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.440
[Guest 2]: later on in the case.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:29.320
[Guest 2]: So she describes having a very maternal feeling to him at that point that she wanted to take

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.240
[Guest 2]: care of him, ask him what his problems were.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.800
[Guest 2]: He, on the other hand, wanted to get fresh and kept on saying, can I, I think, can I

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800
[Guest 2]: suck you?

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.080
[Guest 2]: Can I suck you?

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:48.160
[Guest 2]: And she repeatedly tried to say no, that she thought it wouldn't be helpful to him in his

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.960
[Guest 2]: current state of mind.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.220
[Guest 2]: He tried pulling down her clothes.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.640
[Guest 2]: She pulled them back up and this happened.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.760
[Guest 2]: And then finally, I think he got a little forceful, at least that's how she describes

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.280
[Guest 2]: it.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:12.760
[Guest 2]: And she then decided that she, I think, was remembering Nirbhaya, which is a recent event

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.360
[Guest 2]: at the time.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.600
[Guest 2]: And she decided that maybe things could get violent.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.280
[Guest 2]: I'm just going to go along with this.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.160
[Guest 2]: And she faked an orgasm to end the ordeal.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.800
[Guest 2]: And she wanted to leave immediately.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:34.920
[Guest 2]: But the two friends who were leaving the house as she came in, came back and there was some

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.720
[Guest 2]: back and forth about leaving in a cab or an auto, what was safe.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.760
[Guest 2]: So she finally left 45 minutes later, at which point she immediately called Danish, recounted

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:51.360
[Guest 2]: the events to which this is an undisputed fact, both sides and the telephonic records

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.760
[Guest 2]: to attest to that.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest 2]: And then a couple of days later, she sent a mail to Farrukhi saying that I have, I regard

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.840
[Guest 2]: you well, you're a good acquaintance, I like you and I love you and I want the best for

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840
[Guest 2]: you.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.440
[Guest 2]: But what you did was not acceptable.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:21.340
[Guest 2]: I am a person who owns my, I think she meant sexuality, but in the letter it says sexually.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.340
[Guest 2]: Or whatever.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:29.120
[Guest 2]: She said that she was someone who took pride in making her own sexual decisions.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:37.520
[Guest 2]: And that post this decision, she could no longer feel that she was facing trauma.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.360
[Guest 2]: And she eventually left the US, after which she recuperated with her family and friends

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.520
[Guest 2]: a support system, and then finally worked up the courage to come back a couple of months

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.200
[Guest 2]: later and file a case against him.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And if I'm not mistaken, he replied to this email and the email trail basically confirms

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.320
[Guest 2]: this version.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:01.600
[Guest 2]: He says my sincerest apologies, though in the case, I think, with his expensive lawyers

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.840
[Guest 2]: came up with some argument and how he only read the first two lines.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:13.920
[Guest 2]: And then that's the first two lines is what he expressed the my sincerest apologies comment

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.000
[Guest 2]: in the reply.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.760
[Guest 2]: And but later in court said no, it was only to those first two sentences when I read the

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760
[Guest 2]: entire thing.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760
[Guest 2]: No.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760
[Amit Varma]: So it's not an admission of guilt.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760
[Amit Varma]: That was pretty creative.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.520
[Guest 2]: So coming back to, yeah, it does.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:38.160
[Guest 2]: And in fact, it's only going to get more sickening because of the high court and the Supreme Court's

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.080
[Guest 2]: interpretation of these events.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:50.960
[Guest 2]: So they employ what is a sort of a more legal version of the I'm not a racist, but argument

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:59.000
[Guest 2]: where they say it is irrelevant to the question of consent, whether she met with him earlier

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.960
[Guest 2]: and it kissed him.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:08.040
[Guest 2]: But it happened, meaning if they kept on saying it was irrelevant, but then they kept on talking

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.320
[Amit Varma]: So they keep saying that every time you use, but in a sentence that but invalidates everything

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.160
[Amit Varma]: before it and saying that it is irrelevant to the question of consent, but means you're

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.760
[Amit Varma]: basically saying it is relevant to the question of consent.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.040
[Guest 2]: And that is shocking.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.440
[Guest 2]: So the actual syntax of the argument is that the disclaimer, because their lawyers came

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440
[Guest 2]: at the end.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:37.200
[Guest 2]: So they said this is irrelevant to whether it is consent or not.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:47.040
[Guest 2]: And then to the actual event that was the on which the case revolved around, the high

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:58.520
[Guest 2]: court took this argument that basically because she was and they were both educated people

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:08.880
[Guest 2]: of good letters, that if she actually didn't consent, she would have expressed that affirmatively.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:16.240
[Guest 2]: And it completely negates all the academic studies and discussions around the various

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:22.520
[Guest 2]: power dynamics that are inherent in any sexual assault, which are irrespective of whether

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:30.320
[Guest 2]: you're educated or upper class or whatever sort of you want to say, this is something

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.760
[Guest 2]: that happens across all spectrums of society as Harvey Weinstein and the subsequent allegations

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.160
[Amit Varma]: prove in abundance.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.280
[Guest 1]: As everybody knows, I mean, this is not something you need to prove.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.920
[Guest 1]: So this reminds me of the time when I think post the Nirbhaya case, someone said, if someone

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.120
[Guest 1]: is harassing you, just call him Bhaiya and he'll stop.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.680
[Guest 1]: And this is the same thing, you know, if she really meant no, why didn't she say it stronger?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.960
[Guest 1]: And this is something that we say to women time and again, whenever they bring about

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.440
[Guest 1]: the questions of harassment, it goes, why didn't you do this?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.260
[Guest 1]: Why didn't you get in touch with the police?

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.840
[Amit Varma]: Why didn't you scream for help?

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, in all the old cases coming out now that if this happened 15 years ago, why

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.280
[Amit Varma]: didn't you speak then?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.280
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.880
[Guest 1]: Which I hear all the time.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.840
[Guest 1]: And for example, they don't even take into consideration her fact that she is in immediate

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.160
[Guest 1]: danger, right?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.800
[Guest 1]: If she says no forcefully, she has no clue what the guy would be doing to her.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.760
[Guest 1]: Because it sounds like the Supreme Court judges at that point in time think she's a man.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.560
[Guest 1]: And if she says no, someone's going to be like, oh, you meant no.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.560
[Guest 1]: Okay, then.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560
[Guest 1]: All right.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.560
[Guest 2]: Do you want a cup of tea?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.560
[Guest 2]: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:42.360
[Guest 2]: So there's complete disregard to the context in which the so-called consent was given.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:51.520
[Guest 2]: And basically, all the onus is put on her to make sure that she is conveying to him

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.280
[Guest 2]: that she is not consenting.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.840
[Guest 2]: So that is why the feeble no means yes argument basically amounts to that.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.040
[Guest 2]: It's not the man's job to figure out why they've kissed a couple of times before.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest 2]: So he thinks it's on.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.280
[Guest 2]: So it's her responsibility to ensure that it was clear.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:22.920
[Guest 2]: And the Supreme Court takes this to just unreasonable levels, because they say that the faking of

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest 2]: the orgasm was a sign of consent.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.440
[Guest 2]: First of all, it happened at the end of the act.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:35.640
[Guest 2]: So how can you say that it's consent when it happens after or during as opposed to before?

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.080
[Guest 2]: And then how is it got to do with anything clearly?

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.960
[Guest 2]: These judges must think that they are pleasing their wives at all times and that their wives

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.960
[Guest 2]: are never faked orgasm.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.440
[Guest 2]: Fake orgasm is a mythical beast like a chimera.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:55.720
[Guest 2]: I don't know what the background of their reasoning is, but it makes your blood boil.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.640
[Guest 2]: And that's just me as a guy trying to sort of empathize with how women feel, I just cannot

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.320
[Guest 2]: even fathom how women would react to those kind of pronouns.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, and this may not be pertinent, but a lot of these arguments, why didn't she say

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960
[Amit Varma]: no more forcefully?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.360
[Amit Varma]: Why didn't she speak out before?

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.960
[Amit Varma]: Why did she stay for 45 minutes after that?

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.440
[Amit Varma]: A lot of these arguments seem to me to be made in bad faith, where you've already assumed

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.800
[Amit Varma]: that the woman is making shit up or overreacting or whatever.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.840
[Amit Varma]: And then you're finding clever ways to make an argument and prove that per se, you know,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.680
[Amit Varma]: and of course, the burden of proof should always be on the accuser.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.280
[Amit Varma]: But if you look at the email trail, and if you look at everything that happened, I thought

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.600
[Amit Varma]: this was an open and shut case, you know, clearly the man was guilty.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600
[Guest 2]: That's what I thought.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:47.800
[Guest 2]: And also, in the judgment, in the judgments rather, so they talk about how he had bipolar

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800
[Guest 2]: disorder.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest 2]: And typically in law, if you're going to play some kind of burden or duty on the woman to

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.640
[Guest 2]: make something clear, there's a standard of reasonableness.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.480
[Guest 2]: So someone who has bipolar disorder would would not pass that test of reasonableness

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.800
[Guest 2]: because you would have to go above and beyond.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.600
[Guest 2]: So the fact that he did not understand should be his fault and not hers.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.600
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:24.000
[Guest 2]: And the other is that it was, it's part of the undisputed facts that he was pissed drunk,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.540
[Guest 2]: which is another legal sort of standard for reducing the mental capacity of someone.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:38.840
[Guest 2]: So all the burden is placed on the woman to convince someone who is of a doubly unsound

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.980
[Guest 2]: mind.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.480
[Guest 2]: And it's just bizarre how it's all on her.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:53.840
[Guest 1]: No, you know, this brings to mind the stereotype that academic feminism talks about called

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.200
[Guest 1]: the ideal rape victim.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.960
[Guest 1]: Your ideal rape victim would have never met her assaulter or harasser.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:09.640
[Guest 1]: Your ideal rape victim is chaste and pure and conforms to your normal societal norms

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.400
[Guest 1]: in every sense.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.760
[Guest 1]: Your ideal rape victim will be emotional in court.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.240
[Guest 1]: So for example, there was a study that looked at how jurors reacted to different rape cases.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:28.760
[Guest 1]: And in cases where the woman was calm or not expressive of her emotions, the jurors were

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.960
[Guest 1]: less inclined to believe her testament because if she had been raped, then she should be

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.320
[Guest 1]: crying.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.360
[Guest 1]: So this is also about the way we think of women, right?

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, Pink is a movie that's criticized on several accounts.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.880
[Guest 1]: But again, the thing that was shown there is that none of these girls were ideal victims,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880
[Guest 1]: right?

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.360
[Guest 1]: If they were educated, then why are they going out to meet these men?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.360
[Guest 1]: Why are they stepping out of the norms of our ideal woman type?

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.720
[Guest 1]: This is not even the ideal rape woman.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.480
[Guest 1]: This is the ideal Indian woman.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.120
[Guest 1]: Why are these women going beyond that?

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.760
[Guest 1]: The second thing that I want to bring about is the idea that everyone is talking about

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.960
[Guest 1]: with respect to consent, which is the gray area, the gray area, which seems like a post

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.460
[Guest 1]: modernist construct says, oh, you never know where consent is.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.320
[Guest 1]: This for example, is not a gray area.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.480
[Guest 1]: This is a very black and white.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.360
[Amit Varma]: This is as black and white as it can get.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And it should be no, should always mean no.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And the thing here is that no one will ever imply that a man's no could mean no or yes.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.400
[Amit Varma]: But if it's a woman's no, it's up to the man to interpret it.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And by chance, if he makes a mistake, well, then you'll make all kinds of clever arguments

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760
[Guest 1]: later.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760
[Guest 1]: Yes.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.200
[Guest 1]: I mean, there is now a paradigm that people are saying that, you know, maybe instead of

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.680
[Guest 1]: looking at no means no, we should look at enthusiastic consent.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:51.920
[Guest 1]: In the sense, only if a woman says yes, are you allowed to either flirt with her or be

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.640
[Guest 1]: intimate with her, which seems like a much better paradigm because people clearly don't

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.840
[Guest 1]: understand what you're saying.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.120
[Guest 1]: And other points that I'm going to bring up is in India, the culture of consent.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.800
[Guest 1]: So if I invite you to dinner, Amit, and we're very close friends, and you just don't want

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.520
[Guest 1]: to come, it doesn't matter what your reasons are.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.760
[Guest 1]: Because it's the both of us, you'll say, no, I'm not coming and I'll be like, it's fine.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.720
[Guest 1]: But if it's anyone else, you'll go, actually, you know, I have work and then I have to do

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720
[Guest 1]: this thing.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.960
[Guest 1]: And I have all these errands that I can't go.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960
[Guest 1]: And this is between the both of us.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.880
[Guest 1]: And you're saying this because if I just hear a no without any explanation, I will just

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.140
[Guest 1]: be pissed off.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.360
[Guest 1]: We have a culture in Indian society that does not take no for an answer.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.440
[Guest 1]: And this is even, I think this adds a layer of complexity that consent doesn't have in

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.440
[Guest 1]: the West.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.920
[Amit Varma]: People are trained to say no socially.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.000
[Amit Varma]: This is a fantastic point.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.720
[Amit Varma]: And it's not only relevant to like, intergender relationships.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.640
[Amit Varma]: But even if you ask someone for directions on the street, he will very rarely say no,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640
[Amit Varma]: I don't know where it is.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.960
[Amit Varma]: He will give you wrong directions rather than admit that he doesn't have that knowledge,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960
[Amit Varma]: which probably also is a male problem.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.480
[Guest 1]: No, it's not only a male problem, right?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.480
[Guest 1]: I mean, even within genders, with respect to people who are older than you, it's just

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.960
[Guest 1]: Oh, why do you want to offend them?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.320
[Guest 1]: It's because in Indian culture, people do not take no seriously.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.680
[Guest 1]: And when you bring it down to consent, it's even more dire.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.200
[Guest 1]: Because a case like this, which is, as you said, clearly an open and shut case is being

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.040
[Guest 1]: interpreted, I don't even know in such a twisted manner.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:33.880
[Guest 2]: And to me, the most disturbing argument is that they sort of flip a lot of these discussions,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:41.320
[Guest 2]: which are sort of more feminist and pro women, and use it to justify their decision.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:48.160
[Guest 2]: So for example, there's a passage in the judgment that this is a high court judgment where the

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.440
[Guest 2]: normal construct is that the man is the initiator of sexual interaction.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:59.240
[Guest 2]: He performs the active part, whereas a woman is, by and large, nonverbal.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.040
[Guest 2]: First of all, it should have been passive.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.760
[Guest 2]: I don't understand this nonverbal, like just what the hell, like, what are you even trying

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.760
[Guest 2]: to imply over there?

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:14.120
[Guest 2]: But however, and they talk about how this is sort of become socialized in gender roles

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120
[Guest 2]: or whatever.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.760
[Guest 2]: However, in today's modern world, with equality being the buzzword, such may not be the case.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.040
[Guest 1]: Equality is a buzzword, you guys.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.320
[Amit Varma]: It's a buzzword now, like, like stoles are in fashion.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:36.120
[Guest 2]: And then they like eventually, basically say that because the woman's role is no longer

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.960
[Guest 2]: passive, that it was her responsibility to clarify.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.240
[Guest 1]: This is a high court trying to be woke and failing very miserably.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.640
[Guest 2]: And, and ultimately, like they, it's, as I said, it's, I'm not racist, but so they try

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.640
[Guest 2]: and they talk about these debates on affirmative consent.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:02.320
[Guest 2]: But then towards the end of the judgment, they talk about four circumstances in which

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.960
[Guest 2]: the memory recollection of a witness can be inaccurate.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:15.200
[Guest 2]: And there is some, there's scientific basis to those claims, but, and they go through

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:23.160
[Guest 2]: the four instances or the four circumstances, which are one, if the observation took place

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.200
[Guest 2]: in a poor environment, bad lighting, distance away from the event.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:38.000
[Guest 2]: The second is the sort of mental makeup of the observer.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.360
[Guest 2]: And they say, we'll go into this in detail later.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.960
[Guest 2]: And then the third is what happens in between the event and the recollection and how the

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:52.920
[Guest 2]: recollection happens, which is the fourth with leading questions and such.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:58.520
[Guest 2]: So they go through all these four circumstances in which memory can be inaccurate, but then

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.680
[Guest 2]: fail to apply it to the prosecutor.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.280
[Guest 1]: At the end, you're telling me they ruled in the favor of a man who claims that he's bipolar

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.680
[Guest 1]: and was visibly drunk and use that in his favor.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:15.760
[Guest 2]: And there's a sentence, this is towards just before they give the actual judgment, but

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.560
[Guest 2]: it remains in doubt as to whether such an incident as has been narrated by the prosecutors

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.760
[Guest 2]: took place.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.160
[Guest 2]: And if at all it had taken place, it was without the consent will of the prosecutors.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.880
[Guest 2]: And if it was without the consent of the prosecutors, whether the appellant could discern, understand

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.880
[Guest 2]: the same.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.880
[Amit Varma]: So they attack a statement on three levels.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.240
[Amit Varma]: And the third level is the most absurd that it's like saying that even if she said, no,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.080
[Amit Varma]: if he wasn't in a state of mind that he could understand it, his actions are justified.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080
[Guest 1]: Really?

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080
[Guest 1]: This is like that pleading that he's insane.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.080
[Guest 1]: They are pleading that he's insane.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080
[Guest 1]: Or stupid.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:57.440
[Guest 2]: Actually, it's the last point is only something that commentators say they talk about him

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.280
[Guest 2]: being drunk and they talk about him being bipolar, but nowhere does that factor into

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.400
[Guest 2]: the discussions of his mental capacity at the time.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And also, even if they explain, they do not exculpate what actually happened.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.560
[Guest 2]: Let's, I mean, this is, I mean, especially with law, because if you are intoxicated by

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.320
[Guest 2]: your own will, that is not a defense.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.480
[Guest 2]: It's only if you have been sort of slipped a roofie or something like that, where you

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:31.360
[Guest 2]: can claim intoxication as something that protects you from criminal offense.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.840
[Amit Varma]: So this is like another case where, you know, the woman's consent and her agency is completely

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840
[Guest 2]: disregarded.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:44.680
[Guest 2]: So, no, and just to end with the Supreme Court, which recently dismissed the appeal of the

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:51.400
[Guest 2]: High Court judgment by the woman in question, where they said it was a well-reasoned argument.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.720
[Guest 2]: I don't know on what basis they are saying that.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.680
[Guest 2]: When they were speaking to the counselor for the prosecutrix, it was hilarious in many

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.180
[Guest 2]: ways because they said, okay, let's get down to the legal question.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:14.880
[Guest 2]: It is clear that they have some relationship between the two.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.760
[Guest 2]: And so then the Vrinda Grover said, no, meaning they knew each other, but they were not really,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.360
[Guest 2]: they did not have a relationship.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.320
[Guest 2]: So then they said, no, no, no, no, we didn't mean relationship in the colloquial sense,

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.640
[Guest 2]: but then what was, that was not the obvious inference of what you said earlier.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:39.160
[Guest 2]: Then they made the point on the fake orgasm being consent, which was just absurd.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:51.120
[Guest 2]: And finally, in that letter that she sent two days later, they focused on just the statement

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.920
[Guest 2]: that she said, I love you.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:00.760
[Guest 2]: They did not agree with your grammatical interpretation of the word but, because there was a but that

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:08.440
[Guest 2]: came later, but they said, oh, which kind of rape victim later says, no, the exact question,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:15.200
[Guest 2]: ma'am, you are someone familiar with the rape cases in what kind of rape case, give me an

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.800
[Guest 2]: instance of rape cases where the victim says, I love you later to the accused.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:25.400
[Guest 2]: Well, pretty, I know it's a rhetorical question, but pretty much every marital rape in this

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400
[Guest 2]: country.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.120
[Guest 2]: No, she answered, there are lots of cases say with the example of incest, at which point

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.400
[Guest 1]: the judge said, no, no, no, no, it's okay, don't get into that.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:41.480
[Guest 2]: So then she said, like, I'm only getting into it because you asked me.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:51.480
[Guest 2]: And so they basically dismissed the special leave petition, the appeal, because she said,

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.680
[Guest 2]: I love you later, despite the fact that she said, I love you, but what you did was unexcusable

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680
[Guest 2]: and traumatized.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.600
[Guest 2]: I did not give consent.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600
[Amit Varma]: This is meaningless.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.640
[Amit Varma]: And the very fact that that question was asked to Vrinda Grover indicates a severe lack of

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.080
[Amit Varma]: understanding and empathy on the point of the person asking it that like, come on, don't

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.440
[Guest 1]: you get what she's been through so far, hasn't she been through enough without also having

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.960
[Guest 2]: to face this and understand.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:24.480
[Guest 2]: So yeah, that's one thing I just like, as disturbing and sort of blood boiling as the

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:31.480
[Guest 2]: High Court judgment is concerned, at least they took the time to go through it in detail

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.720
[Guest 2]: and came up with like a very shitty end product.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.720
[Guest 2]: But at least they said, okay, this is something worthy of our time.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.240
[Guest 2]: All of what I said about the Supreme Court happened in a matter of 20 to 30 minutes where

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.720
[Amit Varma]: they dismissed it.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720
[Amit Varma]: Staggering.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's move on now to the other big case before the Supreme Court.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.680
[Guest 1]: Please tell me that there is some light at the end of the tunnel, Madhav, please tell

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.520
[Guest 2]: me, no, no, because it gets darker, we are going to talk about Hadiya now.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.840
[Guest 2]: Because at the end, Vrinda Grover asked, can you at least say that this case is peculiar

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.520
[Guest 2]: to only these facts and it is not laid down an interpretation of consent?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Supreme Court said nothing to it.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to talking about more darkness at the end of the tunnel.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.440
[Amit Varma]: That's the Hadiya case.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:22.920
[Guest 2]: So the Hadiya case is a perfect example of how the posturing does not equal the reality

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:29.520
[Guest 2]: because it is a case that should have been dismissed at the very earliest stage.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.720
[Guest 2]: Ideally, what should have happened is at the moment it reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.720
[Guest 2]: Court said, okay, this is about whether Hadiya married with consent or not.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.360
[Guest 2]: Hadiya, why don't you come here?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360
[Guest 2]: We'll ask you.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.880
[Guest 2]: It took like three to four proceedings to even get to that stage.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.320
[Guest 2]: And then just, it's rife, the Supreme Court were the ones who ordered the NIA probe.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.920
[Guest 2]: How is that relevant?

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:01.120
[Guest 2]: The Supreme Court were the ones who remanded her to the custody of the warden.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.160
[Guest 2]: This is a 24 year old woman.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.360
[Guest 2]: Custody should not be part of the equation at all.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's rewind a little bit and give a TLDR or a quick summary of what the Hadiya case

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600
[Amit Varma]: actually was.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Basically, in two sentences, this woman chose to marry someone she fell in love with.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And she's a consenting adult.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.600
[Amit Varma]: She married him and she changed her religion.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.160
[Amit Varma]: And then her parents and various other interest groups went to court against the Kerala High

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:33.520
[Guest 1]: Court and said that, no, this is a case where she's been brainwashed and love jihad, basic

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.920
[Amit Varma]: love jihad narrative.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And this woman was forcibly separated from her husband and effectively kidnapped by whoever's

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:46.720
[Amit Varma]: custody she was in at different points in time, whether it's her parents or the warden

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.340
[Guest 1]: of whatever, but it's basically abduction.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.560
[Amit Varma]: The state abducted an adult woman.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560
[Guest 2]: That's what happened.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.400
[Guest 2]: And the high court remanded her back to her parents' custody, which was just absurd because

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.520
[Guest 2]: he basically kept her under house arrest.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.520
[Guest 2]: She couldn't go out.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.520
[Guest 2]: She couldn't meet people.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:11.560
[Guest 2]: It was quite at least referred to the Supreme Court because she appealed against her husband,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.960
[Guest 2]: I think was because she, how could she appeal, meaning she was in house arrest.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.440
[Guest 2]: Her husband was the one who appealed.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:26.840
[Guest 2]: So in fact, in the case until recently, she was, I think, like the ninth petition or something

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840
[Guest 2]: like that.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840
[Guest 2]: She's been bumped up to two or three.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.320
[Guest 1]: Well, you know, Hadia is just a woman my age.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.480
[Guest 1]: What does she know about what she wants and what she doesn't want?

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And this is again, a classic contemporary, ongoing example of a woman being denied her

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.760
[Amit Varma]: agency.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.480
[Amit Varma]: If, you know, if the state was to do this to a man, it would, you know, there would

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.560
[Amit Varma]: be a whole different spin on the whole thing.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.560
[Amit Varma]: But she's a woman.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.400
[Amit Varma]: She goes from the custody of the husband to a custody of her parents, to the custody of

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.040
[Amit Varma]: some male warden somewhere.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:02.360
[Amit Varma]: It's like she's a piece of property and while they dispute who owns her, she is flung around

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.360
[Amit Varma]: the separate custodians.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:14.960
[Guest 2]: So in fact, the case is going to be heard very fittingly on March 8th this week.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.640
[Guest 2]: And but in the previous instance, she'd filed an affidavit in front of the court saying

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.840
[Guest 2]: because they weren't really asking her that I did this voluntary.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.640
[Guest 2]: I love my husband.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.120
[Guest 2]: Can I please stay with my husband?

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.320
[Guest 2]: He's my husband.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320
[Guest 2]: I want to stay with him.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.880
[Guest 2]: And it's like, why I married him, disregarded.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:40.400
[Guest 1]: You know, what drives me about this is something that a lot of people say, when India got independent,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.400
[Guest 1]: there was universal adult franchise.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.200
[Guest 1]: Women were allowed to vote in India, much before women in several other countries were

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.200
[Guest 1]: allowed to vote.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.240
[Guest 1]: And it gets me to thinking about how, when slavery was still legal in the United States,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.600
[Guest 1]: slaves were counted as three fifths of a man's property.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.280
[Guest 1]: So they didn't have the vote, but they were counted as part of his property, which seems

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.440
[Guest 1]: to me not very different from the way we look at women today.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.280
[Guest 1]: You may have the right to vote, but you're still part of a man's property.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.160
[Guest 1]: You don't know enough for yourself.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:19.160
[Guest 1]: This is the Indian state being paternalistic, telling its women that they have no clue what

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.200
[Guest 1]: they want, that they're barely human.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.960
[Guest 1]: And just let the adult males decide everything that you want.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And the most heartbreaking word in all of what you said is today.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.280
[Amit Varma]: On that note, I think we'll end the episode Madhav and Hamsini, thanks so much for being

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.280
[Amit Varma]: on the show.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280
[Guest 2]: I learned a lot from you guys.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280
[Guest 2]: Thanks so much.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.360
