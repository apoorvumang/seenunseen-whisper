00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
[Amit Varma]: As we grow up, we believe that by and large, we should not interfere with other people's

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920
[Amit Varma]: business.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.720
[Amit Varma]: And it seems natural to transplant this thinking from individuals to countries.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.680
[Amit Varma]: We should not interfere with another country's internal affairs.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
[Amit Varma]: After all, we don't like it if other countries interfere with our own internal affairs.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.480
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.060
[Amit Varma]: Well, what if it's not quite that simple?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.520
[Amit Varma]: What if countries are not like people?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.620
[Amit Varma]: What if geopolitics, unlike trade between individuals, is often a zero-sum game?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.300
[Amit Varma]: What should we do about Maldives?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.180
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.180
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.700
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.780
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.820
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin this episode, a quick word from our sponsor for this episode.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.860
[Amit Varma]: I love art, but I often find that I simply cannot afford to have the best fine art hanging

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.860
[Amit Varma]: on my walls.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.700
[Amit Varma]: Equally, I have good friends who are artists, and they feel bad that they only get a one-time

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.220
[Amit Varma]: payment for their painting, unlike authors who get royalties for every single copy of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.220
[Amit Varma]: the book that is sold.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.580
[Amit Varma]: Well, there's a company called Indian Colors that is attempting to solve both these problems.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.100
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors licenses the work of top Indian artists and adapts it into objects of everyday

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
[Amit Varma]: use including wearable art like stoles and kaftans, home decor like cushion covers and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.820
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.900
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to get fine art into their homes at an accessible price, and artists

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.060
[Amit Varma]: get royalties and sales, just like authors do.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.180
[Amit Varma]: The artists whose works you'll find include luminaries like Dhruvi Acharya, Sameer Mondal,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.820
[Amit Varma]: Vasvo Ex Vaxvo, Brinda Miller, Shruti Nelson, and my favorite, Harin Vakil.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.860
[Amit Varma]: Do check it all out at IndianColors.com, that's Colors with an O-U, and use the code IVM20

[Amit Varma]: Now let's get on with the show.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.180
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is my friend Pranay Kotasane, a fellow at the Takshashila Institution and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.860
[Amit Varma]: the editor-in-charge of International Affairs at Pragati, the magazine I edit at ThinkPragati.com.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.700
[Amit Varma]: Pranay has been writing a lot about the crisis in Maldives, and he's one of the foreign

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.820
[Amit Varma]: policy experts I respect the most anywhere in the world.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.100
[Amit Varma]: So I'm delighted to have him on the show today.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.860
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740
[Amit Varma]: Hi Amit, it's good to be back.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.700
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, tell me a little bit about what's happening in the Maldives and why should we

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700
[Guest]: care?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.420
[Guest]: Okay, so a lot of political developments happened in Maldives, very interesting ones.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.540
[Guest]: So the story starts around six years back, okay.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.100
[Guest]: So there was one Mr. Gayoom who was ruling Maldives for a long time, even though this

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.580
[Guest]: was a presidential democracy, he ruled for a long time, and then we had the first democratically

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.060
[Guest]: elected president, Mohammad Nasheed, a few years back, around seven years back.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.100
[Guest]: And then Nasheed was replaced by another person, and he was just unceremoniously thrown out.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.660
[Guest]: And then we went to the current president, who is Yameen.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.860
[Guest]: So what happened off late was all these people who are the opposition to Yameen were basically

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.300
[Guest]: declared persona non grata in Maldives, and there were around 12 political prisoners who

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.580
[Guest]: were taken up, and the Supreme Court had convicted all of them.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.540
[Guest]: Now on 1st Feb, this changed.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.840
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court said that this earlier conviction was wrong, and these political

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.700
[Guest]: prisoners should be freed, and that's when all hell breaks loose.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.180
[Guest]: So Yameen says that, no, this is not done.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.380
[Guest]: He declares presidential emergency, which means that Supreme Court is no longer in charge

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.740
[Guest]: of the political developments that are happening there.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.900
[Guest]: And he again arrests all the Supreme Court judges.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.580
[Guest]: Also he arrests a bunch of political people.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.060
[Guest]: And then so that was extended till 15 days, he said that emergency would last for 15 days.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.100
[Guest]: Now just two days back, another presidential decree has been issued, and this emergency

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.740
[Guest]: will extend for another 30 days.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.060
[Guest]: So these are the political developments that have taken place.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.460
[Guest]: But there are a lot of geopolitical angles to this.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.320
[Guest]: This is just the domestic part, but the geopolitical angle is that China is seen to be backing

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.700
[Guest]: Yameen, and even six years back after, Nasheed had actually awarded a contract to GMR, which

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.060
[Guest]: was an Indian company for building their airport, which was one very big thing for Maldives.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.660
[Guest]: And his successor just said, ousted GMR from this contract.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.100
[Guest]: And then an international tribunal actually said that you need to pay money back to GMR,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.860
[Guest]: this is not just done.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.340
[Guest]: Yameen got money from China, from Saudi Arabia, etc. and gave this money to GMR and knocked

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.420
[Guest]: them off the project.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.900
[Guest]: And the project was again started with Saudi Arabia and Chinese help.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.740
[Guest]: So this is the geopolitical context here.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.940
[Guest]: So yeah, that's pretty much what has happened till now.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.060
[Amit Varma]: So why should we care?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.500
[Amit Varma]: What role has Maldives played in our foreign policy so far?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.580
[Amit Varma]: And it's small island somewhere else, government has changed, you know, a guy who was democratically

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.780
[Amit Varma]: elected has declared himself, has effectively become a dictator, imprisoned everybody, seen

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.020
[Amit Varma]: that happen in various places across the world.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020
[Amit Varma]: Let it play out.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020
[Guest]: Why does it affect us?

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.340
[Guest]: Yeah, it does affect us.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.300
[Guest]: So okay, let's take a background.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.820
[Guest]: Earlier, we had recorded an episode on changing behaviors of smaller states in the Indian

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.980
[Guest]: subcontinent.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.860
[Guest]: So it ties into this.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.540
[Guest]: Of course, now, smaller countries in India's neighborhood are no longer, you know, tied

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.980
[Guest]: to India, they're not coupled with India that closely.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.140
[Guest]: And they will look to balance India's overpowering influence with other countries, which is all

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.140
[Amit Varma]: fine.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.420
[Amit Varma]: So let me clarify that before we move on earlier, small countries were because they were so

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.020
[Amit Varma]: close to us, we're almost dependent on our, you know, benevolence, and therefore they

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.540
[Amit Varma]: were tied to us in terms of foreign policy, but now they're becoming more and more prosperous,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.980
[Amit Varma]: which is a good thing, and are also therefore becoming slightly independent.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.340
[Guest]: Yeah, not just that.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.100
[Guest]: And earlier, we didn't have this globalization as a concept, right.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.060
[Guest]: So because the markets were not open, they were tied with India just because of the link

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.620
[Guest]: and India was the biggest power in the neighborhood.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.580
[Guest]: After globalization that changed, they had more options.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.620
[Guest]: And now even more so, because for each of these countries, if you see, actually India

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.180
[Guest]: is the only country which is in between all the South Asian countries, right, no other

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.620
[Guest]: South Asian countries connected to the other one, except going through India.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620
[Amit Varma]: So we are like the hub.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.340
[Guest]: Yeah, and we are the biggest one.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.540
[Guest]: So overwhelmingly big.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.220
[Guest]: So it is very genuine for other countries to feel that we need to balance the power

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.820
[Guest]: of India in our country.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.820
[Guest]: And that's all fine.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.300
[Guest]: And now they have an option because China is also interested in this region.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.980
[Guest]: So they can always play China with India in this and that's all fine.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.020
[Guest]: But where I would draw the line here is, if there is anything that these countries are

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.780
[Guest]: doing, which are directly against Indian national interest, then India has to stand up there,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.780
[Guest]: right.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.740
[Guest]: Because as I explained, the president just poked India in the eye, right, and intentionally

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.820
[Guest]: getting rid of an Indian company, and then trying to boast how the Chinese are going

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.580
[Guest]: to help us is just showing that he can defy whatever India's national interests are and

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.140
[Guest]: still there won't be any consequences for that.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.820
[Guest]: There is a second point is that the ousted president, Mohammad Nasheed, he went out on

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.060
[Guest]: Twitter and he said that it would be great if India could intervene and restore democracy.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:59.220
[Guest]: So now we have a situation in which there is someone who's friendly to India, a powerful

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.660
[Guest]: political force, and he's asking for India's help.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.740
[Guest]: So now just imagine if India doesn't do anything on this.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.460
[Guest]: What would be the lesson that other friendly powers in other countries will draw with respect

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.460
[Guest]: to India?

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.140
[Guest]: A person at the margin would think that India is not a credible partner.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.940
[Guest]: Why should I even deal with India?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.820
[Guest]: Why should I even have a friendly relationship with India?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.860
[Guest]: Because it's just not a credible partner.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.020
[Amit Varma]: But just pray devil's advocate, you could also argue that yes, India should always uphold

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.540
[Amit Varma]: its word, which it makes to friendly nations.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.860
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, this is an individual, it's not a friendly nation.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.240
[Amit Varma]: This is Nasheed, the individual who's no longer in power and India's approach could simply

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.100
[Amit Varma]: be that what does it matter if that small island is friends with us or not?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.460
[Amit Varma]: What is the threat to India's interests over here?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.980
[Guest]: Yeah, right.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:56.300
[Guest]: So, see, the foreign policy game in any region is that you need to have friendly relationships

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:02.300
[Guest]: or friendly regimes in one country or the other so that you can use it for mutual benefit.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.100
[Guest]: And here you clearly have a case where that's not happening.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.500
[Guest]: So one, you would want that to change.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.780
[Guest]: You would either want Yameen to be more friendly to you, at least in terms of respecting Indian

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.940
[Guest]: national interest.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.540
[Guest]: And if not that, then because it's a small country, you can afford to have someone else

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.540
[Guest]: there.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.540
[Guest]: I mean, Mali's capital is 2.5 square kilometers.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.620
[Guest]: It's not as if Indian military forces can't intervene.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.500
[Guest]: So that is one angle.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.380
[Guest]: So India's national interests here are affected in a few ways.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:39.980
[Guest]: So first, because China is a willing supporter to this regime, at least it has tried to be

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:45.660
[Guest]: so, there are fears that over time, they will actually build a military base there.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.780
[Guest]: In fact, the Yameen has already leased some of their islands to the Chinese.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.820
[Guest]: So there is a fear that five to six years later, there might be a military base of China

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.820
[Amit Varma]: which might come here.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.340
[Amit Varma]: And that would give them a big advantage.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.740
[Guest]: Yes, that will definitely give them a big advantage because they don't have any significant

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.180
[Guest]: presence in the Indian Ocean.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.420
[Guest]: They have something in Jibouti, but nothing near India.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.180
[Guest]: Something which is that close to India will be a big, big advantage for them.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.980
[Guest]: See, there is Diego Garcia as well, which is a military base of the US and US has adopted

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.140
[Guest]: a very hands off approach.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.980
[Guest]: I think they are in agreement with India's stance on this.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:29.500
[Guest]: So this is a perfect test case actually for India to demonstrate that if there are friendly

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.140
[Guest]: powers in the neighborhood, India will go back and help them.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.700
[Guest]: The costs are not very high for India to intervene.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.700
[Guest]: So what should we do?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.940
[Guest]: So actually just things what what happened two, three days back was MEA, Ministry of

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.380
[Guest]: External Affairs in India actually issued a statement.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.860
[Amit Varma]: Since it's a couple of days back, I should clarify that we are recording this on Thursday,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.540
[Amit Varma]: the 22nd, and this episode releases on Monday, the 25th.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.100
[Guest]: So those are sort of the timelines, right?

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.900
[Guest]: So what happened was Ministry of External Affairs did issue a statement that democracy

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.700
[Guest]: should be restored, the Supreme Court ruling on 1st Feb should again be restored and things

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.700
[Guest]: like that.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:20.140
[Guest]: And Yamin just didn't listen to that and he again, extended the emergency for 30 days.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.140
[Guest]: Okay.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.060
[Guest]: So this is what has happened.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.940
[Guest]: Now, this is clearly Yamin demonstrating that he just doesn't care about India.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:36.900
[Guest]: So all the other options of people calling that we should do some diplomatic, you know,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.060
[Guest]: diplomatic outreach to Yamin, the time for all that is long gone.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.060
[Amit Varma]: And it simply won't work.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.020
[Guest]: And it's gone six years back since the time the GMR incident happened, the time for that

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.580
[Guest]: is not now, it was six years back.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.440
[Guest]: So now the only option is India should intervene and should take Yamin out.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.660
[Guest]: And actually, my colleague Nitin Pai had written a sort of a roadmap for this.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:05.780
[Guest]: So he had suggested that one thing that could be done is first the Indian army reaches their

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:12.140
[Guest]: army and the navy and after that Yamin is replaced and the next constitutional head

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.600
[Guest]: would be the vice president.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.480
[Guest]: So he is brought to power.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.580
[Guest]: And after that, there is an election coming up.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.580
[Guest]: So an election is held.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.680
[Guest]: And based on whatever happens in the election, the ruling party changes.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.380
[Guest]: So that should be the mode.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.620
[Guest]: One interesting thing that India can do is while intervening in all this, it can make

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.180
[Guest]: sure that the contracts that Maldives has already made with the Chinese companies, they

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.900
[Guest]: don't go away, you know, because that will be more acrimonious, even China will feel

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.900
[Guest]: unsettled.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.900
[Guest]: So that could be managed.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.540
[Guest]: So behave honorably, basically.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.540
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.580
[Amit Varma]: And stand up to our national interest.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.120
[Amit Varma]: So I have three hypothetical questions for you, just to play devil's advocate and sort

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.380
[Amit Varma]: of try and understand the nuances of this, which I don't, which I'm just coming to grips

00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:01.440
[Amit Varma]: with that you're saying that we should intervene now, because A, the regime in charge is unfriendly

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440
[Amit Varma]: with us.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.220
[Amit Varma]: B, the regime in charge has behaved dictatorially, imprisoned its opponents in the Supreme Court

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220
[Amit Varma]: and it's effectively a dictatorship.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.700
[Amit Varma]: And C, most importantly, because our interests are threatened by this, because China could

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.700
[Amit Varma]: build military bases there, which would be a disaster for us and would shift the balance

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.940
[Amit Varma]: of power in the in South Asia.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.780
[Guest]: And there's a D here, because we have a person, a former president was democratically elected,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.700
[Amit Varma]: who is friendly towards India.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.460
[Amit Varma]: Hypothetical question number one, supposing Yameen was democratically elected as as as

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.460
[Amit Varma]: he was, and supposing he didn't do any of this, but was allowing the Chinese to build

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.460
[Amit Varma]: those military bases.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.260
[Amit Varma]: So it would still be against our national interest.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.140
[Amit Varma]: But would we then have an imperative to go out and replace him?

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.540
[Amit Varma]: Yes, we would.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.340
[Guest]: Even if he was a democratically elected?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.340
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.180
[Guest]: Because we have to act in a national interest.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.180
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.180
[Guest]: Yeah, we have.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:58.500
[Guest]: See, it's not we have to understand that it's not as if Maldives is, you know, it's a tributary

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
[Guest]: of India.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:05.480
[Guest]: It's a mutually, it's a relationship under international conduct.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.900
[Guest]: And of course, there's a big power differential.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:15.700
[Guest]: But India has gone out of the way and there are trade contacts also, all the Maldives

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:21.820
[Guest]: self defense forces, they get a lot of training in from India, their helicopters in their

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.260
[Guest]: self defense forces are actually Indian made.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.780
[Guest]: So there are a lot of those connections which India has already done, you know.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:36.920
[Guest]: So if in spite of all this, there is anyone democratically elected or not, who is poking

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.740
[Guest]: India in the eye by doing things which are directly against Indian national interest,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.900
[Amit Varma]: and India has no other option but to stand.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.420
[Amit Varma]: So follow up question, if we didn't have these historic relationship with them, where we

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.460
[Amit Varma]: trained their special forces, and, you know, where we were so close to them, if we didn't

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.940
[Amit Varma]: have those relationships, and if it was just an independent place, leaving everybody alone

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.580
[Amit Varma]: and minding their own business, and they now invited the Chinese to build up a base, would

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.780
[Amit Varma]: we then nevertheless be justified?

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.460
[Amit Varma]: Because we have to look after our own interests?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460
[Unknown]: Yes, yes.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460
[Unknown]: Absolutely.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.140
[Amit Varma]: So what you would say here is that, look, let's be realistic, let's not have some high

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.140
[Amit Varma]: notions of what is moral behavior.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.380
[Amit Varma]: The point is, China would do all of these things, China would have no boundaries in

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.540
[Amit Varma]: terms of what it would do to enhance its national power.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.860
[Amit Varma]: And for our own sake, we need to counter that.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.820
[Guest]: And therefore, we should have no qualms either.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.820
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.500
[Guest]: Yeah, I have never made the argument for we should intervene for the preservation of democracy,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.620
[Amit Varma]: things like what the US does, we know the difference between what the neocons, the neocons

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.660
[Amit Varma]: optics don't apply here.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.780
[Amit Varma]: So the second hypothetical question, supposing we do exactly as Nitin said, we go in there,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.140
[Amit Varma]: we occupy the place, we get Yameen out, we put the other guy in charge, whoever is the

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.900
[Amit Varma]: next in line, and we have free democratic elections.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.100
[Amit Varma]: What if Yameen wins again?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.460
[Guest]: Yeah, then we'll have to lump it, we'll have to live with it.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.260
[Guest]: And then he invites the Chinese army?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.460
[Guest]: Yeah, then we'll have to live with it.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.540
[Guest]: But I think the overall assessment is that Yameen has been extremely unpopular with what

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.540
[Guest]: he's done.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.940
[Guest]: So there, of course, there will be a level of risk that we have to assess.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:15.780
[Guest]: But given that previous democratically elected president is also hugely popular, I think

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.820
[Amit Varma]: these are risks which India can easily manage.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.140
[Amit Varma]: So you would say our intervention should be to the extent of going out there and replacing

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.300
[Amit Varma]: the regime and hoping the next regime behaves correctly.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.100
[Amit Varma]: But we should not install a puppet, we should let democracy play itself out.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.060
[Amit Varma]: And if it turns out that the same guy comes to power and is even more pro Chinese now,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.860
[Guest]: obviously, then we should just come back.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.900
[Guest]: No, but he won't be more pro Chinese, because we would have demonstrated that there are

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.420
[Guest]: costs to be had when certain things which are done to India.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.660
[Amit Varma]: But if he were to come back, we would also have demonstrated that there would be certain

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.620
[Amit Varma]: limits to our actions, and we're not actually going to kill him or imprison him.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.980
[Guest]: Yeah, but we always have an option to do that again, that can be a threat.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.460
[Guest]: And that next time, there won't be any promises of elections.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.460
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Really interesting.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.900
[Amit Varma]: So what's the foreign policy?

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.500
[Amit Varma]: What's the foreign policy establishments thinking on this in India?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:10.260
[Guest]: I think now, after that MEA statement, which came out, it clearly demonstrates that the

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.720
[Guest]: Indian government is very serious about Yameen.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.060
[Guest]: But I just think it took too long, right?

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.820
[Guest]: Since six years, this has been happening.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.740
[Guest]: And we should have preempted that certain things would have happened here.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.740
[Guest]: And we should have taken actions much upfront.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.620
[Guest]: And now that we've let six years pass, our options have to be at a higher escalatory

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.620
[Guest]: level.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620
[Guest]: So our options are gone.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.620
[Guest]: Is it too late?

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.620
[Guest]: I don't think so.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.620
[Guest]: I think it is still manageable.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.700
[Guest]: In fact, a couple of days ago, again, there were news reports that Indian Navy and Army

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.140
[Guest]: etc are already conducting joint exercises in the vicinity of Maldives.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.020
[Guest]: So I think the military establishment is also ready.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.300
[Guest]: And we've done this before, like in 1988, we had intervened in Maldives, the circumstances

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:03.300
[Guest]: were slightly different, but I think Indian military is more than capable to do something

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.300
[Amit Varma]: like this.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.620
[Amit Varma]: What if China decides to put its foot down, is there is a chance of escalation into a

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.620
[Guest]: full blown war?

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.060
[Guest]: I don't think so.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.300
[Guest]: So and even if that is the case, then that is all the more reason that India should preempt

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.300
[Guest]: it.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:22.860
[Guest]: So earlier, there were news items again, that some Chinese ships and frigates were actually

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.860
[Guest]: spotted in the Indian Ocean.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.260
[Guest]: But I don't think it was related to Maldives, because they returned back and they do this

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.420
[Guest]: in two, three months, in either case, they have their regular rounds.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:41.020
[Guest]: So now, if the alternative scenario is that what if China comes into Maldives?

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.380
[Guest]: So I mean, we can't be waiting for the Chinese to come there and then say, what are our options,

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.380
[Guest]: right?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.920
[Guest]: It's better to preempt that and prevent Chinese from coming there.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.460
[Guest]: Because once they come, then what are our options after that?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.460
[Guest]: Then the game is over.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.460
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.580
[Amit Varma]: So if that is the case, and we do what Nitin said now, and we conduct elections there,

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.100
[Amit Varma]: and Yamin wins again, your recommendation is that we come back.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.140
[Amit Varma]: But what if the Chinese go there and all this happens anyway?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.700
[Guest]: I think we can manage after that.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.300
[Guest]: Because once we demonstrate that there are consequences to be had, and there can be even

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.100
[Guest]: higher consequences to be had, that will be enough of a deterrent.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.260
[Amit Varma]: So even if the situation seems the same, we are a different India and they look at us

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.100
[Guest]: differently if we do that.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:28.340
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of take a step back now and talk about South Asia, like South Asia has

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.900
[Amit Varma]: changed a lot in foreign policy terms in the last couple of decades, China has become much

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.140
[Amit Varma]: more powerful.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.940
[Amit Varma]: And recently, under Donald Trump, the US seems to have taken a step back and become more

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.780
[Amit Varma]: ambiguous about some of its dealings and India has had to adjust its mindset accordingly.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.260
[Amit Varma]: We recently had some kind of conflicts in, you know, involving the Rohingyas, for example,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.700
[Amit Varma]: which was a dilemma for us and then Doklam, where there was a standoff with the Chinese.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.140
[Guest]: What's happening in South Asia?

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.340
[Guest]: Okay, so let me put it in this way.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:06.340
[Guest]: First on Doklam, let's say, in Doklam, I think India aptly demonstrated that the things that

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.700
[Guest]: China does in South China Sea where it just occupies land and then says, hey, this was

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.740
[Guest]: my island from long time back and they start doing construction, etc.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:21.260
[Guest]: I think India demonstrated in Doklam that India won't allow that to happen and India

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.460
[Guest]: is not a country which China can take for a ride and the strategy that it adopted there

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.660
[Guest]: in South China Sea won't operate here.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.980
[Guest]: So that was a positive thing.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:36.420
[Guest]: On with respect to the neighbours, as I earlier said, now neighbours always have an option,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.180
[Guest]: it is perfectly in their national interest to balance India's overwhelming influence

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.180
[Amit Varma]: with that of China.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.180
[Amit Varma]: Which is a good thing, which is fine.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.300
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which is fine.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.700
[Guest]: As long as it does not in direct confrontation with India's interest, we should be alright

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.260
[Guest]: with it.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:57.940
[Guest]: On the Rohingya issue, I think we missed an opportunity to demonstrate that we are what

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.980
[Guest]: we call ourselves a net security provider, right.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.300
[Guest]: That's what India likes to call itself.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300
[Guest]: What does it mean?

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300
[Guest]: Explain that.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.620
[Guest]: Yeah, it just means that overall India will provide more security to in the Indian Ocean

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.940
[Guest]: region even to other countries.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:19.900
[Guest]: So now in the Rohingya case, for example, at a time when a genocide was taking place,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.700
[Guest]: there were voices within the Indian establishment which were talking about deporting the 40,000

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.660
[Guest]: Rohingyas who are already there in India.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:33.380
[Guest]: It just didn't make sense, it defies all logic, you know, even foreign policy, national interest

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.940
[Guest]: logic even, right.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.420
[Guest]: Why should we be talking about deportation of those people when there is a huge amount

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.340
[Guest]: of influx from Myanmar anyways?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.940
[Guest]: And what we could have done again is to back Bangladesh to the hill because Bangladesh

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940
[Amit Varma]: took the lead.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.460
[Amit Varma]: And they acted very honorably.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.540
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:58.380
[Guest]: And again, there, we had Sheikh Hasina, who is a great friend of India's, and they are

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.180
[Guest]: going to go to elections next year.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.220
[Guest]: So it is all the more in India's interest to make sure that Sheikh Hasina comes out

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.640
[Guest]: winning on this count.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.020
[Amit Varma]: So these are the specific issues, Roklam and Rohingyas, but overall, tell me a little

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.180
[Amit Varma]: bit about how the balance of power is sort of shifting and the challenges that we confront

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.100
[Guest]: as a result in South Asia.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.100
[Guest]: Okay.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:23.540
[Guest]: So in the Indian subcontinent, what you have is, as I said, there is a huge power asymmetry.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.420
[Guest]: And so the China is an alternative, it is coming in.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.980
[Guest]: And what has happened in the past few years is India is trying to manage this, the fact

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:40.420
[Guest]: that China is more provocative, and the fact that these countries are increasing their

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.900
[Guest]: relationship with China.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.660
[Guest]: So that is the flux that we are operating in.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:52.780
[Guest]: With regards to, and on that count, leave Pakistan aside, because that there the equation

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.660
[Guest]: is very different.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.820
[Guest]: But in all the other countries, this equation is just playing out.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.100
[Guest]: So there are regime changes, there are elections, etc, which are happening, and all of them

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:09.860
[Guest]: are happening in the backdrop of this, will the new leader support China more or support

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.860
[Guest]: India more?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.940
[Guest]: That's how the narratives are playing out.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:21.460
[Guest]: But I think in India's case, and for all the neighborhood countries, they realize that

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.540
[Guest]: they have a lot of relationship, a lot of trade, they have, it's very difficult for

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.060
[Guest]: them to go around the geography of this region.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.780
[Guest]: I mean, we're all in those interwoven networks, and you can't just take a scissor and cut

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.780
[Guest]: it off.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.780
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.500
[Guest]: So that relationship is understood.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.740
[Guest]: And it's very difficult to get out of, get out of a good relationship with India, they

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.420
[Guest]: can't afford it, basically.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.580
[Guest]: So in such circumstances, what India should do is, India should make clear what are its

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.580
[Guest]: red lines in terms of what these countries can, they can do whatever they want, as long

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.100
[Guest]: as it doesn't directly affect Indian national interest.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.860
[Guest]: And as long as those red lines are met, we should be okay to manage with any country.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.300
[Amit Varma]: And where does Pakistan come in all of this?

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.700
[Amit Varma]: I mean, China is inching closer to Pakistan for obvious reasons to use them as a counterweight

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.700
[Amit Varma]: against us.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.220
[Amit Varma]: How has that equation changed?

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.700
[Amit Varma]: I mean, should we be worried?

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.020
[Guest]: Yeah, there are many schools of thought on this.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:24.420
[Guest]: One thing is yes, people do feel now Pakistan used to have a backer called the US, now the

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.700
[Guest]: Pakistani military jihadi complex has another backer called China.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.780
[Guest]: So should we be worried?

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.940
[Guest]: I think, yes, we should be worried.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.500
[Guest]: What will happen is in the short term, the military jihadi complex will strengthen because

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.140
[Guest]: now it has someone to back it and its support with the US is weaning.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.380
[Guest]: So in the short term, yes.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:53.420
[Guest]: And overall, what I feel is, as China gets involved more and more with Pakistan, that

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.620
[Guest]: familiarity is definitely going to breed contempt.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.060
[Guest]: And you will have a lot of acrimony between the two.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:07.100
[Guest]: Just imagine if there will be Chinese people operating in Gwadar and in Balochistan, which

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.740
[Guest]: are again very sensitive areas, and with the language gap and things like that, there will

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.260
[Guest]: be a lot of acrimony.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.060
[Guest]: So I think we should wait and watch for now.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.100
[Guest]: And I do not necessarily think this is very negative for India.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.100
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.740
[Amit Varma]: And how does a foreign policy establishment need to change its view in light of all these

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.900
[Amit Varma]: developments?

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900
[Amit Varma]: Developments in?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900
[Amit Varma]: South Asia overall.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everything, you know, from Doklam to Rohingyas to Maldives to Pakistan.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.300
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.420
[Guest]: So I think the way we have to look at this is this way.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:45.780
[Guest]: We think that whatever China is doing is against India, but that is not the case.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.780
[Guest]: Right.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.940
[Guest]: There is a power play going on between U.S. and China.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.980
[Guest]: So China wants to become what U.S. is.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.180
[Guest]: And that is the larger game which is playing out.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.660
[Guest]: Now, our national interest is what can we do in this ongoing power play which benefits

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.660
[Guest]: us, which means we have to do things with U.S. and with China as well.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.660
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.940
[Guest]: Certain things like climate change, et cetera, our positions are closer to China rather than

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.460
[Guest]: that of the U.S.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:19.220
[Guest]: So we have to try and ensure that we have enough options available so that we can extract

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.660
[Guest]: benefits from both U.S. and China and pursue our bigger goal of prosperity for Indians.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.660
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.580
[Guest]: All foreign policy is finally for that.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.860
[Guest]: And whatever requires to be done in order to ensure prosperity for Indians, we have

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.940
[Amit Varma]: to do that.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.620
[Amit Varma]: And one of the first things would be to stop China from overstepping in the Indian Ocean

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.180
[Amit Varma]: and do something about Maldives.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.180
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.180
