00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
[Amit Varma]: What is a teacup? When I look at a teacup, I see a cup in which I drink tea. But others

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
[Amit Varma]: might see more in it. Looking at a teacup, they might see all the forces of history that

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.680
[Amit Varma]: shape it, the habits of society in a moment in time, all the different cultural influences

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.840
[Amit Varma]: around that give it the shape and weight and texture that we take for granted. A teacup

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.200
[Amit Varma]: contains so much information that it might even be talking to you. And all you have to

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.260
[Amit Varma]: do is listen. Now, at one level, I think this might be overthinking it, chai piyo aash karo.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.440
[Amit Varma]: But at another level, it is true that all the inanimate things around us have rich histories

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.840
[Amit Varma]: and are full of meaning, if only we choose to look for them. I often say we should never

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.520
[Amit Varma]: take people for granted. Well, maybe we shouldn't take things for granted as well.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.240
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen. My guest today is Annapurna Garimela, a designer, curator

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.640
[Amit Varma]: and art historian. She was one of my fellow judges for the JCB prize for literature earlier

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.880
[Amit Varma]: this year, just like the author Sarah Rai, who features in episode 255 of the show. Annapurna

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.520
[Amit Varma]: comes from a different imaginative world and sensibility than mine. And I loved our brief

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.280
[Amit Varma]: conversation so much that I figured I had to get her on this show and have a longer

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.360
[Amit Varma]: chat. We finally made it happen. She shared her rich memories of growing up in a world

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.120
[Amit Varma]: that was partly rural and partly urban. I was struck by the richness and detail in her

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120
[Amit Varma]: memories and felt that a world had opened up to me. We spoke about remembering and reflecting,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.420
[Amit Varma]: academia and scholarship, art and access, the different ways in which we see the world.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.760
[Amit Varma]: We also argued a bit. She's wary of markets, while I love markets and technology because

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
[Amit Varma]: they've empowered and liberated individual creators like me and freed me from the whims

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.880
[Amit Varma]: of elite gatekeepers. Some of our conversation was transcendental, and some was combative.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure you'll find lots to think about. You'll also never look at teacups in quite

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520
[Amit Varma]: the same way.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.840
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.720
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.520
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.080
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.520
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.720
[Amit Varma]: covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.720
[Amit Varma]: me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.600
[Amit Varma]: better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to

[Amit Varma]: and use the code UNSEEN. Up level yourself.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Anupona, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.800
[Guest]: Thank you for having me. It's very gracious of you.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.640
[Amit Varma]: So I'm really looking forward to our conversation in an odd way because I feel like I know very

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680
[Amit Varma]: little about you. Most of my guests are people whose books I might have read or whose work

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.040
[Amit Varma]: I have followed and all of that. And we've of course, you and I have interacted during

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.520
[Amit Varma]: the Zoom jury meetings of the JCB Prize and all of that. So in a sense, I feel like I

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.840
[Amit Varma]: know you, but I also feel like I don't know more about you. I have a sense of who you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.280
[Amit Varma]: are, but not really knowledge of what makes you who you are or what makes you what you

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.560
[Amit Varma]: are and so on and so forth, which is a sort of an interesting place to be in. So I want

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.360
[Amit Varma]: to really start right at the beginning. Tell me about, you know, where you were born, where

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.260
[Amit Varma]: you grew up, the texture of your life, of the young Anupona's life when you were a kid.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.840
[Amit Varma]: Because I think, you know, another interesting facet that I often explore during the show

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.260
[Amit Varma]: is talking to guests who are my age or older or from decades past, as it were, and talking

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.240
[Amit Varma]: about their lives because the texture of life was so different then. You know, one of my

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.440
[Amit Varma]: friends once said that kids growing up today will never know what it is to be lost, like

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.640
[Amit Varma]: physically lost because you have maps. They might even never know what it is to be bored

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.040
[Amit Varma]: in that sense of having nothing to do. They can be bored in different ways. But you know,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.400
[Amit Varma]: they can be immersed in a smartphone. Well, I think back in the day, I could just be immersed

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.280
[Amit Varma]: in a book or, you know, Sarah, our mutual friend once, you know, when I recorded with

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.640
[Amit Varma]: her a few days back, she said this very interesting thing where she said that she was a deep reader

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.520
[Amit Varma]: from a very early age because of the dullness of life. There was nothing else. And I asked

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.920
[Amit Varma]: her about observation skills, which, as you would have realized, are incredibly acute.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.200
[Amit Varma]: And she said that I noticed things so well, because there was nothing else to do. You

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.080
[Amit Varma]: had to look at things. And I don't buy that explanation because many other people lived

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.200
[Amit Varma]: in those times and her powers of observation are extraordinary. So give me a sense of what

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.720
[Amit Varma]: the texture of your young years were wherever you born. What was that like?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:48.400
[Guest]: So I was born in 1966 in June in my grandparents' house in rural Andhra Pradesh in East Godavari

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.840
[Guest]: District. So this area is called Kona Seema. People who are aware of Indian languages will

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.040
[Guest]: understand that this is a delta. Kona is for tri, for delta and Seema is the boundary area.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.360
[Guest]: So this is an agrarian landscape that's today one of the richest agrarian regions in India.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.440
[Guest]: And it really became that rich because of the construction of the Buckingham Canal,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.560
[Guest]: which comes from Orissa all the way down to Pondicherry. And Mr. Cotton, who has a museum

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.380
[Guest]: dedicated to him in Rajahmundry, created innumerable canals that flow through this delta village

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.560
[Guest]: to village and inundated the landscape, the rivers that were flowing out of the Godavari

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.360
[Guest]: Nakrishna into the Bay of Bengal were directed before they flowed out into the landscape.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.800
[Guest]: So the time I came to this landscape, it was, it looked like it had been rich and fertile

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: forever, but in fact was probably only that fertile for about 100, 150 years. So I'm named

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:06.520
[Guest]: Annapurna because on my paternal side, somebody went to Varanasi where she's the goddess of

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.960
[Guest]: the city. And she is a very important goddess for Telugu speaking people. Telugu speaking

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.600
[Guest]: priests are the priests at the temple of Annapurna. And he came back, he did a padiyatra and he

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:27.400
[Guest]: came back and he came back safe and sound. So he took a vow that the first child of every

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:35.440
[Guest]: family in his lineage would be named after her. So I am named Annapurna after this. So

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.240
[Guest]: these kinds of things completely shape you. So my grandfather, my, both my grandmothers

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:50.960
[Guest]: are Annapurna and my grandfather adored me. I am one of 30 children of his surviving 10

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.360
[Guest]: children. There were many pregnancies. He adored my grandmother, I think. And therefore

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.600
[Guest]: there are a lot of children. They produce children and we are 30 and I'm this, and they're

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.640
[Guest]: primarily all boys. We're only nine girls out of this. And I'm the second oldest girl

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.400
[Guest]: and the girl that spent the most time with everyone else for various reasons, which I

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.280
[Guest]: can explain if you'd like. And because I spent so much of my time between my grandparents'

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.560
[Guest]: village and also Bhopal where my father worked as a junior engineer at BHEL, I had these

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:33.320
[Guest]: two things of India, which I think are the things of India that people think of post-independence

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:43.160
[Guest]: as a dynamic that had to be negotiated. Rurality and industrial development, rural development

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
[Guest]: and industrial development. So my grandfather was very interesting. I come from an upper

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.880
[Guest]: caste Brahmin family. And of course there are things that are mythologized by me and

00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:01.960
[Guest]: by all of us, but he was a very kind man. And the atmosphere that he permeated everywhere

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:10.680
[Guest]: was of a person who was an only child and had many children, many sisters. The father

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.760
[Guest]: was not alive, so he had to take care of all those sisters. So in my grandparents' house,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.880
[Guest]: his six daughters, his wife, and his four or five sisters, they're all having babies

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:27.520
[Guest]: at the same time. So I had that world and the world of being in Bhopal, living in the

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.800
[Guest]: quarters, the ground level quarters. So there was a garden and I was there by myself. And

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.240
[Guest]: I was an only child for 10 years. So it was this really interesting dichotomy between

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.320
[Guest]: being surrounded in the village with lots of people and being in Bhopal with very few

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:57.280
[Guest]: people in the household except my parents. And I think that because it was so dichotomous,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:04.320
[Guest]: it prompted me to constantly adjust. And if you're constantly adjusting, you start reflecting

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.300
[Guest]: on what you're adjusting. And then the reflection on what you're adjusting begins to make you

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.200
[Guest]: think about adjusting itself. Or it did to me. This is over time. It's not like it popped

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.760
[Guest]: into my head at age four or something. But also what it does is, growing up that way

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.680
[Guest]: for me anyway, my grandfather made it perfectly okay. He was a very modern man in his own

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:37.160
[Guest]: way. So he wanted a Chevrolet. He practiced the rituals of Brahmanical masculinity to

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.960
[Guest]: satisfy my grandmother to some extent, like doing things like Sandhyavadana. But outside

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:49.040
[Guest]: of the house, he didn't really practice caste untouchability at all. So I went with him

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.320
[Guest]: to the fields whenever I was there, and we would sit all day in the field, which he would

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.340
[Guest]: do, I think, basically to enjoy that time. And our best friends were the people who worked

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.240
[Guest]: in the fields, I think. And of course, there was total complex hierarchy, but he also felt

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.560
[Guest]: an enormous responsibility. So funding their children's marriages and education, none of

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.480
[Guest]: them are field hands anymore. They're all moved on, and my family doesn't have that

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.120
[Guest]: house anymore. So they still have the roots there. So these are all interesting things.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.320
[Guest]: But my grandfather swam, and he believed, I think, caste doesn't matter because water

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.560
[Guest]: is flowing, and water is washing everyone. So he had these ideas, I think. I don't know

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.960
[Guest]: if we ever talked about it. We never talked about it. But sometimes, if you're observing

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:46.040
[Guest]: people and you see the way they carry themselves, he was a big man. The way he carried himself,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.480
[Guest]: you understood that his shoulders were not scared of the touch. He wasn't scrunching

00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:00.040
[Guest]: himself. He was wide open to bounce, for his shoulders to rub against other kinds of shoulders,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.440
[Guest]: those kinds of things. At home, in our house, we were a very wealthy family. So Burma teak

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.560
[Guest]: granaries, seven of them, were filled with rice. And they were the size of the height

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.400
[Guest]: of this building that we're in right now, 1-1 Granary. And that kind of wealth was there.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.880
[Guest]: And so my childhood was spent playing in the granaries, playing with tamarind seeds, making

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:32.920
[Guest]: palm leaf dolls. Because I spent so much time with them, there was this ritual of the door

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.480
[Guest]: being opened in the morning, and then it would stay open all day long till night when we

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.080
[Guest]: went to sleep. And this was a huge ceremonial teak door. And it was a house that was built

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:49.160
[Guest]: about more than, now it still exists, it's more than 150 years old. So architecture,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.320
[Guest]: which is one of the things I study very deeply, formed in my head. And relationships, like

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:03.000
[Guest]: the side passages in which lower caste or women who had their periods or people who

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.520
[Guest]: had to perform some kind of service, they came, or foods that were not allowed to be

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.640
[Guest]: cooked inside the main kitchen, all these things were designated, there were spaces

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.460
[Guest]: for them. His mother lived there, my great-grandmother lived there, she decided to have her own kitchen

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:24.400
[Guest]: to have a different relationship with her daughter-in-law. And these granaries were,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:32.640
[Guest]: there was a big teak box, I would say it's about, it was about three feet or four feet

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.360
[Guest]: deep and about five to six feet wide, which was filled with grain. And in the morning

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.800
[Guest]: in this door, which was never closed, people would come and they'd say,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.040
[Guest]: Dehi bhikshan dehi mata annapurneshwari.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:54.360
[Guest]: And my grandfather and my grandmother, not my grandfather, but my grandmother and my aunts

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.920
[Guest]: and uncles, they would tell me to go give it. And later on, my partner gave me the insight

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:07.800
[Guest]: that perhaps it was an interesting way for a small hand to give small quantity in ritual,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.400
[Guest]: that you're giving something, but that you didn't get into the discourse with the child

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.480
[Guest]: about, is this enough, is this not enough, all these sort of things. But that kind of

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.960
[Guest]: programs you, like what is your identity is programmed when you're named after the food

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.760
[Guest]: goddess, when your task in your grandparents' house is to give the food. There's so much

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.840
[Guest]: cooking in our household and preparations of vadis and pickles, and you know, aunt has

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.120
[Guest]: very rich in mangoes of various kinds, very famous for its pickles, so lots of pickles

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.760
[Guest]: and poppards were made on lungis in the summers. And going to the film theater, as you may

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.640
[Guest]: know, many film theaters in Andhra, the architecture of them is based on rice mills, the person

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.560
[Guest]: who talks about them is SV Srinivas. And we would go to theaters, this was a big thing,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.800
[Guest]: my aunt and I would go in a horse and horse cart. I can't believe I have this life. We

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:15.080
[Guest]: would go in a horse cart at night and we would sit in the theater and watch movies. They

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:22.560
[Guest]: called this the Gandhi class and then there was other classes in this theater. You start,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:31.600
[Guest]: it's very odd because there are many places I understood about caste and class and gender,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.240
[Guest]: but I also understood that there were always people who were transgressing those boundaries.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.440
[Guest]: And that's very important to me to know, hold those two things in my head because I focus

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:51.520
[Guest]: on this, I forget this. And if I focus on this, I forget this. So I keep that in practice,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.240
[Guest]: whether it's in my work or in the way that I understand the politics of the spaces I

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.080
[Guest]: live in, the country that I live in, or the places I've lived in. So that was my childhood

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.160
[Guest]: in my village. In Bhopal, it was very different. In any case, my grandfather was very interested

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.440
[Guest]: in me being very independent. So from the beginning, and he was very tender with me.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.240
[Guest]: So getting my nose pierced is his thing, getting my ears pierced is his thing. And he did all

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:26.040
[Guest]: sorts of wrong things. Like he told the jeweler who would be sitting opposite me, pierce her

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:33.600
[Guest]: ears and pierce her nose. That was at a later point. In Andhra, women get their nose pierced

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:42.160
[Guest]: on the right side, but he told him to do it on the right. He didn't specify to the jeweler

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.440
[Guest]: from his right, so my right, not his. So he pierced me on the wrong side. And of course,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.520
[Guest]: my grandmother and my mother, everybody scolded my grandfather intensely for doing the ritually

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:59.360
[Guest]: wrong thing. And these things, so in a way, I feel like he made it okay to be not fitting

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.400
[Guest]: in or something like that. And then when we lived in Bhopal, I was very much an independent

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.760
[Guest]: person. So Bhopal, that colony, BHL colony, was relatively far out of the city. At three

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.160
[Guest]: and four, I would just walk out and walk onto the national highway, and then my father's

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.360
[Guest]: friend would pick me up and bring me back home. And this was like a real problem for

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:26.080
[Guest]: my parents, my sense of sovereignty, maybe, or autonomy, or a sense that maybe it's not

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.880
[Guest]: even sovereign. Maybe it's a sense that the universe is good with me, and I can live in

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:38.040
[Guest]: it with some fearlessness. And I think I was a very hard child for my parents. I think

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.080
[Guest]: that's also very important for me to state, since you asked this question. I loved my

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.040
[Guest]: mother very much. I have some memories of my father taking me every Sunday when he went

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:56.520
[Guest]: vegetable shopping to the old city of Bhopal, and me standing in front of his Vespa scooter.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.680
[Guest]: And my hands would be on the handlebar, and I would see that I had two, three glass bangles,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.520
[Guest]: and I'd come back, and I'd see my hands, and they'd be full of glass bangles. So this was

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.960
[Guest]: a weekly ritual. These are very nice memories. My father was a very deep listener of classical

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:18.200
[Guest]: music, Carnatic music. And as a junior engineer, he already purchased a reel-to-reel tape machine

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:27.760
[Guest]: in the 1960s in Bhopal. It's a very expensive thing to purchase, have. So from a very young

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.360
[Guest]: age, I have a practice of sitting and listening to music continuously for two to three hours.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:42.120
[Guest]: Doesn't mean that I wasn't irritated sometimes, but nobody asked me to do it, but it's just

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:49.640
[Guest]: something that entered me. At that time, BHEL employees, engineers would go to England because

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.680
[Guest]: the connection to England was still very strong, industrial England. So my uncle, who happened

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.280
[Guest]: to be an engineer at BHEL also, so this is also, we must remember that the reason why

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: so many South Indian Brahmins have advanced is because the family connections allowed

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.560
[Guest]: them to develop these kinds of economic ladders between families and for each other. So he

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:17.160
[Guest]: asked my father to come and work there. And I had a very severe illness when I was young,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:24.920
[Guest]: and they thought I would die. So my uncle had gone to Liverpool for training, and he

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:32.320
[Guest]: brought back for me cod liver oil tablets and those tiny little record players for short,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.560
[Guest]: small records, right? And what did he bring back for me? They were the Beatles records

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.040
[Guest]: and they were rainbow colored. So there was a guava tree in my parents' garden, and my

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.640
[Guest]: grandmother had given me a small, tiny bell metal pot for play cooking. And there was

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.280
[Guest]: this little record player, and I would make these little bridges between the trees for

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.840
[Guest]: water and I'd put this thing on, and I would listen to, I think it was Strawberry Fields

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.560
[Guest]: and a couple of other records over and over again and cook. I think when I say I love

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.480
[Guest]: places, when I think of myself and I say I love places, I think it's the idea of making

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:16.120
[Guest]: a place began there and making a place and knowing places like the garden or my grandparents'

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:24.040
[Guest]: house. They're very profound experiences. So Bhopal was really, really also a beautiful

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:32.280
[Guest]: place to know people from all over India because these quarters, these early days of these

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.720
[Guest]: mega industries had people, there's a Maharashtrian auntie and uncle upstairs. There were other

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.560
[Guest]: caste Andhra people working, Telugu speaking people, Punjabi people. And the great thing

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:51.640
[Guest]: that marked my life as a child was that these industries gave leave travel allowance to

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:58.880
[Guest]: their employees. So what many engineers and families did, they rented a bus and then they

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:06.920
[Guest]: would drive from Bhopal to various places. We would stay in gurudwaras. We would have

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.920
[Guest]: langar because obviously there wasn't that much money. In this process, I saw so much

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:22.400
[Guest]: of the Gangetic belt of Rajasthan, Gujarat, all the way to Varanasi. And I think my first

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:30.320
[Guest]: sense that architecture and archeology were going to be deeply profound things for me.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.560
[Guest]: Well I remember, there are like three, four moments that are so crystal clear in my head.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:46.200
[Guest]: One is like when we went to Abu and Girnar and Shatrunjaya, the sense of spaciousness

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.200
[Guest]: and being on top of mountains and these white temples, very, very powerful. And then another

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.040
[Guest]: really big moment was, as I mentioned to you in our conversation, Jaipur and being in Jaipur

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:05.360
[Guest]: and the Jori Bazaar and like the way that the textures of beads and stuff were really

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.680
[Guest]: important to me. But I think the two places that really impacted me were Khajuraho and

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:20.640
[Guest]: Varanasi. Khajuraho, my parents were not the most, I don't think anybody was in those

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.480
[Guest]: days, but my parents did not hover too much over me. And I'm probably not the kind of

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.680
[Guest]: person that people can hover over. And they left me on the plinth of one of the big temples.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.680
[Guest]: I think it was Khandariya Mahadeva or the Lakshmana temple. And you know, even then,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.800
[Guest]: this was the early days when the flights from Delhi to Varanasi had to stop over in Khajuraho.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:51.240
[Guest]: So the triangle that they call, like it was beginning to happen. And I watched lots of

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.960
[Guest]: people looking at the erotic sculpture and looking at all of this. And I just had this

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:04.200
[Guest]: feeling of mere saare room kade ho gaye. I can even remember that moment now, of my hairs

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:12.440
[Guest]: on my arms, just standing up with the energy of this place, this structure. And it's, I

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.520
[Guest]: don't know if I had the sense to say, oh, this is beautiful or not beautiful. I knew

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.320
[Guest]: it was powerful. And not in a scary way, that it was powerful because somebody had designed

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:32.000
[Guest]: it to be intricate and full of stories and put lots of challenging things on it, like

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.920
[Guest]: erotic sculpture. Even then, we all know by that age, this is the thing that you're supposed

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:45.400
[Guest]: to know and not know about. And then the other place that's really important to me is Varanasi

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:53.960
[Guest]: because my mother went into, I think it was the Sankatmochan temple. And the mahant there

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.920
[Guest]: gave her a genda phool mala. And he put it over, he put it on my neck. And my mother

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.680
[Guest]: took me out onto the ghats, maybe it was busy or something. And she said, you stand here.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:08.440
[Guest]: As I mentioned, they weren't really hovery kind of parents. And this cow came there and

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.880
[Guest]: started eating the genda phool on my mala. And I might have been four or five at the

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.120
[Guest]: most at this. And there was no fear inside of me. And then I thought like it's this,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.520
[Guest]: if I look back, and of course, memory is very funny, and I'm not interested in analyzing

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.000
[Guest]: the truth of memory or not. You get what you get, and you live with that, right? So what

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.880
[Guest]: the memory tells me, and even at that moment, the memory that I have of my feeling is that

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.560
[Guest]: this place is so old and expansive, that nothing can hurt me. Not even this cow who's chewing

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: these flowers. And then of course, people started shouting, and then my mother heard

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.360
[Guest]: or something happened. And then she came and something happened. I don't remember the rest.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:01.280
[Guest]: But I remember this moment very deeply. So this is my childhood in India. When I was

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.880
[Guest]: eight, I went to eight and a half, we moved to the United States. I was also a brief period

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.560
[Guest]: in Sikandrabad, where I went to the Kendriya Vidyalaya. I went to school in my grandparents'

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.880
[Guest]: village for a little while, because my father was already itching to go somewhere else where

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:24.320
[Guest]: he could fund his music obsession. He was interested in Carnatic music primarily. And

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.080
[Guest]: the school in my grandparents' village had cow dung on the floor. So every morning we

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:39.120
[Guest]: had to put cow dung on the floors and do a rangoli, mugu as we call it. And then Kendriya

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.920
[Guest]: Vidyalaya was really nice because it was in Pickett or someplace near there. There's many

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.880
[Guest]: Kendriya Vidyalayas now. Now I'm a little hazy. I was little at that moment. But it

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.200
[Guest]: was Sikandrabad and there were still fields in the middle of the city because it hadn't

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.360
[Guest]: grown so much. So you could see rice growing and that really deep green of rice. And it

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.320
[Guest]: was very nice. My entire childhood was filled with Hindi. Hindi, Telugu, of course, very

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.440
[Guest]: beautiful Telugu, but lots of Hindi because my mother and my father watched a hell of

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.480
[Guest]: a lot of Hindi movies. And my father would play people like Talat Mahmood and Soraya.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:24.040
[Guest]: Begum Soraya? I forget her name. It'll come back to me. All these records. Talat Mahmood's

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:35.000
[Guest]: very vivid. KL Saigal. I love KL Saigal. And lots of music from there. So I don't remember

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.680
[Guest]: not having Carnatic music, The Beatles and Hindi film songs very close to me all my life

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.720
[Guest]: when I was growing up. And when I was eight and a half, I moved to the US.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.760
[Amit Varma]: So so fascinating. One of the themes that I sort of love to explore and which I sort

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.880
[Amit Varma]: of will ask you about is the nature of memory, not in the sense you said you don't want to

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.640
[Amit Varma]: talk about, you know, truth and memory and all, but just the nature of memory itself,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.960
[Amit Varma]: because a couple of thoughts. One is that when you're actually living and I'm really

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.040
[Amit Varma]: talking about, in a sense, looking back on how I have sort of lived and how I remember

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.960
[Amit Varma]: things that while living, sometimes you're not mindful. Things happen and you're not

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.840
[Amit Varma]: mindful of them in that moment. But later you remember them and in your memory, you

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.800
[Amit Varma]: fill those things out. And I did this episode I really loved with Anshul Malhotra, who wrote

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.920
[Amit Varma]: that fabulous book on, you know, partition survivors, their memories through the things

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: that they got with them. And one of the things we discussed there was how we now know that

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.600
[Amit Varma]: how memory functions is when you remember something for the first time, you remember

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.600
[Amit Varma]: it, what actually happened. But the next time you remember it, you remember the remembering

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.920
[Amit Varma]: and so on down the line. It's almost like Chinese whispers inside your head, which is

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.120
[Amit Varma]: why, you know, something could happen to say you and your sister at exactly the same time,

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.640
[Amit Varma]: but you could have a completely different memories of it. And that leads me to the sort

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.400
[Amit Varma]: of thought that at one level, it's completely true that we are shaped by what happens to

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.040
[Amit Varma]: us. But it is also true in the other direction, that what we remember of what happens to us

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:13.480
[Amit Varma]: is shaped by who we are. And therefore, the question like all these beautiful details

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.760
[Amit Varma]: you came up with, the teak door, playing in the granaries, the tiny bell metal pot, all

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.620
[Amit Varma]: of these details, you know, and these are the things you remember, any of your siblings

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.200
[Amit Varma]: or cousins growing up with you would perhaps remember different things. And they are different

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.880
[Amit Varma]: people. And you've kind of hinted at being like a rebellious kid who would, you know,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.280
[Amit Varma]: you can't hover over Annapurna is the kind of sense that I already get from that. And

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.320
[Amit Varma]: it's not just that you are shaped by everything happening to you, because it's also happening

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.880
[Amit Varma]: to others. So where do you begin to get a sense of the person you become? If that is

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.480
[Amit Varma]: something you can possibly nail down, like, you know, where do you begin to get the sense

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.080
[Amit Varma]: of I like these things? I like this kind of art. Oh, I like architecture and no one else

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.800
[Amit Varma]: does. And by the way, anyone listening to the episode so far would find you wonderfully

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.040
[Amit Varma]: sanskari because your two seminal moments as you describe them involve a temple and

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.320
[Guest]: a cow. So well done with that. That's why I always think about, as I mentioned to you

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.440
[Guest]: earlier, like, how does it feel to be on the other side of this and this side of this?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:26.400
[Guest]: It's always there. I'll tell you a story and I'll answer that question. So I love my grandmother.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.920
[Guest]: She's dead now. Of course, I'm 55. So she has to be dead. She's not going to be alive.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.720
[Guest]: So they make pickles in Andhra and pickles get old. And every year you make pickles.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.920
[Guest]: And then they cook lots of rice because in a household full of this many people, you

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.280
[Guest]: have to cook a large quantity of rice. So leftover rice is kept in a terracotta pot

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:53.320
[Guest]: outside the door because you can't touch it after you have, when you are cooking because

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:00.340
[Guest]: you have to be madi. Madi is this idea that you're ritually pure for cooking and for puja.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:07.120
[Guest]: But people would come and she was in her own way attentive to their hunger. But in a way

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:14.160
[Guest]: that I find taught me so many things about cruelty. So they would take the rice out of

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:21.160
[Guest]: that pot. These are people who worked in the fields or around the house. And there would

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:27.320
[Guest]: be that old pickle. And she would have a jar of that old pickle. She would pull out the

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.520
[Guest]: old pickle. They would stand outside of the kitchen in the open area. And I happened to

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.160
[Guest]: be standing somewhere between my grandmother and this person I loved very much. I don't

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:44.080
[Guest]: remember who that person is. It was a man. And she pulled out the old pickle, not this

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: year's pickle, but the previous year. And she flicked it into his plate because she

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.880
[Guest]: can't touch his plate, that rice him. And at that moment, I remember very, very deeply

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:06.160
[Guest]: thinking about, am I him? Am I her? Who am I? Or am I that pickle? I don't think I invented

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:12.920
[Guest]: that way of looking. I think this comes back to what your question or your comment. I think

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:19.080
[Guest]: some things are given to you and you don't have choices. So I am a person who was given

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:26.440
[Guest]: this facility to notice things from a very early age. I don't remember never being a

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:35.040
[Guest]: person who didn't notice. And I notice people's emotions and feelings, things they're doing.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.600
[Guest]: Not everything. I just notice, notice, notice. So if you're noticing all the time, even if

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:47.800
[Guest]: you don't notice everything, it's too much. There's no respite from noticing. So I've

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.440
[Guest]: always been the person that's taken breaks. And when I take a break, what do I do? I think

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:00.560
[Guest]: about what I noticed. So there is this capacity that developed in, I think, people who are

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:08.600
[Guest]: like us. That first time is the remembering, but the reflection on that process becomes

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.840
[Guest]: that. Now, this is not the experience of many people who've not grown up in large families

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:20.000
[Guest]: like I have, but I grew up in a very large family and we're a family that likes to remember

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.240
[Guest]: for each other. So if you have a memory and you share it with them and they not only remember,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.680
[Guest]: so your memory's confirmed when you have that many people who are with you because you're

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:39.800
[Guest]: not the individual that's the capitalist individual or whatever you want to call it, like neoliberal

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:47.280
[Guest]: individual or whatever, but you are this individual of a certain moment of joint family modernity.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:55.880
[Guest]: And they remember. So for example, my Masi, who I adore and is now 70, told me the other

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:06.680
[Guest]: day that one day she saw this blue thing in the doorway in my grandparents' house, and

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.520
[Guest]: it was coming from the well where clothes were washed and baths were taken. And what

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.480
[Guest]: was it? I was maybe three. I had taken all of that robin blue and applied it all over

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.480
[Guest]: myself, every part that I could reach. Another time, we have this tradition of painting yellow

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:31.300
[Guest]: and turmeric. It should be turmeric and kumkum, but it's yellow and red paint. I was so fascinated

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.880
[Guest]: by the yellow paint that I applied it all over myself as a little person. I am to this

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:44.880
[Guest]: day deeply, deeply, deeply interested in color. So when somebody criticizes me or challenges

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:53.380
[Guest]: me about something, I have to say, okay, I was formed this way because of this background,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.200
[Guest]: but I also know that some things just were there. Like for example, there's color exoticism

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: about India, constant fetishization of India through its colors. But as a child, I don't

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.800
[Guest]: remember a moment not being particularly interested in the density of looking at a color, the

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.800
[Guest]: blackness of kajal, which we made at home, or the depth of the blue in that packet, or

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.120
[Guest]: the yellow color that it's being painted. My grandmother also pounded haldi sticks with

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: lime to make it into kumkum in my grandparents' house, mortar and pestle. So the transformation

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.480
[Guest]: of the yellow haldi and the white of the lime into this kumkum, there's this constant sort

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.720
[Guest]: of thing. So memory, I think, works differently for people who come from different time periods

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:51.040
[Guest]: and different social experiences. So in my understanding, memory for me is inseparable

00:34:51.040 --> 00:35:01.440
[Guest]: from having a huge number of people reiterate a memory, an event, a set of emotions, not

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:09.320
[Guest]: the same emotions as mine, but some emotions. And in a way, sometimes I think about this,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:16.480
[Guest]: I know I'm an individual and I'm such a very much a person in myself, but there are moments

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:22.000
[Guest]: where you feel like, where do I begin in this story? And where do they begin? Where do they

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.880
[Guest]: end? And I don't have any anxiety about that. I think that subjectivity doesn't always need

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:33.480
[Guest]: to be in a subject solely. It can be dispersed and crystallized at a certain moment when

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:39.200
[Guest]: a story is told, when an event is recounted. Oh, Poorna is always like this. I'm called

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.640
[Guest]: Poorna Bhavani at home. So she's always like this. She loves color and whatever. So these

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.160
[Guest]: are things I think could also work where you could have the remembering the first time

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: you remember, then the remembering the remembering, but then the other people around you. And

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.400
[Guest]: this is the beauty of having some sort of continuity in social structures. And it could

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:07.200
[Guest]: also be the terror of them. Maybe people need to forget many things in order to evolve better.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.840
[Guest]: And I have chosen to forget things too. I have chosen to rebel. So in a society, in

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:19.840
[Guest]: a world in which forgetting was instrumental and remembering was both instrumental and

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: affectionate or a sense of insult, this is all there. But this is the world I was given.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
[Guest]: So I have to learn to be fond of it and to have some distance from it and all those sort

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.320
[Guest]: of things, right? So I think that it can also be the first time it happens, then the remembering

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:43.320
[Guest]: of that remembering, and then also this understanding that there's a lot of people around you at

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.200
[Guest]: certain moments who was around you to remember. I had a very similar experience at grad school

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.280
[Guest]: in Columbia. When my beloved friends from grad school, we all sit together, there's

00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:02.400
[Guest]: some crystal clear memories for us. And we keep ourselves attached to the freshness of

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.560
[Guest]: that moment of coming to Columbia University as graduate students by recounting certain

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:17.440
[Guest]: stories like my best friend, Deborah Diamond, and I were in Sanskrit class together. And

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:23.880
[Guest]: we happened to be joking about Sanskrit, making Sanskrit jokes. It's part of being a geek.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.520
[Guest]: And she would say things like, bhoga, bhoga, bhoga, like when you were really into eating

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.640
[Guest]: whatever you're eating or whatever. Or we would have these funny ideas of, we were reading

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.160
[Guest]: some Puranic stuff and of having swimming toys where you would have Ananta as the floating

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.640
[Guest]: swimming toy. And then you would be, Lakshmi or Vishnu floating on it and he would be in

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.640
[Guest]: the middle of a swimming pool. All these like weird jokes, which probably aren't funny to

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.640
[Guest]: anybody else. But the memory of us making these jokes in front of, I think it was near

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:07.840
[Guest]: the Frick Library and Museum in Manhattan. It's so, hmm. I think, I think things work

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840
[Guest]: like that sometimes.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And one of the memories from what you're recounting, you know, you speak about forgetting

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.480
[Amit Varma]: is being instrumental sometimes and important sometimes and you need to do it and you speak

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.040
[Amit Varma]: about remembering being instrumental and also, you know, affectionate, like, you know, your

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.240
[Amit Varma]: college memories, for example. And it's, and this interesting memory of the pickle being

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.720
[Amit Varma]: flicked across, right? Seems to me to be in the category of the sort of memory you maybe

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.840
[Amit Varma]: want to forget, but you remember it is clearly vivid for you. I mean, you notice stuff, right?

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.120
[Amit Varma]: But the next step after noticing is at some point in time, you look back and you begin

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:52.040
[Amit Varma]: to make sense of it. Like initially, I get that instinctive revulsion that someone you

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.640
[Amit Varma]: love is being treated like this by someone you love. And you may not at that point, if

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.560
[Amit Varma]: you're a little child understand any more of it than that. But later on, you kind of,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.560
[Amit Varma]: I suppose, begin to sort it out. I mean, your grandfather having broad shoulders in the

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.000
[Amit Varma]: way that he did is a formulation that would have come upon you later. So tell me a little

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.720
[Amit Varma]: bit about how beyond this whole visceral taking in of everything that is happening and the

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:23.520
[Amit Varma]: instinctive responses to that, you know, how do you start thinking about this stuff? How

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.600
[Amit Varma]: do you start making sense of the world? Like, one of the dangers for many young people is

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.160
[Amit Varma]: that they find a particular way to look at the world, whether it's an ideology or points

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:39.320
[Amit Varma]: of views or whatever. And all of these simple narratives or ways of looking at the world

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.760
[Amit Varma]: can be so seductive that you just give in to them. And because, you know, it just works.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.680
[Amit Varma]: They're also instrumental in a sense. Give me a sense of, you know, what was your journey

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:57.240
[Amit Varma]: like in that sense? Like, what were your years in America like? You know, is there a moment

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:02.200
[Amit Varma]: where the stark difference between where you are and where you came from kind of makes

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.960
[Amit Varma]: you think and starts, you know, starts shaping your memories even?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:12.680
[Guest]: Well, you know, I actually think that children have a deep sense of justice. Deep, deep sense

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:18.040
[Guest]: of justice. And if you're growing up in a family like I did, other children will develop

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.840
[Guest]: it in a different way. You're constantly thinking about, for example, I'm fair-skinned. There

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.360
[Guest]: are many fair-skinned people in my family. I'm sure there was some deep cross-pollination

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:37.040
[Guest]: that they have conveniently forgotten, instrumentally forgotten. Much fairer people than I. And

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: my grandmother favored me for that. Also, I was the second oldest girl. I was always

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: like smiling and happy kind of child, with them at least. And so, in her kitchen, she

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.040
[Guest]: would set out all the plates. Like, we were before, by 1975, there were 15 of us already

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:03.680
[Guest]: born. So, any meal would have a minimum of 15 people that she would have to cook for

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:11.520
[Guest]: and serve. So, you don't have to go elsewhere to understand justice, inequality, the dynamics

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:25.240
[Guest]: of human preference, and uncivility, unkindness. So, these 15 plates would be here. There are

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.840
[Guest]: many boys. She also had some favorites in her boys. There's no way you can love 15 people

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:40.160
[Guest]: all the same. That's not possible. So, she made this unbelievably delicious coconut chutney,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.280
[Guest]: freshly ground in the mortar and pestle. Those coconuts, because there's so many people,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.640
[Guest]: the coconuts were cracked by somebody else. They were chipped into smaller pieces. They

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.080
[Guest]: were put into the mortar and pestle, and then she would grind it with tamarind and all the

00:41:53.080 --> 00:42:00.360
[Guest]: delicious spices. We all loved it. So, she would come by bent. She wouldn't haunch it.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:08.260
[Guest]: She would bend, and she would serve each of us in the plate. Definitely, I got more. Definitely,

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:14.600
[Guest]: some of the boys that she liked got more. Then there were the girls, the other girls,

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:20.020
[Guest]: who were not as fair-skinned, also not as interested in her, didn't get. Now, whether

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:25.800
[Guest]: they were uninterested because she didn't extend herself to them, or that in 15 people

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:37.080
[Guest]: it's not possible for everybody to be, I began to understand that I got a lot of favor because

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.360
[Guest]: of, at a very young age, you don't need to articulate it. I feel like you don't need

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:47.840
[Guest]: to articulate it. There's some sense of justice that comes around from the fight. Why did

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.480
[Guest]: you give so much to someone else? That fight is there. Or I would tell my male cousins,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.640
[Guest]: so they would drag me. They wouldn't even put their damn coffee cup back in the sink.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.220
[Guest]: I would say, I would feel that resentment, boiling resentment, like why do they get to

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:08.720
[Guest]: leave their cups there? This is at their house, not at my grandparents' house. You couldn't

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.880
[Guest]: do that there, but you would, this sort of thing. In my case, I violated a lot of the

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:21.000
[Guest]: boundaries they set. And I think children do this all the time. I would touch my grandmother

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.440
[Guest]: when she was muddy. I would go hug all the people that I loved and loved and loved and

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:33.440
[Guest]: hugged them. I would use really the worst curse words against my grandfather when he

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.240
[Guest]: took me around on his shoulders in the village, and he never stopped me. So if I look back,

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:46.080
[Guest]: I also understand this, this way, that yes, it's a deeply unfair world, but challenging

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.040
[Guest]: it doesn't mean that the people that are being challenged will necessarily react violently

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:57.560
[Guest]: to a child. Now, they might have reacted differently to another kind of person, but to a child,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:11.320
[Guest]: I feel like children have an enormous capacity to challenge systems because they're just so unmade still.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:19.600
[Guest]: There's so much in the process. So gradually, my grandmother shed most of these things over

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.280
[Guest]: her own lifetime. My grandfather, of course, operated in a different way. Many things took

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.140
[Guest]: decades to change. But you know, it's not like I didn't suffer. These families are really

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.320
[Guest]: hard because there's also sexual abuse. There's also having you sit outside every time you

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.800
[Guest]: have period. Your first four days, you have your periods. There's enormous labor extracted

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.880
[Guest]: both from the boys and the girls in different shades because these are huge families. But

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:51.880
[Guest]: it depends also a lot. In my case, I've thought about all these things. I never feel victimized

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:58.760
[Guest]: by any of these experiences. Now I think of it in one way, but over my lifetime, they've

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:06.560
[Guest]: just felt like things that make me cry sometimes, but things that also teach me much more than

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:13.480
[Guest]: they make me cry. So I'll tell you about America in a second. I didn't see the system in America

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:24.520
[Guest]: being vastly fair. But today, I think about all that has happened as material, like clay

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:31.280
[Guest]: material. You have material to work with. Every day, it's an aesthetic commitment to

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.120
[Guest]: work with that material. It is an ethical commitment to work with that material, and

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:41.920
[Guest]: that material accrues more material. This is more material. I'm going to reflect on

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.600
[Guest]: this a lot when I leave this studio. We have some sort of responsibility to make ourselves

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:57.040
[Guest]: agentive in relationship to the material that life gives you. We become agentive in one

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:07.040
[Guest]: way or another, no matter where we come from. Now, there are always socially, politically

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:19.360
[Guest]: made ways to rob you of that sense of agency, and that's a responsibility, collective responsibility,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:30.360
[Guest]: that we have to each other to foster a sense of... Agency doesn't mean rights, rights,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:39.760
[Guest]: it doesn't mean responsibilities. It's a sense of consciousness. It's a sense of capacity.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:47.800
[Guest]: When I moved to the United States, it was in 1975. The civil rights movement had ended.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:54.880
[Guest]: The hippie movement, the 1968 struggle at Berkeley had also finished. The Vietnam War

00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:02.560
[Guest]: had come to an end. Richard Nixon had resigned. Gerald Ford had become the interim prime president

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:11.600
[Guest]: of the United States. I arrived there on, I think somewhere close to January 26th, maybe

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:20.160
[Guest]: January 26th, which is odd, 1975. I remember coming from the airport, JFK, to New Jersey,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.680
[Guest]: to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where my parents were living at that time. Elizabeth, New Jersey

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.240
[Guest]: is an industrial town. The Anheuser-Busch factory is there, and many other, it's a port,

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:36.600
[Guest]: so it's stinky. So, on the way, you see a lot of lights on the highway, and I would

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:41.560
[Guest]: see these signs like, Washa Rama, something Rama. And I thought, oh, this place won't

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:50.720
[Guest]: be so bad, they like our god. And this is, the Rama of my childhood is a storybook Rama.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:57.120
[Guest]: He's not so much a god Rama, he's a storybook Rama. He's the stories that we read in Amar

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.640
[Guest]: Chitra Katha, or Chandamama, or my parents. My parents weren't very into storytelling,

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.640
[Guest]: but somebody would be telling some story. Or there would be in films, that was primarily

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: where I, N. T. Ramana acting as Rama. So, I thought, this place won't be so bad. I did

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.920
[Guest]: not want to leave my grandparents. I adored my life in India, loved it. And we go there,

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:24.800
[Guest]: and I said, okay, this won't be so bad. Later on, like 30 years later, my friend in graduate

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:31.240
[Guest]: school told me, that's because Panorama was so interesting and new then, that's why people

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:38.520
[Guest]: started naming, oh, Rama, to all these non-cinematic things. Like the way that.com became the

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: name after a point for so many. And I really think that, and then we went to school, the

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.920
[Guest]: next day, my father put me in school, and they changed my name from Annapurna to Anna,

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.920
[Guest]: because those were the years of assimilation. And they were not being unkind. This was the

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:01.680
[Guest]: way they thought they were being gracious. My father, we would go to the city regularly,

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.840
[Guest]: because you have to remember, these were the years when the great concerts were happening

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.040
[Guest]: at Carnegie Hall with M. S. Subbalakshmi, or whoever, all these great people are coming.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.000
[Guest]: So we would drive from New Jersey and go. And if you park, you have to park on the street

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.120
[Guest]: there. And this was the deep, bad years of New York City, when it was crime-ridden and

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:27.480
[Guest]: people were scared of the city and lots of drugs and whatnot. And he would see an African-American

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:33.560
[Guest]: man walking, and he would park the car somewhere else. And I'm sitting in the backseat looking

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.080
[Guest]: at all this happening, I'm nine years old, and I'm thinking, he doesn't look that different

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:46.400
[Guest]: from us in terms of skin color. And why is Nana doing this? Like, Dad was fair-skinned,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:52.120
[Guest]: but not in any way that was so hugely different from many African-American people, who are

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:57.680
[Guest]: actually at least 33%, according to statistics, the last time I read them, were of European

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:05.680
[Guest]: origin descent. So also, if you grow up, because anyway, I was an only child when I went there,

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.800
[Guest]: my company was the radio. And I'm very grateful to be on a podcast, because I love, I think

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:19.200
[Guest]: my love of listening comes from being such a radio person. I listened to the great music

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: of American soul, right? Like soul music, like people like Aretha Franklin and the guy

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.880
[Guest]: who sang Sitting in the Morning Sun, Marvin Gaye, sitting in the... Yeah, anyway, all

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:45.400
[Guest]: these beautiful, beautiful music, Donna Summer, the disco period, and all these people. And

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.680
[Guest]: I didn't really identify so much with white culture. Now, I'm not saying anything against

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:58.120
[Guest]: it or for it, I just didn't identify with it. Because you have to remember, in my school

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:04.480
[Guest]: in New Jersey, no kid had more than, nobody wore anything but jeans and a t-shirt to school.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:10.640
[Guest]: We might have had three t-shirts and two pairs of jeans, one running shoe and one regular

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:17.960
[Guest]: shoe. Everybody wore sneakers. My best friend was Gina Conti, whose father was a pizza maker,

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:27.520
[Guest]: Italian descent pizza maker. I really think that the class divisions that exacerbated

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:34.880
[Guest]: the differences across race that we experienced more fully, and it's not that they didn't

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:40.160
[Guest]: exist then, but there was this little bit of flatness of social stratification. The

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:48.120
[Guest]: stratification wasn't so big in my school because it was largely poor and working class.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.040
[Guest]: And not poor, I wouldn't say working class. I wouldn't call that poor. I would call it

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.360
[Guest]: working class. And then when we moved from there to Edison, New Jersey, which is now

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.480
[Guest]: a little bit climbing up the NRI ladder, then things changed again. There, my close friends

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:13.840
[Guest]: were a girl from a Korean migrant family and a Jewish girl, who was very, very Sherry Cantor

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:24.640
[Guest]: in Yeonhae Park. Very nice people. I didn't have any friends in school who were South

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.080
[Guest]: Asian, so I had to make friends. Not that I would have necessarily not made friends

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.920
[Guest]: with these people, because I'm generally a person who flows towards what I like. It doesn't

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.600
[Guest]: matter what it is. I think these things really taught me a lot. So if I imagine, like I have

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.680
[Guest]: one grandfather who's a Gandhian and he wove kadhi all his life. My grandfather of a certain

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:52.320
[Guest]: kind of social praxis of doing something at home to satisfy certain ancestral responsibilities

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.920
[Guest]: and familial responsibilities, and then the way that he was outside. I also have another

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:04.640
[Guest]: very rich, rich, rich family who was Brahmo partly near Rajahmundry. And then you come

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.000
[Guest]: to the United States and my father funded our arrival in the United States. He's a Brahmin,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.440
[Guest]: working as a butcher at the nighttime as an engineer during the daytime and as a butcher

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:22.960
[Guest]: in Pathmark or some large grocery chain at supermarket, A&P, I don't remember which one.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.360
[Guest]: And I was very aware of all these things, not in any ideological way, but just aware

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:35.320
[Guest]: that this is the material of my life. And my father didn't have, wasn't anti-beef. He

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:41.360
[Guest]: took me to Burger King and had me eat a burger and I couldn't eat it because it was too rich

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:47.160
[Guest]: for me and I couldn't stomach it. I'm not used, I wasn't used to it. But I had Subways

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.320
[Guest]: sometimes which were heroes, like they're called Sub, Submarine Sandwiches are heroes

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:58.480
[Guest]: and they had meat in it. All these things are like, what I find I think is the deepest

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:07.240
[Guest]: problem is there's a kind of dogma to how you're something now. Like if you are vegetarian,

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:14.600
[Guest]: you must be dogmatic about your vegetarianism. A friend of mine's grandmother, another Brahmin

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:19.920
[Guest]: family said, by the time you're dead, said to her, by the time you're dead, you'll have

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:27.720
[Guest]: eaten at least the elephant head size of non-vegetarian because every grain in India will have some

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.720
[Guest]: bug in it.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's a great way of putting it.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:38.480
[Guest]: It's a great way of putting it because if you look at a rice grain, we all are consuming

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:46.200
[Guest]: this. But it's an orientation of how you structure your cooking and your eating and then it can

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:52.040
[Guest]: be just that. It can be, for example, sometimes I'm really troubled by industrialized chicken

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.760
[Guest]: farming. I just can't handle it. So I stop buying those eggs. I eat eggs from another

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:03.120
[Guest]: source. So this is, I think, answering the question in some way that you've asked, which

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:09.320
[Guest]: is I think what I learned from that time in America, and it was also you have to remember

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:16.800
[Guest]: the hippie culture had its, America lost the Vietnam War and it had a terrible moral, terribly

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:27.280
[Guest]: beautiful moral self-examination over the Vietnam War. I was witness to that. I understood

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:35.760
[Guest]: that a society could collectively do something really wrong and also could collectively negotiate

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.440
[Guest]: the wrongdoing to understand something about it. I still don't agree with the way the major

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:50.200
[Guest]: American media and pop culture and whatnot portray its relationships either to internal

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:56.320
[Guest]: communities or to other countries, but I did see this. I did see the end of the Watergate

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:01.320
[Guest]: and I did see this. And I wrote to Gerald Ford when I was nine saying I'd like to thank

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.800
[Guest]: you from school. I wrote to it, but actually I wrote to Jimmy Carter saying, may I come

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.440
[Guest]: and work for your campaign? Because he was a peanut farmer and I was quite charmed by

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.880
[Guest]: it. Farming felt familiar, of course. And so there was these, I think there are things

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:20.360
[Guest]: like that. I think there, I feel like one of the big rich things of my life is my parents

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:31.600
[Guest]: were so neglectful that no one ever told me, think this, think that, do this, do that.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.440
[Guest]: And if my grandmother said, don't touch me, I'm muddy now. And I touched her, she'd just

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:45.280
[Guest]: go take another bath. There was no severe retribution from them. I faced a lot of, I

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:51.000
[Guest]: don't want to talk about it too much because it's boring, but abuse from my parents. So

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.760
[Guest]: I understood that you just have to be aware to your own life and have it available to

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.920
[Guest]: you. I think that's really important. It's your life, not yours only. It's the life that

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:08.440
[Guest]: the universe has given you and you have to be aware and present to it. It's giving you

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.360
[Guest]: that same thing. You don't need to go have 20 million new experiences to learn. Every

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:22.240
[Guest]: time I reflect on somebody talking to me, making that eye to me, oh, you're not ordering

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:30.840
[Guest]: anything non-vegetarian. You're ticking off the choice vegetarian when you have to select.

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.480
[Guest]: Sometimes I get that reaction and I'm sure I'm not the only one. And I think to myself,

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:41.240
[Guest]: well, you'll find out more about me. I won't give them, I won't give the situation the

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:52.440
[Guest]: power to limit the horizons of how I'm to be known by someone. But that's something

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:59.320
[Guest]: that I think if you've lived in a very diverse way that I feel like I have, you understand

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:05.480
[Guest]: something like that. Maybe that's what I've understood.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.200
[Amit Varma]: So before I go on to my next question, a couple of observations. And the first one is a disagreement

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and the possible reason for this disagreement might be that you're a good person and I'm

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.480
[Amit Varma]: not such a good person. But I disagreed with what you said about kids having an inherent

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:25.160
[Amit Varma]: sense of fairness. Like I think of kids much more in a lot of the fly's way. And you know,

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.320
[Amit Varma]: you look at the child armies of East Timor or Sierra Leone and whatever, what's going

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:35.120
[Amit Varma]: on and what has happened in West Africa. You look at how kids can often act in incredibly

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.800
[Amit Varma]: brutal ways that are inexplicable. Like even in the Nirbhaya rape case, for example, the

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:45.800
[Amit Varma]: most brutal of them was really a kid. And Robert Sapolsky, the biologist has written

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:51.160
[Amit Varma]: eloquently about how especially with boys, the brain stops, completes its development,

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:56.840
[Amit Varma]: not stops, completes its development when men reach 25. Because that's when they get

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.860
[Amit Varma]: fully socialized, which is why there is so much violence among, you know, teenagers and

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:06.120
[Amit Varma]: young men and all of that. But anyway, that aside, I'd like to say something to that.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:13.240
[Guest]: Please do. Yeah. I do believe children have an inherent sense of justice. They also are

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:21.160
[Guest]: deeply unjust. They are deeply unjust. So they understand what is, it's unjust, but

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.720
[Guest]: they do it anyway. So they're sociopaths. No, I don't know about that. My thinking isn't

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:31.000
[Guest]: so far along. But I do know that in my own life and what I've observed, children can

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:41.700
[Guest]: be very unjust and that puts an enormous collective responsibility on having life, not telling

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:49.360
[Guest]: how to be just, but showing how to be just. So may I give you some examples? Please, please.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:55.720
[Guest]: So my uncle who brought me the record player and the cod liver oil tablets, he also bought

00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.960
[Guest]: me a doll from England and it was white. And I took it with me and it was a tall doll.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:10.360
[Guest]: And I took it with me to my village. My grandfather saw this doll. Now, if you say, is my grandfather

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.280
[Guest]: like a deep anti-colonial person or something? No. But he looked at that doll and he said

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.960
[Guest]: to me, understand that I'm maybe four at this point, maybe three or four. He said to me,

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.800
[Guest]: looking at this doll every day will make you think poorly of yourself. Something like that

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.200
[Guest]: will make you self-conscious because it was a white doll. And he threw it into the attic.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:39.520
[Guest]: I'm sure it's still there in that building. The way that he thought about money, he earned

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:45.720
[Guest]: a lot of money, but he gave away vast amounts of money to the point that it was penury at

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.160
[Guest]: the end of his life. Though two districts shut down when he died for two days, there

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.920
[Guest]: was no money left. So everything had to be sold because he gave away money to so many

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:03.560
[Guest]: people. And he wanted to, he was fascinated by modernity. So he gave his daughter's education,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.120
[Guest]: he bought a Chevrolet, he swam, he had these kinds of things. He also finally decided to

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.160
[Guest]: fight in elections. And this was not a smart thing for him to do. There was no way to win

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.400
[Guest]: elections because the tides were turning of the demographics of who could win elections

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:30.480
[Guest]: in that area. And I think back and I think like, I watched people like this. When my

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:38.480
[Guest]: mother was deeply abusive towards me, my mother and my father, my aunt stepped in and took

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.680
[Guest]: over the role of being a mother. At school, you would observe, like I went to a Carmelite

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.720
[Guest]: convent in Bhopal, and Carmelites can be very stern and they have a lot of physical punishment,

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:56.520
[Guest]: like scales on the knuckles and all these kinds of things. I think children in that

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.280
[Guest]: space were deeply aware. They were mean, but they were also aware that this was unfair.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.600
[Guest]: Now how does this all get settled into something like being a good person and something like

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.240
[Guest]: being a sociopath? I think it takes a lot more than that. But I do think children have

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:17.920
[Guest]: both a sense of justice as well, a fairness, and a sense of cruelty. Both exist. They're

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:24.320
[Guest]: fully human people. They have all their emotions. I think that it does take a lot, like when

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.080
[Guest]: I was in New Jersey, my school, Mrs. Mayofsky, who was just the most delightful, wonderful

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.600
[Guest]: teacher in third grade, we had cooking class. We made cook two days a week in class, and

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.640
[Guest]: we fed each other. This was just simple things. Made popcorn and boiled something, I don't

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:47.560
[Guest]: know, something. I was always good at school, so I finished school, finished my work in

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:53.200
[Guest]: class, and I would help others. So she told me a couple of times to sit back, but then

01:02:53.200 --> 01:03:00.280
[Guest]: she put it in my report card that Annapurna is very smart, and she works hard, but she

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.920
[Guest]: should learn to not help other people and sit in her chair when her work is done. And

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.920
[Guest]: I feel like these are really beautiful things, what she taught about me, that don't make

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:17.360
[Guest]: people dependent on you. It took me decades to learn that fully. Decades. I don't talk

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:24.680
[Guest]: nearly the way I used to talk before. I've found real plenitude in silence. But in those

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.360
[Guest]: years, I was like an electrical plug that could plug into many different sockets. And

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.680
[Guest]: I think these things, there's a responsibility. People like those children, child soldiers,

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:45.000
[Guest]: don't become cruel just like that. And it's just because they're children doesn't mean

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.640
[Guest]: that they don't have that cup. That's why we have to be so good to children. We have

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.960
[Guest]: an enormous responsibility to be good to them. Not good like pampering them with silly chocolates

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:04.680
[Guest]: and games and stuff, but take their moral, emotional, sensual, aesthetic, intellectual

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:17.560
[Guest]: needs seriously. Commit to them. Otherwise, you have delinquents. You have sad, depressed

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:27.320
[Guest]: people. And again, these things can also be biological. Some things just come. My father

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:33.000
[Guest]: is like a totally bad person. I know that. I'm not sure I'm supposed to say stuff like

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.480
[Guest]: that in a podcast, but everything that we know about him from all our families is that

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:49.200
[Guest]: he was very, very, he had tremendous capacity for cruelty in a family that doesn't have

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:57.240
[Guest]: that kind of thing. But he also had some really beautiful qualities. Once I asked a friend

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.880
[Guest]: of mine who loves to listen to music, classical music, someone I knew, not a friend, someone

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:10.320
[Guest]: I knew well at one point, how is it that people who listen to such beautiful music can be

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:23.840
[Guest]: so cruel? And this was a reflection on my thinking about him, both him and my father.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:31.080
[Guest]: I think I've read enough of meditations in novels and things about cruelty that sometimes

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:39.280
[Guest]: children are so beautiful. And for men, sometimes women are so, I don't know. People choose

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.560
[Guest]: to allow themselves to be provoked by certain things for good and for worse. Sometimes they

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.880
[Guest]: also have no choice about what provokes them. But then once you're provoked, you have a

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.160
[Guest]: responsibility to reflect on that provocation. How are you going to be managed? Are you going

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:03.520
[Guest]: to go and like, you feel really, really vulnerable. You feel disempowered. How are you going to

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:11.040
[Guest]: handle this situation? I remember when I was 10, my mother hadn't had my sister yet. And

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:17.560
[Guest]: there was a girl in my apartment complex in Edison, New Jersey. And I had gossiped about

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:24.960
[Guest]: her to other children. And her mother called me to their house, working class woman, I

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.400
[Guest]: think a single mother. And she said, you shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have spoken

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:37.240
[Guest]: about her like that to other people. You made her sad. You hurt her. I cannot believe what

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:44.400
[Guest]: a beautiful thing she did for me. There was another girl and her mother was also a single

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.560
[Guest]: mother. This is another experience I really thank America for, is the diversity of people

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:56.960
[Guest]: that I encountered there. Same thing I thank India for, just a different way. And my mother

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:07.040
[Guest]: was very hard on me. But Andrea, this woman, she was a single mother young. She was a very

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.400
[Guest]: nice mother to her daughter who was younger than me. And she happened to be reading Khalil

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:21.920
[Guest]: Gibran, a passage about children and them being arrows you shoot into the air. And she

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.800
[Guest]: gave me that. I borrowed the book from her and I read it to my mother. My mother was

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:33.960
[Guest]: so angry with me. I don't remember my mother being angry with nearly the same weight as

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:43.080
[Guest]: I remember Andrea giving me this book, Khalil Gibran, and introducing me to a person who

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:56.160
[Guest]: reflects on such things. Oh, adults do this. Adults have thoughts about what is, they think

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:01.280
[Guest]: about having choices about what kind of parent to be. So I think it's very, very important

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:11.240
[Guest]: to take children's inner lives, social lives, intellectual lives, very, very seriously.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.840
[Amit Varma]: So let's deviate from this so far sort of linear narrative of your life for a moment

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:22.080
[Amit Varma]: and I'll digress and just ask a question that comes to mind. One, I agree with you. I think

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.560
[Amit Varma]: we're all as human beings hardwired for all kinds of different contradictory things. We

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.560
[Amit Varma]: are wired for empathy. We are also wired in a sense for selfishness and the cruelty that

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.800
[Amit Varma]: it leads to. And you know, I love Steven Pinker's quote on this, where he says, nature gives

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.880
[Amit Varma]: you knobs, nurture turns them. And perhaps, you know, someone like you might have a bigger

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.640
[Amit Varma]: empathy knob, and you know, you just need to turn it a little and some people have a

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.320
[Amit Varma]: much smaller knob and so on. And Pinker in his book, The Better Angels of Our Nature

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:55.800
[Amit Varma]: also makes a point about the importance of literature. Like you spoke about, you used

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.040
[Amit Varma]: an interesting phrase where you said, it is our responsibility to reflect. And now I'm

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.920
[Amit Varma]: thinking how do most people even get the tools to be reflective? And one way of doing so,

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:11.800
[Amit Varma]: which is Pinker's point, is that every time you read a novel, you enter someone else's

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.760
[Amit Varma]: head. You know, you are given one life to live, which is the one you're born into. But

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.640
[Amit Varma]: you live many lives when you read books, when you enter the lives of others, as it were.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And that can kind of build empathy that can build a sort of both a terror and an ability

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.320
[Amit Varma]: to sort of step back and, you know, look at the world. Now, on the one hand, you just

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.240
[Amit Varma]: spoke about how, how can someone who listens to such grand music be such a monster? And

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.340
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure many monsters listen to grand music. But is do you feel that there is something

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:47.680
[Amit Varma]: to that, that the appreciation for art, like especially in India, I think anyone who appreciates

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.880
[Amit Varma]: in a mindful way, our art or our cuisine or anything, even the way we dress is less likely

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:01.700
[Amit Varma]: to be bigoted because you would obviously understand that it comes from everywhere.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:12.420
[Guest]: So I would like to say that this is what I mean when I say spaces to construct spaces

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:21.380
[Guest]: to reflect for children. But I think we need to continuously do this all our lives, right?

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:32.120
[Guest]: So for me, art, all of life is a space to reflect. One facet of like post-Renaissance,

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:45.100
[Guest]: post-Enlightenment ideological formation of human beings is to say that literature is

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.180
[Guest]: the highest art, because as I mentioned the other day that Norman Rush had said that,

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:56.780
[Guest]: you know, after the Bible, it's the novel, that literature is the highest art. But I

01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:06.200
[Guest]: think all different ways, spaces, all different moments, all different things that cause you

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:19.420
[Guest]: to stop and reflect and are designed to make people stop and reflect are important. So

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:25.900
[Guest]: when I was younger, I don't feel I'm being linear. For me, all time is always unfolding

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:36.800
[Guest]: on each other, right? So this movie called Mamta came out, and it has two or three beautiful

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:46.300
[Guest]: songs in it. And one of them is Rahe Na Rahe Hum, or Rehte Te Kabhi, I think Rehte Te Kabhi,

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:54.100
[Guest]: Is Kooje Mein Angaaron Ki Tarha. It's a beautiful, beautiful song. I knew what it meant, that

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:59.460
[Guest]: song, for a small child to see that movie, I knew, I saw it not when it was released,

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.300
[Guest]: but just a few years later, maybe I was eight, nine, one of my Friday nights with my mother

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.700
[Guest]: watching movies things. I knew that what he was communicating is what is the responsibility

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:14.780
[Guest]: of a man to a woman that has been wronged by society that he loves, and how does one

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:23.020
[Guest]: come, and then there's another beautiful song in there, Chhoopalo Yoon Dil Lo Diye Ki Tarha

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.420
[Guest]: Kandir Mein, something like that. It'll come to me, I'm a little nervous. Usually I remember

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:33.540
[Guest]: all the lyrics. So what is the responsibility? The same question I had when I watched Amar

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:39.460
[Guest]: Prem with Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore. These are popular cinema, but when he goes

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:45.460
[Guest]: into Kuch Toh Log Kahenge Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kahna, why can't that be a moment for anyone

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:56.220
[Guest]: to sit back and reflect? He says this, and I'm speaking this because I'm a woman. These

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:02.420
[Guest]: were the first understandings of myself as a feminist. I am a feminist, and I think it's

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.700
[Guest]: one of the most sensuous and intellectually interesting things to be, is how do you look

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:12.540
[Guest]: at the world from this, calling yourself a feminist, what does it mean to make the world

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:18.820
[Guest]: in front of you, inside of you, day in and day out? So these are the beginnings of speculating

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:25.180
[Guest]: on what is the responsibility for a man who understands, not reviles a woman, but understands

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:31.580
[Guest]: a woman. We know about men who revile, but there are also men, I know there are men,

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:43.620
[Guest]: I know many of them personally, who understand women. All these novels, one of the biggest

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:49.220
[Guest]: things that formed me were biographies. So when I was very little, I was always a very

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:53.420
[Guest]: devout reader, so the new books would come to the school library in New Jersey, wherever

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.260
[Guest]: I went to school. The librarians were my best friends. They would keep the new books before

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:01.140
[Guest]: they were catalogued for me on Friday. I would take them home, devour them, and bring them

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:08.460
[Guest]: back. So the things that I took a lot were, among the witchcraft and sorcery books, were

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.220
[Guest]: biographies of people. So biographies of Clara Barton, Florence Nightingale, Margaret

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:22.220
[Guest]: Mead, so many different people. And I really, really think that today, if I say to my daughter,

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:30.740
[Guest]: you must learn everything you need to know from a book to reflect, it won't work. That

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:36.300
[Guest]: was possible at a moment, like when I was 15 and I was staying in my grandparents' house

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:41.700
[Guest]: for six months, I discovered in a cabinet small bound copies of so many Shakespeare

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.580
[Guest]: plays. I read them continuously, like reading Cornelius Rex continuously. Who does that?

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:52.260
[Guest]: But it changes you to do these sort of things. I feel like literature isn't the only thing.

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:59.700
[Guest]: I feel like art and literature are very important, formalized spaces for such things. But so many

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:05.860
[Guest]: people who make really beautiful art are so fucking corrupt, you know, and so disdainful

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:15.780
[Guest]: of the internal complexities and unfairnesses in their own work. So I feel very strongly

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:25.420
[Guest]: that everything in life has to be seen, not in a pressuresome way, but as you have to

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:32.100
[Guest]: be so open that you are receiving whatever it has to give you. A friend of mine who's

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:39.860
[Guest]: from Kerala, and he is my friend, once told me not so long ago, we were talking, and this

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:44.900
[Guest]: was my first understanding of the reading culture in Kerala and the way that the government

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:50.660
[Guest]: press publishes, you know, the Sahitya Akademi or whatever, the Kerala Academy, Sahitya Akademi

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.820
[Guest]: publishes so many books and then there's a contract to send them to school libraries

01:15:54.820 --> 01:16:02.780
[Guest]: and there's a ready-made population to buy books there, institutional purchasing. So

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.020
[Guest]: I said, oh, that's really interesting. And I hadn't arrived at good yet because I was

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:13.860
[Guest]: still absorbing that this thing could happen that way. And he said to me, and then I asked

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:19.900
[Guest]: him, do you like to read? And he said, I read, but I don't read so much. And I said, ah.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.300
[Guest]: And then he felt like he had to explain himself. He said, because reading can be corrupting

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:30.300
[Guest]: too. And I totally agree with that because I think people think that they're becoming

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:41.300
[Guest]: something by being well-read, but that's not true. I have a friend, another friend, Jeebesh

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:49.060
[Guest]: Bhakchi, who I sit sometimes and talk things over with. He's part of an artist collective.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.860
[Guest]: And one day he said that when he sometimes when he works with young people, he gives

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:56.460
[Guest]: them one book and he asked them to read it for like three months or something. Really,

01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:04.180
[Guest]: really well. That's enough. And if we understand book production and marketing itself to be

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:15.340
[Guest]: such a corrupt process, which it is, then how can we expect the books to deliver on

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:28.180
[Guest]: goodness all the time? I think that a moral, no, an ethical engagement with life means

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:36.620
[Guest]: that you have to keep sifting. That's your labor. There's no fixed place you can moor

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:43.060
[Guest]: yourself to because the world is so dynamic. You are dynamic. The world, you are part of

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:51.740
[Guest]: the world. So it's nice to think that literature will deliver us. It's nice to think that listening

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:58.500
[Guest]: to good music will deliver us. It can teach us many, many things. But as far as I can

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:03.500
[Guest]: see, most people seem to be satisfied with getting a little bit new, but mostly what

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:08.300
[Amit Varma]: they're familiar with. I was struck by your phrase earlier, by the way, which you used

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:12.540
[Amit Varma]: to describe your father, but it's also useful in a metaphorical way where you said he was

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.180
[Amit Varma]: an in America, he was an engineer by day, a butcher by night. And I wonder if that applies

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.660
[Amit Varma]: to other things. Tell me now, you know, sort of going back to your life story. And I also

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.140
[Amit Varma]: agree with you that, you know, looking at it in a linear way is sometimes a problem

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:30.300
[Amit Varma]: because there is just the present moment and all our memories are also in the now and all

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:37.940
[Amit Varma]: of that. Tell me about how your sort of sense of self began to form in the sense that like

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.380
[Amit Varma]: I just look back on my own life and many of my guests have also shared this that I look

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:45.900
[Amit Varma]: back on my own life and my sense of self was very flawed. I am a completely different person

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:52.220
[Amit Varma]: from what I was at 25, completely different. And it just changed, right? And over time,

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:55.660
[Amit Varma]: you kind of reflect and maybe you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to be able

01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:01.820
[Amit Varma]: to take a step back and reflect on that stuff and change. How did your sense of self evolve?

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:07.940
[Amit Varma]: You know, a lot of this is impressionistic stuff that you are doing a lot of noticing,

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.140
[Amit Varma]: you notice the flicking of the pickle, you notice, you know, the doll being thrown away

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.980
[Amit Varma]: into the attic where it still lies, as you pointed out, and such an interesting image

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:20.580
[Amit Varma]: of dolls still lying in an attic, still pale after all these years.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:27.620
[Guest]: Now, I want to say something to you. I know me and I know many people who have a pretty

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:31.220
[Guest]: solid sense of self from the time they're born.

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:38.580
[Guest]: I figured that. Yes. And I think the whole task of life is getting people out of the

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:46.540
[Guest]: way. And that's how I've lived my life. I put people in my way, for example, I worried

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:53.580
[Guest]: about my mother incessantly. I worried about people in my life incessantly, worried about

01:19:53.580 --> 01:20:02.940
[Guest]: their well-being. And I thought myself as to be the person that worries for other people

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:10.140
[Guest]: and takes care of them. So I could watch a movie and there would be Ma, and I would say,

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.820
[Guest]: oh, I'm also like that Ma, because I know that feeling inside of me. But that's not

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:21.820
[Guest]: all that I am. I'm much more. So, you know, the person that wants to walk on the National

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:26.980
[Guest]: Highway at age three and doesn't feel any fear, the person, all these things are there.

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:32.100
[Guest]: The person that loves to read is very comfortable being in a room full of people and very comfortable

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:38.500
[Guest]: being solitary. This is all the self, no? So then there are people and situations that

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.660
[Guest]: are going to come and tell along, like, you're a woman, you shouldn't do this. Why? So when

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:53.180
[Guest]: I was 25, 27, 25, at various stages in my life, I did something that I'm not supposed

01:20:53.180 --> 01:21:00.180
[Guest]: to do because not to rebel. I don't think I was rebellious. Just to say, oh, this feels

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:07.460
[Guest]: correct. I need to acknowledge this. So, you know, in my family, they're overly protective

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:12.060
[Guest]: of girls in the wrong way. And then, of course, also sexually abusing of girls. They're always

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:18.300
[Guest]: those relatives, too, in a large family. When I was 27, I bought an Indrail Pass. This is

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:28.300
[Guest]: in 1993. And I traveled all across India in a train by myself wearing a sari. Because

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.220
[Guest]: the other thing that people would say is that, how can you wear a sari and do things? I said,

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.580
[Guest]: well, women are having babies, working in the fields. There's this beautiful photograph

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:42.260
[Guest]: of the Sri Lankan architect Manetta Silva climbing up a ladder to inspect a construction

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.860
[Guest]: site in a sari. I said, nope, I'm going to wear a sari and I'm going to travel. Of course,

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:50.300
[Guest]: I wore some shalwar kameez as well. When I wore a sari at a suitcase, I would bathe with

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:55.940
[Guest]: the Bisleri bottle or whatever it was, that yes, or some bottle in the bathrooms in the

01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:02.020
[Guest]: train. I'd fill it up and I would take a bath every six, seven places. I would spend the

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:09.180
[Guest]: night at a good place, get laundry done. I would sleep at train stations. This is 1993,

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:15.780
[Guest]: just two years after liberalization of the economy. I understood that maybe my family

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:23.740
[Guest]: was much more space, was much more dangerous for me than India was, the rest of India was.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:31.220
[Guest]: That's what I understood as a woman. People were, except for one tiny incident in my life

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:42.300
[Guest]: in those years of traveling to Patna and facing something there from men on Diwali night.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:48.740
[Guest]: A very nice Muslim family group of women just kind of surrounded me and they were wearing

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:56.700
[Guest]: burqas. So they surrounded me and kind of just kept those men away. I never faced any

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:03.300
[Guest]: issues. I'm not saying people don't face issues. I'm just saying that things, you have to keep

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:12.700
[Guest]: working to get to yourself. Again, it's work. You have to do the work. I think I was given

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:22.060
[Guest]: something at birth, whatever you want to call it, genes, karma, all these things. And then

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:27.260
[Guest]: I have a responsibility and I felt it very sincerely because there was joy in it. Like

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:32.820
[Guest]: I'm listening to the Beatles and I said, this feels good to hear. Why? Let me hear it some

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:38.620
[Guest]: more because it's making me feel good. These are just simple things, but they're actually

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:45.060
[Guest]: really profound things. Like why do so many people, including me at moments, gravitate

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:51.340
[Guest]: to things which are bad, which make us feel so bad? I'm not talking about the hard work

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.820
[Guest]: of like, let's say lifting a suitcase up the staircase or something like that. I'm talking

01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:01.180
[Guest]: about things that really make you feel bad. Like, you know, you hate sucking up to people

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:10.860
[Guest]: at a party. Why are you sucking up to people then? Why are you doing it? Because you, what

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:18.940
[Guest]: is it that's supposed to, this is something we have to work at. It is our task. It is

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:23.380
[Amit Varma]: our responsibility. There's so many cinematic images in everything

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.900
[Amit Varma]: you're saying, like a little child painting herself red or these women in a burqa just

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:32.540
[Amit Varma]: surrounding you. And I can just imagine the camera moving as it should. Someone should

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:39.380
[Amit Varma]: make a web series from your memories, perhaps. So what did you want to do then? Let me get

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:44.180
[Amit Varma]: to the mundane, concrete question of, you know, rather than going to these abstractions

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:48.260
[Amit Varma]: like sense of self and all of that, which is always a continuously evolving thing and

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.100
[Amit Varma]: also a fixed thing, like you pointed out, if you had a strong sense of self from when

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:56.060
[Amit Varma]: you were young. But what did you want to do? What were you educated in? And what did you

01:24:56.060 --> 01:25:02.420
[Guest]: see yourself doing for the rest of your life? I was good at school. And I wasn't a science

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:08.380
[Guest]: child or a literature child or a social studies child or whatever. I just was good at school

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:16.300
[Guest]: and loved to read. And I love to read all kinds of things. Gravitated towards things

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:29.060
[Guest]: which were about people, like novels or biographies for my personal reading. I think somewhere

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:34.140
[Guest]: in there, as I mentioned earlier, I read some sort of book about Margaret Mead. I might

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:42.580
[Guest]: have seen Coming of Age in Samoa. And there was a radio show for the South Asian community

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:47.180
[Guest]: in America. And I was called as a group of young people. And they asked me, what did

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:52.020
[Guest]: you want to be? And I think I said fairly clearly. I'm pretty sure I said fairly clearly

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:59.580
[Guest]: I wanted to be an anthropologist. So by the time I had, I'm not that far from that now.

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:10.180
[Guest]: I'm an art historian. I work on architecture. I work on craft. I work on teaching, pedagogy.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:15.780
[Guest]: These are the areas of research interest. So by the time I was 12, I have a scholarly

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:22.940
[Guest]: orientation. I know that. Now I'm very comfortable calling myself that. I always had this like

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:31.060
[Guest]: deeply sit down and delve into something mentality. That's the noticing comes from that. Sitting

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:35.420
[Guest]: down and do the work comes from that, that idea. I know there are many good people who

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.660
[Guest]: don't think like this and I love to listen to their ways of doing things. But this is

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:45.820
[Guest]: me. I sit down and I do this or I could stand up and do it. It doesn't have to be sitting

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:56.580
[Guest]: down. And there was a moment in my life where my parents wanted to get me married when I

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:04.100
[Guest]: was like 16 or 15, arranged marriage. And they tried all kinds of shenanigans and it

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:11.380
[Guest]: didn't work. And this, I went to high school in India. I did my 10th, 11th and 12th here.

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:17.380
[Guest]: PUC as they called it then. And in Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam. And then I went back to

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:22.380
[Guest]: the US and my parents really wanted me to study business administration or something

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:29.020
[Guest]: like that then. It was so boring, man. It was so boring. And I went to this large commuter

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:35.020
[Guest]: university in Los Angeles and I went to art school partly because I think it was nearby

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:39.780
[Guest]: and partly because I liked it. And I was always a little maker. My mother taught me how to

01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:45.820
[Guest]: sew falls and make samosas and kajas and these things and those things. From a generation

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:51.420
[Guest]: of women in India, you learn to make stuff. So I went there and I liked it. So I started

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:57.220
[Guest]: studying design. And I like design because it is something, you want something and you

01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:03.140
[Guest]: have to sit down and work for it. You have to think about how to make it work. But you

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.980
[Guest]: have to remember this was the era, or you may or may not remember, but I think something

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:13.180
[Guest]: similar was happening here too. Just a little bit later where certain things like, you know,

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.300
[Guest]: that sun that came over Birla Sun Life or Bank of Baroda. These are motifs about an

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:30.420
[Guest]: economy rising. So when I went to undergraduate, Reagan had just been elected and there was

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:37.700
[Guest]: this idea of an economy in motion. So the swoop was very important. So every goddamn

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:43.820
[Guest]: thing from Vons to supermarket to this thing or that thing had the swoop. And I think there

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:48.620
[Guest]: was the moment where I thought, this is stupid. I mean, I can say those kinds of things, like

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:53.260
[Guest]: this is really inane and stupid. And I think we had some tasks to design a magazine cover.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:29:01.180
[Guest]: I like that. I was the last batch of students that was not mandatorily learning computer-aided

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:08.180
[Guest]: design. I still hand cut all my letters and pasted them and used benzene to clean up the

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:15.380
[Guest]: thing and the chemicals really got to me. And the temporality of retail design is horrible.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:20.500
[Guest]: You have to be awake whatever time to meet the deadlines. Part of the education there

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:27.060
[Guest]: was you had to take art history classes as part of your art degree. And my first art

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:31.040
[Guest]: history class, I was working three jobs and going to school full-time. My art history

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:38.380
[Guest]: class was at two in the afternoon after lunch. I would fall asleep and I failed. I didn't

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:43.540
[Guest]: even fail, I got a D. But I took more art history classes. And the next one, the next

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:51.700
[Guest]: one, I just loved it. I loved literature classes too, which was also there. I liked the philosophy

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:58.460
[Guest]: classes. I love philosophy. I mean, I read philosophy for fun in those years. And even

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:04.780
[Guest]: now, I love it. I love that somebody says, let's contemplate this thing called friendship.

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:11.020
[Guest]: And they spend 350 pages contemplating friendship. I love the idea that somebody says, let's

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.900
[Guest]: contemplate, what does it mean to print money? Money is a very philosophical thing. So let's

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:21.140
[Guest]: sit down and really reflect on this. I loved all this. And what I loved about art history

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:26.740
[Guest]: was it still was connected to the idea of anthropology about people, like viscerally

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:33.020
[Guest]: connected to people. People make things. But what I liked about it was that unlike literature,

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:41.580
[Guest]: it doesn't privilege an already privileged object, which is the printed text. So I was

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:46.700
[Guest]: aware that people who could read and write had more status in society and things which

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:52.220
[Guest]: were about reading and writing had more status. And I really wanted to spend time listening

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:57.540
[Guest]: to the things that objects said about people and about themselves. And gradually, I came

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.540
[Guest]: to understand that objects don't even say things about people. They say things about

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:05.420
[Guest]: material. And objects might say things about, might be designed to speak for themselves

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:11.580
[Guest]: too. And we can talk about that. And I was fascinated by that. So the turning moment

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:18.460
[Guest]: was I had a Japanese art history professor. It was a wonderful place because Los Angeles

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:26.740
[Guest]: has many museums and museum curators who are not in the topmost positions often teach as

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:32.540
[Guest]: adjunct faculty. So I had pre-Columbian. I had Korean. I had Chinese. I had Japanese.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:38.940
[Guest]: I had, not Korean was part of this, Chinese and Japanese. I had the history of modern

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:45.180
[Guest]: design. I had Greek. I had Roman. I had modern art history. I had so much art history that

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.260
[Guest]: when I went to grad school, I realized that students who went to much more elite schools

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:54.660
[Guest]: didn't have this range. So the turning point for me was when I had a Japanese art history

01:31:54.660 --> 01:32:05.660
[Guest]: teacher and Japanese people believe objects speak. They have this idea of mono no aware,

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:12.900
[Guest]: which is that there's a beauty of things. You have this sense that things are impermanent

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:22.020
[Guest]: and passing. And Japanese people have a sense of, and this is the irony that they became

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:30.620
[Guest]: such a great industrial giant later, but until modernity, they made objects in multiples,

01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:37.300
[Guest]: like for example, massive numbers of teacups or whatever. But there was a sense that these

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.460
[Guest]: objects had to respond to the touch. They had to have a conversation. They had to respond

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:52.500
[Guest]: to the eye. And he allowed us, Joseph Newland, allowed us access to that world. He didn't

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:57.740
[Guest]: drum it into us, but he showed us objects in such a disciplined way. He taught us in

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:03.860
[Guest]: such a disciplined way to come to this. So he told us the story. I don't know if you're

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:08.260
[Guest]: aware of this. The Six Persimmons is a very famous painting. It's a very, very famous

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:16.460
[Guest]: painting. And he told us the story about this painting. And then he told me about his teacher

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:23.820
[Guest]: who was a Zen teacher and who had a Zen master as his teacher. So apparently he wanted to

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:28.980
[Guest]: see this very beautiful scroll or painting that was in this monastery. And the teacher

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:34.940
[Guest]: kept refusing to show it or kept putting it off, not refusing, putting it off. And then

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:38.340
[Guest]: one day, I think he went to the toilet and when he pulled out the toilet paper, there

01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:50.020
[Guest]: was the painting on the roll. And I don't know in America of the 1980s anything else

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:57.700
[Guest]: that could have given me access to the weirdness of human existence, the weirdness and interesting.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:04.180
[Guest]: This is other people that have had other experiences. This was my experience of how to understand

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:11.340
[Guest]: that there's just so many interesting ways of being in this world, living in this world

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.260
[Guest]: and teaching and all these kinds of things. And then I had another teacher for modern

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:22.580
[Guest]: art and she was very interesting because I was not a very good writer. I mean, she said,

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:29.140
[Guest]: I'm going to give you a D if you want to keep your paper this way. But if you want to improve

01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:34.620
[Guest]: your writing, I will work with you till you get the grade you're satisfied with. So I

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.860
[Guest]: decided I would be satisfied with an A. So she worked with me and that was like a quantum

01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:49.140
[Guest]: moment for me, transformation movement, to be really, really understand that if I spent

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:55.260
[Guest]: my time really delving into something and laboring, I would be able to do the things

01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:02.380
[Guest]: I like doing, which is thinking and writing and making something. So that's it. So then

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:09.300
[Guest]: for me, art history continued to be very beautiful experience. And then I did well in my studies

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:14.900
[Guest]: in my undergraduate in spite of the Ds, they eventually put me, there were just moments

01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:19.060
[Guest]: like it was like a, I don't know, whatever, building's Roman or whatever, you know, you

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:24.860
[Guest]: pass these things. And then I decided I wanted to go to grad school at Columbia and I was

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:28.540
[Guest]: accepted. I thought about going to baking school, Pillsbury baking school, because I

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:35.940
[Guest]: love to cook. And then I thought about studying folklore because that's also close to anthropology.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:41.780
[Guest]: So Indiana University at Bloomington was very important school of folklore. I thought about

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.300
[Guest]: studying Japanese art history, but I did not want to, and I'd neither had the funds nor

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:52.600
[Guest]: had the ability to study Kanji for five years in order to master that. I thought about studying

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:59.420
[Guest]: African art, which I loved, loved, loved, loved. But I think I was still enamored with

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:06.380
[Guest]: the idea of having recorded voices, recorded documents about objects. And I didn't have

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:11.460
[Guest]: a very good deeper sense that records come in different forms and you can listen to objects

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:16.380
[Guest]: in different ways. So then South Asian art became the thing that I did, even though I

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:20.620
[Guest]: never studied it in my undergraduate. I fell in love with my teacher. The first time I

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:25.980
[Guest]: went to see her at Columbia before I started teaching, being a student there, and she was

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:31.300
[Guest]: one of the few South Asian women in the field. And she was outlined, there were this narrow

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:36.420
[Guest]: room, her office, and both sides were covered with books. She was sitting near the window.

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:42.940
[Guest]: It was July 29th or something like that in 1989. And I saw her and I said, it was love

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:50.340
[Guest]: at first sight. And I said, okay, I'm going to come and study here. And never did I imagine

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.820
[Guest]: myself becoming a professor, an academic. I'm very clear that being a scholar and being

01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:04.380
[Guest]: an academic are different things. It's very important for me. Being a scholar, being an

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:10.820
[Guest]: intellectual, being an academic, they're different, different things. And they can all merge in

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:23.460
[Guest]: one person. They don't have to. I had choices. So my PhD from there became a beginning point

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:30.700
[Guest]: to a life, I think, which is so rewarding of work and thinking and doing. Yeah, that's

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:35.780
[Guest]: what I do. And I'm very grateful to my teachers who never said that your destiny is to be

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:42.580
[Guest]: this or that. I'm grooming you for this or that. My teacher Vidya Deheja was so generous

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:48.420
[Guest]: about letting me go. In between, I thought about becoming a doctor because I love medicine.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.980
[Guest]: And I started doing some pre-med courses at Columbia. It was just too much. I couldn't

01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.860
[Guest]: take the load of PhD core classes as well as pre-med classes. But yeah, so it's things

01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860
[Guest]: like that.

01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:03.780
[Amit Varma]: So fascinating. And I'm very interested in what you said about the Japanese conception

01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.700
[Amit Varma]: of objects being able to speak. Like, have you read this writer called Ken Liu? His surname

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.940
[Amit Varma]: is Liu, it's pronounced Liu, I think, who's written this beautiful book called Paper Menagerie.

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:17.900
[Amit Varma]: That's a title short story. And it's just incredible. And I don't want to give spoilers

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.340
[Amit Varma]: about it at all. But it's you will love it, I think. And I will post a link in my show

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:24.460
[Amit Varma]: notes for all the listeners to read.

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:27.460
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for doing such things.

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:30.340
[Amit Varma]: I want to kind of double click on a few of the things you mentioned. And one of them

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:34.780
[Amit Varma]: is a difference between being a scholar and an academic. What is that difference? And

01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.580
[Amit Varma]: why do you feel you're more of a scholar?

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:45.860
[Guest]: So I teach all the time and I'm a dedicated, I adore teaching. I adore it. I was blessed

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:52.300
[Guest]: with the most amazing teachers at every stage in my life. And if I am who I am, it is for

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:59.140
[Guest]: many reasons for my teachers. They're very close. So I love teaching. So teaching is

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:08.620
[Guest]: also not necessarily collapsible to being an academic. I think that academia is a model

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:17.300
[Guest]: that developed at a certain moment in time, certainly in post-independence India. And

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:24.620
[Guest]: as a model, it is changing rapidly. And there's a struggle over what its future is going to

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:32.180
[Guest]: be, whether it's in India or in the U.S., it's happening. And that's a good struggle.

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:37.660
[Guest]: Academia is the first place many people grate their teeth against politics, how to be political

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:46.300
[Guest]: in this world, how to be adult and how to be political. All these are very important.

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:51.460
[Guest]: But whether that actually, the structure of academia, whether it's in America where there's

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:58.740
[Guest]: constant pressure to produce research or writing or texts or something, the constant pressure

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:09.860
[Guest]: to be original, innovative, the new, or in India to be critical all the time. All of

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:16.660
[Guest]: these have now been completely absorbed into the educational industrial complex. Let's

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:28.220
[Guest]: be really clear about this. So in the educational industrial complex, where is the time to reflect?

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:39.320
[Guest]: And what is a scholar if not someone who labors and reflects? Labors in the archive, labors

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:44.980
[Guest]: with what they arrive at, discover, labors with the battling interpretations in their

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:53.220
[Guest]: own head, labors with acknowledging their debts to the past, their breaks with the past,

01:40:53.220 --> 01:41:05.980
[Guest]: crafting ways of doing things which reflect this experience of engagement, which are imaginative.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:15.180
[Guest]: If you read people like David Shulman or Velcher Narendra or this wonderful new scholar, new

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:21.100
[Guest]: for me, Arik Moran, who has been working on Himachal and the queens of Himachal, the Pahari

01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:31.620
[Guest]: queens during the British era. These things take time. They take time and they take time

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:37.900
[Guest]: not because you spent hours looking at the computer screen, but they take time to...

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.740
[Guest]: Sometimes I read, read, read, research, research, research, visit temples, temples, temples,

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:47.980
[Guest]: and suddenly this essay of 5,000 words comes out over two, three weeks very cogently and

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:52.380
[Guest]: lucidly. Now, are you saying that it only took me two or three weeks to write something

01:41:52.380 --> 01:42:00.020
[Guest]: or did it actually take years of preparing and doing and preparing and doing? Where is

01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:08.180
[Guest]: that time? And then if you're funded in a certain way, as far as I know, many of the

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:17.340
[Guest]: people who are at a certain stage in their career, they are constantly battling for grants.

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:22.500
[Guest]: They're constantly applying for job talks or conference papers or this. And some of

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:29.980
[Guest]: it's very productive and very generative, but a lot of it is just getting in the way

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:37.620
[Guest]: of being scholarly. And why is being scholarly important? That's the next question we have

01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:50.700
[Guest]: to ask. Because being a scholar respects learning, the process of learning. It really respects

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:59.980
[Guest]: the process of learning. Now, how you represent that process is very much in your hands to

01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:08.940
[Guest]: some extent. Is it a book? Is it a podcast? Is it the way you teach? Is it the way you

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:15.380
[Guest]: treat buildings in a policy discussion? And being a scholar means that you're willing

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:22.740
[Guest]: to go back to beginner's mind on a regular basis. And to me, that's very different from

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:29.740
[Guest]: the intense pressure to have certitude that academia puts on people. I am not interested

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:37.940
[Guest]: in so much in certitudes because the fun is over. And then teaching is very different.

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:42.700
[Guest]: Teaching is a real commitment. Like I have students who have been my students for 20

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:50.020
[Guest]: years. I spend a lot of time with students and the fruit of that labor of teaching for

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:56.780
[Guest]: them and for you happens over a long time. And there's nothing as rewarding in work as

01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:06.180
[Guest]: watching a book you've written make someone really happy or deep. Deep is more better

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:14.260
[Guest]: than happy. Or a student feel like they've arrived at something very profound for themselves.

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:20.100
[Guest]: It's really important. Yeah, I think that's the distinction. The distinction between industrialized

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:26.660
[Guest]: academic work is the production of certitude and scholarly work is the claiming of a beginner's

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:32.820
[Guest]: mind as a wonderful existential space.

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:38.060
[Amit Varma]: So is it then sort of fair to summarize this by saying that academics are forced onto these

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:43.300
[Amit Varma]: grooves. They have to go along those grooves and they have to keep moving all the time.

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:48.180
[Amit Varma]: And if you just talk of incentives, there are incentives that drive them towards all

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:53.180
[Amit Varma]: the time, publishing and producing and trying to be different. There might also be incentives

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.500
[Amit Varma]: that force them to conform to a certain way of thinking that might be fashionable within

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:02.340
[Amit Varma]: academia. Whereas if you're a scholar, those incentives don't exist. You are just in search

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:08.260
[Amit Varma]: of the truth in your own way, at your own speed. And that's what drives you. And would

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.580
[Guest]: that be a correct summation?

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:17.140
[Guest]: It's very stark the way you've painted it. But I am a person of my time. So there are

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:27.540
[Guest]: many, many academics who do wonderful work. My critique is more of academia than academics

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:34.020
[Guest]: in general. But I do feel that I pay attention to what they're saying because what they're

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:40.180
[Guest]: saying and how they're saying and where they're saying it is important to shaping the things,

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:45.660
[Guest]: the environment in which I'm saying things. So for example, I read a lot of things that

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:51.420
[Guest]: come out of university presses. Thank you, university presses. Right? I also think that

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:55.860
[Guest]: university presses will not be the only place I publish. So I don't publish only in university

01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:02.580
[Guest]: presses. I write in different avenues because I want different kinds of audiences. Even

01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:09.060
[Guest]: my engagement with the JCB prize was for me to come out of one space and enter another

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:15.140
[Guest]: space. Right? All these things are really, really important. Yeah. I think being a scholar

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:25.180
[Guest]: is a deeply romantic space that you must allow yourself to have. It's deeply romantic. The

01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:31.020
[Guest]: romance of reading something late into the night or getting up very early and writing,

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:38.420
[Guest]: of being very thrilled to connect to. So I work on medieval material, or I work on like

01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:44.900
[Guest]: that essay I sent to you, one of the founders of the Indian studio pottery movement. These

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:51.420
[Guest]: are people that existed before my time. But if I give myself the time and the space and

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.780
[Guest]: I'm observing myself, I'm observing what I'm reading, I'm observing the things they've

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:59.500
[Guest]: made. I'm reading other people's writing on Japanese studio pottery or something or something

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:08.620
[Guest]: or something. Something happens. Something happens. And that something happening takes

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:19.620
[Guest]: time and space. I want to see an academia that promotes that. I'm not sure that that's

01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:26.020
[Amit Varma]: where academia is headed right now. So we are headed now for a quick commercial break.

01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:29.900
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back, I have lots more to ask you and lots more to double click on from

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:35.140
[Amit Varma]: what you already mentioned. One of the things I've learned most over the last year and a

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:40.940
[Amit Varma]: half is sharing my insights on my two greatest passions, writing and podcasting. And I'd

01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:46.700
[Amit Varma]: love to invite you to be a part of this journey. Registration is now open for the January cohort

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.700
[Amit Varma]: of the art of clear writing, where over four webinars on four Saturdays, I teach all I

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:57.940
[Amit Varma]: know about the art and craft of writing compelling prose, much interaction, many exercises. And

01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:02.340
[Amit Varma]: at the end of it, you get to join the clear writing community and online community formed

01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:07.500
[Amit Varma]: by the 18 previous cohorts of this course. In that community, we have book clubs, workshops,

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:12.540
[Amit Varma]: writing prompts with feedback and much else. I am also doing a special cohort of my podcasting

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:17.500
[Amit Varma]: course, the art of podcasting, which I had conducted for three cohorts last year before

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:21.860
[Amit Varma]: I took a break. All my learnings from five years of the seen and the unseen in three

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.780
[Amit Varma]: webinars over three Sundays. For more details and to sign up for my writing course, head

01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:31.780
[Amit Varma]: on over to indiancut.com slash clear writing. To sign up for my podcasting course, go to

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:37.220
[Amit Varma]: seen unseen.in slash learn. These links will also be at the bottom of the show notes. These

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:44.900
[Amit Varma]: are exciting times for the creator economy, and I'd love to help you be a part of it.

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:49.300
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Anna Poona Garimella about whom,

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.900
[Amit Varma]: you know, I was telling one of our fellow fellow jurors the other day that if you speak

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:57.880
[Amit Varma]: for more than 30 seconds, I feel like I learned something new, which is a combination of how

01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.340
[Amit Varma]: insightful you are. And also your world is so different from mine. So I just feel like

01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:07.020
[Amit Varma]: I'm learning so much, even even during this conversation. And what have you learned? You've

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:12.500
[Amit Varma]: given me a lot to reflect on. So I don't want to put my finger on things that I have necessarily

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:17.180
[Amit Varma]: learned. But this is a conversation I will revisit. I know it. And I'm sure many of my

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:22.300
[Amit Varma]: listeners will feel the same way. And for a moment, I'll move from the subject of you

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.660
[Amit Varma]: speaking to object speaking, which is you know, that point you brought up earlier, which

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:33.660
[Amit Varma]: is so fascinating to me, because we take everything around us in a sense, for granted. In fact,

01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:38.420
[Amit Varma]: I, you know, I was I was feeling very jealous earlier, when you were talking about your

01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:44.340
[Amit Varma]: innate tendency to notice things deeply. And if there's one thing that I consciously try

01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:49.980
[Amit Varma]: to make myself do more, it's notice because I don't notice, I can go through an entire

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:55.540
[Amit Varma]: meal and somebody will ask me what did that taste like? And to my shame, very often I

01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.820
[Amit Varma]: won't know. Because it's just you're just going through the motions. And one wonders

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:05.060
[Amit Varma]: if, you know, just the world around us, like I remember when I travel, I had once traveled

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:11.540
[Amit Varma]: through Pakistan in 2006, when I was covering the cricket tour there. And I was just looking

01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:16.060
[Amit Varma]: at everything with such intense eyes, like walking through Lahore, or when we went to

01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:21.060
[Amit Varma]: Peshawar, and we went to bid on the Khyber Pass. And everything I saw just had so much

01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:25.700
[Amit Varma]: meaning and value for me, or I was putting meaning into it, because I was desperate to

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.820
[Amit Varma]: find things interesting and find things beautiful. And then I come back to Delhi and I'm and

01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:34.860
[Amit Varma]: I realized that it's everything is invisible. It's a scene in the unseen. And I guess to

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:40.060
[Amit Varma]: some extent, I think that is what you were alluding to earlier. In the context of object

01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:46.140
[Amit Varma]: speaking, I'd really like you to elaborate on that so they can speak to me as well.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:49.660
[Guest]: I want to say something first before I get to objects being because it's tied, but it's

01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:55.220
[Guest]: something you just said, it's about going to Lahore and noticing things. Why do we notice

01:50:55.220 --> 01:51:02.300
[Guest]: actually? What are the conditions for noticing? I think, well, there's often the conditions

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:07.140
[Guest]: where you know, you have a bomb blast or some horrible thing happens. Yeah, there's noticing

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:16.500
[Guest]: because a technology is or a social framework is developed around that, which requires noticing,

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:21.900
[Guest]: for example, the marriage photograph. Right? So that's a form of noticing. The selfie is

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:29.460
[Guest]: a form of noticing. To some extent, it might also be a deep form of blinding, too. But

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:38.540
[Guest]: I think that to be noticing, to have noticing as a form of the ethos of life, you have to

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:46.200
[Guest]: be intentional. So you told me when you went to Pakistan, you were very intentional in

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:57.940
[Guest]: your looking. You didn't take anything for granted. So you saw everything. I think that

01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:06.540
[Guest]: intention to be present and to look, to notice, notice isn't just passive looking. Noticing,

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:13.560
[Guest]: if you ask me, it isn't necessarily detached either. Like there's this notion of a writer

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:19.980
[Guest]: being detached and observing life and then recording it. No. Noticing is intentional.

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:29.820
[Guest]: It is aware. And it is aware of both thing you're noticing and yourself as you're noticing.

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:34.960
[Guest]: So there is a kind of flowing dialogue between this. And then, of course, there can be many

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.300
[Guest]: things that are happening in that situation and you will be connected. What that does,

01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:48.380
[Guest]: if you ask me, is begin to populate your world in a very different way. It isn't linear then.

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:54.420
[Guest]: And that's how objects start speaking to you. Because you start understanding, noticing

01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:04.280
[Guest]: things. So my Japanese art history professor introduced me to Ogata Kenzan, who is one

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:17.740
[Guest]: of the great ceramists of early modern Japan. Late. So he made many things, but he made

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:24.140
[Guest]: this very beautiful teacup, which is considered a national treasure. And one day I will go

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:33.420
[Guest]: to Japan and maybe I'll get to see it. But it's just one cup and it has all the kind

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:43.340
[Guest]: of... it touches all the criteria that the Japanese people feel is a great coalescence

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:51.400
[Guest]: of beauty. Great coalescence that allows for beauty to be there. So there is a teacup.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:54:04.580
[Guest]: So this teacup is no handles. It can fit in the palm of your hand. It is for a tea ceremony.

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.380
[Guest]: There would have been, as you're studying this, you would learn that there would be

01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:21.480
[Guest]: a tea house. You would learn that by this point, an aesthetic of very noble, elite people

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:31.880
[Guest]: exploring humble things had developed in Japan. So this world of the great, luxurious world

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:38.200
[Guest]: of samurais and the shogunate worlds and all this thing would also have this other component

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:45.640
[Guest]: not... it's not anti to that world, but it's another component. So you would court humble

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:50.820
[Guest]: experiences like sitting on the floor and a bunch of people gathering, but also friendship.

01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:55.600
[Guest]: You might learn with your Zen master a tea ceremony, all these sort of things. So here's

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:05.800
[Guest]: this teacup that Ogata Kenzan made. No, I'm not a scholar of Ogata Kenzan. I am very knowledgeable

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:14.440
[Guest]: about my... what I took away from being confronted by Ogata Kenzan's teacup, which is that that

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:25.560
[Guest]: lesson has traveled with me. I was 23 when I first encountered him and his teacup. And

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:33.240
[Guest]: I traveled... that traveled with me and it reconciles and it brings into confrontation

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:46.400
[Guest]: all the things which are considered polarities. Luxury and humility, worldliness, and somebody

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.960
[Guest]: who retracts themselves from the world. So all of this is there in this one teacup. And

01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.040
[Guest]: also the teacup itself, it's the world that produces teacup, all of this is there. And

01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:02.520
[Guest]: that teacup itself is designed in such a way that the way that the glaze has emerged is

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:09.840
[Guest]: so accidentally beautiful that it fits into this quality that Japanese... the qualities

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:17.480
[Guest]: that Japanese aesthetics loves, mono no ware, the idea of accidental beauty and the idea

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:23.760
[Guest]: of things which are broken, which can be repaired very beautifully, like with gold, like when

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.200
[Guest]: a teacup breaks, you can repair it with a technique called kintsugi, where you use gold

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:35.080
[Guest]: to emphasize the crack, not hide it, but to emphasize the crack. And of course, I'm not

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:41.320
[Guest]: the first person to talk about this. There are people who have fallen in love with Japanese

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:46.480
[Guest]: ideas and objects because they're confronted with these ideas. But for a 23-year-old to

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:54.760
[Guest]: confront this was really important. So this object, I wrote about it, my semester paper

01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:01.680
[Guest]: was on this object. And then I kept myself, I've always been very close to this idea of

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:06.800
[Guest]: thinking, because you see art history as a field is deeply complex and contradictory.

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.880
[Guest]: You're working with objects often made by people who are not a very economically well-off

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:17.280
[Guest]: standing, they're often deeply vulnerable to power, beheaded, they could be beheaded,

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.840
[Guest]: they could be exiled, they could be kidnapped and brought, like some of the most beautiful

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:27.360
[Guest]: carpets that we know are made by populations of weavers who were essentially kidnapped

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:33.800
[Guest]: and brought to a new city because the ruler of that city said, I want this technology,

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:38.640
[Guest]: this talent, this art to be in my city for a new economic product, or because it's prestigious

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:48.720
[Guest]: or whatever. At the same time, art history is full of institutions and people who come

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:54.520
[Guest]: from unbelievably elite backgrounds. So now in the last, the struggle has been ever since

01:57:54.520 --> 01:58:00.600
[Guest]: the civil rights movement and to some extent the post-colonial movement and nationalist

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:05.960
[Guest]: movement to question this. So Rabindranath Tagore did it in his own way. Other people

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:10.760
[Guest]: did it in their own way. But at my point, the way I get it is through the civil rights

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:15.800
[Guest]: movement and the feminist movement and the post-colonial movement. But I never really

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:24.960
[Guest]: put everything together in a neat ideological package, in a shelf on which to put this teacup.

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:34.200
[Guest]: So what I get out of this is, I have a small organization that I founded and I run with

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:42.560
[Guest]: my colleague Sindhuja, and we get asked to curate an exhibition for a museum, which no

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:50.800
[Guest]: longer exists in some sense. And we decided, let's do a history of a material. So this

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:58.640
[Guest]: is unusual in and of itself. A history of clay in India after 1947. So how are you going

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:07.240
[Guest]: to tell this story? Clay is a ubiquitous material. Indus Valley is built on clay, right? Indus

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.960
[Guest]: Valley, Harappan civilization, whatever you want to call it, it's built on clay. But clay

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:21.120
[Guest]: is completely transformed in value and meaning and purpose at the temperatures that you fire

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:27.400
[Guest]: it, what you use to fire it, how you choose to work with its ephemerality and how you

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:35.520
[Guest]: choose to work with its capacity to be permanent, right? We all know this in some sort of tacit

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:43.800
[Guest]: way when we immerse our Ganeshas, when we break the kulad, when we decide to buy better

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:49.880
[Guest]: quality brick, all these things. But if you decide to sit and meditate on this quality

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:59.160
[Guest]: of clay and write a history of how the qualities of clay are inborn or given to it or over

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:06.800
[Guest]: time, then it's very fascinating to me. So it was my colleague who curated this show

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:15.000
[Guest]: primarily, but there were things that I also worked on because we curated it together.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.480
[Guest]: But the book that she wrote that came out of the exhibition is hers. So we decided to

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:26.920
[Guest]: organize it into some sections. And one of the sections was about studio pottery. And

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.600
[Guest]: in studio pottery, there was a table for the people that would be considered the founders

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:36.720
[Guest]: of Indian studio pottery. Among them were people like Devi Prasad Gandhi and Nirmala

02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:42.720
[Guest]: Patwardhan from Pune, Ira Chaudhary here from Delhi, and Gurusharan Singhji, who is the

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.320
[Guest]: late Gurusharan. All these people are dead except for Ira Chaudhary. So Gurusharan Singhji

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:55.120
[Guest]: was here in Delhi for a long time. In fact, there's a Delhi Blue Apartments, it's still

02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:05.040
[Guest]: there next to Ames. So he was a man who came from Jammu to Delhi and started working in

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.640
[Guest]: Delhi. He studied geology and his father's friend ran a brick factory here and he said,

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:14.160
[Guest]: I'm making tons of bricks. Why was he making tons of bricks? Because New Delhi was being

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:20.080
[Guest]: built. Delhi that's being broken down and torn apart in some sense was being made by

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:27.640
[Guest]: a group of contractors, including Krishnan Singh's grandfather and several other people.

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:36.040
[Guest]: And this man, Ram Singh Kavli, was a subcontractor to these Indian, five major Indian contractors

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:44.520
[Guest]: who were producing the buildings that Baker and Lutyens had designed, among other people.

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:50.760
[Guest]: So he's here, a 19-year-old man, walking around, working in the brick factory. They're also

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:57.120
[Guest]: observing, and he's also observing the city and he sees this blue everywhere in the monuments

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:02.400
[Guest]: because the British, as they redesigned Delhi, are keeping things which have a slight masala

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.600
[Guest]: to them. One of the things that's luscious and delicious is this blue color that you

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:14.320
[Guest]: see in the tombs in Lodhi Gardens and stuff like that. So he's enamored with it and he

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:22.960
[Guest]: also falls in love with this Kavli's daughter and he asks for her hand in marriage. And

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.080
[Guest]: he says, well, you can marry her, but you have to go to Japan because Japan was the

02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.400
[Guest]: big center for ceramic production then, one of the big centers. Germany was another one.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:40.280
[Guest]: Go and learn how to do commercial ceramic production. So he went to Japan and the principal

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.840
[Guest]: there said, you have to learn Japanese. So he started learning Japanese and he fell,

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:49.560
[Guest]: while learning at this institute, while learning commercial production, he fell in with the

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:55.640
[Guest]: group of people who were at the foundational moment of Minge, which is the Japanese arts

02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.280
[Guest]: and crafts movement, which was responding to Japanese own history of industrialization.

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:07.960
[Guest]: So the arts and crafts movement in England was responding to the rampant industrialization

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:13.120
[Guest]: of England and the degradation of English craft. So people like William Morris were

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:21.920
[Guest]: protesting against it. And also, of course, the entry of products made in India, raw material

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.080
[Guest]: that was taken from India, sent to England, made there and then sent back to India. What

02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:32.800
[Guest]: was this doing to Indian English production, whatever? So an arts and crafts movement started

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.440
[Guest]: where you would labor and make beautiful objects and really make crafts. Of course, the irony

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.880
[Guest]: of it is that you can never go back. So these products were exorbitantly expensive because

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:50.920
[Guest]: that's the nature of industrialization. That's one of the characteristics of industrialization

02:03:50.920 --> 02:04:00.800
[Guest]: that it uses craft to make craft almost impossible for ordinary people to own. So similarly,

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.760
[Guest]: Japan had gone through industrialization. So this Minge movement has started and this

02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:15.080
[Guest]: Minge movement had people who were Japanese, like Shoji Hamada, and ideologues and an Englishman

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:20.400
[Guest]: who had been living in and a very famous person for his own leadership in the global studio

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:27.040
[Guest]: pottery movement, Bernard Leach, and Guru Sharan Singh happened to fall into that group.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:34.820
[Guest]: And this group really praised the handmade, the local. They wanted to de-emphasize authorship.

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:41.000
[Guest]: They wanted to think of the artisan craftsman, the artist craftsman, all these very romantic,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.880
[Guest]: very complex and internally contradictory ideas. And Guru Sharan Singh is absorbing

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:52.800
[Guest]: all of this and he's very, very intelligent man, deeply intelligent man, even at that

02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:59.600
[Guest]: age. He comes back to India and he starts work. He marries Chattarkar, Ram Singh Kabli's

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:08.280
[Guest]: daughter. He works in the factory. The factory was situated where Willingdon Airport is there

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.760
[Guest]: and now it's Saptarjung Airport. And all these kilns were there and he would have been seeing

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:22.920
[Guest]: lots of things. And then of course, this whole world changes when New Delhi is constructed

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:29.480
[Guest]: and India gains its independence. The big factories close and Guru Sharan Singh, before

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:35.560
[Guest]: independence had already left and was working in various places, Kota, Ambala, setting up

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:44.120
[Guest]: ceramic institutes, working as a geologist in Bundi, actually, for the King of Bundi,

02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:52.320
[Guest]: in Bundi State, different, different places. And then he comes back in 1946 to Delhi or

02:05:52.320 --> 02:06:00.240
[Guest]: slightly later. He comes back to Delhi and then he starts Delhi Blue Pottery. He's retired

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:05.200
[Guest]: from government service and he starts Delhi Blue Pottery. Now this is a studio pottery

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:10.080
[Guest]: place. And here's where objects have been speaking to him all the time, the blue tiles

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:14.840
[Guest]: in the monuments, the bricks he's making. We don't know what they were saying to him

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:23.520
[Guest]: till this moment. He is listening to, he invites Sharada Ukil, who was a Shantiniketan actor

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:29.000
[Guest]: and who came an artist and also theater person. He came and he designs the tiles for his new

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.280
[Guest]: house in Delhi. So when he starts Delhi Blue Pottery in the new way, after independence,

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:41.080
[Guest]: he's confronted that India made this rule that you couldn't import ceramics anymore,

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:45.040
[Guest]: that in fact, domestic ceramics had to take the place because we didn't have any foreign

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:53.200
[Guest]: exchange. So only crafts, the crafts we sold gave us foreign exchange. And not very different

02:06:53.200 --> 02:07:01.680
[Guest]: from the British, by the way. So he starts designing products and he's very smart. So

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.240
[Guest]: what does Delhi have that needs a lot of products? Already when the railroads had come and Delhi

02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:13.400
[Guest]: became major terminus, scholars have, various scholars have pointed out the culture of having

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:21.880
[Guest]: a hotel started, the culture of having China in for dining had started. Gradually as Delhi's

02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:28.800
[Guest]: elites, the lalas and the rich elite of Delhi were transformed, they started having tiles,

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.640
[Guest]: tiled images of gods and tiles and ceramic plates. All these things started coming into

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:40.040
[Guest]: their household. So that culture had already started. But after independence, the big thing

02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:47.120
[Guest]: was there were all these embassies that were being built and all these people who had dinner

02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:56.360
[Guest]: parties here and they needed dinnerware because you didn't serve dinner to people in talis,

02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:07.600
[Guest]: you served it in crockery. So he started making things that people like to buy and vases and

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:13.040
[Guest]: things, but they were on his terms. And he worked deeply with a potter named Abdullah

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:20.360
[Guest]: who had the secret, the formula for Delhi blue. So it became a signature style for him.

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:26.480
[Guest]: So then for that show that I was curating, we saw a tea set he had made. He made it for

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:32.720
[Guest]: a Chinese restaurant in Kannat Place, lots of things. So this Chinese set is made in

02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:37.600
[Guest]: a clay body called stoneware, which is not a native clay body. It's a clay body that

02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:44.000
[Guest]: comes from Japan. So he had introduced it because he had this training. So he bought

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.720
[Guest]: it from Japan. Now it's a high temperature fired clay, so it's not porous. So it's unlike

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:55.400
[Guest]: a kulad which starts absorbing the chai. This does not absorb the chai. It sits, you glaze

02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:04.360
[Guest]: it and then it's sealed in some sense. So he decides, remember how old is tea? Tea itself

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:12.360
[Guest]: is not more than 60, 70 years old as a beverage to drink in India. As a widespread drinking

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:23.560
[Guest]: thing, it's in the 1920s I think that CTC becomes a technology that allows for the finer,

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:29.120
[Guest]: whatever cheaper kind of tea to be made. So tea is growing everywhere. So the kulad itself

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:35.480
[Guest]: is a new invention. So there's been a culture of tea sets in India. Indian people are making

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:44.600
[Guest]: tea sets in silver. They're making them also in bone china, a problem because it has bone

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.920
[Guest]: in it and we're a vegetarian country by and large. So in South India, stainless steel

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:55.560
[Guest]: tea sets start emerging as a response to this. So all these objects are telling you about

02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:02.400
[Guest]: the society, what the concerns of the society are. And the kind of tea sets that are emerging

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:08.680
[Guest]: here are the version of the tea set. Remember tea came from China to Europe to England and

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:15.760
[Guest]: then of course from India. They all emerge from the British idea of drinking tea or the

02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:22.960
[Guest]: European in which you have a cup which holds the beverage and you have a handle and it's

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:29.680
[Guest]: an aristocratic drink in its origins. You hold it and you have a silhouette that your

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:36.440
[Guest]: hand makes with this teacup. So all of this is possible because of the size of the ring

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:44.040
[Guest]: on the teacup. If you have a beer mug or a tankard, it has big rings so that your knuckles

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:50.960
[Guest]: fully enter it and fold over it. So that tells you the nature of the hand that is carrying

02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:57.240
[Guest]: that mug to the mouth. The way that the silhouette is, like your muscle would bulge when you

02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:04.520
[Guest]: hold that tankard full of beer. When you hold a teacup, you don't need to have any muscle

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:10.400
[Guest]: barely exertion, bare exertion. The Japanese way of thinking about tea is very different.

02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:16.360
[Guest]: You hold it in your hand. It is something precious. It warms your hands in a very cold

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:24.280
[Guest]: climate. So the contact between the hand and the hot beverage and the cup is less mediated

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.160
[Guest]: by the handle. You have it entirely in your hand.

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:35.440
[Guest]: Gurshanji has seen both the Kular, he would have seen the English teacup and he would

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.320
[Guest]: have seen the Japanese teacup. So when he decides to make teacups and he's been part

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:44.880
[Guest]: of Minge, which emphasizes the local, he's also been part of the Swadeshi world because

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:51.800
[Guest]: the Swadeshi movement was big the years he came to Delhi. So local is a big thing. So

02:11:51.800 --> 02:12:01.080
[Guest]: what does he do? In Ambala, he designs a tea set. The teapot is designed based on a Kamandalu.

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:11.520
[Guest]: A Kamandalu is a water carrying pot that ascetics, mendicants use to carry holy water. So it

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:19.520
[Guest]: privileges the liquid inside that vessel. Kamandalu is, in some way, elevates the liquid

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:28.200
[Guest]: inside the vessel. The liquid itself might be sacred like the Ganga or the Narmada or,

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.180
[Guest]: and because it's in this beautiful pot shaped like a cow, shaped like something made out

02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:37.840
[Guest]: of precious materials, is further elevated. And the person who's carrying it, it has a

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:43.480
[Guest]: handle on it. You would put it on your forearm. You will see hundreds of rishis and mendicants

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:51.200
[Guest]: carrying these around. And he takes that as the inspiration for his teapot. So local is

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:58.480
[Guest]: covered. It's made in India, Swadeshi. Then he has to decide, but it's made not out of

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:05.160
[Guest]: bone china, not out of terracruda, which is unfired clay. It is not low fired clay like

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:13.880
[Guest]: okul, but it is stoneware. So from Japan. Now he cannot import all the materials to

02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:20.120
[Guest]: make Japanese stoneware. So if you do an analysis of that teacup, that tea set, you will understand

02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:27.320
[Guest]: that he digested all of this knowledge and experience, found local clay bodies, local

02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:37.000
[Guest]: minerals, synthesized all of this to produce a local clay body that had Japan in it, that

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:46.040
[Guest]: had England in it, and that had the Indic world in it. And then this clay body, he has

02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:54.480
[Guest]: to decide the shape of the teacup. So I remember my Ogata Kenzan again very deeply. And I see

02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:04.200
[Guest]: that his teacup has a handle, but the shape of the teacup is somewhere between the English

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:10.840
[Guest]: teacup, the Kuladish kind of shape, because to produce vast quantities, he'll have people

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:22.000
[Guest]: helping him to throw this, and the Japanese teacup. So somehow he's mediated all these

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.600
[Guest]: anxieties. We're a new Indian nation. We have dinner parties, and we're English in the way

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:35.800
[Guest]: we present ourselves. He's producing something that doesn't look English. It has no floral

02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:44.480
[Guest]: designs. It's not white bone china. It doesn't have any meat in it, any bone in it, nothing.

02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.920
[Guest]: He's done all these things. And when you hold that teacup, all you have to do is listen

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.800
[Guest]: to what it's telling you. And then you can start doing this research, or you can do all

02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:03.200
[Guest]: this research and come to the teacup and say, how do you hold the whole story, all the stories

02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:10.360
[Guest]: of the clay, and Gursharanji, and the histories of tea in yourself as you're in my hand? And

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:18.560
[Guest]: that's how objects speak. And when you see that tea, that warm tea in that cup with milk

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:23.880
[Guest]: in it, because Japanese don't drink it with milk, and the English don't necessarily drink

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:29.280
[Guest]: it with milk, but the way the tea was marketed in India by Lipton, door to door they went

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.680
[Guest]: and told people, because people drank milk in northern India, they told them how to mix

02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:42.120
[Guest]: it with sugar and milk to make it more marketable. So here we are, people drinking milky tea,

02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:53.120
[Guest]: which has a particular color in this cup that could be anywhere from a mossy green to brown

02:15:53.120 --> 02:16:01.800
[Guest]: to a deep deli blue. And it looks really nothing like Japanese, nothing like English, nothing

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:09.140
[Guest]: like a kulad. It is its own thing. And we, as I, as an art historian, as a person engaging

02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:17.200
[Guest]: with this deeply, have to be able to listen to those things, what it's telling me, and

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.680
[Guest]: respond to it and articulate it.

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So you've, you've just shown me the universe in a tea cup and you asked me earlier, what

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:34.080
[Amit Varma]: have I learned from you? And this is, you've added a new layer of appreciation that I'll

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.840
[Amit Varma]: have when I look at a tea cup the next time.

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you should.

02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And I don't drink tea, so it won't be too soon.

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.560
[Guest]: You can look at your coffee cup.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:47.200
[Amit Varma]: I can look at my coffee cup. No, no, it's so kind of fascinating. Now, okay, I'm going

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:54.680
[Amit Varma]: to ask you a sort of provocative general question that can also dive back to this. You know,

02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.680
[Amit Varma]: I just remembered this joke that I heard in school, which is, you know, in the 1980s,

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:05.560
[Amit Varma]: or maybe early 90s, when I was just in college. And it's a joke about MF Hussain. And the

02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:10.040
[Amit Varma]: joke is that this rich industrialist goes to Hussain and tells him that I want to, you

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.320
[Amit Varma]: know, commission a painting from you, will you paint something for me? And Hussain isn't

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:19.560
[Amit Varma]: feeling particularly creative at that moment, but he says, okay. And after the guy is gone,

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:24.240
[Amit Varma]: he just spreads out a lot of red paint on the floor. He takes off his clothes, gets

02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.880
[Amit Varma]: naked, sits down on it, then he goes and sits on a canvas. He calls it Apple that sells

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:34.520
[Amit Varma]: for a crore. Okay, that's a joke, right? And my question here is this, that when I think

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.040
[Amit Varma]: of art, and by art, I mean, you know, paintings, fine art, that kind of stuff with any other

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:47.040
[Amit Varma]: art form, like literature and music and cinema, I just feel that beyond the point, what I

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:53.320
[Amit Varma]: think of them is not mediated by elites, what artists like what what seems to happen with

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.480
[Amit Varma]: fine art is that you become a painter, but then whether you're considered a great artist

02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:06.680
[Amit Varma]: or not a great artist, doesn't depend so much on what, you know, reaction you might necessarily

02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:12.840
[Amit Varma]: have on the general public out there, the aam aadmi like me, but on a group of narrow

02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:17.840
[Amit Varma]: elites, who might be driven by a certain kind of ideology or politics, who will then pass

02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.640
[Amit Varma]: judgment on the art, and someone becomes a great artist, and someone becomes just a craftsman

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.280
[Amit Varma]: and is forgotten by time. And it's a very small group of people kind of deciding this

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:32.800
[Amit Varma]: is not a larger process. And you know, if you don't fit the flavor of the moment, you

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:37.400
[Amit Varma]: could just be lost. Like I have actually spoken to artists who've pointed out to what critics

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.480
[Amit Varma]: have written about them in praise, and said, Ki mujhe kuch samajh bhi nahi aaya wo kya

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.400
[Amit Varma]: bol raha hai. Because these are just artists who are just doing work they love for whatever

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:50.960
[Amit Varma]: reasons they love doing. And then, you know, you'll have critics and the gatekeepers apply

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:57.800
[Amit Varma]: their own kind of lenses to it. And in that sense, I think that world of fine art seems

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.080
[Amit Varma]: to me to be very different from all these other artistic worlds, where someone in a

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:07.560
[Amit Varma]: far corner somewhere can write a book, and me random person can read it, and, you know,

02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:12.240
[Amit Varma]: react to it, and it's not dependent on someone else's judgment. I mean, this sounds really

02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:16.520
[Amit Varma]: negative, I'm not being entirely critical, you know, like, even when it comes to poetry,

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:21.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, you know, before I really got into poetry, I would think that some poetry

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.640
[Amit Varma]: is like this, that I just don't get it, what the hell is going on. And I remember reading

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Mary Oliver's great book, Poetry Handbook, and rereading the poem Red Wheelbarrow, she

02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:35.920
[Amit Varma]: deepened my appreciation of it, to the extent that I tear up when I read that poem, that

02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.880
[Amit Varma]: there's no reason for me to, it's not about any concrete thing, but it just has such a

02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:46.040
[Amit Varma]: powerful impact on me. And I understand that a lot of art, which, you know, is not accessible,

02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:51.960
[Amit Varma]: can be approached in that way. But, and this question struck me, because earlier, you spoke

02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:59.240
[Amit Varma]: about how that art wasn't something just restricted to the privileged or whatever, and books were

02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:03.440
[Amit Varma]: because of printing press, and, you know, not everybody could, you know, necessarily

02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:09.080
[Amit Varma]: read and write. So what would be your response to this rambling question, which I did not

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:14.120
[Amit Varma]: intend to be offensive, but I am now worried that...

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:19.720
[Guest]: I really, really like not being offended easily. It gives me in a lot of space. And then I

02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:25.200
[Guest]: can really have nice conversations. So thank you for asking your question. There's a lot

02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:32.240
[Guest]: in that question. And as you rightly said, it's rambling, but it's also has threads of

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:38.120
[Guest]: which are not unique to you. These are large pressing concerns that historians and critics

02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:46.640
[Guest]: and people have taken very seriously and deeply. So I think you're going to have to help me

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:51.600
[Guest]: unpack your own questions as I talk to your question as I engage with it.

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.600
[Guest]: Okay, let me let me...

02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.240
[Guest]: No, I'm happy to answer it.

02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Let me add to it in another context, which is the context of music. I read this very

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:05.120
[Amit Varma]: interesting thread recently about Billy Joel and his first album, Piano Man, right? Now,

02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.160
[Amit Varma]: what happened when that album came out, and the album was brought out by a record label,

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:13.960
[Amit Varma]: it came out, but the record label itself wasn't enthusiastic. Radio stations were simply not

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:18.400
[Amit Varma]: playing it. So they were going to give up on the album and not give Joel any more work.

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And he was basically finished at that point. Till one random enthusiast fell in love with

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.080
[Amit Varma]: it so much that he got in touch with the record label and said, why the hell aren't you promoting

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:32.320
[Amit Varma]: this? And they just weren't interested. So this guy, and I'll, you know, post that thread

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:37.680
[Amit Varma]: from my show notes, went around to different radio stations. And at one point with a big

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.560
[Amit Varma]: radio station, he did a quid pro quo deal of some sort with somebody so that they would

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:48.120
[Amit Varma]: play the record for a day. And they started playing Piano Man for a day. And then listeners

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:53.000
[Amit Varma]: started phoning in and saying, we want more of this. What is this? This is amazing. And

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:58.520
[Amit Varma]: then it blew up and Billy Joel's had the career that he's had. Now, the truth of the matter

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:06.200
[Amit Varma]: is that that this is art. This is not something that is appealing to crass popular sentiment.

02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:10.360
[Amit Varma]: It is it is great art. And I mean, that's what I would say what Billy Joel's work and

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:16.280
[Amit Varma]: certainly Piano Man, and it would have been completely lost if it hadn't had a chance

02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:21.080
[Amit Varma]: to get democratized in this way and to reach a larger audience in this way. Similarly,

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:26.120
[Amit Varma]: to continue with music, I think of Johann Sebastian Bach, who was not a big figure in

02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.360
[Amit Varma]: his own lifetime. And after he died in the decades after he died, there was this kind

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:35.840
[Amit Varma]: of Bach Renaissance or whatever, I forget the exact term that people give to it, where

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:40.680
[Amit Varma]: he became elevated in our consciousness to become the legend he is. And you would imagine

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:45.200
[Amit Varma]: he was always a legend. No, in his lifetime, he was nothing. The elites of the day, who

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:50.040
[Amit Varma]: were the arbiters of taste, did not care for Bach. And it it took these centuries for him

02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:54.800
[Amit Varma]: to come. And with all of those with books, with music, you can talk about what about

02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:59.680
[Amit Varma]: the unseen talents who never quite managed to emerge, but at least in those fields, you

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:05.720
[Amit Varma]: had a better chance. In art, it seems to me that if you don't fit a particular conception

02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:10.200
[Amit Varma]: of art that elites may have, you're not going to make it in the fine art world. And a lot

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.280
[Amit Varma]: of talented people might today say that that's irrelevant anyway, we'll do art in a different

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:17.760
[Amit Varma]: way. So yeah, so that's kind of my elaboration.

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:25.880
[Guest]: Sheiltan Pethi That's a good one. So I can answer this in

02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:31.640
[Guest]: so many different ways. So I don't even know where to start, but let's try all of them.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:38.400
[Guest]: So first of all, I was never interested in the distinction between fine art and art.

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:43.960
[Guest]: This distinction was produced and a certain moment in time, let's say in India, when the

02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:50.760
[Guest]: colonial art schools were set up, JJ, Calcutta, Madras, Lahore. So because you had to produce

02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:55.640
[Guest]: a population that was trained in a certain way to produce craft, or you had to produce

02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:01.440
[Guest]: a population that need to be saved in or by middle class and elite people in order to

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:06.840
[Guest]: preserve inheritances and heritages. And then there were going to be a group of people who

02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:13.880
[Guest]: would be fine artists who would help it become more civilized or modern or whatever, depending

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:20.000
[Guest]: on which language or which kind of things. So I wasn't interested in it except as a historical

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:27.880
[Guest]: artifact. So if we set that aside, what do we have then? What we have is a field of production,

02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:38.520
[Guest]: a field of thought, a field of sensuous experiences, a field of aesthetic proclivities. If that's

02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:46.720
[Guest]: the case, then I'm interested in everything. And I've been this way from the time I, because

02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.040
[Guest]: I come from that generation, I think partly, but also because I'm listening to Hindi film

02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:58.320
[Guest]: music and I'm listening to T.K. Pattamal, but I'm also coming from a world which was

02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:06.840
[Guest]: where art making wasn't as thoroughly industrialized as it has become through certain kinds of

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:12.160
[Guest]: technological forms over the last century, right? Those things were still available to

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:20.960
[Guest]: us in India in the 1950s and 60s and 70s when we were born. When I was born in 1966, I was

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:26.880
[Guest]: born in. So I think that something about your perspective is also the experience of living

02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:32.720
[Guest]: in a certain kind of world. Now, then there is this whole question of taste. So here you

02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:38.880
[Guest]: have Pierre Bourdieu, the French sociologist who talks about constructing social distinction

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:46.560
[Guest]: and taste and all these sort of things. So knowing what is good art didn't constitute

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:52.280
[Guest]: a form of social distinction in the world that I lived in. For most people in India,

02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:58.880
[Guest]: it's cast or much cruder forms of capital demonstration, much more obvious forms of

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:06.320
[Guest]: capital, not cruder, but art can be pretty damn crude. Forms of distinction are there.

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:12.840
[Guest]: So that's one set of answers. Another set of answers are, one set of statements.

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:17.440
[Amit Varma]: I should clarify that this wasn't sort of a challenge to you per se. I understand that

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.040
[Guest]: you're in a much broader.

02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:20.040
[Guest]: I think we're discussing.

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:23.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So I'm talking more about the art world. I understand that you're.

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.800
[Guest]: Yeah. So I'll come to the art world. So I come to the art world. I'm coming there, but

02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:33.560
[Guest]: we have to map this ground out first. So who goes to art school? So I told you that early

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:39.960
[Guest]: on art schools were set up. There was a population of people who were hereditary craftspeople

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:44.000
[Guest]: who were brought to teach. They were potters, let's say from Multan, who were brought to

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.960
[Guest]: JJ to teach people how to make art pottery. They were people who were weavers, came from

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:55.480
[Guest]: weavers families, and they learned weaving in their own households and their own communities,

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:58.920
[Guest]: but had to go to school for weaving in order to produce the way the British wanted them

02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:00.400
[Guest]: to produce.

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.720
[Guest]: So there is a set of systems that started developing in our country, in the world over

02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:14.160
[Guest]: in the modern world, which created certain groups as elite producers and certain people

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:22.840
[Guest]: as less than elite producers. Simultaneously, it produced elite consumers, elite patrons,

02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:29.360
[Guest]: whatever. Patronage was of course, elite patronage is a much older phenomenon, but elite consumers.

02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.880
[Guest]: And then there are people who want to affiliate with certain kinds of eliteness because they

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:39.880
[Guest]: would like to be an elite art critic or whatever, right? So there's a production and a proliferation

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:48.160
[Guest]: of class classifications, distinctions. So words like kitsch have been thought about

02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:55.560
[Guest]: very deeply. Words like popular categories, like popular culture. I work with the category

02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:02.560
[Guest]: called vernacular art. All these things are deeply, deeply problematic and deeply important

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:08.440
[Guest]: because they've shaped entire art worlds. So after independence, any, the who goes to

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:13.040
[Guest]: art school, very often they're people who come from well-off families. They also might

02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:17.520
[Guest]: come up, it's a great melting pot also from other kinds of families, people who have some

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.440
[Guest]: modicum of education, at least let's put the common denominator is there. It's primarily

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:29.320
[Guest]: men also, because women have always have practiced some form of art or the other in India, either

02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:35.680
[Guest]: embroidery if they're middle-class women or cooking or painting of some kind like alpana

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:40.320
[Guest]: or these are certain. So certain art forms like Tagore's great intervention was to say

02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:45.800
[Guest]: all of these forms could become part of the curriculum of Shantiniketan. And we could

02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:52.040
[Guest]: have an institution called Sriniketan that would also cultivate these forms. So art is

02:28:52.040 --> 02:29:00.420
[Guest]: being defined by that institution to be in a much broader way. It's when MS University,

02:29:00.420 --> 02:29:04.480
[Guest]: this is our art world. I'm going to talk about our art world because our meaning, the art

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:12.820
[Guest]: world we have here in India. So when we have MS University Fine Arts Department set up,

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:22.080
[Guest]: it is set up with a great nobility of intention. Hansa Mehta was a great woman and she was

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:30.700
[Guest]: deeply involved in setting up the program. The early people who were behind it, like

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:36.540
[Guest]: Markand Bhatt, who had come from the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia back, had spent

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:42.300
[Guest]: a lot of time with great modern, the modernist collection there. So there was an idea of

02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:49.580
[Guest]: what would constitute not the Bombay progressives, not the Shantiniketan way of being progressive,

02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:55.080
[Guest]: not the colonial art school way of being. What would be this new language that would

02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:59.260
[Guest]: be taught here? So of course, there were all sorts of things that happened there. K. G.

02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:04.820
[Guest]: Subramaniam insisted on bringing lots of craft and Gulam Ahmed Sheikh, who also taught there

02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:12.620
[Guest]: later on, was very interested in promoting an engagement with Indian manuscript painting.

02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:18.780
[Guest]: But in the process, and there were people like Bhupen Kakkar who were not formally trained

02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:29.500
[Guest]: but were deeply interested in using the medium of painting to talk about unbelievably complex

02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:36.220
[Guest]: things like being a gay man in middle-class Baroda. And he wrote lovely short stories

02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:42.660
[Guest]: as well. And he wrote lovely short stories. And when I think of his painting, You Can't

02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:51.780
[Guest]: Please All, I just cry. I cry. It's this man looking out, his naked body on a balcony looking

02:30:51.780 --> 02:31:02.340
[Guest]: out into the square. And it's based on that parable of the donkey and people wanting to

02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:07.220
[Guest]: be in conformity so much that they want to please all. And he's standing there reflecting

02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:12.540
[Guest]: on all of this and realizing at that moment in life, it's a gray man. It's not a young

02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:17.520
[Guest]: body that's in that painting. You can't please all. And I saw this for the first time in

02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:23.540
[Guest]: person at the Tate when they had the exhibition there. And I really think that all these possibilities

02:31:23.540 --> 02:31:29.220
[Guest]: were there and they continue to be there. But we did not have an art market like this.

02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:37.980
[Guest]: We had ideology. Ideology and we had teaching lineages. We had cross affiliations. So if

02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:41.100
[Guest]: you went to Shantiniketan, you might come to teach at Baroda and then go back to teach

02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:45.180
[Guest]: at Shantiniketan. You might go and teach in Rajahmundry or in Vishakhapatnam or start

02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:51.900
[Guest]: a school in Hyderabad or wherever. But the art market really starts growing. So if we

02:31:51.900 --> 02:32:00.380
[Guest]: look at an institution like Kemold in Bombay, it created a place for people to sell paintings,

02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:06.900
[Guest]: but it didn't see itself as constructing an investor's market. There was no possibility.

02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:16.820
[Guest]: The TIFR, Homi Bhabha and the Tatas, they were the big patrons of art in Bombay and

02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:21.460
[Guest]: they made institutional collections which are now unbelievably valuable in terms of

02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:27.420
[Guest]: monetary ideas. But when the art market comes, and this is where we must go back to our dear

02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:35.660
[Guest]: Karl Marx, capital changes social relationships. So social relationships, what is an art world

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:42.980
[Guest]: but a set of social relationships that are founded on capital. And here, it's very important

02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:48.340
[Guest]: to keep marking out distinction. And in this way, it's no different from books, it's no

02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:57.420
[Guest]: different from music. It's just that the realm, the geographic expanse of art making that

02:32:57.420 --> 02:33:03.780
[Guest]: comes out of formal art academic teaching. Do you know only 2% of students who graduate

02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:10.340
[Guest]: from art schools actually become professional artists in the sense of showing work in galleries?

02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:15.220
[Guest]: The rest of them become set designers, they might do puja pandas, they might become graphic

02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:24.220
[Guest]: designers, they might do animation, they might do so many other things. So this 2% is, but

02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:29.020
[Guest]: so the largest population of artists are not these artists. They're the artists who do

02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:34.700
[Guest]: temple sculptures and who do this and this and this and this. Remember, the largest population

02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:42.420
[Guest]: after farmers in India is weavers and textile workers. So if we look at the idea of culture

02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:49.060
[Guest]: work as one idea and art production in the gallery sense of it is just one facet of it.

02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:52.880
[Guest]: First it changes our framework. Now you're talking about people feeling like why am I

02:33:52.880 --> 02:34:03.580
[Guest]: left out of the game? And it is a game in some sense, an economic game. Because it's

02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:10.340
[Guest]: a market and so many people, and I'm not the person who can speak the most interestingly,

02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:16.540
[Guest]: but you'll get yourself an art gallerist who is willing to talk honestly. Their words are

02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:22.980
[Guest]: worth are like pure bouillon compared to mine, because they really know the inside information

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:23.980
[Amit Varma]: and things.

02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:26.420
[Amit Varma]: But you know what they would say, so you can tell me.

02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.860
[Guest]: I don't know if I know what they would say, but I would say that I know how they're positioned

02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:40.020
[Guest]: to some extent. What I feel is that the way that the art world developed in India in the

02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:46.100
[Guest]: last, let's say, 20-30 years is not the way Camel started. It's not the way a Mary Boone

02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:55.920
[Guest]: in New York or Alfred Stiegler or any of these great supporters. What you have is a bunch

02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:06.340
[Guest]: of people who are kind of interested in something. So a lot of culture work in India is supported

02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:19.100
[Guest]: by industrial families through their women in their family. It's a gendered project culture.

02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:23.820
[Guest]: And this is not going to make anyone happy, but I must say this. I'm not the only one

02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:26.700
[Guest]: to say it, but I will say it.

02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:32.020
[Guest]: Till very recently, much of this fine art world that you're talking about was supported

02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:39.260
[Guest]: by black money. Now, this is black money coming from buyers. It's black money that artists

02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:44.660
[Guest]: are being paid, and it's black money that's being laundered through this business called

02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:57.740
[Guest]: art, sale and resale. So when you have this, it constructs very little space for intellection.

02:35:57.740 --> 02:36:10.620
[Guest]: So how do economics impact the space for intellection in art? So there's very little room for investing

02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:18.940
[Guest]: in something that's risky. A lot of it is based on nepotism. You scratch my back, I'll

02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:29.060
[Guest]: scratch your back. A lot of it is also the situation you're talking about is based on

02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:35.300
[Guest]: obfuscating this rather mundane world. What part of India is not based on black money?

02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:46.540
[Guest]: Let's be really clear about this. Obfuscating this through opaque discourse, which is unbelievably

02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:55.620
[Guest]: unreadable. It's hard to understand. Then art education itself does not prepare artists

02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:02.980
[Guest]: to intellect about their own work. And that's the saddest thing. When we think about early

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:10.420
[Guest]: artists, they wrote their manifestos. A manifesto is a deep act of intellection. You are proposing

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:16.500
[Guest]: something. It's a propositional thing, a proposal for an art world, for a kind of art community,

02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:25.980
[Guest]: for a kind of economics, for whatever it is, a language. Many artists were also pedagogues.

02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:33.300
[Guest]: So again, you have to think this through. They also wrote books about it. Paul Klee,

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:39.580
[Guest]: KG Subramaniam, Rabindranath Tagore, all these people wrote books about what does it mean

02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:46.740
[Guest]: to teach, to make, to live, to think about art. So you have a group of people who are

02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:54.380
[Guest]: today not taught very well to intellect about their own work. So it very quickly moves to

02:37:54.380 --> 02:38:00.260
[Guest]: how do you represent yourself? Once you jump into that act of representing yourself, it's

02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:08.180
[Guest]: like you're already in a selfie place without self-knowledge. So then the people that have

02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:14.020
[Guest]: really deep self-knowledge are really spending the time thinking. Sometimes they are able

02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:20.020
[Guest]: to take up a lot of space because there's also a market for the thinking artist, the

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:24.300
[Guest]: intellecting artist. Now, whether they're thinking something deeply original all the

02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:30.260
[Guest]: time, that's a different question, but they're thinking. And I'm not sure how much originality

02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:38.380
[Guest]: is possible sometimes either. I think there's work that is so interesting that it makes

02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:43.020
[Guest]: you think about thinking. There's work that's so interesting that makes you think about

02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:49.220
[Guest]: the idea of originality. But whether complete originality in some sense of having nothing,

02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:54.460
[Guest]: no connection, sui generis emerging, I think that's almost impossible.

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:59.500
[Amit Varma]: So I think my rough provocation has led to a subtle critique from you, which kind of

02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:02.380
[Amit Varma]: went in the same direction, right? Am I right?

02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:07.380
[Guest]: I'm critiquing your critique while saying the same thing you're saying in some ways.

02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:10.940
[Amit Varma]: And thank you for that, because you'll improve my critique the next time I make it by doing

02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:11.940
[Guest]: that.

02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:16.900
[Guest]: But I think that in all of this, there are people who are making unbelievably interesting

02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:26.900
[Guest]: work. They are. And how is that possible? I'm a product of, let me put it this way,

02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:31.780
[Guest]: they're making choices that are hard choices, but in their living. I don't think it was

02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:38.340
[Guest]: easy to be Nazrin Mohammadi when everybody else was practicing a different kind of art.

02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:44.600
[Guest]: She was doing this like really, really abstract work. And I don't think she was in the pocket

02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:51.140
[Guest]: of any great institution in the West either. It took her many decades after her death for

02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:55.540
[Guest]: her work to gain that kind of recognition. And that's also the market.

02:39:55.540 --> 02:40:00.700
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so I'm going to commit you with another question where I think we won't exactly be

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:06.300
[Amit Varma]: in agreement. You've been sort of decrying and lamenting what you called industrialization

02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:11.260
[Amit Varma]: and commercialization and the market and all of those things. I would go the other way.

02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:15.020
[Amit Varma]: And I would say that for artists, I would in fact celebrate that. And the reason I would

02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:20.560
[Amit Varma]: celebrate that is that I don't think they lead as some people imply to homogenization

02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:25.580
[Amit Varma]: of culture and the death of creativity or any of those things. I think what they instead

02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:31.980
[Amit Varma]: do is that individuals get empowered in various ways through technology and otherwise, to

02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:36.820
[Amit Varma]: actually be able to express themselves in unusual ways that otherwise would not have

02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:41.020
[Amit Varma]: been open to them. In fact, I think, you know, a lot of people today with maybe a visual

02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:45.580
[Amit Varma]: imagination or someone who wants to story tell through images may not need to go in

02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:49.440
[Amit Varma]: for the fine arts. They can be filmmakers, they can do other things, which are not necessarily

02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:55.000
[Amit Varma]: lower forms of art. I mean, God knows what kind of manner Bhupen Khakkar would have expressed

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.980
[Amit Varma]: himself in and he did it brilliantly in two mediums as we spoke about, but maybe he could

02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:04.940
[Amit Varma]: have been a filmmaker, maybe he could have been a YouTube creator, for example, and I

02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:11.020
[Amit Varma]: would not, you know, look down on any of those like just speaking of my own podcast, for

02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:16.340
[Amit Varma]: example, I think commercialization, the markets, what they have done is they have put the technology

02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:21.940
[Amit Varma]: in my hands to make exactly the kind of show I want, which conventional wisdom would tell

02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:31.460
[Amit Varma]: you will not work long for our conversations with obscure scholars like me. And the conventional

02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:35.360
[Amit Varma]: wisdom would not have allowed me to do this. I have been empowered by all these things

02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:39.960
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned industrialization, commercialization, which I don't think are necessarily bad words.

02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:43.600
[Amit Varma]: I think they are good for artists because more and more people have gotten the means

02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.280
[Amit Varma]: of production in their own hands. They are not dependent on gatekeepers. They're not

02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:54.060
[Amit Varma]: dependent on like you spoke about how the cultural project today is almost like a vanity

02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:58.380
[Amit Varma]: project of the wives of industrialists. Most artists are not dependent on that. That is

02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:03.020
[Amit Varma]: not even a project that I take seriously. You know, most artists can do what they want

02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:08.220
[Amit Varma]: today. And they are empowered to do that by the fact that you know, the technology is

02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:13.100
[Amit Varma]: there, the markets are there, I can produce a show which you know, 30 years ago, I would

02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:17.500
[Amit Varma]: have been laughed out of any room of any radio station if I, you know, propose something

02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:22.780
[Amit Varma]: like this. And I can reach my viewers. And you know, they can express their appreciation

02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.420
[Amit Varma]: for it in monetary and non monetary ways. So that kind of would be my counterpoint that

02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:34.580
[Amit Varma]: I, I feel that this invocation of industrialization, commercialization is a bad thing. And I understand

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:40.340
[Amit Varma]: that in many domains, it leads to homogenization, we are losing languages, we are losing different

02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:45.740
[Amit Varma]: types of bananas, the freaking bland Cavendish banana is everywhere, because of these forces.

02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:50.420
[Amit Varma]: So I get the negative aspect of it. But I don't think that it's a death knell of art.

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:56.860
[Amit Varma]: On the contrary, I think it is what has empowered so many individual artists to do their thing

02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:01.220
[Amit Varma]: without needing to please gatekeepers or elites.

02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:21.380
[Guest]: So bravo. I don't think I'm decrying industry, industrial means. I'm not decrying the technological

02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:29.220
[Guest]: or the commercial. So when we add the word ization to industry, or commercial, we are

02:43:29.220 --> 02:43:38.720
[Guest]: talking about something else than mere industry. We're talking about a logic and ethos that

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:46.060
[Guest]: pervades every aspect. So that's something we have to keep in mind. So it's one thing

02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:56.220
[Guest]: to set up a factory. So for example, a cottage industry is a scale. It's an ethos of making,

02:43:56.220 --> 02:44:00.300
[Guest]: but it's still an industry in the way that the Indian government thought about it till

02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:13.100
[Guest]: very recently. So you might be making thousands of dias, and it's mass production. And it

02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:23.620
[Guest]: might be a cottage industry. So then an industry that produces porcelain dias on molds in a

02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:30.020
[Guest]: factory is also making dias, but they're doing it in a different way. And then if you think

02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:36.580
[Guest]: that the way of making dias in a cottage industry is a problem, and the only way to make dias

02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:44.820
[Guest]: is the one that this is making, then we know that there's a problem there. That's what's

02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:50.180
[Guest]: happened. And then there's another thing that says, this is even too expensive. You have

02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:56.460
[Guest]: to pay workers their salaries and blah, blah, blah. Let's just get LED lights from China

02:44:56.460 --> 02:45:01.260
[Guest]: and string them all over, which is what's also happening. And this takes care of the

02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:06.740
[Guest]: whole dia business. There's no mess of oil. We don't have to pay workers. It's cheap.

02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:15.380
[Guest]: It's throwaway. So it's very important to think about what something does. So let's

02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:19.700
[Guest]: go back to rap music. Let's go back to music and let's talk about rap music. Rap music

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:29.020
[Guest]: is a deeply crafted form of music that comes out of industrialized music production. So

02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:38.780
[Guest]: the idea of taking records and capturing snippets from previous records, adjusting, crafting

02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:45.620
[Guest]: them, recrafting them, retooling them, retooling the record player to become an instrument.

02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:51.460
[Guest]: All this is recrafting. It's a second order of craft. It's not a primary order of craft.

02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:56.460
[Guest]: So craft and industrialization are not opposed. There's a very great scholar whose name I've

02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:02.020
[Guest]: forgotten who talks about the fact that in the Soviet Union, when people had factories,

02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:08.220
[Guest]: these machines that they ran were industrially produced. But because the Soviet Union's economy

02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:13.700
[Guest]: was so bad, all repairs had to be done by the person that ran that particular machine.

02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:19.060
[Guest]: In the end, that machine was thoroughly handcrafted, all parts had to be remade, and only that

02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:25.620
[Guest]: person could run it because they had made it. So there isn't a linear journey here.

02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:29.580
[Guest]: So what you're saying about technology being put into the hands of many people, like for

02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:35.860
[Guest]: example rappers or you or even me, maybe I wouldn't be able to do the kind of work I

02:46:35.860 --> 02:46:43.660
[Guest]: like doing if certain things had not happened. But they also have really profound effects.

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:49.540
[Guest]: And I'm interested in understanding the effects.

02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:54.060
[Amit Varma]: So I actually think we're in agreement because we both agree that there are good aspects

02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:55.060
[Guest]: and bad aspects to this.

02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:56.460
[Guest]: Is it necessary to think about things in agreement?

02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:00.100
[Amit Varma]: We're looking at different parts of the same elephant and that's really interesting.

02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:05.820
[Amit Varma]: But I'm going to look at another part of the elephant in terms of the exact limb that you

02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:10.260
[Amit Varma]: examined of the elephant, but from another side, which is that earlier it struck me like

02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:14.060
[Amit Varma]: you when you spoke about your years in the US, and you said that you were there at a

02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:20.420
[Amit Varma]: time where one if you look at the past society had just made the massive mistake of the Vietnam

02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:21.420
[Amit Varma]: War.

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:26.980
[Amit Varma]: And yet at the same time, society could reflect upon the massive mistake of the Vietnam War.

02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:32.700
[Amit Varma]: And I had a slight disagreement with that phrasing or I found it a little simplistic

02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:40.860
[Amit Varma]: because I am wary of terms like society subsuming individuals. I think the individuals who took

02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:46.500
[Amit Varma]: America into the Vietnam War are a very different set who may not necessarily have reflected.

02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:51.220
[Amit Varma]: And the individuals who reflected are reflecting not on their own actions, but the actions

02:47:51.220 --> 02:47:52.220
[Amit Varma]: of others.

02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:58.460
[Amit Varma]: I'd rather think in terms of individuals. And I think that using group terms like society

02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:04.220
[Amit Varma]: or in a later sense, industrialization, you know, can hide some of the nuances that lie

02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:05.220
[Guest]: within.

02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:09.940
[Guest]: They have their limits. They're limit terms. They're not terms that can hold everything.

02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:15.020
[Guest]: So in America during the Vietnam War, I mean, remember, I'm only eight and a half, nine

02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:22.300
[Guest]: at that time. How did I experience remorse or regret or those sort of things? That was

02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:33.820
[Guest]: from seeing people who were, it was very narcissistic. American remorse was very narcissistic.

02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:35.340
[Guest]: That's a great way to put it.

02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:39.460
[Guest]: Yes. I'm not the first person to put it. There's a wonderful Vietnamese American writer who

02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:44.780
[Guest]: writes it about this beautifully. I forgot his name. His book got nominated for some

02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:52.380
[Guest]: major award. It was very narcissistic. You know, I was, let's say, let me put it this

02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:58.540
[Guest]: way. I was in 1971. I was five years old. I was in Bhopal and the bombs and we had to

02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:04.220
[Guest]: black out our windows in Bhopal because of the fear of bombing.

02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:10.900
[Guest]: And I never grew up in a world that was very lengthy. I'm, and I know now because I've

02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:17.060
[Guest]: seen much more of the archive that was virulently anti-Chinese or anti-Muslim. It wasn't, there

02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:23.980
[Guest]: wasn't that kind of virulent anti-Muslim rhetoric in my world about this war.

02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:33.460
[Guest]: I go to America and I see remorse or regret about Vietnam, not so much about Vietnamese

02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:40.060
[Guest]: people, but about a president who promoted the Vietnam War, Lyndon B. Johnson, and then

02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:43.940
[Guest]: less about Johnson, but particularly Nixon. Now we know the story is even more complex

02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:55.260
[Guest]: than I'm saying it now because he did Watergate and he was like this megalomaniac. It challenged

02:49:55.260 --> 02:50:02.140
[Guest]: America's ideas about its own democratic commitments.

02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:07.540
[Guest]: So the Vietnamese people were maybe a picture on Life Magazine, that young girl with her

02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:14.260
[Guest]: back burning from napalm running. Those kinds of things, but in general, and I think there's

02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:22.900
[Guest]: a lot of people, Vietnam veterans, they were vastly, how do you experience remorse? Well,

02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:28.380
[Guest]: you might drug yourself to death, alcoholism to death. And America in the 1970s, you saw

02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:31.620
[Guest]: that, you saw that in public spaces.

02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:35.620
[Amit Varma]: I was making a point about language actually, where, you know, the use of the term society

02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:41.700
[Amit Varma]: and even now you said that America's own idea of its whatever, and even that's such a general

02:50:41.700 --> 02:50:42.700
[Guest]: term.

02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:47.780
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to talk in generalizations, but then I'm going to keep working away from them.

02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:51.100
[Amit Varma]: So can I go back to your earlier point about industrialization and do that, where you said

02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:56.700
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, you spoke of industrialization and you invoked the image of millions of the

02:50:56.700 --> 02:51:00.540
[Amit Varma]: hours being produced and suddenly then you get LED lights from China and that's it. That's

02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:07.780
[Amit Varma]: not all that industrialization is. So industrialization is also giving us the microphones, the software

02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:13.500
[Amit Varma]: tools that I used to make my podcast. And if there are budding filmmakers who are making

02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:17.540
[Amit Varma]: their own short films, putting them on YouTube, all those tools, which they couldn't have

02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:21.460
[Amit Varma]: dreamed of using 20 years ago, are now in their hands.

02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:25.900
[Guest]: I think we're thinking about industrialization in two different ways.

02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:32.180
[Amit Varma]: And I'm saying that your way is perhaps reductive and not appreciative enough of the nuance

02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:34.700
[Guest]: that individuals are so empowered.

02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:41.220
[Guest]: No, I am not at all a Luddite. I am not at all a Luddite.

02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:48.020
[Guest]: I am not anti-industrial, but I am very aware that the developmentalist agenda that was

02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:53.340
[Guest]: thrust upon this country, which was so intensely committed to industrializing, I am a product

02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:59.780
[Guest]: of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, right? I grew up in an uncle who was a controller

02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:07.740
[Guest]: of Hindustan machine and tools in Hyderabad. So I'm completely a product of that world.

02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:16.700
[Guest]: But we have to be aware that the way we make things, the things we make and the way we

02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:25.180
[Guest]: make things make us. And you asked the question about why so much stuff is being made and

02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:31.500
[Guest]: called art. Why is it some stuff not being called art? It has some things to do with

02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:36.960
[Guest]: that. In fact, so many things which are not industrially, every fine artwork is actually

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:41.180
[Guest]: industrially produced. Where is that paint coming from? Who's sitting around grinding

02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:43.020
[Guest]: that paint?

02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:44.020
[Amit Varma]: But what's wrong with that?

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:50.540
[Guest]: There's nothing wrong with that. So in fact, it is very important to find out the relationships

02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:55.820
[Guest]: between different modes of production is what I'm saying, and then how they make the art

02:52:55.820 --> 02:53:03.740
[Guest]: form. So just because millions of diyas are made in a potter's workshop, diyas are made

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:09.900
[Guest]: in a factory and LED, it doesn't mean that one, it's not a teleological relationship.

02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:13.540
[Guest]: One doesn't come to an end and another doesn't come. Somebody might figure out which they

02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:25.540
[Guest]: have to wire a terracotta diya with an LED light. This is the nature of making, and I'm

02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:30.980
[Guest]: interested in that, but it's going to produce certain kinds of situations. That is exactly

02:53:30.980 --> 02:53:36.940
[Guest]: you mass produce technology, speakers, this thing, that thing at different levels. There

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:42.420
[Guest]: might be, I don't know, 5,000 such microphones made a year for this quality or whatever,

02:53:42.420 --> 02:53:46.380
[Guest]: and you have access to it and you're able to do this beautiful thing.

02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:47.380
[Guest]: Everyone has access to it.

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:48.380
[Guest]: Everyone has money.

02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:55.060
[Amit Varma]: No, no. You know, I think TikTok showed that. That TikTok for me was revolutionary because

02:53:55.060 --> 02:54:00.740
[Guest]: it showed that to be a creator, you don't need access to money.

02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:07.840
[Guest]: Everybody can be a creator. I don't want to link creativity with production. Many societies

02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:12.000
[Guest]: like the other places in the Trobriand Islands or whatever, imagine that creativity is something

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:19.420
[Guest]: that's imminent in the universe, and I believe that. We, at certain historical moments, certain

02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:25.940
[Guest]: production methods construct that creativity in certain ways and market it in certain ways,

02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:33.460
[Guest]: make it possible to come from imminence into a particular form of imminence, so a novel,

02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:36.460
[Guest]: a podcast, whatever it is.

02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:42.500
[Guest]: There are people in India who have access to certain kinds of technology, which they

02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:48.580
[Guest]: would not have had before, but the minute, for example, when COVID came, they were robbed

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:55.220
[Guest]: of the access to that. There are people who are more vulnerable to precarity, to the lack

02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:57.180
[Amit Varma]: of access than others.

02:54:57.180 --> 02:55:02.620
[Amit Varma]: I will say one thing, though, with reference to TikTok, that after COVID came, some of

02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:06.340
[Amit Varma]: the best art about COVID, which took time to emerge, was on TikTok.

02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:07.340
[Guest]: I'm glad it was there.

02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:08.340
[Guest]: It got banned two or three months after.

02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:16.380
[Guest]: I have zero opinions about certain technologies or whatever. Like, for example, I'm totally

02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:22.540
[Guest]: fascinated by cranes. We went to the JCB factory. They had a little display of their machinery.

02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:29.900
[Guest]: I was like, wow, I love cranes. But if you go to central India and you look at the mines

02:55:29.900 --> 02:55:34.600
[Guest]: there and the way that mining is happening there, you know that that place has been rich

02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:42.420
[Guest]: in mineral since the beginning of time, maybe, for eons, and that people in that area have

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:47.020
[Guest]: known how to get metal for their needs for thousands of years.

02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:55.160
[Guest]: But if you put that JCB crane—I'm going to be killed for this—and Earthmover into

02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:01.820
[Guest]: and have it produce, excavate the earth at a pace far greater than an axe or something,

02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:07.660
[Guest]: it's going to produce something else. It produces a new relationship to the earth. It produces

02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:15.620
[Guest]: a new aesthetics. I want to be attentive to that, not whether this technology is bad or

02:56:15.620 --> 02:56:21.980
[Guest]: that technology is bad or is industrialization bad or what. These things emerge in certain

02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:28.980
[Guest]: ways and are used in certain ways, and I want to understand that. I want to understand that.

02:56:28.980 --> 02:56:35.500
[Guest]: And I want to understand who wins, who loses, how are we transformed. And it's not just

02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:42.180
[Guest]: about winners and looters. I also don't like binaries. It's not about being pro-industrialization.

02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:50.220
[Guest]: It's about understanding things, not accepting them so easily or rejecting them so easily.

02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:56.940
[Guest]: It's about understanding that that's what emphasizing the dynamic things are. If things

02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:02.620
[Guest]: aren't dynamic enough, if Earthmovers today have not made it possible for people to develop—I

02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:08.100
[Guest]: don't know, I'm just making an exaggerated, silly example—new kinds of housing that

02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:13.420
[Guest]: everybody can afford very rapidly, if it's not been miniaturized enough so that lots

02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:18.980
[Guest]: of things can happen, whatever, that's because we don't care enough to do those kinds of

02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:19.980
[Guest]: things.

02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:23.620
[Amit Varma]: So on this, we are completely on the same page.

02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:27.580
[Guest]: And he wanted us to get there. That's why it was important to you to have this conversation.

02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:31.940
[Amit Varma]: No, no. I mean, it's like different angles of an elephant. We don't have to agree or

02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:36.140
[Amit Varma]: disagree or anything, like you correctly said. But we are entirely on the same page. But

02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:40.100
[Amit Varma]: I would say that the exact analogy that you made, the exact field that you spoke of mining,

02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:45.100
[Amit Varma]: I think what we've really seen over time, and you just happened to take the JCB name,

02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:48.740
[Amit Varma]: I think we should both clarify. I think I can clarify on your behalf that we have no

02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:53.140
[Amit Varma]: opinions on JCB at all, except that they run this brilliant literature foundation and more

02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:54.140
[Amit Varma]: power to them.

02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:55.140
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:57:55.140 --> 02:58:00.060
[Amit Varma]: But in general terms, I would say that something like mining illustrates how we have moved

02:58:00.060 --> 02:58:07.780
[Amit Varma]: from a parasite state to parasite crony capitalists. And in both of those cases, I think the problem

02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:13.700
[Amit Varma]: is not a conceptual problem with markets and industrialization, but with power. But that's

02:58:13.700 --> 02:58:15.100
[Guest]: perhaps a different kind of...

02:58:15.100 --> 02:58:18.060
[Guest]: Yeah, but power doesn't exist in an abstract way.

02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:19.060
[Amit Varma]: Of course it doesn't.

02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:26.860
[Guest]: It doesn't exist in a... And power is reconceptualized when new things come along. So for example,

02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:31.500
[Guest]: human beings have loved to extract things from the earth, as I said. Diamonds, Golconda

02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:38.300
[Guest]: diamonds for example. But if you have... Golconda diamonds were like this. I like the mining

02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:42.940
[Guest]: analogy because it covers a gamut. So Golconda diamonds were so precious, they could become

02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:50.700
[Guest]: a God's eyes. Kings had the first dibs on the largest stone recovered. You didn't emphasize

02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:56.900
[Guest]: faceting, you emphasized weightage. So that's why most diamonds were often limitedly faceted

02:58:56.900 --> 02:59:05.420
[Guest]: when they were put in Mughal jewelry. When the idea of faceting comes very big and new

02:59:05.420 --> 02:59:12.980
[Guest]: ways of cutting diamonds becomes important, the speed of excavation increases. And of

02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:19.140
[Guest]: course the diamond mines are now more or less dry. And then the South African horde emerges

02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:24.780
[Guest]: and diamond mining happens there in a crazy way. Now we're going to produce industrially

02:59:24.780 --> 02:59:29.940
[Guest]: made diamonds, which are called piece diamonds or something like that. And that's going to

02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:36.500
[Guest]: change the whole dynamic again. Now it's this that is really interesting and saddening and

02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:40.140
[Guest]: all this. I don't want to leave it at some detached way of interesting. I want to have

02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:48.320
[Guest]: an opinion about certain things. I want to say that lots of people were in some sort

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:57.420
[Guest]: of bonded labor in mines, but because you could only do so much with human hands and

02:59:57.420 --> 03:00:05.140
[Guest]: certain kinds of machinery, it allowed for specialization to happen and it controlled

03:00:05.140 --> 03:00:08.940
[Guest]: it in its own way, not because the intention was to control. I'm sure if there were people

03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:14.100
[Guest]: able to get more out, they would try. But there are also some religious problems. Like

03:00:14.100 --> 03:00:19.700
[Guest]: for example, you could not do everything under the earth because the... Now the earth doesn't

03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:26.700
[Guest]: have the same kind of sanctity for many people. Even indigenous people who live in certain

03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:34.180
[Guest]: parts of area are deeply involved in the extraction of wealth that was in land that was sacred

03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:40.980
[Guest]: in one way or another. Sometimes there are no heroes. And the thing is that what we need

03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:48.660
[Guest]: to understand is that when the technology of the earth mover came, it allowed for a

03:00:48.660 --> 03:00:55.420
[Guest]: set of factors, the desacralization of the earth, the creation of large markets that

03:00:55.420 --> 03:01:03.540
[Guest]: were globally networked, the intense real estatization of land. All these things came

03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:14.060
[Guest]: together. The de-emphasis on investing in human beings and thinking more upon privileging

03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:22.780
[Guest]: extraction. All these things were possible, not at one instant, but through a cascade

03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:29.380
[Guest]: of things that come together. So I like that. Just like I talked about Gurshan Singh's teacup

03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:34.660
[Guest]: as being a cascade of things at that very moment. And then everything kind of just pulls

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:43.900
[Guest]: back when you look at something else. So if I look at a podcast and I understand, say,

03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:49.860
[Guest]: recording technology and the impact it had for, let's say, the wives to record their

03:01:49.860 --> 03:01:56.340
[Guest]: voice and sing and have it recorded, I am Gauhar Jaan. Right? So it's so beautiful

03:01:56.340 --> 03:02:05.980
[Guest]: to think that when the Kerala Saint, Narayan Guru. So he wrote, for example, that, and

03:02:05.980 --> 03:02:12.220
[Guest]: this is also why I am not anti-industrializing. He says he's proselytizing to people who

03:02:12.220 --> 03:02:17.140
[Guest]: are deeply underprivileged. So the metaphor he has for the soul is that your soul will

03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:22.900
[Guest]: be, in his writing, he says that your soul will be like a steamship that goes up the

03:02:22.900 --> 03:02:30.060
[Guest]: river. Or when the rifle comes into Southern India, Kama no longer holds bows and arrows,

03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:37.140
[Guest]: he holds a rifle of love. The bullets of love are shot, right? Or pellets of love are shot.

03:02:37.140 --> 03:02:43.260
[Guest]: I think this is really important. They're just such key moments, but we cannot take

03:02:43.260 --> 03:02:48.220
[Guest]: the whole package for granted. We must break it down and remake it, break it down and remake

03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:55.300
[Guest]: it because that's how it works. But if the process of continuing something extends over

03:02:55.300 --> 03:03:00.300
[Guest]: long periods of time and people have very little agency in breaking it down, then it's

03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:07.300
[Guest]: a real, it starts becoming more often than not oppressive. So we're able to still love

03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:14.380
[Guest]: the family because it keeps breaking down. And then we put it back together in some new

03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:15.380
[Guest]: formation.

03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:20.300
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you spoke exactly to my concerns when you spoke about people not having agency,

03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:24.580
[Amit Varma]: the oppression it leads to, power, and that's a long discussion and we will do another six

03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:29.220
[Amit Varma]: hour conversation someday in this because this cannot be a last conversation. So, you

03:03:29.220 --> 03:03:33.060
[Amit Varma]: know, I'm now feeling that just in the same way that my show went from being a half an

03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:36.180
[Amit Varma]: hour show to a three hour show, it should now go to a six hour show or an eight hour

03:03:36.180 --> 03:03:40.420
[Amit Varma]: show. So you and I can do justice to the many things we want to talk about, but you have

03:03:40.420 --> 03:03:46.380
[Amit Varma]: a flight to catch. So all hail industrial flights. And I'll end with a couple of questions

03:03:46.380 --> 03:03:50.540
[Amit Varma]: which really intrigued me, things that you said earlier, while we were talking, which

03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:55.420
[Amit Varma]: I found super interesting, and I want to double click on them. And one of them, like I asked

03:03:55.420 --> 03:03:59.840
[Amit Varma]: you, what are the things you feel deep love for? And what are the things you have deep

03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:04.540
[Amit Varma]: knowledge of? And you named a bunch of things and I'll go through them. But I'll ask you

03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:09.340
[Amit Varma]: about one thing each. Like when you spoke of deep love, you spoke about places, children,

03:04:09.340 --> 03:04:14.500
[Amit Varma]: partner, family, grandfather, work, India, yoga, the way the body lives in the world,

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:18.380
[Amit Varma]: which is so fascinating, friendship. And I think through the conversation, people would

03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:22.180
[Amit Varma]: have got a pretty good sense of, you know, what all these things mean to you. But what

03:04:22.180 --> 03:04:27.100
[Amit Varma]: I was most intrigued by in this deep love section was when you said, quote, love is

03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:32.380
[Amit Varma]: my ethic, stop quote, which fascinates me. Tell me a bit about what you meant by that.

03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:38.700
[Guest]: What a great question. I didn't expect that, actually. First of all, I want to say, because

03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:43.620
[Guest]: the time will go and the time is going and I hope we will talk more and I will get to

03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:51.580
[Guest]: talk to you as much as you have talked to me. So there are many ways to be in the world.

03:04:51.580 --> 03:05:03.180
[Guest]: You can be deeply ambitious and then goal setting and those kinds of things. You can

03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:13.260
[Guest]: be focused on, let's say, morality. There's some cord you can pick up and say, this is

03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:22.460
[Guest]: going to become the ethic of my life. I think that love is a profound ethics because it's

03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:31.500
[Guest]: not easily holdable. So it kind of, you can't control it. I mean, let's think about the

03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:39.020
[Guest]: time when Sufi ideas of love enter into popular culture in India sometime around Amir Khusrow's

03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:46.900
[Guest]: time. That's the 12th century. So he writes a song called Chaap Dilak, which is a song

03:05:46.900 --> 03:05:56.700
[Guest]: in praise of his beer, his ustad, a beloved. And that song is still being sung today. And

03:05:56.700 --> 03:06:04.020
[Guest]: it's the song that people use to talk about the radical nature of music or love or anything.

03:06:04.020 --> 03:06:14.780
[Guest]: It's so deeply, deeply powerful. So if I say that love is very, it's an ethic, it means

03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:23.300
[Guest]: that you do things, you find the love inside of you. You find a loving position in which,

03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:27.260
[Guest]: with which to do mundane things, to which to do hard things, which things which you

03:06:27.260 --> 03:06:34.420
[Guest]: don't like, things which have to be done, things to let things go. You must. It's a

03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:41.460
[Guest]: way of engaging with life because you can make life about many things. But if you choose

03:06:41.460 --> 03:06:48.720
[Guest]: to make a life, the ethics, the ethics of life, love, it changes many things. The woman

03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:56.660
[Guest]: who started the Me Too movement, Tarana Burke, she was sexually molested when she was young.

03:06:56.660 --> 03:07:03.780
[Guest]: Or maybe it was Tarana Burke and some other people involved in that movement. One of these

03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:12.700
[Guest]: people said that she met the boy who sexually molested her much later in life. And what

03:07:12.700 --> 03:07:16.780
[Guest]: she realized was, or maybe it was an older person, I forget, because there were several

03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:22.100
[Guest]: instances, it's after all the Me Too movement, so it's going to come from somewhere. She

03:07:22.100 --> 03:07:32.620
[Guest]: said that she didn't have any idea of punishing them. Because what was it that they could

03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:38.700
[Guest]: be punished with that could possibly give back to her what was taken away from her?

03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:46.780
[Guest]: I thought that was such a loving way of understanding yourself and your loss. So this is what I

03:07:46.780 --> 03:07:56.260
[Guest]: mean about love, being in ethics. I think that a lot of times I practice silence because

03:07:56.260 --> 03:08:06.900
[Guest]: that's the most loving thing I can do. Because if I talk, speech, words, there's not enough

03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:14.780
[Guest]: love in any word to actually bring about the love that is required. So there are choices

03:08:14.780 --> 03:08:22.420
[Guest]: you make. You talk about agency and it's so important to you. And I'm totally with you.

03:08:22.420 --> 03:08:27.780
[Guest]: You have to give yourself the intention. What is being intentional? It is to be agentive.

03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:34.860
[Guest]: I am intending to cook a nice meal today. I would like my child to have a nice tiffin

03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:41.860
[Guest]: box. So that's an intention that's coming from love and care. So that means you don't

03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:48.100
[Guest]: wait till 7.45 when the school bus is coming to cook that nice meal. You buy the groceries.

03:08:48.100 --> 03:08:52.980
[Guest]: You get the gas in place. You make sure that you have the time, that you have the knowledge,

03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:57.620
[Guest]: that you understand your child's environment at school. What is it possible for them to

03:08:57.620 --> 03:09:04.620
[Guest]: eat? All these things are part of being loving. So it's a profound ethos.

03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:10.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm fascinated. You should, you know, the second time today, intentionality is coming

03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:15.340
[Amit Varma]: up the first time in the context of noticing and now in the context of love that it's not

03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:19.220
[Amit Varma]: something that you just spontaneously feel, but you make an effort. You make a look at

03:09:19.220 --> 03:09:25.580
[Guest]: the beautiful aspect. You cannot force yourself. Effort is different from force. Deeply different.

03:09:25.580 --> 03:09:30.540
[Guest]: You cannot. A lot of people force themselves to swallow shit that is completely not worth

03:09:30.540 --> 03:09:36.900
[Guest]: the swallowing and also very unloving to the self and to the other person. I believe civil

03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:43.820
[Guest]: disobedience is a profound act of love. I really believe in that. And I practice satyagraha

03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:48.060
[Guest]: in many parts, including as a parent. Sometimes my kid does stuff I don't like. I practice

03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:56.100
[Guest]: civil disobedience with her. So there's no reason why I have to do this, even engage

03:09:56.100 --> 03:10:03.460
[Guest]: in a conflict with you just because you're my child. I told my students when I would

03:10:03.460 --> 03:10:09.020
[Guest]: turn up, fly from Delhi to Hyderabad to teach them once a week for three days and fly back

03:10:09.020 --> 03:10:14.780
[Guest]: and they couldn't be bothered to come on time. I said, I am here today. They came maybe two

03:10:14.780 --> 03:10:19.500
[Guest]: hours into the class or one hour into the class. I would come from the airport, land

03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:25.300
[Guest]: in Hyderabad, drive directly to class with my suitcase, be ready to teach. They wouldn't

03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:30.540
[Guest]: turn up. This happened enough times. Then I said, I've met my contractual obligations.

03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:36.860
[Guest]: I have been here. There is no where in my contract that says I have to teach when you

03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:43.860
[Guest]: are not here. So I'm going to practice civil disobedience. And somehow that sort of started

03:10:43.860 --> 03:10:49.460
[Guest]: touching them a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. I practiced it

03:10:49.460 --> 03:10:55.540
[Guest]: in several ways. But yes, I think love is a deeply ethical. It's an ethics. Love is

03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:56.540
[Amit Varma]: an ethics.

03:10:56.540 --> 03:11:00.820
[Amit Varma]: So I'm reminded of a couple of things and one is from what you just said, civil disobedience.

03:11:00.820 --> 03:11:04.540
[Amit Varma]: The very dear friend whose house I'm staying at in Delhi, Mohit Satyanand, he told me the

03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:09.980
[Amit Varma]: story of once how next door to him, there was this sort of office or a working environment

03:11:09.980 --> 03:11:13.660
[Amit Varma]: and people would go out and I forget exactly what it was, either leave cigarette butts

03:11:13.660 --> 03:11:17.300
[Amit Varma]: in the road or leave teacups, one of those two, and they would just leave it there. And

03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:21.500
[Amit Varma]: he asked them politely once, can they please not litter? And they didn't do it. So the

03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:25.020
[Amit Varma]: next day he went out and he collected everything that they had littered and he put it away

03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:30.620
[Amit Varma]: himself. And he did it a couple of times and it completely stopped. And the other example

03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:34.380
[Amit Varma]: is from this great book I'm reading called Think Again by Adam Grant, where he talks

03:11:34.380 --> 03:11:39.820
[Amit Varma]: about this African American piano player called Darryl Davis, who goes to a gig in Maryland

03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:46.100
[Amit Varma]: in 1983. And over there, he just does a great gig. And after that, a white gentleman comes

03:11:46.100 --> 03:11:50.420
[Amit Varma]: up to him and says, wow, that was amazing. And he realizes that the white gentleman is

03:11:50.420 --> 03:11:56.100
[Amit Varma]: a member of the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan, but they have a drink together. And then he starts

03:11:56.100 --> 03:12:01.740
[Amit Varma]: talking to the guy, asking him questions and so on. And the guy eventually reforms, not

03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:06.940
[Amit Varma]: just reforms, gets his other white supremacist friends. And, you know, and over a period

03:12:06.940 --> 03:12:11.860
[Amit Varma]: of time, there is this change that is happening just because you're talking to this person

03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:16.460
[Amit Varma]: and he's talking to them. And this leads me in a bit of a digression, but this leads me

03:12:16.460 --> 03:12:21.100
[Amit Varma]: to something I've come to realize more and more, that the hate that we have within us

03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:26.140
[Amit Varma]: is for abstract things, that when we encounter them in the concrete, we don't hate them.

03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:30.100
[Amit Varma]: You know, you will, for example, Achal in her episode, Achal Malhotra told me about

03:12:30.100 --> 03:12:34.620
[Amit Varma]: how when she was in Pakistan, people would rant and rave against Hindus, but then they

03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:38.420
[Amit Varma]: would notice she's there and she said, tum nahi beti, tum theek ho, tum nahi. So in the

03:12:38.420 --> 03:12:43.180
[Amit Varma]: concrete, I know a lot of people who are bigots on Twitter, in the concrete, they'll be nice

03:12:43.180 --> 03:12:47.780
[Amit Varma]: to their Muslim friends, but treat them like exceptions. And the problem is when abstract

03:12:47.780 --> 03:12:52.860
[Amit Varma]: concepts like nationalism and race and all this nonsense gets into it, that there is

03:12:52.860 --> 03:12:57.980
[Amit Varma]: hatred. And when I read this, you know, incident about Darrell Davis, which is in the sixth

03:12:57.980 --> 03:13:03.660
[Amit Varma]: chapter of Grant's book, I just thought that this is such a great example of these bigots

03:13:03.660 --> 03:13:07.980
[Amit Varma]: who hate a particular kind of person. But when they meet a person like that in the concrete,

03:13:07.980 --> 03:13:15.140
[Guest]: they can be changed, you know? So I often feel that it's a good idea. I don't know if

03:13:15.140 --> 03:13:20.740
[Guest]: love is transactional or not transactional, ethics are relational or not relational. I

03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:25.980
[Guest]: know that, I know the ideas behind those kinds of ideas. I'm not interested in them at a

03:13:25.980 --> 03:13:32.740
[Guest]: point as a way of living. I'm interested in them maybe in a mild way to read about them.

03:13:32.740 --> 03:13:41.740
[Guest]: But actually, love as ethics means that you are both deeply aware of the dynamism of life

03:13:41.740 --> 03:13:51.020
[Guest]: and also deeply non-transactional. Otherwise, transaction itself can be a deeply loving

03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:57.020
[Guest]: thing. So the first time I often go to a new place, I go shopping. Nothing spectacular.

03:13:57.020 --> 03:14:03.340
[Guest]: I love the love that you exchange at a very simple level. Koi bhi threatening cheez nahi

03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:11.620
[Guest]: hai. Aapne ek dal muri kharid liya. You bought a nariyal paani or you bought a set of bangles

03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:20.240
[Guest]: or maybe a pot or something. And you find out so many things about yourself and the

03:14:20.240 --> 03:14:28.220
[Guest]: other person in that transaction. But there is a way to do that transaction in a non-transactional

03:14:28.220 --> 03:14:35.020
[Guest]: way. That's the loving part. You're attentive to the attention he's giving you. You're attentive

03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:40.860
[Guest]: to how he positions that project. I mean, I can go on and on. It's unnecessary. But

03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:45.980
[Guest]: I really feel like that's a good way to live for me. It works.

03:14:45.980 --> 03:14:51.260
[Amit Varma]: So my next question is related. What I also then asked you about is what do you have deep

03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:55.740
[Amit Varma]: knowledge of? And you mentioned a bunch of things which we will explore in our next conversation

03:14:55.740 --> 03:14:59.660
[Amit Varma]: together, which I hope you will be kind enough to allow me at some point. But you mentioned

03:14:59.660 --> 03:15:06.540
[Amit Varma]: things like teaching, individuals, ideas, this country, cooking, textiles. But you also

03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:10.700
[Amit Varma]: at this point while talking about this said another interesting thing which I want to

03:15:10.700 --> 03:15:14.180
[Amit Varma]: dig down on. And you said, quote, knowledge and love are not far apart.

03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:21.500
[Guest]: Yes. Oh, what a beautiful way to wrap up this conversation. Thank you. I just love this

03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:29.460
[Guest]: country. My parents moved to America and they became American citizens. My sister was born

03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:35.740
[Guest]: there. She's an American citizen. I have this extremely thick middle Atlantic accent because

03:15:35.740 --> 03:15:41.180
[Guest]: along with changing my name, they put me into speech therapy because I did not have.

03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:45.300
[Guest]: I have no problem. I just kind of reflect on this thing happened to me. I have no problem

03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:50.420
[Guest]: with it, but it's not something I can shed very easily because it came and was so ingrained

03:15:50.420 --> 03:15:55.980
[Guest]: in me. So even now I have this accent when I talk.

03:15:55.980 --> 03:15:58.180
[Guest]: The white doll your grandfather could not throw away.

03:15:58.180 --> 03:16:03.140
[Guest]: The white doll grandfather could not throw away, which has become me in some way. My

03:16:03.140 --> 03:16:11.980
[Guest]: grandfather wasn't around then. So I love this country and I have to love it like this

03:16:11.980 --> 03:16:18.420
[Guest]: with the American accent. And I get into so many unpleasant situations because people

03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:25.220
[Guest]: judge me a lot because I wear saris or I have this accent or I have white hair. If you want

03:16:25.220 --> 03:16:32.440
[Guest]: to start judging people, there are hundreds of ways to do it, right? And when I step out

03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:39.060
[Guest]: into this country, this is a moment like another sanskari moment for you. So we get everything

03:16:39.060 --> 03:16:45.820
[Guest]: connected. So I went to the 2012 Kumbh Mela. I was asked by my friend Ranveer Shah to come

03:16:45.820 --> 03:16:51.340
[Guest]: and talk to some students that had come from an American university there. And of course

03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:54.940
[Guest]: there's lots of free time and then you walk around and you watch all the sadhu babas and

03:16:54.940 --> 03:17:03.940
[Guest]: sadhvis and everything. And I noticed that at one particular place, grouping of sadhus,

03:17:03.940 --> 03:17:09.220
[Guest]: there was a guy from Japan with all his jeta jhuta and everything and there and then there

03:17:09.220 --> 03:17:15.060
[Guest]: was another place that was a guy from California. And as I kept walking, I was there for three

03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:20.020
[Guest]: days and I walked and walked and walked through the Kumbh Mela and I realized that India is

03:17:20.020 --> 03:17:29.280
[Guest]: still a place where you could be on the far horizon of consciousness or desire or want

03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:34.700
[Guest]: that people believe India is a place you can come to and you can be that and you can maybe

03:17:34.700 --> 03:17:42.180
[Guest]: make a community out of it. So I love that. So I know this about this country because

03:17:42.180 --> 03:17:47.660
[Guest]: I have, I'm a person from Andhra Pradesh but I grew up in Bhopal and Hyderabad and I lived

03:17:47.660 --> 03:17:52.820
[Guest]: in Bangalore for many years and I also lived in Delhi and I lived in Punjab, many places.

03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:58.500
[Guest]: What I love about what I love about this country is I feel like there's a possibility of making

03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:05.260
[Guest]: a community and because we are 1.3 billion people, your community can be pretty big.

03:18:05.260 --> 03:18:09.220
[Guest]: And I think that's important. For me, that's important that people have an opportunity

03:18:09.220 --> 03:18:13.260
[Guest]: to do that if they want. So better or worse, it's there.

03:18:13.260 --> 03:18:16.300
[Amit Varma]: I was actually drilling down on the quote, knowledge and love are not part of it.

03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:21.460
[Guest]: So I'm coming to that. I'm coming to that. So these are these observations. And then

03:18:21.460 --> 03:18:26.580
[Guest]: when I started, looked at myself making such observations, I said, why is this possible

03:18:26.580 --> 03:18:36.380
[Guest]: for me? That's because I know this country so well. I have been on the Indrail Pass twice

03:18:36.380 --> 03:18:40.820
[Guest]: and traveled across this country. I have lived in Northern India. I have lived in Southern

03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:46.940
[Guest]: India. I have spent vast amounts of time in Calcutta. I have lived in rural India. I work

03:18:46.940 --> 03:18:51.700
[Guest]: on many different things associated with various pockets of this country. I know it and know

03:18:51.700 --> 03:18:57.140
[Guest]: it and know it and know it. And at a point, I can't tell you where my love begins and

03:18:57.140 --> 03:19:02.300
[Guest]: where my knowledge ends and where my knowledge begins and where my love begins. Where else

03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:05.140
[Guest]: could I live that I know this well?

03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:10.940
[Amit Varma]: This is a beautiful way to end the episode. Annapurna, thank you so much. Annapurna, Apoorna

03:19:10.940 --> 03:19:15.740
[Amit Varma]: and Anna, the white dog and Sandy. And Bhavani. Not just in names, but we contain multitudes

03:19:15.740 --> 03:19:19.940
[Amit Varma]: in so many different ways. And I guess knowledge of them is what brings the love, right? So

03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:20.940
[Unknown]: thank you so much.

03:19:20.940 --> 03:19:24.500
[Unknown]: Thank you so much for having me.

03:19:24.500 --> 03:19:28.460
