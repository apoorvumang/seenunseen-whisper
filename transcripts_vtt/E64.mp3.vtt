00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
[Unknown]: What does it mean to be free?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.600
[Amit Varma]: What do individual rights mean and where do they come from?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
[Amit Varma]: What values should we use to guide our behavior?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.840
[Amit Varma]: What is the relationship between citizens and the state?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Why is taxation equal to part-time slavery?

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:34.560
[Unknown]: What does it mean to be libertarian?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.880
[Amit Varma]: This is a special episode in the sense that the conversation you will hear was not recorded

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.040
[Amit Varma]: for this podcast and I am the interviewee, not the interviewer.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
[Amit Varma]: About a month ago, I appeared as a guest on the Pragati podcast.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.800
[Amit Varma]: I air it in an online magazine of commentary called Pragati at thinkpragati.com and one

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.560
[Amit Varma]: of our podcasts, hosted by my colleagues Pawan Srinath and Hamsini Hariharan, is called the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.760
[Amit Varma]: Pragati podcast.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, I am known as a libertarian, although I try to avoid labels these days because they

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.960
[Amit Varma]: have all become debased and caricatured.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.720
[Amit Varma]: But when Pawan invited me to talk about my libertarianism, I figured that it's a good

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.960
[Amit Varma]: chance to explain what my first principles are and where I get my values from.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.220
[Amit Varma]: Forget all the isms.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.080
[Amit Varma]: My beliefs revolve around respect for the autonomy of other people.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.880
[Amit Varma]: And it all boils down to one word, consent.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: I elaborate on that in the discussion, but before we go there, I'd like to apologize

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: to all listeners of the Scene and the Unseen who have already heard that episode of the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.600
[Amit Varma]: Pragati podcast.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.160
[Amit Varma]: Our data shows that there is not much overlap between listeners of the two shows and the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Scene and the Unseen gets a lot more listeners at the moment.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.480
[Amit Varma]: So I thought it's a good chance to introduce the Pragati podcast to you guys, as well as

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.360
[Amit Varma]: put this conversation up.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320
[Amit Varma]: So without much further ado, here's a chat I had with Pawan.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.400
[Guest]: Amit, thanks for coming on the show.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.160
[Amit Varma]: Pawan, thanks for having me on the show.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.800
[Amit Varma]: Our roles are reversed, you might note, since I've interviewed you so many times for the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
[Guest]: Scene and the Unseen and now it's the other way around.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.400
[Guest]: Yes, it's a pleasure to have you on the Pragati podcast.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.520
[Guest]: I think you were there on the first episode and then now you're back after quite a few

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520
[Amit Varma]: episodes, I think.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but I was only ever a guest host, never a guest per se, so be nice to me.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.160
[Guest]: All right.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.120
[Guest]: So Amit, tell me, are you a liberal or a libertarian?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.600
[Guest]: What description do you prefer?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, I could call myself both, but I don't like using any of those terms

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
[Amit Varma]: now.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: The thing with liberal is that I am what you would in the 19th century have called a liberal

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.880
[Amit Varma]: and in Europe still in the European sense, I'd be a liberal.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.360
[Amit Varma]: That is today called a classical liberal because the term liberal has mutated meaning so often

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.840
[Amit Varma]: and means something completely different, if not the opposite in some places.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And classical liberalism really started with during the Enlightenment with John Locke.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's really the foundation of libertarianism as well, that they're kind of very close together.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And I think both classical liberalism and libertarianism fit me, but I don't like using

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.040
[Amit Varma]: either of those terms anymore.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.840
[Guest]: OK, but it would be safe to say that you are in favor of more and more liberty.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Yes, but, you know, let me let me indulge me for a moment and I'll just elaborate on

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.760
[Amit Varma]: why I don't like even the word libertarian, because, you know, people talk of libertarianism

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.880
[Amit Varma]: as, you know, just another ism where you have a certain worldview and a way of looking at

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.560
[Amit Varma]: the world and you believe in certain things which, you know, other people believe in other

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.520
[Amit Varma]: things and maybe they can be falsified.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.520
[Amit Varma]: And what you think of facts right now might not be facts tomorrow.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.080
[Amit Varma]: But none of that really fits where I come from.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.320
[Amit Varma]: Like for me, it's not a way of looking at the world, but adherence to a certain value.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.740
[Amit Varma]: And that value can really be summed up in one word.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.440
[Amit Varma]: And that word is consent.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So all of libertarianism or all of what I know it to be or all of what I believe in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.640
[Amit Varma]: eventually circles round and comes down to the word consent.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.240
[Guest]: Okay, expand on that a little, because usually when we talk about libertarianism or liberty,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.000
[Guest]: I think people come back to the idea of freedom, but you seem to be reframing it as consent.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Freedom also works.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But again, freedom is a sort of a nebulous thing and people define it in various different

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.320
[Amit Varma]: While consent to me seems to encapsulate it perfectly and there's really no perverse way

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.400
[Amit Varma]: of using it.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.000
[Amit Varma]: But let me then go back, go back to first principles.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, you can come to libertarianism through two parts.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll take you through both of both of those parts.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.320
[Amit Varma]: And the first part begins by going back to first principles as articulated by John Locke

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.040
[Amit Varma]: during the Enlightenment, where John Locke spoke about what we now call in brief, the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280
[Amit Varma]: right to self ownership.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is part of a body of what is called natural rights, where people believe that,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.080
[Amit Varma]: okay, these are rights that we are all born with, and no one may take them away from us

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.440
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's perfectly fine if you don't believe in natural rights, if you believe that rights

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.240
[Amit Varma]: have no meaning in and of themselves, but are instead a system that are given by society

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.400
[Amit Varma]: to its members and so on.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.920
[Amit Varma]: Even if you don't believe in natural rights, the fact of the matter is that you have to

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.320
[Amit Varma]: have some framework of rights, which is agreed upon by society or states at large, and what

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.920
[Amit Varma]: should that framework be?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.720
[Amit Varma]: And for me, that framework corresponds pretty exactly with John Locke's articulation of

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.040
[Amit Varma]: natural rights.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.560
[Amit Varma]: So so let me go through what that is, Locke believed that the most basic right that everyone

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.640
[Amit Varma]: is sort of born with is the right to self ownership.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.720
[Amit Varma]: Because when you're born, you're not you're not owned by anyone, you're not owned by your

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.520
[Amit Varma]: parents, you're not owned by society at large, or whatever, all of that makes no sense.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.920
[Amit Varma]: You own yourself.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And he framed that as a right.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And to him, all legitimate rights arise from that your right to self ownership exists as

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.240
[Amit Varma]: long as you respect the corresponding rights of others, and all rights which arise out

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
[Amit Varma]: of self ownership.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.160
[Amit Varma]: For example, your thoughts are yours alone.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, when you express them the right to free speech, that comes out of the right

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.040
[Amit Varma]: to self ownership.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.640
[Amit Varma]: If you mix your labor with something, you get the right to property.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And that again arises out of the right to self ownership.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.160
[Amit Varma]: And all these kinds of rights are called negative rights, in the sense that to respect these

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.720
[Amit Varma]: rights, somebody has to not do something to you.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.720
[Amit Varma]: So your right to free speech means that no one can shut you up, your right to property

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.960
[Amit Varma]: means that no one can steal from you, which is why these are called negative rights.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.520
[Amit Varma]: And again, rights is one of those terms which has been sort of become corrupted over the

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.760
[Amit Varma]: years because today rights, you know, there's another class of rights taking off from Isaiah

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.800
[Amit Varma]: Berlin, which are positive rights, he spoke of negative and positive freedoms, pretty

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.520
[Amit Varma]: much the same thing, positive rights, where people talk about the right to food or the

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.360
[Amit Varma]: right to education, and so on.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.580
[Amit Varma]: And all of those rights are actually entitlements.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.080
[Amit Varma]: And giving them the language of rights is problematic, because the only way you can

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.200
[Amit Varma]: fulfill a positive right is by infringing someone's negative right.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.840
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you say that XYZ has a right to food, and therefore the government has

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.520
[Amit Varma]: to provide him food, to get him that food, the government then has to get the money for

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.320
[Amit Varma]: the food from someone and infringe his negative right.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.120
[Amit Varma]: So while it may be desirable that everyone should eat and everyone should get educated,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.200
[Amit Varma]: framing it as a right is problematic, but I've kind of taken a sort of a digression.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'll go back to what I was, I'll go back to negative rights and

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.440
[Guest]: So Amit, just to clarify on this, so if you're saying that you have a right to life, a negative

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.440
[Guest]: version of that right would be that no one has the right to take away your life.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.320
[Guest]: But a positive version of it could be that in order to live your life, you might need

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.720
[Guest]: a few things and the government or the state might provide them.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.720
[Amit Varma]: Bang on, precisely, precisely.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's a very good clarification.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.280
[Amit Varma]: All negative rights imply that nobody should be able to do anything.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, the right to life means no one should be able to kill you.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:25.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, the problem arises that if you claim these rights, you know, you can have a society

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.680
[Amit Varma]: where it's not as if everyone will agree to live this way, someone.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the classical liberal view is that someone needs to be there to protect

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640
[Amit Varma]: your right.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's the government or the state per se.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.820
[Amit Varma]: And the state needs to exist only to the extent that it protects negative rights and does

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.080
[Amit Varma]: nothing else.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.840
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost what I call the liberal paradox, that on one hand, you say that your right

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.480
[Amit Varma]: should not be infringed.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.800
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, your rights cannot be protected unless they are infringed to

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.780
[Amit Varma]: at least some extent, which is the extent that the state needs to exist and take taxes

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.680
[Amit Varma]: from you, which is which is the origin of sort of the classical liberal construct of

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.200
[Amit Varma]: the state, which is called the night watchman state, for example, that this is all they

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200
[Amit Varma]: do.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.320
[Amit Varma]: They protect the rights of their citizens, and otherwise they let their citizens interact

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.040
[Amit Varma]: in whatever ways and they don't interfere unless somebody's rights are being infringed.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.360
[Guest]: So this night watchman formulation is very interesting for me.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.020
[Guest]: So can you expand on that metaphor?

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.800
[Guest]: So what does a night watchman version of the state look like?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.760
[Amit Varma]: So a literal night watchman is someone who protects something, right.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.640
[Amit Varma]: So a night watchman version of the state would basically be the police and the defense.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:52.520
[Amit Varma]: They would protect you against external threats with defense and the police, which would have

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.560
[Amit Varma]: a monopoly on violence and would make sure that nobody's rights are infringed and there

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.040
[Amit Varma]: would be a justice system, you know, making sure that the rule of law means something

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.520
[Amit Varma]: so that if someone does infringe someone's rights, you have a way of dealing with that.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:13.400
[Amit Varma]: You have a way of punishing the offender and, you know, reducing incentives for further

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.160
[Amit Varma]: offenses to happen and so on and so forth.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, a lot of people would say that, no, no, no, no.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.520
[Amit Varma]: But the government's job is, you know, education is a good thing.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.680
[Amit Varma]: The government should provide education or roads are a good thing.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.200
[Amit Varma]: The government should do roads or statues are a good thing.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.160
[Amit Varma]: We should have statues of great leaders and the government should build that.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.600
[Amit Varma]: But the important thing to note is that the government is not a benign presence which

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.560
[Amit Varma]: exists on its own.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.400
[Amit Varma]: Every act of government is an act of violence.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.840
[Amit Varma]: Everything that a government does is funded by money forcibly taken from individuals.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, think of it this way, we take the government and therefore the resultant taxes for granted.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.360
[Amit Varma]: But if you're being taxed 30 percent of your income through direct plus indirect taxes,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.760
[Amit Varma]: what that basically means is that if you're giving one third of your income away in tax,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.880
[Amit Varma]: you're working one third of the year, four months for the government, for four months

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.760
[Amit Varma]: you're effectively a slave.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.520
[Amit Varma]: So all taxation is really part time slavery, which we take for granted.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And the liberal paradox is that to be able to live as free citizens, we accept a certain

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.000
[Amit Varma]: amount of this infringement on our property and this part time slavery because, hey, we,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.380
[Amit Varma]: you know, that's almost a necessary evil.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.520
[Amit Varma]: But then the question is that everything that the government does is at that cost.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.760
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we should think about it very carefully.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760
[Amit Varma]: It's it's not enough.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.760
[Amit Varma]: Pavan, if you were to tell me that, hey, you know, Amit, we should build a statue in Bangalore

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.280
[Amit Varma]: of so-and-so, a great hero of mine.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.360
[Amit Varma]: And my answer to that would be that if you think that the government should build a statue,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.260
[Amit Varma]: then do it with your money.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.440
[Amit Varma]: Why force me to part with mine and not just me?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.280
[Amit Varma]: Every citizen of this country pays indirect taxes.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Even a beggar at a traffic signal will, you know, buy some salt or buy some soap at some

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040
[Amit Varma]: point in time.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And they're paying taxes on that.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.960
[Amit Varma]: So to build your statue or to do whatever your vanity project is to fulfill your values,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.400
[Amit Varma]: you are taking money out forcibly from somebody else.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and the morality of that is questionable.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.880
[Amit Varma]: And the reason we can do this is that there is a disconnect in our minds.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.240
[Amit Varma]: We think that we don't realize or it's not explicit that everything that the government

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.480
[Amit Varma]: does is at the cost of money taken from us and at the cost of our freedom.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.320
[Guest]: Amit, I understand the security angle, right?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:35.020
[Guest]: So the government has to have sufficient resources to maintain a monopoly over violence.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.760
[Guest]: But what about other things like public goods?

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.360
[Guest]: I understand your argument that if the government wants to build a statue or if they want to

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.440
[Guest]: do a handout, if they want to make a scheme of some sort, they do end up taking taxes.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.680
[Guest]: But what about pure public goods?

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.080
[Guest]: For example, connectivity, you know, clean air, there are lots of things that governments

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.760
[Guest]: inevitably will end up having a role in playing, right?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.460
[Guest]: Because markets are not necessarily very good at providing for these things.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.320
[Guest]: People don't necessarily want to pay for something like this and want to be a free rider.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I think everyone can agree that look, a statue is a waste of money.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.340
[Amit Varma]: Everyone can also agree that there are certain public goods, which it's hard to envisage

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.240
[Amit Varma]: them coming about through markets.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.480
[Amit Varma]: So I would actually argue there's no such thing as a market failure if you allow markets

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480
[Amit Varma]: to function.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.120
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, I think rather than take a hard stand on this and say that, no,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:38.380
[Amit Varma]: the government should only do this, what I prefer to do is I prefer to get into any kind

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.280
[Amit Varma]: of discourse with the common understanding that let's understand that every government

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.000
[Amit Varma]: action has a cost.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And then once you recognize the cost, then you can debate the benefits because then you

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.840
[Amit Varma]: are taking those counterfactuals into account.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.600
[Amit Varma]: And you're saying that, okay, so if the government spends its money on XYZ, it has a cost.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.800
[Amit Varma]: This is a cost.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:05.280
[Amit Varma]: And once you keep the cost in mind, then you can have a reasoned conversation and reasonable

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.200
[Amit Varma]: people can disagree on the extent of what the government should do.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.040
[Amit Varma]: Everybody agrees no statue.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.240
[Amit Varma]: Everybody agrees that yes, police, but should there, for example, be more airports?

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's something where you can have a reasoned argument.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.200
[Amit Varma]: But all those arguments should have at its basis, the understanding that there is a cost

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.800
[Guest]: to any government action.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.320
[Guest]: All right.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.920
[Guest]: But you know, the sometimes I wonder if we can look at the government in a slightly different

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.320
[Guest]: way in that it is a another institution, which is a mechanism of cooperation in society.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.360
[Guest]: And so government is one type of a cooperative system with different roles and responsibilities.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.480
[Guest]: A corporation would be something else.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.800
[Guest]: So how do they conflict with the freedoms of an individual?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.240
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of the times your employer is also infringing on your freedoms quite a lot,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240
[Amit Varma]: So here's the deal.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:09.280
[Amit Varma]: First of all, I agree with your articulation of government as part of, you know, that whole

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.200
[Amit Varma]: thing that helps society to cooperate.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.400
[Amit Varma]: But insofar as it maintains a rule of law, the difference is in what is voluntary and

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.760
[Amit Varma]: what is not.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.520
[Amit Varma]: And here again, like, you know, eventually by the end of this episode, I'll come to why

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.520
[Amit Varma]: consent.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.800
[Amit Varma]: But the cardinal sin for any classical liberal or libertarian is therefore coercion.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.640
[Amit Varma]: Now the thing is, when I join a company, I join a company voluntarily.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.520
[Amit Varma]: It has certain rules and regulations.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.880
[Amit Varma]: I join according to that.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.640
[Amit Varma]: I promise to abide by that.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.840
[Amit Varma]: If my employer insists that I stay in office between nine to five, then he is not infringing

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.840
[Amit Varma]: on my freedom.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840
[Amit Varma]: I have agreed to that.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.460
[Amit Varma]: And if he forces me to do something that is beyond the terms of my contract with the company,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.460
[Amit Varma]: then I have recourse.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.460
[Amit Varma]: I can sue.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Or I should be able to sue.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.840
[Amit Varma]: In India, the rule of law is so bad that often the legal recourse can become meaningless.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
[Amit Varma]: But I should be able to sue.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a voluntary interaction.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.680
[Amit Varma]: With the government, on the other hand, nothing is voluntary.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.800
[Amit Varma]: Nothing is coercive, and the whole approach of the government is not that we are here

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800
[Amit Varma]: to serve you.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.960
[Amit Varma]: We are here to protect your rights.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you are our masters.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.840
[Amit Varma]: That's not the approach of the government.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And especially in India, we take granted this Maibab government that rules over us.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240
[Amit Varma]: They are our rulers.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what happened in 1947 was we replaced one bunch of rulers with another bunch of

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760
[Amit Varma]: rulers.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Only the color of the skin was different.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.160
[Amit Varma]: And we went on like that.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.800
[Amit Varma]: And I would argue in many ways, the bunch of rulers who replaced them, and I'm not talking

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.200
[Amit Varma]: about specific political parties, because every single political party that's ever been

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.960
[Amit Varma]: in government has this approach.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.880
[Amit Varma]: But in many ways, post-independent Indian governments have been far more oppressive

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880
[Amit Varma]: than the British were.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.580
[Amit Varma]: For example, the salt tax that Gandhi protested when he went on the Dandi March was a fraction

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.160
[Amit Varma]: of what it is today in independent India.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.960
[Guest]: So fair enough.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.680
[Guest]: But how do I put this?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:13.000
[Guest]: It is like, how do we look at the system where, look, it is not possible to engineer a government

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.600
[Guest]: where consent is there through and through, right?

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.240
[Guest]: For example, we are born into this world.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.960
[Guest]: So say there is a constitution, there's some rule of law.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.680
[Guest]: As we are born, it's not like we can consent to the existing state of affairs and say that

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.220
[Guest]: we have opted into this ecosystem, right?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.060
[Guest]: So everyone sort of starts without consent.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.360
[Guest]: So how do you, how do we engineer this right?

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360
[Amit Varma]: That's absolutely right.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, whenever people accuse me of chasing some libertarian utopia, I have to

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.560
[Amit Varma]: point out that no, I'm not chasing a utopia in the sense that I'm not saying that we should

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.700
[Amit Varma]: be in this, that the world should suddenly turn into this ideal world where everybody

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.680
[Amit Varma]: has complete consent and no rights are infringed.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.440
[Amit Varma]: The fact of the matter is that we are born without having a choice in the matter, in

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.960
[Amit Varma]: this country, in this current system that we are in, and we have to then negotiate that.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.720
[Amit Varma]: And as citizens who care about freedom, it's then important to raise our voice against

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120
[Amit Varma]: any kind of injustice in any context.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.840
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, as a writer, I don't, in my columns, try to give utopian solutions.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.640
[Amit Varma]: Instead, I try to move one step at a time, like, you know, when I propose, for example,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.080
[Amit Varma]: a reform or a public policy, I'll always try to make sure that the reform I'm proposing

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.320
[Amit Varma]: either reduces the role of government, or if it keeps the role of government the same,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.440
[Amit Varma]: it makes it more efficient by introducing market mechanisms, for example.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And so you've got to kind of do this fight one step at a time, you can't just withdraw

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.520
[Amit Varma]: from the world and go into a cave and, you know, that doesn't work.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.360
[Amit Varma]: This is a world we are in, and it is our duty as citizens and as individuals, it is our

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.120
[Amit Varma]: duty to ourselves to constantly keep fighting for our freedom and keep reminding others

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.880
[Amit Varma]: that we are not free.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's important.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.000
[Amit Varma]: But you know, that this is just sort of one aspect of it.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Like I said, that when I arrive at consent, or when I arrive at libertarianism, you can

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.880
[Amit Varma]: arrive at it from two directions.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.120
[Amit Varma]: Yes, tell us about the second one.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you can arrive at it from two directions.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And one direction, of course, is the one I just articulated, which is where you're coming

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.920
[Amit Varma]: at it from first principles and the right to self ownership and so on, whether or not

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.320
[Amit Varma]: you regard that as a natural right.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.120
[Amit Varma]: But the other direction is the direction of outcomes.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, I'm not a utilitarian, I don't like utilitarianism, because you can really rationalize anything

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560
[Amit Varma]: with it.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, utilitarianism, I think, runs up against Hayek's knowledge problem.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:40.060
[Amit Varma]: And to put that in simple language, utilitarianism means that you judge events by their outcomes.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.680
[Amit Varma]: But the problem is that outcomes are always messy.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.120
[Amit Varma]: Every action has unintended consequences, you never know what they're going to be.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.360
[Amit Varma]: And utilitarianism can be used to justify absolutely anything.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.600
[Amit Varma]: But if you take a broad sweep of history, and you look at what freedom does, I would

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:04.560
[Amit Varma]: argue that freedom leads to the best outcomes for society, in every sense, but not just

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.640
[Amit Varma]: for the economy, but for cultures.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that is something that is counterintuitive.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, we evolved, humans evolved in prehistoric times when they lived in small tribes in times

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.120
[Amit Varma]: of scarcity, and we evolved to instinctively think of the world in zero sum ways.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.560
[Amit Varma]: So if I gain something, you necessarily lose that something because there's only so much

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.680
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.520
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is that the world is positive sum, in the sense that, you know, the example

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.160
[Amit Varma]: I keep giving so much so that people who read me probably find it tiresome by now.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.000
[Amit Varma]: But I cite the libertarian thinker John Stossel, he had written a column where he spoke about

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.440
[Amit Varma]: something called the double thank you moment, which is basically this, let's say I go to

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Starbucks to buy a cup of coffee, which costs 180 bucks at all Americano I have, I buy the

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.840
[Amit Varma]: cup of coffee.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.640
[Amit Varma]: And as I hand them the money, they say thank you.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.660
[Amit Varma]: And as they hand me the coffee, I say thank you.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.660
[Amit Varma]: And both of us mean it.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And the reason is that both of us benefited, it's not that only one party benefited.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.400
[Amit Varma]: So it's a double thank you moment.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.640
[Amit Varma]: And every voluntary interaction in the world, whether economic or monetary or otherwise,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.840
[Amit Varma]: every voluntary interaction between two people takes place when both people benefit.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.520
[Amit Varma]: No one has to lose for the other one to win.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.680
[Amit Varma]: In this case, I value the coffee more than the money I paid for it.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.040
[Amit Varma]: They value the money more than the coffee that they made for me.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.440
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what happens is that the more you allow these voluntary interactions and

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:33.300
[Amit Varma]: more people gain, this is both true socially, where you ideally want a lot of free speech

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.040
[Amit Varma]: where people can interact with each other in various ways and so on and so forth.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:44.140
[Amit Varma]: And also in terms of economics, where you have the more of these voluntary transactions

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.880
[Amit Varma]: you have, the more little positive, some games which lead to benefits for everybody.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's how economies grow, countries grow, cities grow, which is why that, you know,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.400
[Amit Varma]: there's almost a direct correlation over 250 years that as free markets spread across the

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.800
[Amit Varma]: world, prosperity spread in exactly that way.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, this is why cities, for example, are the most prosperous places in any country,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.120
[Amit Varma]: giving a lie to the absurd notion that population density is a bad thing.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.680
[Amit Varma]: Population density is a great thing because it leads to more such voluntary interactions,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.880
[Amit Varma]: larger networks, more value for everybody being created.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And the corollary of this is that the more the government interferes in such voluntary

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.440
[Amit Varma]: interactions, the more it harms society.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.400
[Amit Varma]: So when a government interferes in the free market, for example, it's bad in two aspects.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.160
[Amit Varma]: One of course is a moral aspect, which I spoke about earlier, that if two consenting adults

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.360
[Amit Varma]: should be able to do whatever they want with each other, that should hold true, whether

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.520
[Amit Varma]: it's in the bedroom or in the marketplace.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.760
[Amit Varma]: It's morally wrong to interfere between those two consenting adults.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And the second argument is a consequential argument, the utilitarian argument that you're

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.560
[Amit Varma]: reducing the amount of value in the world when you do that, which is why government

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.480
[Amit Varma]: regulation of markets is so problematic and always counterproductive.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:08.200
[Guest]: Thanks for saying that, Amit, because I think even in India, where you can argue that our

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.560
[Guest]: freedoms are severely restricted in many spheres, there's always been some amount of intellectual

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: support for the idea of, you know, your social and personal freedoms, about speech, about,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.120
[Guest]: you know, your right to live your life the way you want to, where you live, where you

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.680
[Guest]: work, etc.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:32.680
[Guest]: But the idea of economic freedoms somehow has never become very important in the Indian

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.360
[Guest]: political landscape or in the public imagination.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360
[Guest]: Why do you think that is?

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:43.120
[Guest]: I mean, why is there no public support for increasing the freedom for us to engage in

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.480
[Guest]: the business that we want to buy what we want and to sell what we want?

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.480
[Amit Varma]: Because we build narratives that separate them.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, it is common for the left to support all the personal freedoms that you

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.760
[Amit Varma]: and I support, but oppose free markets and on various different reasons and say, no,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.560
[Amit Varma]: the government needs to regulate this or the government needs to regulate that and get

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.360
[Amit Varma]: in the way of voluntary interactions there.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.360
[Amit Varma]: And equally, on the other side, you know, the right will might pay lip service to free

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360
[Amit Varma]: market.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Though in India, we've never had an economic right.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.200
[Amit Varma]: In India, every single government, including the current Narendra Modi government, is a

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.800
[Amit Varma]: far left government, which does not believe in economic freedoms.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.240
[Amit Varma]: But the right doesn't believe in personal freedoms in India also in terms of free speech

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.800
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's because this sort of narrative of left and right has been imposed upon us, or

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.960
[Amit Varma]: this narrative today of nationalist versus liberal, which is a ridiculous binary as well.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is that these narratives, to me make no sense.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, looking at the world in terms of left wing and right wing is nonsensical, especially

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.960
[Amit Varma]: in India, where there is really no left wing when it comes to no right wing when it comes

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.780
[Amit Varma]: to economic freedom, everything is left.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:57.880
[Amit Varma]: But the way I prefer to look at the world is more in terms of freedom and in terms of

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.020
[Amit Varma]: freedom and coercion, you know, authoritarian and libertarian, so to say.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.880
[Amit Varma]: And using these terms is problematic because people associate terms like liberal and even

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.040
[Amit Varma]: libertarian today has become a tarnished term because, you know, people who call themselves

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.880
[Amit Varma]: libertarian in America, some of them have, you know, gone over to the alt right and there

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.280
[Amit Varma]: will be people who call themselves libertarian here who have said they support Modi, which

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.720
[Amit Varma]: is absurd to me.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, it doesn't make any sense because, hey, consent, coercion, you know, those principles.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.040
[Amit Varma]: So now I'm known as a libertarian and that's what people call me and I wish there was some

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040
[Amit Varma]: other label.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.840
[Amit Varma]: But the truth is that I just go back to first principles all the time.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, everything for me comes down to being against coercion and giving importance

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320
[Amit Varma]: to consent.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.320
[Guest]: Okay.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:46.400
[Guest]: I want to bring, broach upon another topic that's related, where, you know, no matter

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.960
[Guest]: what values you believe in, there is some sort of a locus of identity that is there

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.200
[Guest]: in part of any philosophical outlook, right?

00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:01.840
[Guest]: So for example, the communists think of the worker and a collective of the workers as

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:07.440
[Guest]: an entity and sort of focus on, you know, how they can be benefited best.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:15.480
[Guest]: You know, people who believe in Hindutva think about the larger Hindu population as one somewhat

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.360
[Guest]: monolithic community, which needs to be given special importance to.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.200
[Guest]: In that sense, what would you focus on?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, I absolutely abhor identity politics of any kind, whether it is on the left or

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.240
[Amit Varma]: the right, which is why, you know, in their ways of looking at the world, I don't find

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.440
[Amit Varma]: the bhakts very different from the woks.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, they're dividing the world into categories and identities and somebody is

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.680
[Amit Varma]: an enemy and someone's a friend and there is oppression somewhere and blah, blah, blah.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.920
[Amit Varma]: The truth is, as the old cliche goes, the smallest minority is an individual.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.400
[Amit Varma]: So I look at everything from the point of view of every individual.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, you can and one binary that is true and is not a false binary is group rights

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.880
[Amit Varma]: and individual rights.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.720
[Amit Varma]: You can either believe in group rights or individual rights.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.000
[Amit Varma]: If you believe in group rights and if you say that we should think of people in terms

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.360
[Amit Varma]: of groups and look for their welfare and so on, then you are necessarily ignoring individual

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.400
[Amit Varma]: rights, you know, and that's a problem to me.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think we need to go beyond identity and think in terms of individual rights.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And of course, some might argue that, look, identity politics has dominated the world

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.440
[Amit Varma]: so far.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.400
[Amit Varma]: If you want to protest a certain kind of identity politics, how do you do that without getting

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.040
[Amit Varma]: into identity politics?

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And my reply to that always is that you do that by fighting for individual rights, by

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.640
[Amit Varma]: insisting on individual rights.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.560
[Amit Varma]: That's the only way you do it, to not think at the level of the individual is to then

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.680
[Amit Varma]: condescend to every individual and say that, no, I won't see you for yourself, you're part

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680
[Amit Varma]: of a group.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the sins of your group must be visited upon you.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And if we wish to give special privileges to the group, which will, of course, be coercively

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.120
[Amit Varma]: taken from somewhere else, then that comes to you as well and so on and so forth.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's a dangerous way of thinking.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I think it perpetuates hatred and ill will within communities and within groups.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800
[Amit Varma]: And right.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.700
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I think that identity politics is one of the things that is really wrong with

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.040
[Amit Varma]: our political discourse today.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040
[Guest]: Right.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.520
[Guest]: I think it's quite a bit more useful to think in terms of interests rather than identities,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
[Guest]: right.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.600
[Guest]: So, for example, you know, you follow a keto diet.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.120
[Guest]: So therefore, you have an interest in ensuring that, I don't know, the right kind of meats

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.480
[Guest]: are available across the country.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.320
[Guest]: Somebody else might have a different interest, somebody likes to run every day.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.080
[Guest]: So you know, you might have an interest in having adequate infrastructure for running.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.280
[Guest]: So so in that sense, interests are multiple and people can align themselves differently

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.760
[Guest]: in the political space with just interests, right.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.120
[Guest]: So because I mean, it's not right to wish interests away.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.920
[Guest]: But the idea is to sort of try and move away from compulsory identities that are imposed

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.040
[Amit Varma]: on groups of people.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040
[Amit Varma]: That's very well said.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And it's very wise.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't have said it better.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you entirely.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Look, all of us have different interests and all of us voluntarily can do whatever we want,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.480
[Amit Varma]: as long as there's no coercion involved.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.840
[Amit Varma]: So, for example, you know, I'm in Mumbai, you're in Bangalore.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And every time I go to Bangalore, I'm blown away because you have such a nice keto community

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760
[Amit Varma]: there.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760
[Amit Varma]: You have so many keto options.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.800
[Amit Varma]: I have less of them in Bombay and and therefore it stands to reason that I would want to sort

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.280
[Amit Varma]: of convert more people to keto.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.240
[Amit Varma]: I say convert like it's a religion, but it's not.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.880
[Amit Varma]: It's the only healthy way of living.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.500
[Amit Varma]: But so bring bring people around to my point of view.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.080
[Amit Varma]: But it should not at any point involve coercion.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't even mind if you think in terms of identities, because as long as there

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:42.220
[Amit Varma]: is no coercion involved anywhere else, and as long as you're not demonizing another class

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.160
[Amit Varma]: of people entirely or shutting them up.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.160
[Guest]: Okay.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.600
[Guest]: So I think we've sort of circled around this, but can you walk us through how all is liberty

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.120
[Guest]: important or how is it being infringed in India today?

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:04.520
[Guest]: So in 2018, we are sort of here after a decade of high economic growth, a couple of decades

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.560
[Guest]: of some economic and personal freedoms being loosened.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, there are new threats coming in, right?

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't even know where to begin because our freedoms are infringed in so many ways.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Number one, there is a myth that we have a liberal constitution in the good sense of

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.120
[Amit Varma]: the word liberal, but I'm not sure we do.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:28.840
[Amit Varma]: Our constitution doesn't really protect free speech, for example, because Article 19A and

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.280
[Amit Varma]: it pays lip service to free speech, but it also lays out all these caveats like decency,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.280
[Amit Varma]: public order, and so on.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And because of those caveats, we have old IPC laws that the British made to control

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.600
[Amit Varma]: us like 295A and 153A, which essentially clamped down on free speech.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.520
[Amit Varma]: And there's nothing we can do about them.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.640
[Amit Varma]: I think it's, for example, unbelievable and shocking that in 2018, 377 is still on the

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.640
[Amit Varma]: cards.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And we are saying that an entire sexual orientation is effectively illegal.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that kind of sex is illegal.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.320
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't say that being homosexual per se is illegal, but effectively, that's what 377

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320
[Amit Varma]: does.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And it's unbelievable that in 2018, we should be in that kind of situation.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And equally in terms of economic freedom, I mean, first you look at, you look at two

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.640
[Amit Varma]: aspects of what the government does to us.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Number one, in the economic sphere, number one, you look at what they take from us.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, taxation is much higher than it should be, both indirect and direct.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's because the government spends a lot more on useless things than it should.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, our government is a large but weak state where it should be a small but strong

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360
[Amit Varma]: state.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.880
[Amit Varma]: It should be small, but the areas it is small in, like law and order, like defense, it should

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.880
[Amit Varma]: be strong.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Instead, it is weak in those areas.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And it does a hundred other things where it is basically a parasite state, figuring out

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.560
[Amit Varma]: ways to sort of suck blood from the people.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I know that sounds dramatic, but that's really what it is.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:59.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's again, if you're paying one third of your income in taxes, you're basically

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.560
[Amit Varma]: a slave to the government for four months of the year.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.360
[Amit Varma]: There's no other way of looking at that.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And as we've argued before, some amount of that may be necessary.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.520
[Amit Varma]: But to me, it would be a fraction of the amount that we're giving out now.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.040
[Amit Varma]: That's one aspect, what the government takes from you.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.320
[Amit Varma]: And so on, the other aspect in the economic sphere is all the many infringements on the

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.360
[Amit Varma]: economic freedoms of citizens, all the interference that it does in markets.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, look at the state of our poor farmers.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Amit Varma]: You look at the state of our farmers now, 71 years after independence, and it makes

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
[Amit Varma]: you want to cry.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.080
[Amit Varma]: And why is it like this?

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.480
[Amit Varma]: It's like this because our farmers have been trapped in farming by bad policy.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'd encourage listeners to, you know, go to seen unseen.in and look at the very

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.720
[Amit Varma]: first episode of the scene in the unseen, where you were one of my guests along with

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.160
[Amit Varma]: Karthik Sheshadar and we discussed agricultural reforms.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.440
[Amit Varma]: And in various ways, you know, farmers are not allowed markets in any aspect, how they

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.200
[Amit Varma]: get their produce, where they sell their produce, you know, in terms of pricing or anything

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.760
[Amit Varma]: that kept in a constant state of dependency.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.560
[Amit Varma]: They can't sell agricultural land for non agricultural purposes.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.040
[Amit Varma]: So they can't even escape, you know, a few episodes back in the scene in the unseen,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.800
[Amit Varma]: my guest Shruti Rajgopalan had spoken about this being one of the ways in which the caste

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.520
[Amit Varma]: system perpetuates itself, because people find it hard to simply escape physically,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And agriculture is, of course, the most egregious example.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's somewhere where, you know, in 91, there were no reforms that touched agriculture

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.720
[Amit Varma]: or touch factor markets and large parts of the country are still hugely poor for that.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, this link isn't direct, this link isn't obvious.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, if if you ask a farmer himself, that what do you want from the government,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.680
[Amit Varma]: and he's in desperate states, and he'll say, Oh, I want a farm loan waiver, which is all

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.680
[Amit Varma]: well and good.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:50.920
[Amit Varma]: But a farm loan waiver basically traps a farmer in his current state of poverty, quite apart

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:56.400
[Amit Varma]: from the fact that you have, it's also paid for by other people, you know, I'm like, government

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.760
[Amit Varma]: does so many things I shouldn't do, like run businesses, run banks, I mean, who is paying

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.320
[Amit Varma]: for need of Modi power, you and I are paying for need of Modi's and Vijay Mallya's theft,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.800
[Amit Varma]: which is the only word for it.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's a theft that has happened in collusion with the government.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.240
[Amit Varma]: There's no way around it directly or indirectly.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, there's hardly anything I can not complain about.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.200
[Amit Varma]: But what makes me most sad is that this is not in the public discourse, I you know, I'm

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.760
[Amit Varma]: a completely lonely voice in the public discourse.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.360
[Amit Varma]: This is people are not questioning all these fundamental things about the government, the

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.840
[Amit Varma]: mindset that the government is a solution to everything, even when the government has

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.680
[Amit Varma]: actually created the problem in the first place, is embedded in people, the you know,

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.160
[Amit Varma]: the mindset of the MyBab government is embedded.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you think about, you know, just one example, which, you know, got a lot

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.560
[Amit Varma]: of public heat in the last few years, people talk so much about corruption.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.360
[Amit Varma]: And if you think about corruption, what causes corruption, it's discretion, you give a set

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.980
[Amit Varma]: of people power over other people, they will use that power.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.080
[Amit Varma]: Because power corrupts, they will make money.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.240
[Amit Varma]: And yet the solution that most well meaning people come up with is, oh, you, the solution

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.520
[Amit Varma]: is more government, that you have a Jan Lokpal or you have a, you know, another committee

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.040
[Amit Varma]: over the hundred committees already there.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.240
[Amit Varma]: And that doesn't help anything that adds to the problem.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:15.480
[Amit Varma]: To solve the problem, what you need to do is you need to take away power from the government

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.720
[Amit Varma]: and give it back to the citizens.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's how you solve that particular problem.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.760
[Amit Varma]: And people don't have a consciousness of this, they keep looking at the government as a solution

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.480
[Amit Varma]: to everything.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.340
[Amit Varma]: And, and I feel really sad about that, and I wish there was some way I could make these

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.160
[Amit Varma]: ideas a little more popular.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Maybe this podcast will help, who knows.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.160
[Guest]: All right.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:42.480
[Guest]: But, you know, I've seen that, you know, people often have different fears, and often that

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.560
[Guest]: is also reflective of their philosophies, right.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:52.840
[Guest]: So for example, if someone's a someone believes in, say, communism in India today, they might

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:59.440
[Guest]: probably fear, I don't know, they might fear religion and the religious identity as a source

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.440
[Guest]: of violence.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.520
[Guest]: They might fear, I don't know, big corporations coming and doing nasty things.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.480
[Guest]: So in that sense, is there a fear that is important to you?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Can you rephrase that?

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.200
[Guest]: I mean, what fear exactly?

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.440
[Guest]: Like a fear of a very large government in a sense, a fear of people taking violence

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.680
[Guest]: into their own hands.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.560
[Guest]: But I mean, I know that it's a slightly negative way of looking at everything.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.360
[Guest]: But there are often certain deep seated fears or concerns that motivate us, right?

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because you know why?

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Because the government hasn't done its basic job of providing a rule of law and from saving

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.800
[Amit Varma]: us from these fears is a one fundamental role of the government, that, you know, if he knew

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.480
[Amit Varma]: that the government always will look after our rights and the rule of law will be maintained

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.800
[Amit Varma]: and my free speech will always be protected, then I would not fear anything.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:54.240
[Amit Varma]: But if it doesn't do that, then, of course, different groups in different places will

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.240
[Amit Varma]: fear things.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:00.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, the Hindutva people who value their religion will fear that communism will erode

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.400
[Amit Varma]: away their traditions or left liberals will fear that, you know, the Hindutva parties

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.440
[Amit Varma]: will impose their views on the rest of the country, including them.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.520
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that those fears are taken care of if there is a rule of law and if the

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.760
[Amit Varma]: government is strong enough and if the constitution provides enough safeguards, then they don't

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
[Amit Varma]: need to fear.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Then the Hindus can celebrate their culture and the liberals can have the freedom that

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.840
[Amit Varma]: they should have and everybody's happy.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.040
[Amit Varma]: But the government doesn't do its job at a fundamental level.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.760
[Amit Varma]: So people have these fears and you name big corporations.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.640
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to kind of address another point that, you know, people often demonize free

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.000
[Amit Varma]: markets by saying, oh, but then big corporations will take over and they will run the country

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.720
[Amit Varma]: But the truth is that big corporations hate free markets.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.400
[Amit Varma]: What big corporations really want is their turf to be protected, which is why, for example,

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.360
[Amit Varma]: just before independence, when Nehru asked a group of industrialists, and this was famously

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.480
[Amit Varma]: known as the Bombay Club or the Bombay Plan, I forget which, to suggest what should be

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.200
[Amit Varma]: done for the country, they wholeheartedly suggested what he was going to do anyway,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.880
[Amit Varma]: which was a closed economy, because that would protect them.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.440
[Amit Varma]: So people don't get that free markets and companies are on two opposite ends of the

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.440
[Amit Varma]: spectrum.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.120
[Amit Varma]: So what happens is a free market, the way I define it, is a market where all voluntary

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.960
[Amit Varma]: interactions are protected by the government.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.280
[Amit Varma]: There is the rule of law, whereas what you often see in crony capitalism or crony socialism

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.640
[Amit Varma]: or cronyism, to put it simply, rather than get into an argument, is that you have a very

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:32.080
[Amit Varma]: powerful government which uses its power to benefit big corporations, whether it's the

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.520
[Amit Varma]: Reliances or the Adanis or whatever, whatever you choose to believe in, but benefit different

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:43.000
[Amit Varma]: big corporations in different ways, and not allow incumbents to come up, not allow the

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.160
[Amit Varma]: guy at the bottom of the ladder the economic freedom that he deserves, while taking his

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.240
[Amit Varma]: money and redistributing it to richie-riches at the top, like the Nirav Modi's and the

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.920
[Amit Varma]: Vijay Mallya's.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.680
[Amit Varma]: So big companies are not synonymous with free markets, they're in fact the very opposite.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.920
[Amit Varma]: Free markets basically mean every common citizen of this country being able to voluntarily

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.960
[Amit Varma]: interact with anybody he wants to in any way, provided there is no coercion and provided,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.920
[Amit Varma]: to get back to that magic word, there is consent all around.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920
[Guest]: All right.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:21.520
[Guest]: So, Amit, given that liberty and the values around consent and freedom are sort of reducing

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.000
[Guest]: right now, at least in most parts of the world, is there anything that you are optimistic

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: about?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.160
[Guest]: Is there anything that makes you hopeful?

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.840
[Amit Varma]: I think what makes me optimistic to some extent is a technology.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.320
[Amit Varma]: I think technology empowers individuals where political struggles haven't.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, commuters in all Indian cities have suffered for a long time because of scarcities

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.560
[Amit Varma]: of public transport, because the government provided public transport is so bad, and because

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: you have the government interfering in public transport in terms of limiting the licenses

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.240
[Amit Varma]: given to taxis and auto rickshaws and blah blah.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.240
[Amit Varma]: So if you're in Delhi, for example, you would never go anywhere by meter, you would have

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.000
[Amit Varma]: to negotiate a price with the guy.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.240
[Amit Varma]: In Bombay, sometimes a guy would just refuse to come where you want to.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly, bang, technology came in terms of these app based services like Uber and

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Ola and empowered individuals.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, now I don't need to worry at all about getting a transport at any time of the

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.600
[Amit Varma]: day to go anywhere.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.500
[Amit Varma]: I'm just giving you one small example.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.900
[Amit Varma]: So in many ways, there is a hope that technology will empower individuals in ways that ironically

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:31.320
[Amit Varma]: political struggles have failed to do, but also going beyond that, I take courage from

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Martin Luther King's words to paraphrase him that you know, but the arc of history, and

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I think the arc of history, one would hope does bend towards freedom right now you have

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.760
[Amit Varma]: a lot of populism in the world and you have guys like Trump and Modi and Erdogan and so

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.840
[Amit Varma]: on in charge, but one hopes that in the long run, citizens will express themselves more

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.920
[Amit Varma]: and fight more, which I think is happening to some extent, and that they will be empowered

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.920
[Amit Varma]: by technology.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And of course, it cuts both ways.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we can talk forever about all the trade offs involved.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And many of these things are unknown unknowns, you know, you and I can't possibly imagine

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.560
[Amit Varma]: what the politics of the future and the technology of the future even 10 years from now will

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.800
[Amit Varma]: look like is beyond our imagination.
