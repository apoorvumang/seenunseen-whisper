00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
[Amit Varma]: One of the greatest signs of privilege in the modern world is how many things we take

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.800
[Amit Varma]: for granted.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Looking at myself, for example, I take it for granted that I have a roof above my head

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.360
[Amit Varma]: and will have one for the foreseeable future.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.800
[Amit Varma]: I can eat when I am hungry.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.520
[Amit Varma]: I will always have access to drinking water.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a friend of mine recently pointed out that thanks to technology, the next generation

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.880
[Amit Varma]: will never know what it is to be lost.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Imagine that, GPS Zindabad.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Well, today's episode is about water, which is something that people like me are lucky

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.960
[Amit Varma]: enough to take for granted, while millions in this country are not.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, usually things get better.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.880
[Amit Varma]: But in this regard, matters might actually get worse.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.560
[Amit Varma]: We think of water as an endless resource.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.200
[Amit Varma]: But could India actually be running out of water?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.640
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.760
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: In one sense, India has had a water crisis for decades.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.320
[Amit Varma]: Millions of Indians don't have access to clean drinking water.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.680
[Amit Varma]: But those who run the country take it for granted.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.240
[Amit Varma]: I always assumed, though, that the issue here was distribution.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.480
[Amit Varma]: I thought, well, we have the ocean on three sides, we are a land of rivers.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.460
[Amit Varma]: It's just a question of using technology to make all this water drinkable and then distributing

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.460
[Amit Varma]: it efficiently.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.640
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered while recording this episode, that my notions about water were completely

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.200
[Amit Varma]: wrong, and that we might be headed for a water crisis.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.920
[Amit Varma]: My guest for this episode is Vishwanath S. He is well known on Twitter as Zen Rain Man,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.080
[Amit Varma]: and has been an activist for water conservation for over three decades.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.440
[Amit Varma]: I'd heard a lot about him.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And as I didn't know anything about the subject, I invited him over for an episode.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.040
[Amit Varma]: We recorded this in Bangalore a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Listen, Vishwanath, thanks so much for coming on the scene and the unseen.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840
[Amit Varma]: Pleasure.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Vishwanath, you worked in the field of water conservation and in the field of water generally

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.720
[Amit Varma]: for more than three decades now, 32 years, 32 years.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And these days, there's been a lot of news about Bangalore's water wars, and so on and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240
[Amit Varma]: so forth.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Can you contextualize our current problems for me a little bit?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040
[Guest]: That's interesting.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.160
[Guest]: India is a bit peculiar as compared to other countries when it comes to how it accesses

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.480
[Guest]: water.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.560
[Guest]: One striking example for me, which has driven me to work in this particular sector also

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.120
[Guest]: has been the dependence on groundwater.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.400
[Guest]: We have close to 33 million wells and borewells.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.080
[Guest]: We take out 250 cubic kilometers of water, that's groundwater every year.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.680
[Guest]: So this is far more than what the next two nations, China and the USA combined to.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.400
[Guest]: Together China and USA take about 220 cubic kilometers out, India takes 250 cubic kilometers

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.920
[Guest]: of groundwater out.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.960
[Guest]: So this dependence on groundwater is something stunning.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm a complete layman.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.560
[Amit Varma]: So excuse me for this very sort of newbie question, but how do the other nations then

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
[Amit Varma]: get their water?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320
[Amit Varma]: Like if we are different from depending so much on groundwater?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320
[Guest]: Right.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.480
[Guest]: I think the other nations, China and the USA are to a large extent dependent on surface

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
[Guest]: waters.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480
[Guest]: Right.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.280
[Guest]: Waters from rivers which they stock up in reservoirs, dams and then pump it across or

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.320
[Guest]: canalize it across the country.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.760
[Amit Varma]: But in our case, we are dependent more on drilling underground and…

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.680
[Guest]: We have been to for a long, long time, we have depended on groundwater.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.320
[Guest]: It dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization, Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Lothal, we have a history

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.680
[Guest]: of open wells, which provided water and this is striking again, because it's called the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.760
[Guest]: Indus Valley Civilization, yet the habitations actually took their water from groundwater.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
[Amit Varma]: So why was that?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you'd imagine a land with so many rivers would, you know, not have this kind

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680
[Guest]: of…

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.720
[Guest]: Well, it looks like a historical coincidence, but let's look at it from also the other

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.040
[Guest]: lens of what I would call water romance, which I'm pretty much romantic about.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.400
[Guest]: This discovery that a hole in the ground could yield water was something stunning for civilization.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.760
[Guest]: Some tectonic shift happened.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.080
[Guest]: You were no longer tied to the tyranny of rivers and lakes.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.600
[Guest]: You could go to the countryside, dig a hole in the ground, find water and survive.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.360
[Guest]: And it looks like the ancients in India cracked that particular form of knowledge.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.240
[Guest]: So therefore, you were anywhere and everywhere and remember this country of ours, what is

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.480
[Guest]: now what we call India is two-thirds semi-arid, it's in the Deccan Plateau.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.000
[Guest]: So the rivers are ephemeral, they're not permanent, they're not perennial rivers.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.400
[Guest]: And then when you have to survive for the whole year, you look for solutions and the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.860
[Guest]: well was a striking solution.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.200
[Amit Varma]: So what are the implications of our dependence on groundwater?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200
[Guest]: Here's the thing.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.200
[Guest]: Till we were dependent on open wells, there was a strange sort of communication between

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.640
[Guest]: the ecological resource that is water and us as human beings.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.860
[Guest]: So the wells spoke to us, it would tell you summer is coming.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.840
[Guest]: So you started to alter your behavior depending on the water availability.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.640
[Guest]: The well was both functional and communicative, it rewarded you for good behavior.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.200
[Guest]: If you recharged around the surrounding areas, if you protected the forest, then the well

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.720
[Guest]: had plenty of water.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.240
[Guest]: If you dumped waste material, well, the well would get polluted and you wouldn't be able

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.240
[Guest]: to use the water.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.880
[Guest]: So these signals of communication and functionality was something striking about the well.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.600
[Guest]: Come the 60s, and then we slipped into the era of the borewell.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.080
[Guest]: The borewell stopped communicating to us, they only communicate to us twice, once when

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.480
[Guest]: they strike water and once when they're dead, actually.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.240
[Amit Varma]: Because we no longer see what's happening to water levels, how they're changing with

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.240
[Amit Varma]: the seasons, and we can't adjust accordingly.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.680
[Guest]: So that information is stopped.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.640
[Guest]: So the borewell does not let you know how much water there is, what is the source of

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640
[Guest]: that groundwater?

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.920
[Guest]: Where is it coming from?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.960
[Guest]: What is the quality of that groundwater?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.640
[Guest]: What can you do to protect it?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.320
[Guest]: How much of it are you using up?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.520
[Guest]: All these signals are completely lost with the borewell.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.460
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of the seen and unseen effects of borewell drilling, like, what were the

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.680
[Amit Varma]: advantages which led to that being adopted as a technology in the first place and what

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.780
[Guest]: eventually happened?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.320
[Guest]: So there's a strange coincidence to the entry of the hard rock drilling rig into India documented

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.720
[Guest]: by UNICEF, amongst others.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.600
[Guest]: In the 60s, the mid 60s, there was a continuous drought for three years, and there was actually

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.800
[Guest]: famine, there was food shortage and great water shortage.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.120
[Guest]: And UNICEF brought in these drilling rigs from the UK, Denmark and the USA, hard rock

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.420
[Guest]: drilling rigs, about 18 of them, and started drilling for water.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.280
[Guest]: These went off into the villages of Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, and they brought life

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280
[Guest]: saving water.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.600
[Guest]: So they were a big boon at that particular point of time because the wells had dried

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.600
[Guest]: up.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.720
[Guest]: The borewells had to be dug to about 100-200 feet, which the wells would not have reached.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.120
[Guest]: And then the hand pump was attached to it, and life saving water came.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.380
[Guest]: But in a peculiar Indian tradition, we took the drilling rig, jugadofied it and started

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.120
[Guest]: to make the rig itself.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.960
[Guest]: So, small town of Tiruchangod in Tamil Nadu is now one of the leading exporters of borewell

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.280
[Guest]: drilling rigs in the world.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.000
[Guest]: These rigs then started to get used for irrigation and agriculture, farmers started to drill

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.240
[Guest]: it, they were uncontrolled, nobody controlled the number of wells that were being dug.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.520
[Guest]: And actually, the political establishment started to give free electricity for the pump

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.720
[Guest]: sets to mine water from these, and so they spread rapidly, became politically uncontrollable

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.200
[Guest]: and started to exploit a lot of water.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.840
[Guest]: Two consequences, the benefits, of course, of the Green Revolution came from groundwater,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.880
[Guest]: a lot of people argue not from the dams of India.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.640
[Guest]: The second consequence on health, for a long for a short time, diseases like the guinea

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.800
[Guest]: worm were eliminated, waterborne diseases became less because groundwater was pure water.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.000
[Guest]: But slowly, poisons such as fluoride and arsenic started to emerge.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.800
[Guest]: Now we have a situation, because of our dependency on these deep borewells, that about 66 million

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: Indians are consuming fluoride contaminated water and about 18 million Indians are consuming

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.480
[Guest]: arsenic contaminated water.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's quite a revelation.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.560
[Amit Varma]: So the first seen effect of borewells was effectively that it played a part in enabling

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.880
[Amit Varma]: the Green Revolution, which of course saved millions from possible starvation and was

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.200
[Amit Varma]: a big boon to us.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And the second effect was that diseases like guinea worm, for example, completely vanished.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, before I ask you to elaborate on the unseen effects, you spoke about how

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:45.880
[Amit Varma]: the spread of borewells was, you hinted that it was perhaps more than it should have been.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, partly because of government incentives, like free power, which allowed

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.480
[Amit Varma]: people to pump up as much water as they wanted.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And we started, we jugarified and we started making them ourselves.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.720
[Amit Varma]: And can you elaborate on that a bit, like how, like, was the was the spreading of borewells

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.400
[Amit Varma]: at what point does it sort of become a con rather than a pro?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400
[Guest]: Yes.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400
[Guest]: That's an interesting question.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.120
[Guest]: I think in the initial days when the Geological Society of India, which was one of the strong

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.640
[Guest]: proponents of the hard rock drilling rig and the borewell, went about its business, farmers

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.480
[Guest]: did not believe that a four inch hole in the ground could actually yield water.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.040
[Guest]: So they had to be persuaded by scientists who actually dug these borewells and drew

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040
[Guest]: the clean water out.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.840
[Guest]: And I think even in the minds of the geologists, it was not clear that we were going to run

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.280
[Guest]: out of groundwater, because we had not formed a good idea of how much water was actually

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.760
[Guest]: there, what was the volume that was being recharged annually, and what were the areas

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.320
[Guest]: from which these deep borewells were being recharged.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.240
[Guest]: I think that hydrogeological science is only now developing in India, we are doing something

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.680
[Guest]: called sub aquifer mapping, trying to understand these hard rock aquifers in a more thorough

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.400
[Guest]: manner, which we did not know in the 60s and 70s.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.920
[Guest]: So we went about assuming infinite resource.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.280
[Guest]: And I think that was the handicap.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.360
[Guest]: So one does not lay blame on a deliberate attempt to create a scarcity.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.900
[Guest]: But this is the very nature of technology and science.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.680
[Guest]: It seems that we create problems, and then overcome them with solutions, which are actually

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680
[Guest]: greater problems.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.640
[Amit Varma]: And so then the cycle continues, except that, you know, with most everyday technology, like

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.480
[Amit Varma]: if there's a bug on the latest Android version, it's fixed really fast, and the information

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480
[Amit Varma]: is flowing really fast.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.080
[Amit Varma]: And here, because it's geology, and you don't really know what's under the earth, and it's

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.640
[Guest]: something that can take decades to play out and affect millions of people.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest]: And how many hydrogeologists are produced in India?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.480
[Guest]: It's a good question to ask.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
[Guest]: And where do they go?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.560
[Guest]: Most of them went to the oil industry.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.120
[Guest]: So we had a lack of human resource power, we still have a lack of human resource power,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.080
[Guest]: given the complexity of the science, who has to do the investments in managing groundwater?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest]: Is groundwater a government resource?

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.560
[Guest]: Is it a common pool resource?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560
[Guest]: Is it a private resource?

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.760
[Guest]: It's now managed as a private resource.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.680
[Guest]: When do we flip from being from turning it into a common pool resource from a private

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680
[Guest]: resource?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.800
[Guest]: And then who does those investments are big question marks even now.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.880
[Amit Varma]: So one of the unseen effects that you pointed out, of course, with the new diseases that

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.320
[Amit Varma]: came about like chloride poisoning, and so on and so forth, but, you know, going even

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.840
[Amit Varma]: beyond that, as our knowledge grew of, you know, how scarce groundwater might be how

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.080
[Amit Varma]: it gets depleted, where it comes from, and so on and so forth.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.760
[Amit Varma]: Looking at those learnings, what can you say are the and also the point you made about

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.240
[Amit Varma]: the information that a person living on the land has about the water content of the land

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.680
[Amit Varma]: disappearing because you this was now unseen the water at the borewell was striking as

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.160
[Amit Varma]: opposed to the scene water in a well, which you're in touch with every day.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.520
[Amit Varma]: How did all of this play out?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.600
[Amit Varma]: What are the long term unintended consequences?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.560
[Guest]: So one unintended consequence is the drying up of the peninsular rivers, a lot of people

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.920
[Guest]: don't get the fact that it's not merely depletion of catchments and cutting down of forests

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.080
[Guest]: and trees, but it's actually the sinking of the groundwater table through millions of

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.280
[Guest]: borewells, which causes our rivers to dry up.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.800
[Guest]: And so if we want to revive our rivers, which is now quite a thing with society, then we

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.200
[Guest]: have to get our groundwater tables high.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.360
[Guest]: It's a relationship not understood pretty well.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:33.840
[Guest]: The second point is what it did was it caused farmers to take loans to drill borewells.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.480
[Guest]: Enough evidence has come that farmers would take loan after loan, sink borewell after

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.600
[Guest]: borewell in this desperate chase for water because that was his only source of water

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600
[Amit Varma]: for whatever.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So he would have to drink multiple borewells because he drink dig one and then that would

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.040
[Amit Varma]: get over and he'd have to dig another one.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.680
[Guest]: The thing with hard rock terrain is that if you drill a borewell, it's not a guarantee

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.040
[Guest]: that you will strike water, you may drill one four meters away and it may strike water

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.440
[Guest]: because this waters occur in cracks and crevices which are limited, there's not a sponge like

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.040
[Guest]: aquifer which the well would have tapped into.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.960
[Guest]: So this uncertainty of being able to strike water was a clear factor in hard rock borewells

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.560
[Amit Varma]: and this caused tremendous agricultural distress.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.280
[Amit Varma]: So what followed from this, take me on a narrative like through the decades, like in the 60s

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.000
[Amit Varma]: you have problems of food and water and then you have these borewells coming in, they enable

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.280
[Amit Varma]: the green revolution and it seems like a technological miracle and by and large the green revolution

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.360
[Amit Varma]: was something which helped millions of people enormously.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.600
[Amit Varma]: But then through the decades, a story then starts playing out where people gain more

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.400
[Amit Varma]: and more knowledge about what it's actually doing to the groundwater and we start facing

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
[Amit Varma]: the consequences.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Can you sort of tell me that story through the decades?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600
[Guest]: Well, yeah.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600
[Guest]: Okay.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.600
[Guest]: So let's see, India is getting independent in 47, our population is about 330 million.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.640
[Guest]: We are a nation growing just about enough food for ourselves.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.480
[Guest]: Slowly the population starts to increase, in the 50s we are faced with a set of droughts

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.880
[Guest]: and in the 60s it becomes striking because we get three year drought, continuous drought

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.640
[Guest]: and then we have a hand-to-mouth living as is described with grains coming from the USA,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640
[Guest]: PL 480.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.840
[Guest]: At the time there's a war with Pakistan 65 coincidentally or otherwise and now our dependence

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.520
[Guest]: on food becomes a security risk for us.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.200
[Guest]: So we start to think what we should do.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:33.400
[Guest]: Caesar Bramaniam steps out, Prasad Swaminathan and meet Norman Borlaug and the high yielding

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.560
[Guest]: dwarf variety, the Mexican dwarf variety of wheat comes to India.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:44.000
[Guest]: This dwarf variety needs actually more water and it needs lots of groundwater for its productivity

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
[Guest]: to increase.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.600
[Guest]: It needs fertilizers, it needs pesticides.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.960
[Guest]: Then comes the rice, the International Rice Research Institute is established in Odisha

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.880
[Guest]: to begin with, later on shifted to the Philippines, they developed IR 64, a wonderful hybrid variety

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.160
[Guest]: which comes to the Tanjavur belt which is in the Cauvery area.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.520
[Guest]: These wheat and rice strains are now demanding water, they are producing food security and

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.640
[Guest]: informally, subversively farmers are drilling bore wells to feed this water but we are fixated

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640
[Guest]: on the food output.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.920
[Guest]: We are not looking at what's happening to the water depletion and slowly the spread

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.480
[Guest]: of this both these varieties is all across India.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.160
[Guest]: In the meantime, the hard rock drilling rigs have come technologically speaking.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.400
[Guest]: They have started to replace the traditional diesel pump or the animal driven lifting devices.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.760
[Guest]: They now start to dig deeper and deeper and start to move everywhere.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.360
[Guest]: Free power is started to be given to the farmers because the farmer lobby is a strong lobby,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.480
[Guest]: agriculture is a strong lobby and so therefore, this depletes groundwater even further because

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.640
[Guest]: it is indiscriminate use of the groundwater, flood irrigation, it is not drip or sprinkler

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.160
[Guest]: irrigation.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.080
[Guest]: And slowly eventually, we are into 33 million bore wells and 250 cubic kilometers of water

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080
[Guest]: over time.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.560
[Guest]: Now, we realize the gravity of the situation, we start to figure out areas where groundwater

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.360
[Guest]: is depleting and we try to bring control through law, it does not work, none of the places

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.100
[Guest]: in India, groundwater rules and legislations are working because the number, sheer number

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.840
[Guest]: of bore wells to manage and regulate has become too huge.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.280
[Guest]: Now, we are in an era where we want to recharge the aquifers and try to make it up but we

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.720
[Guest]: still have not found an idea for demand management.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.640
[Guest]: Until we find a balance between demand management and what goes in into the groundwater as rainwater,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.040
[Guest]: strike a balance, we will be in for tough times.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.280
[Amit Varma]: And this seems like an almost insurmountable problem because at the policy level, the government

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.400
[Amit Varma]: will of course say that we need to not destroy the depleted resource, we need to figure out

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.120
[Amit Varma]: a way to make it better.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.240
[Amit Varma]: But at the individual level, the incentive for the individual farmer always will be to

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.720
[Amit Varma]: make sure that his next crop has the water it needs and therefore, he doesn't give a

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.040
[Amit Varma]: damn and farmers are an important constituency and politicians therefore have to kind of

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.360
[Guest]: listen to them, can't go against them.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
[Guest]: That's true.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.440
[Guest]: But however, there are grains of experiments which are now happening where we are turning

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.440
[Guest]: the resource into a common pool resource and there's a particular program called the participatory

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.800
[Guest]: groundwater management, which the group which I'm working with, Argyam, it's a funding agency,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.120
[Guest]: it's also funding and we're trying to bring together pools of farmers who pool their

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.160
[Guest]: groundwater bore wells.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.480
[Guest]: So, let's imagine about 40 or 50 farmers come together, link up their bore wells, use drip

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.800
[Guest]: irrigation and sprinkler irrigation so that they are effective, put up a rain gauge in

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.280
[Guest]: the place and understand how much it rained.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.400
[Guest]: Based on the rainfall, take a call on how much water is recharged these bore wells and

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.400
[Guest]: therefore, use and grow crops which require less water than what it rained.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.080
[Guest]: So, if this year it rained less, you grow millets, if it rained more, you grow paddy.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.440
[Guest]: That kind of a call.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.240
[Guest]: You link up the groundwater and build that groundwater knowledge, link the bore wells.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.080
[Guest]: The pooling also brings in market feasibilities.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.160
[Guest]: You can buy seeds cheaper, you can sell to the market as a cooperative, as a unit, as

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.320
[Guest]: a producer unit.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.400
[Guest]: These experiments seem to show a glimmer of hope for the common pool resource that groundwater

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400
[Guest]: has become.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Are they just sporadic efforts made by organizations like yours?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.440
[Amit Varma]: Because it imagined that it's actually in the farmers' long term interest to pool together

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.320
[Amit Varma]: and do this for various reasons, not just the water, but also the collective power they

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.400
[Amit Varma]: get when it comes to the marketplace and therefore, this is something that should be happening

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.200
[Amit Varma]: anyway regardless of any impetus coming.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Is that the case or have you found that that impetus is required?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.920
[Guest]: So here's the thing.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.440
[Guest]: The institutional architecture of groundwater governance in India is varied from state to

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.440
[Guest]: state because groundwater and water is a state subject.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.200
[Guest]: One of the better performing institutions is the Groundwater Survey and Development

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.640
[Guest]: Agency, which is in Maharashtra.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.200
[Guest]: And Maharashtra has taken up very formally this way of pooling groundwater and trying

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.040
[Guest]: to work on it as a modality.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.200
[Guest]: And we're eagerly waiting for the kind of results that will come there because that

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.320
[Guest]: will set an exemplar for other states to follow.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.720
[Guest]: There's no other choice.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.200
[Guest]: We have to make it work.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:13.120
[Guest]: But we have to get these institutions to be full of specialties which can deal with societies,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.560
[Guest]: not just groundwater alone.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.160
[Guest]: So far, we have thrown hydrogeologists, now we need community mobilizers.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.440
[Guest]: We need people who can organize farmers groups.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.880
[Guest]: This is a different skill set altogether.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.920
[Guest]: So the governance architecture of groundwater will have to be reimagined and it will have

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.240
[Amit Varma]: to change.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.840
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of, to understand the situation we're in and the crisis that there is, give

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.960
[Amit Varma]: me a sense of the worst case scenario.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Supposing Vishwanath, you don't exist and this governance architecture doesn't take

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.160
[Amit Varma]: place and there's no one really doing anything about this and it's just individuals going

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.840
[Amit Varma]: by without that larger knowledge that you have gained.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840
[Amit Varma]: What's the worst case scenario?

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840
[Guest]: What can happen?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.480
[Guest]: It's playing itself out in many parts of the country, playing itself out in North Gujarat.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.720
[Guest]: It played itself out in Chennai, that groundwater ran out completely, that societies had to

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720
[Guest]: migrate out.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.900
[Guest]: There was great agricultural distress, economic distress.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.960
[Guest]: People struggled for drinking water, drinking water had to be shipped in trains and trucks

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960
[Guest]: and tankers.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960
[Guest]: In Gujarat?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.040
[Guest]: In Gujarat, in Maharashtra, in Karnataka, in many places, in many habitations, the groundwater

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040
[Guest]: has simply run out.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.680
[Guest]: There is no life without groundwater.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:24.520
[Guest]: So, you'll see great patches of India, which will simply be not occupied because there's

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520
[Guest]: no groundwater.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.000
[Guest]: And, mind you, when groundwater tables fall, forests will start to die, because the roots

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.320
[Guest]: of the trees cannot get into the aquifers to drink water.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:41.400
[Guest]: So, you can imagine terrific catastrophes, the limited forest cover that we have which

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.760
[Guest]: feed our rivers will die and so therefore our rivers will be in distress, they're already

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.760
[Amit Varma]: in distress.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.080
[Amit Varma]: This is both an ecological disaster as well as a humanitarian disaster, because you'll

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.320
[Amit Varma]: have people migrating away from areas where there's no groundwater and quite apart from

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.960
[Amit Varma]: the devastation that's already been wreaked on them by having to migrate, they'll put

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.280
[Amit Varma]: pressure on the areas they migrate to, who will in turn, in a cascading effect, face

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.000
[Amit Varma]: these problems of their own.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Is there any, like you said, a lot of nations don't quite depend on groundwater.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Are there other options?

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, if we take it as a given that eventually, over time, the groundwater is not going to

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240
[Amit Varma]: sustain us.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Are there other options in terms of, you know, again, I'm asking completely as a layman,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.960
[Guest]: that can fill that need?

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.880
[Guest]: Well, different areas and different rainfall patterns and different hydrogeologies will

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.280
[Guest]: have to show a different response.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.200
[Guest]: Kerala in India has the largest density of open wells for any place in the world.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.320
[Guest]: What Kerala is now doing with its rainfall is it's picking up rooftop rainwater, many

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.360
[Guest]: households in Kerala and feeding their wells, so that the wells are full all the time that

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:46.760
[Guest]: the quality of well water improves, and it can quickly become a mass movement.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.160
[Amit Varma]: And this is again an innovation that's happened, as you pointed out, because they get information

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.960
[Amit Varma]: about what's happening to the level of water in the well, and therefore, they can prepare

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.200
[Amit Varma]: in advance and they understand what's happening while with borewell drilling and so on, you

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.000
[Amit Varma]: have no information, you assume it's there till it's not there.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.320
[Guest]: So, this business of modernity, which started to bring piped water to homes with all good

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.800
[Guest]: intentions to remove the duress that women had to go to bring the water and make things

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800
[Guest]: easier.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.240
[Guest]: Pipe water inside the house caused this disconnect, because you don't know where the pipe water

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.720
[Guest]: is coming from, how much there is water in the rivers and all.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.560
[Guest]: So, some examples are striking, what we are trying to do is to merge both the pipe network

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560
[Guest]: as well as groundwater.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.400
[Guest]: Belgaum is a striking example.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.320
[Guest]: When they ran out of water for the pipe network, an engineer there called RS Nayak thought

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.240
[Guest]: about the old open wells there and with the help of the community mobilized and cleaned

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.880
[Guest]: up those old open wells.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.680
[Guest]: The community promised not to chuck Ganesh idols into it, garbage into it.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.680
[Guest]: In return, with some small funding, they were able to put up water networks for the local

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:55.840
[Guest]: community 500 people, 1000 people, sometimes even 10,000 peoples, a local network linked

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.720
[Guest]: to the local well, pipe water to your homes.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.560
[Guest]: So, here's an incentive for the community to keep their wells clean, to recharge water

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.840
[Guest]: and then in turn they get water.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.520
[Guest]: As opposed to the pipe water supply, which cost them about 12 rupees a kiloliter, the

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.920
[Guest]: water from the well was only 75 paisa a kiloliter and I'm talking 75 paisa for 1000 liter.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.480
[Guest]: So, there's an economic benefit and an ecological benefit and an environmental benefit plus

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.080
[Guest]: sustainability.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.980
[Guest]: And this water supply scheme is giving water to 200,000 people in Belgaum of a population

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.720
[Guest]: of 500,000 people.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:33.920
[Guest]: Kundapur, which is close by, started to get 24 bar 7 pipe water supply.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.040
[Guest]: Well, when the residents were asked to connect and pay a connection fee, they said, we already

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.920
[Guest]: have our 24 bar 7 supply from our wells, they're giving us 24 bar 7 and we're in charge of

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920
[Guest]: these wells.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.200
[Guest]: So, why do we need your pipe water connection?

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.120
[Guest]: So, somewhere these two will have to meet the pipe water network aspirations of the

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.560
[Guest]: people and the well as a sustainable water resource and the community understanding what

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560
[Guest]: the well is.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.280
[Guest]: And so, that challenge will have to be played itself out differently in states like Kerala,

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.520
[Guest]: in small towns and cities and in the vast rural areas of India.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it seems it seems a really great challenge because like in a village, okay, you can have

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.120
[Amit Varma]: communities and they have wells and so on, but in a large city like Mumbai or Bangalore,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, you don't have those open wells and that sort of connect, you're dependent

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.360
[Amit Varma]: on the pipe water supply and then on the water supply basically.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.560
[Guest]: So, let me give you one more example from Bangalore because you raised this important

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.840
[Guest]: point of urbanization and the complexity of cities and how you manage it.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:33.400
[Guest]: And this example is Rainbow Drive on Sarjapur Road, just opposite Wipro, 36 acres of campus,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.880
[Guest]: 360 plots, not connected to the city utility network.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.000
[Guest]: What would they have done?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.760
[Guest]: Each one of them would have drilled a bore well as they build their homes.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.120
[Guest]: So, you would have 360 straws emptying out the cup of water, each competing with the

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.160
[Guest]: other, pretty soon it would be finished.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.040
[Guest]: When we worked with the community and the community had some reasonably enlightened

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.920
[Guest]: leadership, what they did was they banned private bore wells, they said we'll sink

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.560
[Guest]: three community bore wells and we'll share the groundwater, but 360 will now compulsorily

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.800
[Guest]: recharge the aquifers.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.400
[Guest]: So, each one of them will make a recharge well, which is about three feet in diameter

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.840
[Guest]: and about 20 feet to 30 feet deep, pick up all the rooftop water, the water which flows

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.520
[Guest]: on the roads and make sure that it's filtered and send it into the aquifer.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.760
[Amit Varma]: So, recharge well is something that collects all this water and…

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.880
[Guest]: Unlike a well which gives you water, a recharge well picks up rainwater, clean rainwater and

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.160
[Guest]: puts it into the aquifer.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.400
[Guest]: So, you got 360 recharge wells, but only three wells which were drying.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400
[Guest]: Still this was not enough.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.280
[Guest]: When we did a water balance for them, we figured that they were consuming 265 liters per person

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280
[Guest]: per day.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.440
[Guest]: With all the rainwater harvesting they do, they're still overdrawing on the aquifer.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.600
[Guest]: So, they had to get it down to 130.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.920
[Guest]: They put a meter in every connection, they price the water.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.760
[Guest]: So, if it's more than 20,000 liters per month consumption for a household, they pay

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.680
[Guest]: 120 rupees a kiloliter.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.200
[Guest]: The consumption came down to something like 120 liters per capita per day.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.800
[Guest]: With the monies that the institution collected, they were able to invest in a wastewater treatment

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800
[Guest]: plant.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.440
[Guest]: They pick up treated wastewater and send it to the households for non-potable use.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.320
[Guest]: So, again, the net freshwater demand has dropped to something like 80 liters per capita per

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320
[Guest]: day.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.640
[Guest]: They are now contributing to the city of Bangalore, they're contributing water.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.240
[Guest]: They're self-sufficient, they're sustainable, and they have perhaps the cheapest water in

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240
[Guest]: town.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:22.600
[Guest]: So, these kind of examples, this is 36 acres, it's now being replicated in a 70 acre layout.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.240
[Guest]: It's gone to a 200 acre layout where they've discovered that the basements were flooding

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.960
[Guest]: and the wells had water and they were buying water at the same time.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.880
[Guest]: So, this sort of mental map in which we've forgotten what shallow aquifers and wells

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.640
[Guest]: are, are being regenerated.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.280
[Amit Varma]: So, this is obviously a remarkable and inspiring story.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.920
[Amit Varma]: But as you pointed out, it's a community which is relatively small, and also had enlightened

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.480
[Amit Varma]: leaders, and therefore is sort of one island of enlightenment in overall.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.760
[Amit Varma]: So, my question to you there is that, let's say that as a society, it's a problem we need

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.480
[Amit Varma]: to solve.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.600
[Amit Varma]: What is, what is the role that the government can play in it with all the incentives because

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.480
[Amit Varma]: they are usually focused on the short term, and they have different kinds of special interest

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480
[Amit Varma]: groups?

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.320
[Amit Varma]: And what is the role that we cannot look to government to play, that we have to say that

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.800
[Amit Varma]: society has to make these moves and these ideas, and these values have to spread through

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.800
[Amit Varma]: society?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.800
[Amit Varma]: How hard is that?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.800
[Guest]: Can it happen?

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800
[Guest]: What are your thoughts?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: So, that's a, that's an important point.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: I think the institutional architecture for water governance in India is 20th century.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.440
[Guest]: We're faced with 21st century problems.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.640
[Guest]: And unless we redefine our institutions and get them to be able, capacitated enough to

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:35.320
[Guest]: be able to address our problems, we're going to be stuck with some challenges.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.400
[Guest]: From a policy perspective, the city of Bangalore, Chennai, for example, drives a rainwater harvesting

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.600
[Guest]: policy, which makes it mandatory for every household to do rainwater harvesting.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.760
[Guest]: It's not being implemented at the efficiency and effectiveness, which it should be.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.600
[Guest]: But a beginning has been made.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.040
[Guest]: And why it's not being implemented is something that we need to crack because we do not have

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.760
[Guest]: a good communication outreach to persuade citizens to understand the benefits of doing

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.800
[Guest]: it.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.000
[Guest]: But if we do that, then we have a substantial amount of recharge of our aquifers.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.900
[Guest]: So therefore, our bore wells and groundwater open wells can come back to life.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:15.100
[Guest]: If lakes are rejuvenated, and if they're fed with treated wastewater, so in the rainy season,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.400
[Guest]: you feed the lakes with rainwater, in the non-rainy season, you feed them with treated

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.440
[Guest]: wastewater which comes in through constructed wetlands.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.720
[Guest]: And there's an example in Jakkur, there's an example in a lake called Rajanalli, Puttanalli,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.160
[Guest]: many examples are there.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.480
[Guest]: Then these lakes recharge that shallow aquifer and a huge amount of groundwater becomes available

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.600
[Guest]: for the city to reuse, right.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.840
[Guest]: So a wastewater policy which talks about ecological use of treated wastewater to recharge aquifers.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: A groundwater policy which says, okay, in a particular area, you're not allowed to sink

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.440
[Guest]: individual bore wells, but community bore wells will supply you water.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.080
[Guest]: A rainwater harvesting policy, wastewater policy, groundwater policy, all talking to

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.560
[Guest]: each other and reinforcing sustainability is the way for government to think and work

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560
[Guest]: upon.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.120
[Guest]: At a policy level, that's already happening, we need more better implementation.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.680
[Amit Varma]: What do you see are the bottlenecks here?

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, is it the government sort of seeing the light?

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.360
[Amit Varma]: Or is it a matter of state capacity?

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Or is it a matter of communication?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.720
[Guest]: It's again that cities need what is called integrated urban water management institutions,

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.800
[Guest]: an institution which looks at water holistically.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.840
[Guest]: A classic example is Jakkur Lake.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.320
[Guest]: Now, if you go to the lake, the lake is with the BDA, the Bangalore Development Authority,

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.440
[Guest]: which is handed over to the Bangalore Mahanagar Palike.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.840
[Guest]: The fishes in the lake belong to the fisheries department.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.960
[Guest]: The recharge that the lake water does is monitored by the Mines and Geology Department in the

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Central Groundwater Board.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.560
[Guest]: So these are like separate silos, which...

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560
[Guest]: Completely.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.320
[Guest]: The wastewater which comes in is managed by the Bangalore Water Supply and Storage Board.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: The rainwater which comes in is with the Mahanagar Palike.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.520
[Guest]: You take any one of this institution to the lake, and they're like the six blind men of

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520
[Guest]: Hindustan.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.760
[Guest]: They just see their point of view, and then they come back.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.680
[Guest]: Now, unless we get these institutions to sit together on one plan of action and management,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680
[Guest]: we have a challenge.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.680
[Guest]: Now, residents associations are doing the convergence.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.640
[Guest]: They sit, they identify a problem.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.800
[Guest]: Okay, solid waste is coming in.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.040
[Guest]: I go to the BBMP and fix it.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040
[Guest]: Medical waste is coming in.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: I go to the State Pollution Control Board and make sure that they take action.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.080
[Guest]: But that citizen action cannot be long term and sustainable.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.600
[Guest]: Our institutions have to, like I said, reimagine themselves and come together on this common

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.880
[Guest]: platform.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880
[Guest]: It's possible.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880
[Guest]: It's a long road.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.880
[Guest]: It's a harder route.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880
[Guest]: It's not a technical solution.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.680
[Guest]: It's an institutional and governance solutions.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.280
[Guest]: We need that kind of capacities to come together to reformulate our institutions and governance

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.920
[Guest]: policies to make it happen.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.640
[Amit Varma]: So when you spoke about sort of the institutional architecture being of the 20th century instead

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.000
[Amit Varma]: of the 21st century, what you're referring to is that the same thing that they all work

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.360
[Amit Varma]: in kind of silos.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And now we need to recognize the problem and bring it under one authority, which can then,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.960
[Guest]: you know, take these decisions and get it done.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960
[Guest]: That's one part of the problem.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.640
[Guest]: The 20th century architecture of institutions was one of supply management, the resource

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.000
[Guest]: was available in plenty, you needed engineering skill sets to pump water from a large distance.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.040
[Guest]: The Bangalore Water Supply Storage Board, set up in 1964, was the first water utility

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.200
[Guest]: set up in India.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.800
[Guest]: And its biggest achievement was that it brought water from the Cauvery River in 1972, which

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.280
[Guest]: is 100 kilometers away and 300 meters below the city.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.920
[Guest]: Huge engineering challenge.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.080
[Guest]: Now the resource itself is running out.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.480
[Guest]: But what this institution is geared for is to pump water to the city.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.640
[Guest]: So its next imagination is to bring water from the Sharavati River, which is 340 kilometers

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640
[Guest]: from Bangalore.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.200
[Guest]: Whereas what it perhaps needs to do is to look at the ecological resource available

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.720
[Guest]: within the city like rainwater, wastewater, groundwater, and manage it.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.560
[Guest]: But there is not a single hydrogeologist in the institution.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.560
[Guest]: There's not a single hydrologist.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.120
[Guest]: There's not a single ecologist.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.520
[Guest]: How can that hockey team play football, which is what is being asked of them?

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.760
[Amit Varma]: That's a brilliant articulation.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And like you just pointed out, citizen activism has its limits, and you also don't have enlightened

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
[Amit Varma]: citizens everywhere.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.320
[Amit Varma]: So what really you need here is, in a sense, political will and governmental will, which

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.240
[Amit Varma]: are slightly separate things, but those are what you need.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.880
[Guest]: What are the obstacles to those?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.400
[Guest]: Well, actually, the government too is listening.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.920
[Guest]: It's not that all politicians are bad.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.600
[Amit Varma]: There are quite a few ministers who...

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.120
[Amit Varma]: But the incentives are sort of different.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.440
[Amit Varma]: They're geared towards a short term, winning the next elections, more towards handouts

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.360
[Amit Varma]: and deep fundamental change.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.360
[Guest]: That is true.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:24.600
[Guest]: The democratic cycle and the ecological cycle of sustainabilities, this one is a five year

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600
[Guest]: cycle.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.840
[Guest]: But in the minimum 20 year cycle, they don't overlap and the short termism and suboptimal

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.680
[Guest]: nature of democracies start to impact it.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:40.360
[Guest]: However, I think we can find a midway by which we commit ourselves to a long term plan, which

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.240
[Guest]: is cutting across political frontiers, but then use the democratic cycle for equity and

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: distribution, which is as critical as resource management.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.480
[Guest]: The big challenge for our cities is not how much water is coming in as much as who is

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.080
[Guest]: getting this water.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:01.160
[Guest]: Here the political system can play a major role in making sure that there is equity.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.240
[Guest]: So I see a lot of merit, but what we need from civic society groups and activist groups

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:12.560
[Guest]: is to be able to understand the weaknesses of the system and address those in a solution

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.040
[Guest]: mode rather than to keep on harping on problems and highlighting problems.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:24.640
[Guest]: You can keep on saying that Belandur Lake is getting sewage, that it's foaming and frothing.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.920
[Guest]: But what is the architecture by which you want to manage it is something that civic

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.400
[Guest]: and academic institutions, civil society groups have to come together and brainstorm a bit

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.760
[Amit Varma]: And what I've often heard from civil society activists in other fields is that when it

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.360
[Amit Varma]: comes to dealing with government, you can sort of push for short term measures and jugars

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and little fixes here and there, but changing fundamental architecture is much more difficult

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.840
[Amit Varma]: because of sort of the incentives involved.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.280
[Amit Varma]: So I sort of now want to talk about your personal journey.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.440
[Amit Varma]: You've been in this for 32 years, you've been a sort of an evangelist for reform in all

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440
[Amit Varma]: of these.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.880
[Amit Varma]: What has that journey been like?

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Like to what, what's your struggle been to convince fellow citizens around you of what

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.560
[Amit Varma]: the problems are?

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.160
[Amit Varma]: And from there, what's your struggle been to actually make fundamental change happen?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.640
[Guest]: Well, it's not been struggle, struggle, as in where you see it as a sort of a despondent

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.640
[Guest]: act.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.360
[Guest]: I've had great joy and happiness in being able to understand the complexity of the problem

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:27.600
[Guest]: and trying to see how individually and as teams, different kinds of teams, we're able

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.520
[Guest]: to push the solution envelope a bit more.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.880
[Guest]: Luckily, 14 years of my initial life in the job sector, I spent with Housing and Urban

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.480
[Guest]: Development Corporation, which is the Government of India undertaking.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.400
[Guest]: So I know how the government thinks I was lucky enough to do that.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:47.600
[Guest]: And that job gave me exposure to many geographies of South India, especially I must have visited

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: every alternate village and almost every town and city as part of that job.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.920
[Guest]: So it was a huge learning experience and one learned the strengths of government and the

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.920
[Guest]: limitations of government.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.640
[Guest]: Then once you stepped out, the challenge was, how do you work with communities, academic

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.680
[Guest]: institutions, and even the government from a policy influence part of you.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.120
[Guest]: So it's important to build a brand around yourself and a thought process that you do.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.800
[Guest]: So that has been very important.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.520
[Guest]: I think you must be seen as somebody who does not have an agenda, which is political or

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:22.440
[Guest]: whatever, personality driven, but which seeks to bring positive change to communities, individuals.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440
[Guest]: The response has been fabulous.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:29.200
[Guest]: I mean, I have the choice are from working with well diggers, traditional well diggers.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.320
[Guest]: There are a community who have been digging wells in India for 1200 years now, and who

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.520
[Guest]: have run out of a livelihood because nobody's digging wells, but everybody's digging bore

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520
[Guest]: wells.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: So how do you make sure that they get a job?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.880
[Guest]: So in the policy, we said in the rainwater harvesting policy, which I was fortunate enough

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.440
[Guest]: to write with the government was to say, hey, everybody will make a recharge well.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.080
[Guest]: So suddenly the livelihood opportunities for these well diggers came up and the well diggers

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.920
[Guest]: learned a new skill and a new trade.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.360
[Guest]: You pick up rainwater and you send it into wells, they didn't know a damn about it.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.280
[Guest]: Now many of these wells have water.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.160
[Guest]: So there's at least 10,000 open wells in Bangalore with water in it.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.040
[Guest]: So people call them again to clean it up every year, which was what they used to do before

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.920
[Guest]: and deepen it a bit more and make sure that the water quality is improved.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.840
[Guest]: So you see that solving a water problem is also engaging with history, livelihoods, its

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: economic benefits, its social benefits, and all these add up to ecological benefits.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.240
[Guest]: And when you see that canvas, it motivates you almost on a daily basis, because there's

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.840
[Amit Varma]: something exciting happening.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.160
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel you're taking small steps all the time and then it's then it's sort

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.200
[Amit Varma]: of getting to somewhere really meaningful or do you sometimes feel there's an impasse

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.560
[Guest]: and I mean, oh, there's old monk for that.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:46.640
[Guest]: But the thing is that the beauty of at least the work that I got on myself was that I was

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.640
[Guest]: able to engage with one small rainwater harvesting unit, which collects 2000 liters of rainwater

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.560
[Guest]: to be able to sit on writing the wastewater policy for Karnataka, rainwater harvesting

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.200
[Guest]: policy for Karnataka, sitting with the planning commission as one of the subgroup members

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.720
[Guest]: to be able to address some of those issues.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.160
[Guest]: So scale, ways of thinking institutional governance to actually doing that sort of engagement,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.760
[Guest]: which really gives you a huge kick.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And supposing some of my listeners are listening to this and thinking that, hey, you know,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.360
[Amit Varma]: as a concerned citizen, I'd like to do something about this.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, two questions for you on that account.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.460
[Amit Varma]: One, can you explain the scale of the problem?

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.840
[Amit Varma]: What are things like right now?

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:34.300
[Amit Varma]: And two, what is it that concerned citizens can do at a practical level immediately?

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.540
[Guest]: So the scale of the problem is an agglomeration of a million problems.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:44.080
[Guest]: If you take a city like Bangalore and there are 1.8 million households, the city of Bangalore's

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.440
[Guest]: problems of water is 1.8 million problems, which then agglomerate.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.800
[Guest]: So therefore, you can become part of that 1.8 million solutions because you occupy one

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.680
[Guest]: of those households and one of those homes.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:01.880
[Guest]: The thing to do is to start to understand what water is in your household level itself.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:07.200
[Guest]: And it's not rocket science if you want to, you can cut down consumption 30%, 40% if intent

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.200
[Guest]: is there.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.240
[Guest]: You need space between the years, you don't need space anywhere else.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.560
[Guest]: Second is to look at the rainfall in your apartment, in your building and see what's

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.240
[Guest]: happening to it and whether it can be put to better use.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.500
[Guest]: And one of the better uses is to make sure that it goes and infiltrates into the ground.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.160
[Guest]: These are immediate actions.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.080
[Guest]: The second set of actions is to reach out at a community or a watershed level.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.240
[Guest]: There is a lake within two kilometers of every apartment or house in Bangalore, step in into

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.440
[Guest]: the lake on a Sunday, which we try and get what we call friends of lakes to come.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.120
[Guest]: Pick up 10 plastic bags from that lake.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.160
[Guest]: The next time somebody chucks a plastic bag in that lake and you realize you're going

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.760
[Guest]: to pick it up, it really makes you mad.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.080
[Guest]: So your ownership of the lake is generated by simple small actions and then work with

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.800
[Guest]: groups to figure out what needs to be done to save the lake.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.300
[Guest]: It's not going to be easy, but you'll understand the political ramifications, the challenges

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.400
[Guest]: which a city has to go through in managing water.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.260
[Guest]: And it gives you pretty much a can-do kind of a positive moment.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.000
[Guest]: And I think we need to work at a lot of these can-dos at various scales, you know, you engage

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.100
[Guest]: with your corporator, engage with your MLA, engage with your water utility provider and

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:21.600
[Guest]: see how the challenges they think that exist and what can be done by you as a participant.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600
[Amit Varma]: You'll find many solutions.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.400
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to end with, I mean, this has been extremely illuminating, and I'm going

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.640
[Amit Varma]: to end with two questions.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.800
[Amit Varma]: One, what makes you despair about the journey that you're on and what can happen to what

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.680
[Guest]: India's water problems and to what makes you hopeful?

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.600
[Guest]: The despair comes from a sort of a binary view that we seem to think that economic development

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.800
[Guest]: means certain sacrifices and therefore ecological environment has to degrade.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.280
[Guest]: This set of thinking articulated in that river water reaching a sea is a waste.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.560
[Guest]: It makes you despair saying how much more literate should we become ecologically and

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560
[Guest]: environmentally.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.760
[Guest]: And your point is they can go hand in hand, there's no trade-off.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.440
[Guest]: They absolutely go hand in hand, there is no binary there, they have to coexist together

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.240
[Guest]: and we have to find, you cannot label people environmentalists or you cannot label people

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.480
[Guest]: pro-market and leave it at that.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.680
[Guest]: Both have to talk to each other and reinforce each other and understand each other's problem.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:27.560
[Guest]: But that conversation is not deep enough or not smooth enough in the sense we don't seem

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.040
[Guest]: to be able to sit and dialogue a way out.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.320
[Guest]: That's a cause for despair.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:38.480
[Guest]: The cause for hope is to see the millions of actions, fishermen, well diggers, poor

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:45.720
[Guest]: well diggers, everybody who's in some way or the other contributing to make sure that

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.680
[Guest]: what we have as a society and as a nation stays somewhere reasonably good.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.280
[Amit Varma]: So that engagement fascinates me.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.560
[Amit Varma]: That's an inspiring note to end on and you know, if you're listening to the show, you

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.640
[Amit Varma]: don't just have to listen to our journey and say, hey, that's nice, but you can also be

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640
[Amit Varma]: part of it.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.440
[Amit Varma]: Vishwanath, thanks so much for coming on the show, it's my honor.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.440
[Guest]: It's my pleasure and the Twitter handle is at Zen Rain Man, I have to do this.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.040
[Amit Varma]: I always tweet that at the end of the show, don't worry, but at Zen Rain Man and he tweets

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.760
[Amit Varma]: regularly about all of these issues.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.520
[Amit Varma]: So please go and check that out.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I really hope you write a book about this someday, because all of this has

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.760
[Amit Varma]: been such a learning for me just, you know, talking to you today.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there's such a great narrative of how our woes with water have sort of developed.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400
[Guest]: Yes.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.160
[Guest]: Thanks for that suggestion.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.480
[Guest]: I'm basically too lazy a person to be able to sit together and print words.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.480
[Guest]: The communication has to be immediate and absolutely these kind of conversations that

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: I have with you, it's such a pleasure to talk because then thoughts flow and we can answer

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
[Amit Varma]: questions.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'd love to have you on the show again sometime.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
