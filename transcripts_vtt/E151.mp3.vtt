00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.660
[Amit Varma]: Unity unites us and we can celebrate together in different ways.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.480
[Amit Varma]: But politics in Maharashtra is based more around what divides us.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.340
[Amit Varma]: Do you speak Marathi or Gujarati or Hindi?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460
[Amit Varma]: Are you Brahmin or Maratha or Dalit?

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.580
[Amit Varma]: Are you from Vidarbha or Marathwada or Konkan or Mumbai?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.240
[Amit Varma]: Are you a farmer or a banker?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.280
[Amit Varma]: And amid these divisions, there is one overarching quality that unites all political parties.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Opportunism, the will to power.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.640
[Amit Varma]: That's the central theme that runs through the gripping ongoing drama of Maharashtra

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640
[Amit Varma]: politics.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.080
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Maharashtra politics has been in the news recently, but in this episode, I want to take

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: a broader and deeper look at it than what we get in the present.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.280
[Amit Varma]: I want to take a journey through the last few decades of Maharashtra politics and try

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.360
[Amit Varma]: to get a better grip on this deeply complex ecosystem.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.600
[Amit Varma]: And I cannot think of a better guest for this purpose than Sujata Anandan.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.400
[Amit Varma]: Sujata has been a political reporter since the 1980s, and I've been admiring her columns

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.880
[Amit Varma]: on local politics since I first came to Mumbai in 1995.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.160
[Amit Varma]: She's also written two deeply insightful books, Hindu Hriday Samrat about the life and times

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.280
[Amit Varma]: of Balasaheb Thackeray and the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Maximus, a broader sociopolitical

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: history of the state.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
[Amit Varma]: She's a legend in the space, and I'm delighted that she's agreed to come on the show and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.160
[Amit Varma]: share her insights with me.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin our conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.240
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.080

[Amit Varma]: Sujata, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520
[Amit Varma]: My pleasure.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.520
[Amit Varma]: I've been following you, as I mentioned in my intro since the 1990s.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, while many of the finest political reporters today are women, back in the day,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, you were almost an exception in that sense, because there was this feeling

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.400
[Amit Varma]: that in journalism, women do the soft beat, they do the features, they do all of that.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.560
[Amit Varma]: And you were a proper hardcore political reporter.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.880
[Guest]: How did you get into journalism and reporting?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.480
[Guest]: I basically took a journalism course because I wanted to join the IAS.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.120
[Guest]: And I thought taking a journalism course will teach me essay writing, which had a lot of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.440
[Guest]: marks on that.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.680
[Guest]: But once I went into journalism, I never looked back and I didn't want to become an IAS officer.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.560
[Guest]: I wanted to continue as a journalist.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.040
[Guest]: Political journalism, I applied for a job to Times of India.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.040
[Guest]: And there the editor told me that, you know, I was writing on Rotary clubs, Lions clubs,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.080
[Guest]: you know, dance shows, things like that.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.320
[Guest]: What you said, you know, I mean, soft journalism, entertainment.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.120
[Guest]: And he saw my portfolio and he said that if this is the kind of journalism you want to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.440
[Guest]: do, I suggest you go and start teaching English at Elphinstone College, because you can still

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.680
[Guest]: continue to do this in your spare time, you know, I mean, but if you want to be a real

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.200
[Guest]: journalist, you have to choose either business journalism or political journalism.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.360
[Guest]: Now, I didn't have a head for business journalism, you know, so I got pushed into political journalism

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.820
[Guest]: against my will.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.680
[Guest]: But once I was there, I realized my editor was right.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.640
[Guest]: He said that I was a natural and I realized that I was indeed a natural in political journalism.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And were you already interested in politics in general?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Or is that something you had to cultivate after you?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840
[Guest]: No, I was not.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.080
[Guest]: In fact, I hated politics at that point of time, which is why I was doing the soft entertainment

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.160
[Guest]: journalism.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.440
[Guest]: But when I began my career, there was nothing like entertainment journalism, you know, I

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.840
[Guest]: mean, I always tell people that had there been entertainment journalism at that time,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.000
[Guest]: I would have been an entertainment editor rather than a political editor by this time,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720
[Guest]: you know, I mean, but I got pushed into it against my will.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.680
[Guest]: I hated it in the first few months in the first couple of years.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.040
[Guest]: But once I got the hang of it, I think I was able to understand the political nuances much

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.880
[Amit Varma]: better than many other people.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And what was it like in those early days, like, you know, when you're going out on the

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.040
[Amit Varma]: beat, you're meeting politicians, did they take you seriously?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040
[Amit Varma]: How did they treat you?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.640
[Amit Varma]: How do you learn to sort of talk in their kind of language and have them open up to

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.640
[Guest]: you?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.120
[Guest]: You know, when I started out, like you said earlier, there were very few women in the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.120
[Guest]: field.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.320
[Guest]: A couple of them were there before me, Olga Telles was there, you know, I mean, I think

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.000
[Guest]: she was the first political woman correspondent, and a couple more in Marathi journalism.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.400
[Guest]: And many of us who were covering active politics, like having to visit Mantralaya, having to

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.600
[Guest]: visit the Legislative Assembly during sessions, we had a real battle on our hands in the beginning,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.360
[Guest]: because you know, the legislators, the MLAs coming from villages, coming from small towns,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.680
[Guest]: they were just not used to seeing, you know, women in such freedom modes, you know, I mean,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.480
[Guest]: like we were free, we were coming there, we were talking, we were laughing, you know,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.320
[Guest]: I mean, we were taking our place equally amongst the men, and they just couldn't get over that.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.560
[Guest]: So many of them thought that we were up for some game.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.560
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they made passes at us, you know, I mean, and they tried to get a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.200
[Guest]: lot more serious, but then all of us, all the women journalists, we really put them

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.000
[Guest]: in their place, you know, I mean, there was one senior woman journalist who took me under

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: her wing.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.160
[Guest]: And she said, whenever these MLAs come close to me, and they put their face close to me,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.080
[Guest]: and say, kai bai, kai chal laa hai, so I tell them, bai nai, tai mana.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.480
[Guest]: You know that I'm your elder sister, you know, I mean, I'm not just another woman.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.600
[Guest]: And I tell them keep a distance of at least five feet from where you're standing and talking

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600
[Guest]: to me.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.240
[Guest]: And you should also be very careful about this.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.080
[Guest]: But you know, she was one of the pioneers.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.500
[Guest]: So she had cleared the way quite a lot.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.840
[Guest]: By the time I came into journalism, yes, there were some ministers, there were some MLAs

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.640
[Guest]: who tried to make passes.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.920
[Guest]: But I knew how to deal with it, you know, I put them in their place.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.120
[Guest]: And once they got to know, once they got to know that you were not up for all these things,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.320
[Guest]: then they began to take you very seriously.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.680
[Amit Varma]: And also, I guess language was never a problem for you.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.560
[Amit Varma]: Because like you mentioned, before we started our conversation, you've pretty much grown

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.600
[Amit Varma]: up here, though, and you said you've come from MP, where you were born.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And isn't that something you have in common with Mr. Thackeray's father, Keshav Thackeray

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.120
[Guest]: also came from MP to Maharashtra.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.120
[Guest]: Yes, he did come from MP to Maharashtra, but he actually migrated.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
[Guest]: I was born there.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.240
[Guest]: My father was posted in Amarnath, close to close to Mumbai, you know, I mean, he was

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.360
[Guest]: with the defense services, you know, I mean, so I was born there.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.000
[Guest]: And then I came here, I grew up here.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
[Guest]: And well, but yes, I am a migrant, just like, just like the Thackerays, you know, I mean,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.600
[Guest]: I am a migrant.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.320
[Guest]: But Maharashtra government, particularly, I don't know whether this is true about other

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.640
[Guest]: states, it considers that if you have lived in Maharashtra continuously for 20 years,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.760
[Guest]: you have to be regarded as a native, you are a regular Maharashtrian, you know, I mean,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.040
[Guest]: so by that definition, I am a Maharashtrian, I'm an honorary Maharashtrian.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, I really enjoyed reading both your books, especially in Maharashtra Maximus,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.120
[Amit Varma]: which has come out recently is especially fascinating, because it sort of puts the fault

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.240
[Amit Varma]: lines in current Maharashtra politics in very sharp historical perspective.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, when people talk about contemporary politics, they'll talk about

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.560
[Amit Varma]: the Brahmins versus Marathas and so on.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And reading your book, I realized that this is a fault line that is not something that

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.840
[Amit Varma]: only in modern politics, it goes back hundreds of years.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.420
[Amit Varma]: Tell us a little bit more about that, about, you know, the schism between the two that

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.240
[Amit Varma]: sort of happened when the Peshwas took over from Shivaji.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:48.160
[Guest]: Yeah, now, Shivaji was a Maratha warrior king, and his son, Sambhaji, and grandson, Shahu

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
[Guest]: Maharaj.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160
[Guest]: You know, until then, it was the Bhosle dynasty, which had a tight grip on Maharashtra.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.480
[Guest]: But right from the times of Shivaji, Vishwanath Ballal was their Peshwa, their prime minister.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.080
[Guest]: And after that, after Shahuji, there was a split in the family.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: They were two sons, you know, I mean, there were two branches of the family.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.400
[Guest]: Tara Bai, who was the second wife, you know, she wanted the inheritance for her son, Rajaram.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.840
[Guest]: And of course, Shahu Maharaj was under the custody of Aurangzeb.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.320
[Guest]: Aurangzeb had kidnapped him and his mother.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.400
[Guest]: Then he got released, and he came and he sat on the throne.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.480
[Guest]: But by that time, there was a split in the dynasty.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.120
[Guest]: So there was one branch ruling out of Kolhapur, and one branch ruling out of Satara.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.280
[Guest]: Now the Peshwas, the prime ministers, the Ballal family, they took advantage of this.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.840
[Guest]: And while they ruled in the name of the Maratha kings, they were the actual warriors.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.960
[Guest]: Now they were Brahmins, and they were not a warrior caste.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.040
[Guest]: For those centuries, for those days, you know, I mean, they were not expected to go into

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.520
[Guest]: the battlefield.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.880
[Guest]: But Bajirao particularly, Bajirao Ballal, he is one general who never lost a battle,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.520
[Guest]: who never lost a war.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.400
[Guest]: He died early, but he never lost a war.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.520
[Guest]: And of course, the Marathas had a very guerrilla kind of fighting, you know, they never used

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.320
[Guest]: to have open battles, which is why the first open battle that they ever had, which was

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.240
[Guest]: the Panipat in 1761.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:21.280
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they lost that war, because they really could not fight that on open ground.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.640
[Guest]: And but until Bajirao was alive, he never lost a single war.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.160
[Guest]: And the Marathas, when we refer to Marathas, we also mean the Peshwas.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.720
[Guest]: But this Maratha Peshwa dynasty, I mean, that war that they lost, the battle of the war

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.280
[Guest]: of Panipat that they lost, it pushed them back by a whole generation.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.160
[Guest]: 20-25 years, they could not do anything.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.480
[Guest]: Then gradually, gradually the succeeding dynasties by that time, Shivaji's descendants were just

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.120
[Guest]: rubber stamps, if I may put it like that, you know, I mean, they were just putting the

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.400
[Guest]: mohary on all the decisions of the Peshwas.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:05.560
[Guest]: And the inheritors of Bajirao Ballal, the heirs of Bajirao Ballal, they gradually built

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.120
[Guest]: up the dynasty again.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.840
[Guest]: But they were a weakened lot and there was a lot of infighting amongst them after Bajirao's

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.360
[Guest]: death, you know, his brother, his nephews, everybody, they wanted a piece of the cake

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
[Guest]: and things like that.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.480
[Guest]: So the dynasty was highly weakened.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.280
[Guest]: And if you go back in history, Charles Metcalfe, Lord Charles Metcalfe, who was the governor

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.640
[Guest]: of Bombay, I think he had said that there are only two ruling powers in India.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.640
[Guest]: One is the British and the other are Marathas.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.960
[Guest]: And every territory they cede, we occupy and every territory we occupy is ceded to us by

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.080
[Guest]: the Marathas.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.200
[Guest]: So they were really ruling from north to south, from east to west, everywhere there was a

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.160
[Guest]: Maratha presence and they had gone as far back as Peshawar.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.240
[Guest]: And I believe that if they had not lost the Battle of Panipat, if they had not lost the

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.520
[Guest]: War of Panipat, maybe we would not have had a partition of India also, because there would

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.000
[Guest]: have been a Maratha rule over there.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.800
[Guest]: And we may not have had the partition of Bengal, because again, there would have been Maratha

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800
[Guest]: domination over there.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.120
[Guest]: But Marathas were pushed back from all the edges.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is very interesting.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Like again, bound by, you know, what we know of present day geography, people don't often

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.320
[Amit Varma]: realize how large the Maratha Empire was at its peak, like you point out from Peshawar

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.160
[Amit Varma]: to Tanjore and all the way to Bengal in the east and Gujarat in the west.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Another interesting phrase I picked up from your book, like I've spoken to many historians

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.080
[Amit Varma]: on the show and some of them have told me about how Shivaji's sort of kind of nationalism

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.040
[Amit Varma]: was an early version of the sort of Hindutva nationalism that we see today.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And in your book, I learned the phrase Maharashtra dharma.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from your book where you say, quote, Maharashtra dharma simplified for those

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.480
[Amit Varma]: unfamiliar with the term, meant not just Hindu dharma, but also nationalism.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:54.160
[Amit Varma]: It manifested in 17th century India in various ways, such as a protection of the cow, protection

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.600
[Amit Varma]: of Brahmins, a fight for independence from Muslim kings, and an attempt to restore morality

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.720
[Amit Varma]: in Indian Hindu society, which many felt had been destroyed by the Islamic rulers, stop

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
[Amit Varma]: quote.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.640
[Amit Varma]: I almost feel like this is, you know, like, it's the same, right?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640
[Guest]: In a sense.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.720
[Guest]: Yes, it is.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.960
[Guest]: And I received a lot of flack for writing that, you know, I mean, and people could not

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.720
[Guest]: accept there were lots of arguments, you know, during my book launch, etc, you know, saying

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.760
[Guest]: that they didn't agree with this.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.840
[Guest]: But you know, see, Shivaji had a royal saint, you know, all kings have their own resident

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.560
[Guest]: saints and all that, which was Ram Dass.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:37.760
[Guest]: And it was Ram Dass's campaign to restore all these old traditional ancient values,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760
[Guest]: etc.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.400
[Guest]: But Shivaji on his own, one must accept, you know, I mean, his closest generals, his most

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.720
[Guest]: trusted generals were Muslims, his bodyguard was a Muslim.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.800
[Guest]: And when he went out to meet Afzal Khan, you know, it was a Muslim bodyguard who warned

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.560
[Guest]: him that there is some conspiracy afoot and you better be careful because they might be

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560
[Guest]: killing you.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.400
[Guest]: And Afzal Khan's conspirator was a Maharashtrian Brahmin.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.160
[Guest]: So there were really no straight lines dividing the Muslims from the Hindus.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.440
[Guest]: But yes, they wanted their cultural values to be restored.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.560
[Guest]: And Shivaji's campaign was for a Hindvi Swaraj.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:22.880
[Guest]: That means an Indian self-rule, not like Hindutva Vadi, not exactly the Hindutva Vadi that we

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880
[Guest]: are facing today.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.960
[Guest]: You know, I mean, today it is only majoritarianism, it is only Hindutva, which is where I distinguish

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.080
[Guest]: today in modern day also, I distinguish Hinduism from Hindutva, you know, I mean, which is

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080
[Guest]: very different.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.680
[Guest]: Hindutva is a political philosophy, is a political philosophy and Hinduism is a religion.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.080
[Guest]: But Chhatrapati Shivaji had no problems taking advice from Muslim generals, having Muslim

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.560
[Guest]: generals in his army, they used to lead him into battle, etc.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.280
[Guest]: So there was no communal divide at that point of time.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's interesting that obviously Hindutva, like you correctly said, is a sort

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.320
[Amit Varma]: of a political philosophy that the way I had understood it goes back to the early 20th

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:08.440
[Amit Varma]: century is basically Savarkar, RSS, Gita Press, all of that happening in the 1910s, 1920s,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440
[Amit Varma]: around that period.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.280
[Amit Varma]: So I was sort of very intrigued to find earlier articulations of it, such as sort of Shivaji's

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.040
[Amit Varma]: muscular nationalism.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And I guess even as Hindvi Swaraj, the way he understood it, self-rule by the people

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.880
[Amit Varma]: here excluded the Mughal rulers and the Islamic rulers from that, from his understanding of

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360
[Amit Varma]: what, you know, what our nation is, right?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.040
[Guest]: You know, Shivaji was in Pune, you know, he inherited a patch of land from his father

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:41.280
[Guest]: in Pune, which then one of his, what do you say, Acharyas, I could say, you know, I mean,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.920
[Guest]: he helped him because Shivaji was a child at that point of time and Shivaji's father

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.040
[Guest]: was also separated from his mother.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.360
[Guest]: He was married a second time and he was with the Islamic kingdoms in the south, in the

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.200
[Guest]: Deccan, you know, he was a general in that kingdom.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.040
[Guest]: And Shivaji was quashed between Mughals in the north and these Deccan Islamic kingdoms

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.360
[Guest]: in the south.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.920
[Guest]: And he was in Pune, which was a really wild patch of land.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.760
[Guest]: There were wolves, there were hyenas in what we know as Pune today.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.840
[Guest]: And a reward was given, you know, people said that if you can come and you can clear this

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.400
[Guest]: patch of the hyenas and wolves and everything, we will set up a kingdom here.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.920
[Guest]: So a lot of farmers came and cleared that place, etc.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.520
[Guest]: And then he set up his kingdom over there.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.360
[Guest]: And he had a very difficult task, you know, I mean, squashed between these two sides.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.560
[Guest]: But then he did make friends with the Deccan Islamic kingdoms.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.480
[Guest]: Even if they were not very good friends, you know, they had an understanding, they had

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.700
[Guest]: a military understanding.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.440
[Guest]: But the Mughals were really enemies because, you know, they kidnapped him.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.560
[Guest]: And even there, Raja Jai Singh, who was sent to kidnap Shivaji, he was a Rajput, he was

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.680
[Guest]: a Hindu Rajput and he was working on behalf of Aurangzeb.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.400
[Guest]: And Aurangzeb kidnapped him, kept him in the Agra fort, etc.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.640
[Guest]: He escaped from there, you know.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.280
[Guest]: So there was a big history between him and Aurangzeb and then Sambhaji, his son and Aurangzeb,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
[Guest]: etc.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.400
[Guest]: Sambhaji was put to death by Aurangzeb.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And reportedly one of the reasons was he refused to name the Mughals who helped him.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.640
[Guest]: Yes, the collaborators, including Aurangzeb's son, who was in Sambhaji's army.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.780
[Guest]: You know, he refused to give away his position.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.560
[Guest]: And Sambhaji's position was given away by a Maratha general, you know, the More family.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.240
[Guest]: So these things, you know, are, what do you say, they're not etched in sharp black and

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.080
[Guest]: white lines, you know, I mean, it keeps moving between various things.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.840
[Amit Varma]: No, it's very interesting.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.400
[Amit Varma]: And there also you see traces of what you see in contemporary politics, where no matter

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.320
[Amit Varma]: how strongly an ideology is stated, eventually you make friends and enemies of convenience.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.000
[Guest]: Yes, yes, you do.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.680
[Guest]: And you know, that way Balasaheb Thackeray is seen as a very sharp, vicious, violent

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.720
[Guest]: Hindutva wadi.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:59.600
[Guest]: But it is interesting that his party was set up in 1966.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.440
[Guest]: And the first time that he sort of won the municipal corporation elections, he won it

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.840
[Guest]: on the issue of Vande Mataram.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.040
[Guest]: Because that time, right from then, a Muslim corporator from the Congress had said that

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.480
[Guest]: I cannot sing Vande Mataram.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.320
[Guest]: And Thackeray was looking for this issue to go to the polls.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.840
[Guest]: And so he just seized on Vande Mataram.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.080
[Guest]: And he had a very vicious campaign against the Muslims.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.000
[Guest]: But still he did not win a majority in the BMC.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.880
[Guest]: And now to form a standing committee, he needed the support of two or three more corporators.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.800
[Guest]: Who do you think he goes to?

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.440
[Guest]: He goes to GM Banatwala of the Indian Union Muslim League.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.200
[Guest]: You know, you have just fought against that party.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.520
[Guest]: You have called them names, but neither Banatwala nor Bal Thackeray have any problem joining

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.120
[Guest]: hands and becoming part of the standing committee.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.960
[Guest]: And this kind of a thing has now continued into this century, into this decade.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, anybody who thinks it is politically convenient.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.680
[Guest]: Years ago, I had Madhavrao Sindhia.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.760
[Guest]: The late Madhavrao Sindhia used to be the General Secretary in charge of Maharashtra.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.480
[Guest]: And it was Vajpayee's government in the center.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.840
[Guest]: So then I had said that, well, if they don't prove a majority, then they will have to resign

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.280
[Guest]: and there will be elections.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.280
[Guest]: So he said, I don't have any hopes of that, you know, because they will break the other

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.480
[Guest]: political parties and anybody, you know, who's getting a little slice of power will go with

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480
[Guest]: them.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480
[Guest]: And so I said, what about ideology?

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.720
[Guest]: So he said, ideology doesn't matter.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.940
[Guest]: It is only power that matters.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.080
[Guest]: So that is exactly what is happening even today.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, another interesting example of Thackeray, and of course, we'll speak about him more

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.600
[Amit Varma]: later in this episode, is he had the India Pakistan match stopped where he had the pitch

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.840
[Unknown]: at Wankhede dug up in 91.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And yet, not long after that, he's hanging out with Javed Mian Dada and saying, oh, don't

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.400
[Amit Varma]: worry, we'll have more matches here and all of that.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:49.560
[Amit Varma]: So in private, it's one thing in public, another thing and let's kind of sort of, you know,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:55.200
[Amit Varma]: go back into history and sort of talk about, you know, the birth of the shaping of Bombay

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200
[Amit Varma]: itself.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, like it's very interesting, like, you know, you had a lot of nativist claims

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:06.440
[Amit Varma]: made about Bombay in the last few decades by Thackeray and others, but the interesting

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.720
[Amit Varma]: thing about Bombay is that its origin is actually very syncretic.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it was basically two islands owned by Sultan Muhammad Shah.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.560
[Amit Varma]: He gives that to the Portuguese.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.520
[Amit Varma]: The Portuguese give it as dowry to the British when Prince Charles marries Catherine of Braganza

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.720
[Amit Varma]: in 1662.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And then the British don't really know what to do there.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.640
[Amit Varma]: And there are, you know, Kohli fishermen on those islands and there's not much, but then

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.520
[Amit Varma]: it becomes a good port for shipping cotton and they set up cotton mills and Bombay becomes,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.240
[Amit Varma]: as you point out, a mini Manchester of the East.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And what happens interestingly there is that all the migrant labor brought in is from other

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.880
[Amit Varma]: rural parts of Maharashtra and from elsewhere.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: So it isn't as if the original ingredients were necessarily Marathi.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.760
[Guest]: It's just a mix of all of these.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
[Guest]: Yes, it is a mix.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.880
[Guest]: You know, see Surat was a port right from Mughal times.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.640
[Guest]: You know, they used to sail their ships from there, they had to go to Hajj etc.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.440
[Guest]: So they used to sail from Surat.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.280
[Guest]: And the British also used Surat, Portuguese also used that port, Dutch also used that

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.280
[Guest]: port.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.920
[Guest]: But then the British came into these seven islands of Bombay and they joined them together

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.960
[Guest]: and they realized this strategically it was a very good port for military purposes and

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.040
[Guest]: also for commercial purposes.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:27.520
[Guest]: So when the importance shifted from Surat and Porbandar to Bombay, then there were a

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.640
[Guest]: lot of Gujarati, Hindu, Jain, Sindhis, Marwadis, Bora Muslims, Parsis etc.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.440
[Guest]: You know, I mean, shifting quickly towards Bombay and they were amongst the first ones

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.860
[Guest]: to set up the textile mills etc.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.360
[Guest]: And all said and done, yes, there were these Kohli fishermen and there was a migrant labor

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.800
[Guest]: from interior of Maharashtra.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.360
[Guest]: But Bombay was actually built up by the Gujaratis, which is the core of the fight between the

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.320
[Guest]: Maharashtrians and the Gujaratis at the moment.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.520
[Guest]: So when after independence, this became a Bombay state, it was a bilingual state, Parsi

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.640
[Guest]: Saurashtra and Kutch were in Bombay state.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.360
[Guest]: And you know, the first chief minister of Bombay state was a Maharashtrian, but Muraji

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.480
[Guest]: Desai was the second chief minister.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.040
[Guest]: And there were these, you know, we talk about the Gujarati duo at the moment, you know,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.120
[Guest]: Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, but there was also a Gujarati duo in the 50s, you know,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.200
[Guest]: I mean, which was Vallabhbhai Patel and Muraji Desai, you know, who were accused of having

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.480
[Guest]: overdue influence on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.560
[Guest]: And Nehru preferred to listen to Sardar Patel and to Muraji Desai rather than to YB Chavan

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.440
[Guest]: and the other Maharashtrian leaders.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.440
[Guest]: And there was this movement, you know, I mean, for separating the two and all the Maharashtrian

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.320
[Guest]: leaders complained that whatever the funds are allocated to the Bombay state, these strong

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.040
[Guest]: Gujarati leaders divert that towards Saurashtra and Kutch.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040
[Guest]: We don't get anything.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.480
[Guest]: Western Maharashtra doesn't get anything.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.600
[Guest]: Vidarbha at that point of time was with Madhya Pradesh, with Mahakosha and Marathwada was

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.280
[Guest]: still with the Nizam of Hyderabad.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.320
[Guest]: It was part of Hyderabad state.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.920
[Guest]: So Western Maharashtra and Bombay were with Bombay state.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.200
[Guest]: So they say, we don't get any funds, you know, all the funds are diverted towards Saurashtra

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
[Guest]: and Kutch.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.280
[Guest]: So they started a movement incidentally, Bal Thackeray's father was also a big part of

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.040
[Guest]: that movement and they started and then the Congress in those days who did not have any

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.240
[Guest]: competition, began to lose a lot of votes, you know, I mean, they began to lose a lot

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.440
[Guest]: of seats and it went to all Chutput parties, I would say, you know, I mean, like Sayukta

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.960
[Guest]: Maharashtra Movement Party and Communist Party and things like that.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.560
[Guest]: They were not really very strong parties, but still people prefer to vote against the

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560
[Guest]: Congress.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.440
[Guest]: So Nehru got unnerved and then he gave in to Chavan's exhortation, said, Muraji said

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.960
[Guest]: that if you are splitting Bombay state, you know, we want Bombay as our state capital

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.440
[Guest]: because we are responsible for building it up the way it is.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.240
[Guest]: But then Nehru conceded and gave Bombay to Maharashtra.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.160
[Guest]: But once Bombay came to Maharashtra, local Maharashtrians discovered that they still

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.600
[Guest]: did not have rights in their own state capital.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.200
[Guest]: They were still second class citizens because this was full of South Indians.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.240
[Guest]: If you go and look up the Bombay Municipal Corporation, the list of mayors up to the

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.240
[Guest]: 50s and the 60s are all South Indians, Keralites, Tamilians, Kannadigas or Parsis, etc.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240
[Guest]: There's not a single Maharashtrian.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.120
[Guest]: Gujaratis are also mayors, but not a single Maharashtrian.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.880
[Guest]: And then, you know, in South Bombay, in areas like Girgaon and all those kind of places,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.360
[Guest]: there was a major redevelopment, the kind that is taking place in Muhammad Ali Road,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.800
[Guest]: which is under the Syedna, he's redeveloping the area.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.760
[Guest]: So Maharashtra government had taken a redevelopment and during that redevelopment, much of the

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: housing went to either the South Indians or the rich Gujaratis.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.160
[Guest]: Nothing came to Maharashtrians.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.160
[Guest]: And this is what bothered Thackeray quite a lot.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.120
[Guest]: You know, and that is how he set up the Shiv Sena saying that if there are jobs going in

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.840
[Guest]: Bombay and if there are, he was basically a Bombay based party at that point of time.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.400
[Guest]: And if there is a housing redevelopment, houses have to go to Maharashtrians and jobs have

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.440
[Guest]: to go to Maharashtrians.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.160
[Guest]: And that is how the whole, what do you say, it's still cosmopolitan, but it shifted its

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.120
[Guest]: focus towards Maharashtrians after that.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.400
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, your book, Maharashtra Maximus does a very good job of sort of delineating

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.760
[Amit Varma]: the second fault line, the Maharashtrians versus Gujaratis fault line.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Like as you point out, you know, before independence, the British had set up the BMC and you could

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.480
[Amit Varma]: only vote if you were a taxpayer.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.960
[Amit Varma]: So the majority of the taxpayers were Gujaratis, Parsis, Boras, Sindhis, because the Maharashtrians

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.200
[Amit Varma]: happened to be mostly the migrant labor brought in to work in the mills and so on and so forth.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.720
[Amit Varma]: And then even after independence, when you have universal franchise, but still, you know,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.800
[Amit Varma]: as a sort of legacy of the past, your corporators and all that are Gujaratis, Parsis, Boras

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and Sindhis, but your bureaucrats are all Tamil and you know, they are running the administration.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is, as you point out, what led to the Samyukta Maharashtra movement coming up.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.160
[Amit Varma]: I was struck by this very amusing anecdote, which gave me a sense of how shrill the rhetoric

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.160
[Amit Varma]: got, where when Murarji was Chief Minister, like at one point to just give context to

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.200
[Amit Varma]: this, you say, I'll quote from your book, quote, the turning point in the agitation

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.840
[Amit Varma]: came when he ordered, he being Murarji, ordered the police to fire on a protesting mob at

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Flora Fountain, which resulted in the martyring of a hundred and six protesters, a fact that

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.200
[Amit Varma]: has not yet been forgotten by the local populace, stop quote.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And obviously this spilled out in the streets and Maharashtrian leaders, you write, who

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.560
[Amit Varma]: were stalwarts of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, coined this beautiful slogan, Mumbai

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.200
[Amit Varma]: aahi aamchi, nahi konachi bappachi.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.760
[Guest]: It doesn't belong to anybody's father.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760
[Amit Varma]: It belongs to us.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760
[Amit Varma]: It belongs to us.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.880
[Guest]: No, it's nobody's father's property.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.320
[Guest]: And Murarji got really very angry with that.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.880
[Guest]: You know, rural Marathi is sometimes very rustic and even Thakre used to speak a bit

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880
[Guest]: like that.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.560
[Guest]: He used to call it Thakri Bhaja, you know, very rough, very rude, very rustic, but they

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.640
[Guest]: probably don't mean anything with that.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.400
[Guest]: So Murarji got a little angry about that.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:56.620
[Guest]: So he said, barah Mumbai tumchi, ata bhandi ghasan aamchi.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.120
[Guest]: That means now you come and scrub our utensils.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.640
[Guest]: What he meant to say is that we are the rich entrepreneurs and you are just domestic servants

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.680
[Guest]: in our house.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.520
[Guest]: So that is your place.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.120
[Guest]: And that is what really rattled the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, saying that, you know,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.160
[Guest]: I mean, in our own state, in our own city, you know, I mean, they are making us feel

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.200
[Guest]: as second class citizens and then they came out on the streets and Murarji was again,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.760
[Guest]: you know, very hot tempered man.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.920
[Guest]: So he ordered a firing and those 106 people were martyred and the movement never looked

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920
[Guest]: back after that.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they had to concede Bombay to Maharashtra.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.080
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I'm just thinking that if a chief minister today ordered a firing and 106 people

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.920
[Amit Varma]: died in Flora Fountain, I mean, it's almost unthinkable.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.320
[Amit Varma]: And so one can sort of imagine how deep the wounds went.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And you also, you sort of point out in your book about how there were all these different

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.960
[Amit Varma]: little groupings which were coming up, fighting for the cause of the Marathi people like the

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Samyukta Maharashtra movement and so on and so forth.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:00.360
[Amit Varma]: But what made Bal Thackeray Shiv Sena stand out was his oratory and his ability to draw

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.360
[Guest]: the crowds.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360
[Guest]: Yes.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.560
[Guest]: You know, if you have read my book on Bal Thackeray, I have insisted that, you know,

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.640
[Guest]: Bal Thackeray is a creature of the Congress, you know, because the Congress leaders also

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.080
[Guest]: were rebelling against this, you know, domination of South Indians, domination of Gujaratis,

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080
[Guest]: etc.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.080
[Guest]: They wanted a state for themselves.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.480
[Guest]: And much of what Bal Thackeray said later, you know, speak Marathi in BMC, it did not

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.280
[Guest]: come from Shiv Sena or Bal Thackeray.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.680
[Guest]: It came from the Congress leaders.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.920
[Guest]: It came from George Fernandez.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.360
[Guest]: It came from Rinal Gore.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.160
[Guest]: It didn't come from Bal Thackeray because there was this sub-nationalism even in the

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: Congress leaders.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.880
[Guest]: But they were these Gandhi topiwallas, they were these khadi clad leaders and they could

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.040
[Guest]: hardly descend on the streets and they could hardly say that, you know, throughout the

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040
[Guest]: South Indians.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.960
[Guest]: Now, you know, I mean, when the Shiv Sena came to power in 1995, Bal Thackeray in his

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.400
[Guest]: first address said that, you know, I mean, we will deny ration cards to North Indians,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.400
[Guest]: migrating North Indians.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.600
[Guest]: By that time, North Indians were migrating in hoards to Mumbai.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.040
[Guest]: But the first claim like that was made by a Sayukta Maharashtra movement legislator

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.380
[Guest]: in the assembly saying that we should deny ration cards to South Indians.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.380
[Guest]: We should not allow them.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.280
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they are consuming our water, they are consuming our natural resources,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.280
[Guest]: etc.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.880
[Guest]: So Bal Thackeray only copied those ideas.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.880
[Guest]: However, the Congress could not openly come out and say these kind of things.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.440
[Guest]: So they kind of, you know, I mean, set up Bal Thackeray.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.000
[Guest]: And in those days in the 70s, Shiv Sena used to be known as Vasanth Sena.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.840
[Guest]: After Vasanth Rao Naik, who was the chief minister and Vasanth Dada Patil, who was the

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.320
[Guest]: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress president.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:39.000
[Guest]: So it was a clear indication that, you know, they are the ones who are funding and fueling,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.880
[Guest]: you know, Bal Thackeray's sub-nationalism and his regionalism.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.280
[Guest]: And at that point of time, there was a sharp divide between Maharashtrians on one side,

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.880
[Guest]: South Indians, of course, because they were white collar workers, but they were more easily

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880
[Guest]: surmountable.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.400
[Guest]: And the Gujaratis who were the moneybags and the Congress needed the moneybags for themselves,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.400
[Guest]: you know, so they had to be very careful and they had to do it in a very diplomatic fashion.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.240
[Guest]: And Bal Thackeray was their answer to that.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And the tactical element of this is very interesting, because again, another thing people might

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.640
[Amit Varma]: not realize today, where the communists have pretty much been decimated everywhere.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.320
[Amit Varma]: But in those days, in the 50s and 60s, the communists were very big.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.920
[Amit Varma]: They were the, you know, the biggest threat in a sense, in a local sense to the Congress.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, they had all the mill workers with them and all that.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.080
[Amit Varma]: So tactically, it made total sense for the Congress to have their so-called D-team, you

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.560
[Amit Varma]: know, the Vasanth Sena and then let these guys fight the communists while they can just

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.760
[Amit Varma]: sit back and, you know, sort of be the mature party.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.320
[Amit Varma]: Like there's a political concept I think of in this regard, which is the Overton window.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.680
[Amit Varma]: So the Overton window basically is, it's sort of this space within which this linear space

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.600
[Amit Varma]: within which there is a window, which constitutes acceptable discourse.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.760
[Amit Varma]: So for example, if it is drawn along the line of freedom, at one extreme, you have complete

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.140
[Amit Varma]: freedom at the other extreme, you have complete authoritarianism.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.840
[Amit Varma]: And in between, there's a window of what the discourse is.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And the Overton window can shift where if one party makes a lot of noise, say in terms

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.440
[Amit Varma]: of total freedom, then people who would, the window shifts in that direction.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.800
[Amit Varma]: So people who would otherwise not have been acceptable in the discourse suddenly seem

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800
[Amit Varma]: moderate.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just sort of thinking aloud, tell me if you agree with this, that what this

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.360
[Amit Varma]: also made the Congress, it made the Congress look more mature and more reasonable and almost

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.560
[Amit Varma]: like the adults in the room, because you have these two crazies on either side.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.920
[Guest]: Yes, and that is what their intention was.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.960
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they did not want to soil their hands, you know, by getting into this

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.720
[Guest]: whole thing and becoming parochial and pushing out other people.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.520
[Guest]: The Constitution allows freedom of movement anywhere in the country and the Congress,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.560
[Guest]: you know, just coming out freshly out of freedom, just 20 years into freedom, they just really

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.280
[Guest]: could not do this kind of a thing.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.800
[Guest]: So they set up this maverick, you know, I mean, who was, but how did he get away?

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.360
[Guest]: Because you know, there's also a murder case, they murdered a communist leader in Lalbagh.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.080
[Guest]: And then a Shiv Sena man contested that seat, you know, and he became the first legislator

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.080
[Guest]: in the Maharashtra Assembly.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.400
[Guest]: How did the Shiv Sena and Bal Thackeray get away with it?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: You know, I mean, unless they had the sanction of the authorities, unless the government

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.480
[Guest]: was protecting, you know, I mean, he could not have got away with it.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480
[Guest]: The case is still in court.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480
[Guest]: It is 40, 50 years.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.480
[Unknown]: This was Dange.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480
[Amit Varma]: No, Desai, Krishna Desai.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:26.400
[Guest]: Dange was another person with whom Bal Thackeray, although he was a communist, and Bal Thackeray

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.400
[Guest]: was a, what do you say, sharp regionalist.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: Dange and Bal Thackeray came together briefly, maybe one or a couple of meetings in Lalbagh.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.080
[Guest]: And then Thackeray never liked to concede second place to anybody.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.640
[Guest]: And Dange also had a great oratory, not in Thackeray's style, but he had a great oratory

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.280
[Guest]: with which the mill workers reacted to and listened to and they resonated with it.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.200
[Guest]: So Thackeray did not like the fact that Dange was overshadowing him, you know.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.240
[Guest]: So he promptly dropped that alliance with Dange.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.720
[Amit Varma]: No, and I remember you mentioned this part in your book that, you know, Thackeray calls

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.480
[Amit Varma]: him and they give a speech and Dange speaks first.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.400
[Unknown]: And he's so reasonable and yet he gets a crowd with him.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.480
[Unknown]: Thackeray is, of course, you know, a rabble rouser and Thackeray immediately then never

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480
[Amit Varma]: asked.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And the person accused of the Desai murder eventually became a minister in the 95th cabinet.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280
[Guest]: Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.040
[Guest]: He became a minister and he was not brought to book, you know, I mean, so it could not

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.800
[Guest]: have happened without the complicit sanction of the rulers at that time and the rulers

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.040
[Amit Varma]: were only the Congress, you know.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And in your book on Thackeray, Hindu Raza Samrat, you've got these very evocative early

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.520
[Amit Varma]: sections that give us a glimpse into Thackeray's early resentments, like when he worked at

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.520
[Unknown]: the Free Press Journal, for example, R.K.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.720
[Amit Varma]: Lakshman was one of his colleagues and everybody else, all the senior management, the editors

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.600
[Unknown]: and all that was South India and they kept referring Lakshman's cartoons to his and he

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.500
[Amit Varma]: felt that that was discrimination and his cartoons have been described by various people

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.640
[Amit Varma]: as being extremely crude and not quite in the Lakshman class.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.760
[Amit Varma]: But he took that resentment with him almost like a generation earlier and I don't mean

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.920
[Amit Varma]: to imply an equivalence, but almost as if, you know, 50 years before that, you know,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.300
[Amit Varma]: Hitler took the knocks he got at art school from the Jews and so on and carried that resentment

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.080
[Amit Varma]: all the way through.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.240
[Amit Varma]: My question is, you've known Thackeray pretty well personally as well.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:25.160
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, one can say that this was a genuine ideology, that he really felt strongly

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.840
[Unknown]: about this, that we Marathis must have our place and he was really committed to that

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.420
[Amit Varma]: sub-nationalism.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.280
[Amit Varma]: But then as you also point out, there are so many contradictions in his actions and

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.520
[Amit Varma]: his targets keep shifting according to what is tactically feasible at different points

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.400
[Amit Varma]: in time from South Indians to Muslims to North Indians later and so on.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.920
[Amit Varma]: So was he a man who had firm beliefs of any kind and ideology of some sort or was he a

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.440
[Amit Varma]: political tactician who wanted to be a politician and then just picked whatever niche was most

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.920
[Guest]: promising at a given point in time?

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.200
[Guest]: No, I think he was a political tactician, you know, he was not committed to any ideology.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.400
[Guest]: Otherwise, he would not have aligned with the Muslim League.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:11.120
[Guest]: He would not have called for a school or a hospital on the disputed site in Ayodhya,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.240
[Guest]: which he did after participating in the riots post the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.620
[Guest]: He then later called for a school or a hospital when he realized that the Muslims were voting

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.680
[Guest]: for him because Muslims had extended an olive branch.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.260
[Guest]: And you know, I have always insisted that his only ideology was himself.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.240
[Guest]: He did believe in the Marathi Manus.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.520
[Guest]: He did want to get something for them, but there again, if you notice, you know, the

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.040
[Guest]: generational change that has happened in the Shiv Sena, he worked with lumpens.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.320
[Guest]: You know, he wanted an army, you know, like one call to the army and, you know, they are

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.960
[Guest]: all in the streets, they are flooding the streets and they are causing problems, you

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.400
[Guest]: know, they're causing riots, etc.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.680
[Guest]: So he had an interest in keeping them slightly undereducated, you know, I mean, people who

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.280
[Guest]: will not turn around and ask questions.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.360
[Guest]: Like, you know, a friend of mine told me that when you join the NDA, they of course, they

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.240
[Guest]: fail you if you get three out of ten, but they also fail you if you get eight out of

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240
[Guest]: ten.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.760
[Guest]: So it's between four and seven.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.440
[Guest]: Four and seven, because they don't want you to be too intelligent and ask questions and

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.360
[Guest]: question your commanding officers.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.960
[Guest]: So that is what was with Bal Thackeray.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.160
[Guest]: He did not want too educated and too questioning people, you know.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.560
[Guest]: So yes, you know, I mean, moderately educated and then, you know, like with his Lokadikar

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: Samiti and like with his trade unions, he will come to know that there are jobs opening

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.040
[Guest]: up in Air India or Mazgaon docks and, you know, they will be very happy.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.560
[Guest]: Balasaheb got us a job as fitter, loader, turner in all these places.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.880
[Guest]: But they never had any ambition beyond that, you know, I mean, it is only the second generation

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.200
[Guest]: which has woken up and realized that they were not qualified, you know, I mean, their

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: children were not qualified, etc.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.600
[Guest]: Or they were not qualified.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.240
[Guest]: And so they started to send their children to better schools, wanted them to become graduates,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.560
[Guest]: wanted them to speak English and not restrict themselves to Marathi.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.680
[Guest]: I have quoted, you know, someone in my book, Arun Tikkarkar, who was the editor of Lok

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680
[Guest]: Satta.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.600
[Guest]: So he said, Maharashtrian society suffered a generational setback thrice in the past

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.600
[Guest]: few centuries.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.960
[Guest]: One was this war of Panipat, which the Peshwas lost, the Marathas lost.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.800
[Guest]: It took them 25 years to come back.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.280
[Guest]: Second was Mahatma Gandhi's assassination by Nathuram Godse.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.920
[Guest]: People did not trust Maharashtrians for a long time after that.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.800
[Guest]: There were very few Maharashtrians in Nehru's cabinet or in Indira Gandhi's cabinet, etc.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.440
[Guest]: They didn't trust Maharashtrians.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.240
[Guest]: And the third was when Bal Thackeray set up the Shiv Sena, you know, because outside of

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.160
[Guest]: Maharashtra, everybody got the picture of Maharashtrians as, you know, I mean, wicked,

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.400
[Guest]: evil, writers, you know, I mean, they are terrible, you know, I mean, they kill you,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.680
[Guest]: you know, I mean, they don't allow you to seek jobs in the state and things like that,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.000
[Guest]: in which the middle class Maharashtrians hated that picture.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.440
[Guest]: They hated that picture because they knew that they were not like that.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.280
[Guest]: So there was one time when only the lumpens were supporting Bal Thackeray.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.640
[Guest]: But then when Uddhav Thackeray took over the thing, he realized what had happened and he

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.200
[Guest]: wanted a better class of Maharashtrians to be supporting the Shiv Sena, to be representing

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.560
[Guest]: the Shiv Sena, which is why this change has taken place, you know, I mean, and also the

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.680
[Guest]: government that we have got, it is essentially because the Shiv Sena has stopped being the

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.960
[Guest]: kind of violent party, you know, okay, fine, it is saying Hindutva, it is asking for the

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.240
[Guest]: Ram temple, but they have managed to keep that on the back burner.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.560
[Guest]: And they managed to form a government essentially because they are nonviolent and they believe

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560
[Guest]: in the constitution.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.360
[Guest]: Bal Thackeray never believed in the constitution or in nonviolence.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, another thing I realized while reading your book is the key shifts

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.520
[Amit Varma]: in the Shiv Sena, like we see that when it starts, a lot of the people who are with Thackeray

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.920
[Amit Varma]: are actually educated people who are reading because he started this magazine called Marmik,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.880
[Amit Varma]: as you point out, and they're all educated middle class Maharashtrians who are sort of

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.880
[Amit Varma]: with the movement.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And then he goes completely the lumpen way and the rowdies sort of take over the party

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.280
[Unknown]: and that's happening through the 70s into the late 70s.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that earlier the thinking rationalist educated middle class kind of goes away from

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.340
[Amit Varma]: him and it becomes a party of lumpens.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.960
[Amit Varma]: And you've got this very evocative chapter in your book called Marathi Manus, which in

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.840
[Amit Varma]: fact I first read as a Kindle single.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.800
[Unknown]: It was I think released on its own.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And it's also there on juggernaut on its own, I think.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'll link that from the show notes.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:21.720
[Amit Varma]: And that describes it very evocatively how, because he would get these menial jobs for

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:27.220
[Amit Varma]: his Shiv Sena foot soldiers through the use of force and all that, that there'll be factory

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.480
[Amit Varma]: watchmen and there'll be, you know, jobs of that sort, that there wasn't a stress on education

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.700
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And because of that, an entire generation lost those opportunities and they just kind

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.680
[Amit Varma]: of went forever.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that in that particular case, normally politicians don't

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.640
[Amit Varma]: walk the talk, but in that particular case, even his, the kids of his own family, Uddhav

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.360
[Guest]: and Raj didn't really have a great education in the sense they went.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360
[Guest]: No, they didn't.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.000
[Guest]: That is one thing you have to give credit to Thackeray.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.920
[Guest]: You know, I mean, he imposed me Marathi and he imposed, you know, I'm in Marathi medium.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.480
[Guest]: So he sent his children to those kinds of schools.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.320
[Guest]: Today they feel handicapped.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.440
[Guest]: They feel handicapped, which is why they have sent their children to Bombay's courtesans

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.080
[Guest]: and Xavier's and things like that.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.160
[Guest]: And I think Rashmi and Uddhav Thackeray are very proud of Aditya Thackeray that he's able

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.160
[Guest]: to hold his own.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.160
[Guest]: He's part of the Pathri crowd.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.680
[Guest]: He's part of the bold and beautiful, which they were never able to do.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.040
[Guest]: You know, I mean, because not only that, you know, I mean, Uddhav and Raj were not really

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:28.280
[Guest]: educated in that sense, but, but, you know, I mean, they were also seen as such, you know,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.520
[Guest]: I mean, in the sense, you know, these are not the kind of people we want to associate

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.320
[Guest]: with, because they are violent, they beat up people.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.280
[Guest]: And even, even middle class Maharashtrians didn't want to do it.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.000
[Guest]: Forget about North Indians and South Indians and other people, they didn't want to do it.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.200
[Guest]: So it has been a conscious shift in the Shiv Sena.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.800
[Guest]: And in that chapter, which you just quoted, I have a story about this person who's now

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.240
[Guest]: a very top ranking PR person.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.440
[Guest]: And he was living in Lalbagh and his mother was in, was teaching English in a government

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.440
[Guest]: school, in a government or a municipal school.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.960
[Guest]: But, you know, long before Thackeray's policy of Me Marathi, she wanted her children to

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.840
[Guest]: learn the mother tongue.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.920
[Guest]: So she put her children into Marathi medium schools, initially, you know, primary, etc.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.400
[Guest]: But whenever they wanted to read English books, you know, she always went to the library and

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.720
[Guest]: got them, you know, so she got them Shakespeare, she got them Banerjee, etc.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.040
[Guest]: And as these children grew up, they began more interested in reading English literature,

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040
[Guest]: etc.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.280
[Guest]: And then they began to question and Lalbagh was really right in the heart of the Shiv

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.600
[Guest]: Sena fortress, you know.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.240
[Guest]: So this particular person began to question Thackeray's parochial policies and he got

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.200
[Guest]: beaten up, right, royally by all the Shiv Sena supporters, etc.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.880
[Guest]: Every time he used to get beaten up whenever he used to ask questions, but then he got

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880
[Guest]: a job.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.920
[Guest]: First he became a journalist, then he moved into PR.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.920
[Guest]: And now he lives in a huge flat and he facing the sea.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.560
[Guest]: And he has about two or three cars parked in his basement, etc.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.200
[Guest]: And then he told me that, you know, I mean, I'm still friends with those people that I

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.360
[Guest]: grew up with.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.120
[Guest]: And then I invite them home and then they come and then they look at my cars and then

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.120
[Guest]: they look at my house and they look at the sea facing window, etc.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.400
[Guest]: And they don't say anything.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.220
[Guest]: And even I don't say anything, although I want to tell them, I tell you so.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:22.560
[Guest]: And I want to tell them that, you know, around the time when you were lending your muscle

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.720
[Guest]: to Bal Thackeray, I was sitting in the libraries of Mumbai reading Shakespeare in Burnet Shaw.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.880
[Guest]: And getting mocked for it.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.160
[Guest]: Which is why I'm here and you are where you are, you know, I mean, so that, that's

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.120
[Guest]: that difference has been understood by the second generation of Shiv Senik.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.480
[Guest]: So they don't want that.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.200
[Guest]: And if you remember, I don't know whether you were in Bombay that time.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.520
[Guest]: There was a time, you know, when the Shiv Seniks used to go to all these convent schools,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.240
[Guest]: you know, St. Anne's, Don Bosco, etc.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.720
[Guest]: And they used to beat up the fathers and the nuns, etc., because they wanted their children

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.000
[Guest]: to be admitted to those schools.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.240
[Guest]: And these missionary schools, you know, they have a very strict thing, you know, I mean,

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.920
[Guest]: and they also put a lot of weightage on their parents.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.240
[Guest]: Are your parents educated, are your parents speaking English, you know, I mean, are they

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.840
[Guest]: capable of doing your homework?

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.320
[Guest]: I mean, helping you do your homework, etc.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320
[Amit Varma]: Do they beat up the teachers?

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.760
[Guest]: Yeah, because you are not admitting, you're not admitting, you know, I mean, that kind

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.840
[Guest]: of a thing.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.840
[Guest]: And then the Archdiocese, you know, they passed a law saying that we are not going to listen

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.120
[Guest]: to politicians.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.960
[Guest]: I mean, we are not going to admit politician children just because they are, you know,

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.120
[Guest]: I mean, they are politicians' children, they have to come here on merit.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.760
[Guest]: You know, the parents have to come and they have to answer the same questions.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.080
[Guest]: And when they realize that they're not getting admission in these schools, then they shifted

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.880
[Guest]: to certain other schools like, you know, Bombay Scottish, which doesn't have that kind of

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.880
[Guest]: a rule, you know, it is not run by missionaries, etc., you know, American International, they

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.440
[Guest]: send their children to those schools, but they definitely got them a proper education.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that you also talk about like the second interesting shift that happens,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.200
[Amit Varma]: like one is, of course, a shift to the Shiv Sena in the late 70s becoming this lumpen

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.440
[Amit Varma]: party.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.320
[Amit Varma]: And the other shift is after they come to power in 95, they get drunk on power and your

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.200
[Amit Varma]: common Shiv Sena foot soldiers are doing extortions and taking money from common people.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.120
[Amit Varma]: At one point, you write in your book that people stopped buying cars or doing any kind

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.920
[Guest]: of conspicuous consumption.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And then that changed.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.640
[Guest]: Yeah, but that essentially changed because people reacted to that.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.000
[Guest]: This was between 96 and 98.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.040
[Guest]: Even people like doctors and lawyers and professionals like that, they were dressing down, they would

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.680
[Guest]: probably drive in a Maruti 800 instead of a Mercedes Benz and things like that, because

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:31.480
[Guest]: they knew that they were under the focus of all the shakha pramukhs, etc.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:39.760
[Guest]: You know, it got so bad because the Shiv Sena has got this labor unions in five star hotels,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.240
[Guest]: in hospitals also.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.000
[Guest]: So even if a heart patient was admitted to hospital and he went in for heart surgery,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.080
[Guest]: and after that, the doctor would get an extortionist call, and even the patient would get an extortionist

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080
[Guest]: call.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.720
[Guest]: They'd say, we know that you paid so many lakhs for this operation.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.200
[Guest]: And then they would tell the doctor that we know that you earn so many lakhs, so you can

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.840
[Guest]: afford to pay us this much, etc.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.120
[Guest]: It became really, really, very bad.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.360
[Guest]: And then it came to businessmen also, you know, I mean, these businessmen who had wanted

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.400
[Guest]: to support the Shiv Sena, etc.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.760
[Guest]: So at that point of time, I think it was in 98, that they all got together and they held

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.400
[Guest]: a meeting at Chowpatty.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.960
[Guest]: And then they said, enough is enough.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.200
[Guest]: We are not going to stand this nonsense.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.240
[Guest]: And they got a lot of support from the police commissioner at that time, etc.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.880
[Guest]: Because even the police commissioner was sick and tired of all those extortionist calls

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.680
[Guest]: and extortionist complaints and things like that.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.600
[Guest]: So they got together and they said, we are not going to pay you a single Naya Paisa.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.280
[Guest]: Not only that, you know, I mean, businessmen going to Thackeray's house, you know, in posh

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.520
[Guest]: cars would have to leave the keys there and come back without their cars, you know, I

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.120
[Guest]: mean, so they would always go there in taxis.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.920
[Guest]: And you never knew, you know, there would be something like, you know, Thackeray is

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920
[Guest]: passing by someplace.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.520
[Guest]: He's going to somebody's house and he sees this cake shop.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.040
[Guest]: He gets into the cake shop and he pays and he buys the cake to take it somewhere.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.640
[Guest]: But after that, there would be a line of Shirseniks for days and days saying that we want this

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.880
[Guest]: cake, we want this pastry, etc.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.560
[Guest]: And they would just walk away with it without anything, you know.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.200
[Guest]: I mean, so this kind of thing used to happen.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.400
[Guest]: And then they all got together and they said, enough is enough.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.960
[Guest]: We are not going to pay you a single thing.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.520
[Guest]: And then Thackeray realized that he was in danger.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.400
[Guest]: You know, I mean, if he lost the popular support and also he lost the support of people who

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.120
[Guest]: were donating to his party, I mean, proper donations to his party, then he would be in

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.120
[Guest]: trouble.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.720
[Guest]: But having said that, I have to say that the Shiv Sena in Thackeray's time always had three

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.480
[Guest]: kinds of Shirseniks.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.800
[Guest]: If I may say so, I mentioned it in my book also.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.140
[Guest]: One was the pure extortionist.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.840
[Guest]: You know, he would go and he would extort.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.360
[Guest]: You know, somebody told me that every other political party, the political leader collects

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.040
[Guest]: money at the top and passes it down to the workers.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.640
[Guest]: Shiv Sena was the only party where the workers collected it from the bottom and passed it

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.640
[Guest]: on to Thackeray.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:54.800
[Guest]: You know, but Thackeray, knowing that he could not walk into those shops himself and extort

00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.560
[Guest]: the money from them, he would pass on 20 percent of the collections to his Shiv Seniks, which

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.920
[Guest]: is how they went from slums to chawls to flats to high rises to bungalows in some place or

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.920
[Guest]: dada.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.440
[Guest]: And they were very grateful to Thackeray because, you know, I mean, they said he shares it.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.400
[Guest]: He shares it with us because they know that they cannot extort in their own name.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.040
[Guest]: If they go and walk into a shop, nobody is going to pay them a second look.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.760
[Guest]: They're not going to give them a second look.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.920
[Guest]: So that was pure extortionism.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.600
[Guest]: Then there were those who believed in violence along with extortion.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.360
[Guest]: You know, if you resisted, then they would be violent.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.760
[Guest]: You know, I mean, and they were the more dangerous ones.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.680
[Guest]: And then there was a third one who was there only for Marathi asmita, Marathi pride, Marathi

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.680
[Guest]: ethos.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.400
[Guest]: They are the ones who got really tired of this kind of a thing, extortion and extortion

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.720
[Guest]: and violence.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:50.440
[Guest]: And then, you know, Sharad Pawar broke the Congress in 1978 and he formed his own regional

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.520
[Guest]: party and this Marathi ethos people all shifted to Sharad Pawar.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.080
[Guest]: So Thackeray lost a lot of his base at that point of time.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.680
[Guest]: The middle class intellectual Maharashtrian just shifted away from the Shiv Sena and went

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.040
[Guest]: to the Congress.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.200
[Guest]: It would take another eight years for Sharad Pawar to rejoin Congress.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.960
[Guest]: And then those people who didn't like Congress, they shifted base back to Shiv Sena.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.240
[Guest]: But by that time Thackeray had learnt his lesson.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.640
[Guest]: He knew that he could not be a pure extortionist and pure violent party.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.920
[Amit Varma]: No, I always think of political parties as sort of rival mafias, which are basically

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.920
[Amit Varma]: just fighting for, you know, that period in time when you get the monopoly to power your

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920
[Amit Varma]: the state.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.920
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, even if you steal public money, there's a subtle way to do it, which

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.100
[Amit Varma]: is you form the government and you steal public money in so many ways.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.800
[Amit Varma]: And there is the unsubtle crass way of doing it, which is, I guess, what Shiv Sena are

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.280
[Amit Varma]: getting carried away and new to the business of politics.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you could call them a nouveau mafia and they did for that period in time.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.960
[Amit Varma]: And then they also changed.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And let's kind of talk about Sharad Pawar a bit, because what is also very interesting

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.600
[Amit Varma]: is that back in Thackeray's early days when he was in the Free Press Journal, Sharad Pawar

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600
[Guest]: used to hang out with him.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.360
[Guest]: Yes, Sharad Pawar used to hang out with him and he sapped in all the meetings and discussions

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.920
[Guest]: that happened about the formation of the Shiv Sena.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.280
[Guest]: They used to sit somewhere in Elphinstone College.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.400
[Guest]: They used to hire a hall and sit in Elphinstone College.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.600
[Guest]: And there was, you know, I have mentioned in the book also that it is the industrialists

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:23.700
[Guest]: of Bombay, along with the Congress politicians who had an interest in seeing the formation

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:29.200
[Guest]: of the Shiv Sena so that they could use this kind of this army of lumpens, you know, I

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.720
[Guest]: mean, to get what they couldn't through the usual routes.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.360
[Guest]: So Sharad Pawar was a youth Congress leader at that point of time.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.380
[Guest]: And although he may not admit it, I'm convinced, you know, I mean, that he was asked by some

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:47.160
[Guest]: of the senior leaders, most probably the Chief Minister of Maharashtra at that time, Vasant

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.600
[Guest]: Rao Naik, you know, I mean, to sit in on those meetings and guide Thackeray into it.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.080
[Guest]: And there used to be a secretary of Ramkrishna Bajaj also who used to be sitting in on those

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080
[Guest]: meetings.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:04.480
[Guest]: So, you know, whether he had a real big role in the formation of the Shiv Sena, one cannot

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.800
[Guest]: say, but he definitely sat there and he guided Thackeray.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.080
[Guest]: And they have been friends from that time, you know, I mean, everybody thinks that and

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.760
[Guest]: I have mentioned, you know, that they are bitter political rivals, but in private life,

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.640
[Amit Varma]: they are the best private friends.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And there were at certain points, there was an overlap between the voters that they were

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.760
[Guest]: competing for, which is basically the Marathas.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760
[Guest]: Yes.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:29.640
[Guest]: Yes, Marathas in the sense, you know, I mean, Thackeray never really had, although he is

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.760
[Guest]: based his party on Shivaji and, you know, on his name, he never really had Maratha Marathas

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760
[Guest]: in that sense.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.480
[Guest]: The Maratha vote was always with the Congress and later the NCP.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.200
[Guest]: And then it shifted to the BJP for certain political reasons.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:48.120
[Guest]: But a lot of, you know, the ones who believed in Marathi ethos, Marathi pride, and those

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.400
[Guest]: are the ones, you know, Sharad Pawar had been the chief minister in 78, then again in 88

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.960
[Guest]: and then again in 90.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.200
[Guest]: And you know, he acquired the reputation of being a great administrator.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.480
[Guest]: And I wouldn't call him a visionary in the sense of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, but you

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.840
[Guest]: know, he definitely was farsighted.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.240
[Guest]: He saw many things, you know.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:13.000
[Guest]: So Maharashtrians prefer to, what do you say, identify with him rather than Bal Thackeray.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.400
[Guest]: You know, I mean, the more educated, the more soft spoken, the more, what do you say, knowledgeable.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:28.320
[Guest]: And Sharad Pawar is not very good at hype and beating his own, blowing his own trumpet.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.360
[Guest]: But he has done a lot more for the people in the villages and rural areas and particularly

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.860
[Guest]: his constituency.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.880
[Guest]: And people wanted to associate with him rather than Bal Thackeray.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.840
[Guest]: Ajit Pawar, his nephew, once had said, you know, what has Bal Thackeray done for the

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.840
[Guest]: people of Maharashtra?

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.400
[Guest]: Has he set up a single educational institution?

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.920
[Guest]: Has he set up a single sugar factory?

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.560
[Guest]: Or has he set up anything else that is benefiting the common people of Maharashtra?

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.280
[Guest]: He's only been doing for himself, himself.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.720
[Guest]: You know, he's been just, you know, he's been building a house, he's been building something

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.560
[Guest]: and, you know, I mean, he's been doing nothing for the people, which is true also.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.040
[Amit Varma]: In your book, you quote him as saying all he's done is built a house with 27 air conditioners.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.000
[Guest]: Yes, there were 27 air conditioners in his house, you know.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.720
[Guest]: So, and which is really true.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.040
[Guest]: He never did anything for the Maharashtrian people.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040
[Guest]: He never thought about it.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040
[Guest]: He didn't set up a hospital.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.040
[Guest]: He didn't set up a school.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040
[Guest]: He didn't do anything.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.360
[Guest]: Sharad Pawar has done much of it, you know, although it is under the radar.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.000
[Guest]: He doesn't tom-tom and he doesn't blow his own trumpet.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.320
[Guest]: But Maharashtrian, middle class Maharashtrian intellectuals wanted to identify more with

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.200
[Guest]: Sharad Pawar at that time, than with Bal Thackeray.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.760
[Guest]: And until he rejoined the Congress, because you know, these people, some of these people,

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.040
[Guest]: they don't like the Congress.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.320
[Guest]: They have never liked the Congress from the beginning.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.040
[Guest]: And they always wanted an alternative.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.320
[Guest]: So they thought that they were getting an alternative in Bal Thackeray, when they realized

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.000
[Guest]: how violent and extortionist that party was and that they were not like that and they

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
[Guest]: didn't endorse that.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.200
[Guest]: They shifted to Sharad Pawar when he formed the Congress.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:59.600
[Guest]: When he came back to the Congress, many of them shifted back to the Shiv Sena.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.320
[Guest]: By that time, the BJP was also kind of in alliance with the Shiv Sena.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.880
[Guest]: And if you notice, every other regional party, whether it is Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:16.480
[Guest]: or Ahom Ganapareesh in Assam, or even Trinamool Congress and Maya Vati, Mulayam Singh Yadav,

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:21.520
[Guest]: all of them have come to power in their respective states within five years of their existence.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:27.000
[Guest]: You know, they formed a political party, maybe five years or at the most, the next term,

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.720
[Guest]: sixth year, seventh year, they have come to power.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:35.280
[Guest]: Shiv Sena is the only party which took 30 years to come to power in Maharashtra.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.920
[Guest]: And that too only in alliance with the BJP.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: Because you know, they didn't look upon themselves as a political party and governing Maharashtra

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.280
[Guest]: was never their intention.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.920
[Guest]: Like I said, they were just extortionists.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.360
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they were collecting left, right and center.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.040
[Guest]: That is all that they were interested in.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.260
[Guest]: You know, I mean, and Bal Thackeray was only interested in himself.

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.120
[Guest]: He was not interested in anything else.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.060
[Guest]: You know, I mean, I would endorse Ajit Pawar that he never did anything for the people

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.060
[Guest]: of Maharashtra.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.400
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's very interesting.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Like in your book, you point out how one point of disillusionment and obviously there was

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.760
[Amit Varma]: a sense among many people that they're a B team of the Congress and the Congress is running

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:15.200
[Amit Varma]: But one major disillusionment came in 75 when Thackeray went on TV to support the emergency

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.520
[Amit Varma]: after earlier having come out against it.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.520
[Guest]: Yes.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.560
[Guest]: And that is also because, you know, I mean, he was forced.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560
[Guest]: S.B.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:28.200
[Guest]: Chavan was the chief minister and they sent a posse of policemen to Matushree.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.400
[Guest]: And you know, Thackeray wanted to protect his magazine, Marmic.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.320
[Guest]: And all journals were being shut down at that point of time.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.960
[Guest]: He didn't want that to happen.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.280
[Guest]: So they gave him a choice, you know, I mean, saying that, you know, either you come with

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.280
[Guest]: us to Doordarshan and support the emergency or else we are taking you to jail and you

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.280
[Guest]: will be shutting down Marmic.

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.240
[Guest]: You know, so they gave him half an hour.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.760
[Guest]: He came out in 10 minutes and said, come, let's go to Doordarshan.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.760
[Guest]: And they shut down Marmic anyway.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.360
[Guest]: Later on, you know, I mean, so never trust the devil, as they say, you know, I mean,

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.360
[Guest]: never believe in it.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:02.120
[Guest]: But he wanted to protect Marmic and he was also afraid of jail, you know, because once

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:07.040
[Guest]: he went to jail for three months in 1969 during the, you know, the Belgaum riots, anti-Muraji

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.000
[Guest]: Desai riots, basically, you know, I mean, they wanted to stop Muraji Desai and give

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.240
[Guest]: him a petition and Desai did not want to stop and he ran his vehicle over some ships and

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240
[Guest]: etc.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.160
[Guest]: So everybody went on rampage and then they arrested Thackeray and put him in prison and

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.480
[Guest]: he didn't like that experience of three months.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.120
[Guest]: So he didn't want to go to jail, you know, I mean, so he preferred, you know, and he

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.760
[Guest]: supported and actually the opposition was very disappointed because at that point of

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.640
[Guest]: time, they had needed Thackeray's firepower.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.480
[Guest]: They had needed his foot soldiers and then suddenly the foot soldiers were not available,

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.960
[Guest]: you know, I mean, and he had supported the Congress, but he had supported Indira Gandhi.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:45.640
[Guest]: He also met Indira Gandhi during the emergency and Mrs. Gandhi also struck the Shiv Sena

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.120
[Guest]: off the banned parties list after meeting Bal Thackeray.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.160
[Guest]: So there was a quid pro quo there.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.560
[Guest]: But after she died, he did not feel obliged to support the Congress anymore.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:03.200
[Guest]: So if you see there is a shift in his philosophy from region to religion from 1984 onwards

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:10.520
[Guest]: and from 1984 to about 1987, when there was a by-election in Vilepally in Mumbai, Dr.

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.080
[Guest]: Ramesh Prabhu was contesting that election.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:18.520
[Guest]: He became a very sharp Hindutva wadi and his Hindutva was even too sharp for the BJP at

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.720
[Guest]: that point of time.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:25.440
[Guest]: The BJP had just come out of this Janata Dal experiment, you know, I mean 1978 etc.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:30.280
[Guest]: They had supported a Janata party candidate and Congress was contesting and Shiv Sena

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:36.080
[Guest]: was contesting and Bal Thackeray made these very, very incendiary speeches against Muslims

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.080
[Guest]: etc.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:45.960
[Guest]: And he has the record of being the first Indian to be disenfranchised by the Election Commission

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:52.640
[Guest]: for basing his election campaign on religion rather than on secular issues.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.320
[Guest]: But his campaign was in 1987, but it took 10 years for the decision to come.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.640
[Guest]: So he was disenfranchised for six years and he couldn't vote until 2004.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.640
[Guest]: And so was Mr. Ramesh Prabhu.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.840
[Guest]: It destroyed Ramesh Prabhu's career, but it didn't make any difference to Bal Thackeray

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.320
[Guest]: because he was not contesting elections anyway.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.080
[Guest]: And he continued with the same thing.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:17.160
[Guest]: But you know what happened is after 87, after his sharp Hindutva focus, then Pramod Mahajan,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.240
[Guest]: you know, I mean realized that, you know, they were also going, BJP was also shifting

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.760
[Guest]: towards a sharp Mandir focus etc.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.520
[Guest]: And he said that we don't want our Hindutva votes to be divided.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.280
[Guest]: They came together and it is in complete with Pramod Mahajan that Thackeray realized the

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.960
[Guest]: value of really seriously fighting the Assembly elections and coming to government.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.080
[Guest]: So for the first time, usually he used to get only one MLA at a time in the Maharashtra

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080
[Guest]: Assembly.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.440
[Guest]: You know, I mean, in 1990 for the first time in alliance with the BJP, he got about 80

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.080
[Guest]: or 85 MLAs.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:50.800
[Guest]: And then the next election, 95, he managed to get a government.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we will talk about 1980s politics and the rise of the BJP and also the cooperative

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.280
[Amit Varma]: movement and the part that played in politics after the break.

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.520
[Amit Varma]: But before we go to the break, you know, you knew these people very well.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.360
[Amit Varma]: For example, you knew Bal Thackeray very well.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.720
[Amit Varma]: You interviewed him countless times.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.040
[Amit Varma]: If I remember correctly, you broke the news to him that the Babri Masjid has broken and

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.400
[Unknown]: people are saying that Shiv Sinha has done it.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.120
[Amit Varma]: So in your personal interactions with him, and I'm assuming after a while, like, was

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.560
[Amit Varma]: there some kind of friendship developing there?

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:23.560
[Amit Varma]: And did you find that in person he was reflective about what he was doing?

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.360
[Amit Varma]: Or was he always drunk on his Kool-Aid?

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.600
[Amit Varma]: Or was he always putting up a front for everybody, including you?

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Or was he reflective?

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Did he realize the mistakes he had made?

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Did he regret things he had done?

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.600
[Guest]: I used to have a love-hate relationship with him.

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.000
[Guest]: You know, I never agreed on certain issues.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.800
[Guest]: But maybe, maybe there were some things that I agreed with him.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.000
[Guest]: For example, when he said that, you know, I mean, do only criminals have human rights?

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.080
[Guest]: You know, I mean, and the victims don't have human rights.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.160
[Guest]: Yes, I could not disagree with him over there.

00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.520
[Guest]: But you know, and then once I challenged him, I said, how can you label all Muslims as anti-national?

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.160
[Guest]: And how can you label all Muslims as terrorists?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.520
[Guest]: And there is an Abdul Hamid also, you know, I mean, the famous Abdul Hamid, you know,

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.640
[Guest]: who fought against Pakistan on the border.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.560
[Guest]: He was killed and posthumously awarded the Paramvit Chakra, etc.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.600
[Guest]: So he said, yes, I have to make a difference.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.400
[Guest]: I have to make a difference between loyal Muslims and disloyal Muslims.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.480
[Guest]: But if they want to stay in this country, and if they want to, you know, part of our

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.640
[Guest]: gross national product, you know, the gross domestic product, then they have to act like

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: Indians, which was also an acceptable thing.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, like, like, you can't have anybody living here in being a terrorist,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.520
[Guest]: you know, I mean, you have to follow the laws, you have to follow the rules.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.920
[Guest]: But I personally would not make a difference between the religions.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.320
[Guest]: Tapri used to make a difference on that between the religions.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.080
[Guest]: But this was before a lot of Saffron terrorism came to light, you know, I mean, so, so I

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.080
[Guest]: could not argue with him on that, you know, by the time the Saffron terrorism came to

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.520
[Guest]: light, he was a very sick man, he was always in hospital, you know, I mean, I never got

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.920
[Guest]: a chance to go and have those long conversations with him that I had had in the 80s and the

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.640
[Amit Varma]: 90s, etc.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.720
[Amit Varma]: And was he someone who read books a lot?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.520
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, I mean, what was his intellectual engagement with the world per se?

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Did he read books?

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.520
[Amit Varma]: Were there thinkers he was influenced by?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.960
[Guest]: You know, he had the advantage of having a lot of, like I said, the Maharashtrian intellectuals,

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.800
[Guest]: the early days, you know, like Dr. Ramesh Prabhu, he was a medical doctor, he was his

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.400
[Guest]: private physician, you know, he joined the Shiv Sena, the day Thackeray held that rally

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.800
[Guest]: in Shivaji Park, he signed up for the Shiv Sena.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.760
[Guest]: And then he got noticed by Bal Thackeray and Thackeray called him home and he became Thackeray's

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760
[Guest]: physician.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.280
[Guest]: So they were lawyers, they were professors, they were doctors, they were engineers, all

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.080
[Guest]: these kind of people who joined and I'm sure they gave him inputs.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.680
[Guest]: I'm sure they gave him inputs.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.880
[Guest]: But like I said, he alienated all of these people.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.280
[Guest]: And he decided to focus more on the lumpens, you know, he got a lot more out of the lumpens

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.200
[Guest]: and he got out of these intellectuals.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.320
[Guest]: But I don't think he was very fond of reading.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.480
[Guest]: I don't think he, you know, because he was never taken to quoting and things like that.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.720
[Guest]: But then he would say Hitler was a nationalist.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.000
[Guest]: I believe in Hitler.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
[Guest]: He never read Hitler to know what Hitler had done.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.280
[Guest]: And then when you challenged him and you said, do you know what he did to the Jews?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.640
[Guest]: And he equated the Jews only with the Muslims, you know, and then when you told him that

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:22.280
[Guest]: the Jews at that point of time were all intellectuals, they were professors, they were doctors, you

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.200
[Guest]: know, I mean, they were philosophers, they were scientists, you know, he was a little

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200
[Guest]: taken aback.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.120
[Guest]: He said, really, they were not always like this.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.120
[Guest]: I said, no, they had to become like this because of what happened during the Holocaust.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.160
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they were not militant because, you know, Israel is now a very militant country,

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.720
[Guest]: you know, I mean, so and I told him that, you know, Israel has to be like that because

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.960
[Guest]: it is surrounded on all sides by Islamic nations, you know, I mean, so they have to do something

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.560
[Guest]: to keep their heads above water, you know, but they were not like that always.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.840
[Guest]: And they were taken advantage of.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.440
[Guest]: So he would be taken aback a little bit.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.520
[Guest]: So I don't think he really actually bothered to read.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.480
[Guest]: But there were people who were feeding him a lot of information, including from newspapers,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.800
[Guest]: he would always have a lot of clippings marked in red and things like that with him.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.840
[Amit Varma]: So he had a lot of inputs.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.120
[Amit Varma]: And then attraction towards intellectuals like even Suresh Prabhu, who later on when

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.640
[Amit Varma]: he brought him into the party and, you know, insisted that he become a minister in the

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.600
[Unknown]: central government and so on.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.560
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break and we'll continue this conversation.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.920

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Sujata Anandan about Maharashtra politics.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, before the break, we've spoken a lot about the Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.560
[Amit Varma]: and we'll continue to do so as we go on through the 80s and 90s to the present time.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.800
[Amit Varma]: But tell me also a little bit about how the Congress is evolving in this time and also

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.480
[Amit Varma]: about the very unusual role of cooperatives in Maharashtra politics.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:20.400
[Guest]: See, I'll tell you, cooperatives are the backbone of the Congress and of Maharashtra politics,

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.320
[Guest]: which is why the Congress has lasted as long as it has done in Maharashtra.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.800
[Guest]: It lost power in so many other states.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:34.440
[Guest]: And even in 1978, when the Congress split, it did not quite go out of power.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.680
[Guest]: And the two wings, you know, the Sharad Pawar Congress and the Vasanth Dada Patil Congress,

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.760
[Guest]: they continued because they were joined by the common interest of the cooperatives and

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.760
[Guest]: the cooperatives are very interestingly placed in the sense the farmers have to be members

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.720
[Guest]: of these cooperatives and they elect a chairperson.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.680
[Guest]: And then the chairperson goes ahead to contest either the assembly election or the Lok Sabha

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.680
[Guest]: election.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:04.120
[Guest]: So your local chairperson is either a member of parliament or a member of the legislative

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.120
[Guest]: assembly.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.440
[Guest]: And for these sugar barons or cooperative barons, their politics is dependent upon their

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.880
[Guest]: business and their business is dependent upon politics.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:21.440
[Guest]: And this sense was there only with Sharad Pawar, which is why in 1999, when he split

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.320
[Guest]: the Congress again, most of the sugar barons went to Sharad Pawar.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.080
[Guest]: You know, the Apex Cooperative Bank, Ajit Pawar, his nephew, was the chairperson of

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:34.240
[Guest]: the Apex Cooperative Bank and all these sugar barons who were not necessarily Pawar supporters

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.120
[Guest]: and whom I wanted to support, Sonia Gandhi or the Congress, you know, they had their

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.520
[Guest]: loan spending with the Apex Cooperative Bank.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.680
[Guest]: And then if they are not on the side of Sharad Pawar, you know, they don't get their loans

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.320
[Guest]: and that destroys their business and the business destroys their politics because if they don't

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.960
[Guest]: have a factory, they don't have voters at the assembly elections or parliamentary elections.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.360
[Guest]: And it has really been their backbone.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.200
[Guest]: And it also saves the farmers, you know, I mean, sugar is a very water intensive crop.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.960
[Guest]: So sometimes that might cause problems during drought, etc.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.200
[Guest]: Then these sugar barons set up, you know, dairying, you know, I mean, so a lot of dairies

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.480
[Guest]: have grown up in Maharashtra, so many names, you know, Varana and so many other things.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:19.560
[Guest]: And so if you have a bad monsoon and you cannot grow crops, you cannot grow sugar cane, then

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.040
[Guest]: you depend upon dairy farming, you know, I mean, milk, you know, other things, cheese,

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.280
[Guest]: butter, all those things help the farmers.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:33.320
[Guest]: So that is what the BJP had been trying to break in the past five years.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.440
[Guest]: And I have a feeling that the, you know, the farmers problem in Maharashtra particularly

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:44.120
[Guest]: got compounded because of that, you know, because they would bring their crops or their

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:50.800
[Guest]: pulses or whatever they have to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.400
[Guest]: And, you know, the government would not give them the minimum retail price or whatever,

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.160
[Guest]: you know, I mean, they won't give them that.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.960
[Guest]: And they would have to do distress sales, etc.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.000
[Guest]: They would not even be able to recover.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.200
[Guest]: And particularly with regard to tuvar dal, for example, you know, I mean, they would

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.960
[Guest]: pack this, you know, I mean, they harvest the tuvar dal sometime in March, April, and

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.200
[Guest]: they bring it to the APMC, you know, I mean, around that time.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.880
[Guest]: And if you do not lift their pulses around that time, there are these sacks of pulses

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.400
[Guest]: sitting in the market yards.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.360
[Guest]: And then there is a monsoon in June, and it rains and the sacks get soaked, you know,

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.040
[Guest]: I mean, and then they get mildew and things like that, and their entire crop is destroyed.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.360
[Guest]: And this happened for three or four years, it has happened in Maharashtra, which is why

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.840
[Guest]: the problem that the Maharashtra farmers are facing has been much, much more than farmers

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.360
[Guest]: in other states.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.000
[Guest]: And this was done deliberately to break the back of the NCP and the Congress, because

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.480
[Guest]: all these farmers voted for the NCP and the Congress.

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.920
[Guest]: And the ruling dispensation hoped that if the farmers suffer, then they would not vote

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.080
[Guest]: for the Congress and the NCP.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.080
[Guest]: But like someone told me, that unfortunately, the BJP and the Shiv Sena do not understand

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.120
[Guest]: what a cooperative movement is.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.880
[Guest]: They just, even a cooperative bank, they do not understand what a cooperative bank is

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880
[Guest]: there for.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.520
[Guest]: And cooperative bank is there for this only.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.040
[Guest]: And the demonetization also broke their back, you know, because the farmers all have their

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.600
[Guest]: accounts only in cooperative banks.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.040
[Guest]: And then you say that cooperative banks are not entitled to exchange the old notes.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040
[Guest]: They didn't have money.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.300
[Guest]: And you brought the demonetization at the month of the Rabi season.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.720
[Guest]: They were waiting to buy their seeds and fertilizers.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720
[Guest]: And you brought this in.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.720
[Guest]: And one farmer told me that, man, I was not getting money out of farming.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.560
[Guest]: So I shifted to trading.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.520
[Guest]: You know, I mean, I bought seeds and fertilizers.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.280
[Guest]: And I thought that this season I'm going to make a lot of money.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.040
[Guest]: But now there's nobody coming and buying my seeds.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.920
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, I've spent so much money and my seeds are sitting here, my fertilizer.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
[Guest]: And what do I do?

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.840
[Guest]: So he started to give it to the farmers on credit.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.960
[Guest]: He said, because at least if I gave it on credit, I can recover something.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.360
[Guest]: Otherwise, it will go.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.640
[Guest]: So that also broke their back.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.000
[Guest]: In the context of Maharashtra particularly, I think the government had hoped that the

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.680
[Guest]: Congress and the NCP will lose their grip on the farmers by breaking their back.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.600
[Guest]: But they do not understand.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.000
[Guest]: When they set up a cooperative bank, they think it is about giving car loans and giving

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
[Guest]: housing loans.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.880
[Guest]: They don't understand how the system works.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.720
[Guest]: And they didn't understand the connection between farmers and agriculture and industry

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720
[Guest]: and trade.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.520
[Guest]: And they just didn't understand the connection that, you know, if the farmers do not have

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.120
[Guest]: a proper deal, if they are not producing proper crops, you know, I mean, that there is no

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120
[Guest]: demand for tractors.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.720
[Guest]: There is no demand for machinery.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.080
[Guest]: There's no, you know, I mean, those kind of things.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.720
[Guest]: They just didn't understand the connections.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.080
[Guest]: As a result of which I have a feeling that the past dispensation has driven the rural

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.600
[Guest]: economy to the ground.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.080
[Amit Varma]: I have multiple episodes on demonetization, which of course was massively disastrous for

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.480
[Amit Varma]: the entire economy regardless of timing.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.400
[Amit Varma]: There was an interesting observation in your book also about cooperatives where you quote

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.960
[Amit Varma]: someone talking about how cooperatives were really only good for the rural elites.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the way you describe the systems of how the cooperatives function, that the

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.960
[Amit Varma]: average farmer at the bottom of the food chain has no option but to go to a specific place

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.080
[Amit Varma]: and sell and buy at specific prices.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.680
[Amit Varma]: And there are basically no functional markets for him.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.240
[Amit Varma]: He's almost like a feudal.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.000
[Guest]: Yes, it is feudalism.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
[Guest]: It is feudalism.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.560
[Guest]: Like I told you that, you know, I mean, their business dependent upon politics, politics

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560
[Guest]: on their business.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.080
[Guest]: But you know, at the bottom level, there is a zoning in Maharashtra.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.560
[Guest]: You know, there are so many sugar cooperative factories and one factory is in one particular

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.480
[Guest]: zone, say the Satara zone or Sangli zone, or even Satara and Sangli may have two or

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.680
[Guest]: three zones.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.320
[Guest]: So the farmers are within a radius of that zone and they have to necessarily take their

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.480
[Guest]: sugar cane to that factory.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.120
[Guest]: You know, I mean, even if another factory is giving a better rate, they cannot take

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.280
[Guest]: their sugar cane to that factory.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.040
[Guest]: And if they have not voted for that particular chairman or chairperson, they have not voted

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.520
[Guest]: for him and they have not elected him to office either the legislative assembly or parliament.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.760
[Guest]: What happens is their sugar cane is not crushed in the sense of a cutting season is the harvesting

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.640
[Guest]: season is October to November.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.600
[Guest]: If you go now, I mean, it is December now.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.320
[Guest]: So if you go now into the rural areas, you'll see loads and loads of trucks and tractors

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.080
[Guest]: and bullock carts, you know, piled high with sugar cane, you know, heading towards these

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080
[Guest]: factories.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.520
[Guest]: Now the yield of the sugar cane, it has to be pressed within about 10 days of cutting.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.000
[Guest]: It has to be crushed within 10 days of cutting.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.800
[Guest]: Then it gives you a 90 to 95 percent yield.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.920
[Guest]: And the longer you let it be, the juice yield will not be so much.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.880
[Guest]: So if you crush it in April, it'll come down to 10 or 20 percent.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.000
[Guest]: And the farmer gets paid according to the yield of his sugar cane.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.240
[Guest]: So if you don't get, if you don't vote for the guy, this is how you get punished.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.160
[Guest]: If someone suspects that you have not voted for him, he will not crush.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160
[Guest]: He will not say anything.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.360
[Guest]: He will just not crush your sugar cane.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.000
[Guest]: He'll say that, yeah, it is in the queue.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.160
[Guest]: It's not yet come up for crushing.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.400
[Guest]: By the time it comes up for crushing, he gets only a 10 to 20 percent yield on that.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.240
[Guest]: He gets only that much money and everything is dependent upon that.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.640
[Guest]: You know, only when he gets the money, he can buy for the seeds, you know, he can hire

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640
[Guest]: labor, etc.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.160
[Guest]: So it is really a very few.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.240
[Amit Varma]: But so many poor farmers are trapped in this system.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.680
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that at some point there would be a movement among them and, you know, some

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.640
[Amit Varma]: political entrepreneur would take advantage of that.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:27.200
[Guest]: You know, there was an attempt around the 90s to set up some private sugar factories.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.440
[Guest]: But I don't think the private entrepreneurs took it very seriously because some of them

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.440
[Guest]: drove it to the ground.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.480
[Guest]: You know, some of them had other reasons why they set up the factories.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.360
[Guest]: And basically these kind of things continued.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.560
[Guest]: And once upon a time, it was only Congress and NCP who was setting up the sugar factories.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.360
[Guest]: Later on, even the BJP, even the Shiv Sena, they all started to set up, you know, because

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.560
[Guest]: they realized that, you know, I mean, this is how.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.960
[Guest]: But you know, they had to be rural people when they were, you know, like Gopinath Munde,

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:59.720
[Guest]: the late Gopinath Munde, for example, you know, I mean, in 1994-95 when Sharad Pawar

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.960
[Guest]: was the chief minister, he was the opposition leader and we called him a fantastic opposition

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.800
[Guest]: leader because he was taking on Sharad Pawar, he was saying things, etc.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.880
[Guest]: And Pawar is seen as a very strong chief minister.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.640
[Guest]: But he could not answer any of Gopinath Munde's questions.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.560
[Guest]: But you know, after Munde came into government, he went and set up his own sugar factories.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.840
[Guest]: You know, I mean, he lost a lot of steam after that, you know, after that he could never

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.480
[Guest]: take up farmers issues, you know, I mean, so this is what happens in Maharashtra.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.720
[Amit Varma]: It's very easy to be virtuous in opposition.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.720
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.720
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.640
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, let's kind of get back to the 80s.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.720
[Amit Varma]: And we are at a point where what has already happened by the late 70s and by the early

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.120
[Amit Varma]: 80s is the Shiv Sena's basically they've lost the Marathi middle class intellectual to Sharad

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Pawar's breakaway party.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.240
[Amit Varma]: And they're basically a lumpen party.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.440
[Amit Varma]: They're a force on the streets and not really a political force.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.360
[Amit Varma]: And the Congress now wins an election and everyone's expecting that Vasantha Patil will

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.640
[Amit Varma]: be the chief minister.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.880
[Amit Varma]: But instead, Indira Gandhi puts A. R. Anthony in that place.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that and the sentiments that that then evoked within the political

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.920
[Guest]: marketplace.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.000
[Guest]: You know, Antony was good friends with Bal Thackeray.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.600
[Guest]: And when he went and he requested Bal Thackeray in 1980, when they held the election because

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.560
[Guest]: Sharad Pawar was leading the Congress at that point of time and everybody expected the Congress

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.360
[Guest]: vote to split.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.520
[Guest]: And of course, there was the Janta Party, Communist parties, all the ones who had been

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.720
[Guest]: part of the Janta Party formation in 77.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.160
[Guest]: They were also in the fray.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.680
[Guest]: But then Bal Thackeray decided at that point of time to support Indira Gandhi, which meant

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.800
[Guest]: that he did not contest the election.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.440
[Guest]: He did not put any Shiv Sena's in the fray.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.960
[Guest]: And people said that that helped the Congress to win the elections.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.440
[Guest]: And Antony was a good friend of his.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.720
[Guest]: Antony used to go up to Matushree and chat about Thackeray.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.840
[Guest]: And if you have seen Mantralaya, the state headquarters, as soon as you enter, there

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.840
[Guest]: is a huge portrait of Shivaji.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.880
[Guest]: And that is Antony's doing.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:04.080
[Guest]: He said that he knew that there was this portrait of Shivaji and he searched the premises of

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.280
[Guest]: Mantralaya and then he found it in one room, you know, I mean, gathering dust, etc.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.000
[Guest]: He had it dusted off and polished up and then he installed it over there.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.560
[Guest]: And Thackeray quite appreciated that, you know, I mean that, okay, fine.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:22.800
[Guest]: And Antony also insisted, Antony had hired a historian to write some 14 volumes on Chhatrapati

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.840
[Guest]: Shivaji and he said, I wanted it to be called only Shivaji the Great, like Akbar the Great

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.240
[Guest]: or Ashoka the Great, you know, or Alexander the Great, you know.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240
[Amit Varma]: So I wanted that.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.240
[Amit Varma]: A branding exercise.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.240
[Guest]: Yes.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.240
[Guest]: Yes.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.800
[Guest]: So Thackeray appreciated that also.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.800
[Guest]: And Antony wanted the sword of Bhavani to be returned by Queen Elizabeth, you know,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.880
[Guest]: because the British had taken it over there and he made moves also to have that.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.880
[Guest]: And all these were appreciated by Bal Thackeray.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.160
[Guest]: So they were very great friends.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:57.200
[Guest]: So until Antony was the Chief Minister, Thackeray was quite supportive of the Congress and until

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.980
[Guest]: Mrs. Gandhi was alive.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.620
[Guest]: But in 1984, Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:10.440
[Guest]: But simultaneously in 1984 also, if you remember the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front in the

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:16.200
[Guest]: UK, they kidnapped a diplomat called Ravindra Mhatre, you know, and Ravindra Mhatre was

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:23.660
[Guest]: Maharashtrian, you know, and Thackeray had this talent of marrying two sentiments together,

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.840
[Guest]: you know, like he married the Marathi sentiment and anti-left sentiment together to defeat

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.680
[Guest]: VK Krishnamenon in Bombay after Nehru's passing away when he got a ticket.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.680
[Amit Varma]: 69 or something.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.400
[Guest]: He did that.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.240
[Guest]: So now, you know, Thackeray was, if nothing, he was at least a supporter of the Marathi

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.240
[Guest]: Manus.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.320
[Guest]: So Ravindra Mhatre was a Marathi Manus.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:52.040
[Guest]: But this is also when he, ahead of the BJP, he spotted this feeling growing in the Indians,

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.420
[Guest]: anti-Muslim appeasement feeling growing up amongst Indians.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:01.440
[Guest]: And the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front was responsible for his kidnapping and killing.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.680
[Guest]: So he began to sharply, like I said, in 87, he came into a sharp focus that got him disenfranchised

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680
[Guest]: also.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.520
[Guest]: But he built up to this from 84.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.240
[Guest]: Mrs. Gandhi was gone.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240
[Guest]: And he was now building it up.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.560
[Guest]: At that point of time, even extreme Hindutva organizations like Patit, Pawan, Sange and

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.760
[Guest]: all, they did not pay any attention to Thackeray because they felt that he was too maverick.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.080
[Guest]: He was saying all kinds of nonsense and everything.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.920
[Guest]: But then Pramod Mahajan spotted what was happening and then he aligned with the BJP.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.440
[Guest]: In 87, of course, Thackeray was too extreme Hindutva for even the BJP.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.400
[Guest]: But by 1988-89, the BJP was clear that they were going to push for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya,

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.440
[Guest]: etc. and they wanted to consolidate their Hindutva vote and they came together.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:49.400
[Guest]: So from 84 to about 89-90, Thackeray shifted focus to Hindutva.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.280
[Guest]: He forgot the Marathi Manus.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.840
[Guest]: But by that time, 75% of jobs, government jobs, etc. had gone to Maharashtrians.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.480
[Guest]: Because even when Raj Thackeray in the 90s or in the 2000s, when he held an agitation

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.280
[Guest]: saying I want job for locals, they discovered 85% of the jobs are with locals, government

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280
[Guest]: jobs, etc.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.920
[Guest]: Because it was a conscious policy that was introduced by the Maharashtra government.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.880
[Guest]: So Thackeray had nothing to do.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.960
[Guest]: And he had become a paper tiger.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.120
[Guest]: After having achieved his sub-nationalism, he was a paper tiger.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.040
[Guest]: So then he shifted to Hindutva.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.720
[Guest]: And then he joined up with the Shiv Sena.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:30.400
[Guest]: And of course, in 1991, the demolition of the Babri Masjid, etc. that the Sena and the

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.240
[Guest]: BJP did together.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.040
[Guest]: But I don't think the Shiv Sena demolished the Babri Masjid.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.960
[Guest]: Not as much as they may claim that they demolished.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.120
[Guest]: In fact, in my book, there is a whole chapter on that.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.360
[Guest]: Because Thackeray never had the guts to do anything like that.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.720
[Guest]: He would not be that extreme to bring down a mosque, etc.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.160
[Guest]: Moreover, there were certain reasons.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.480
[Guest]: There was no Shiv Sena leader present in Ayodhya.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.360
[Guest]: They were sitting in Calcutta on the day the mosque was brought down.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.160
[Guest]: But then the BJP leader said that the Shiv Sena has brought down the mosque.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.560
[Guest]: So Thackeray was one of those people, he would always claim credit for anything if it gave

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.440
[Guest]: him any political mileage.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.360
[Guest]: So at that point of time, he had said, in fact, he had told me, I had called him and

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.080
[Guest]: I had told him, and he had said that, you know, I mean, you call me back in 20 minutes,

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.840
[Guest]: because he was very taken aback that the Shiv Sena had brought down the mosque.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
[Amit Varma]: You broke the news.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.520
[Guest]: And I told him that there is a flash, you know, that has come.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.880
[Guest]: And then he knew that his leaders were sitting in Calcutta.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.360
[Guest]: It was the days before mobile phones.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.040
[Guest]: So he could not really contact them like that.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.960
[Guest]: And then when I called him back in 20 minutes, he said, if my Shiv Sena had brought down

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.200
[Guest]: the mosque, then I can be only proud of them.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.560
[Guest]: I as a junior reporter did not recognize the if.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.440
[Guest]: So even my story said that, you know, Thackeray is very proud of the Shiv Sena for bringing

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.720
[Guest]: down the mosque.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:50.840
[Guest]: Then he began to get into trouble with the Liberians Commission, which probed the demolition

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.280
[Guest]: and with the Allahabad High Court.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280
[Guest]: So then he backtracked.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.080
[Guest]: He said, my Shiv Sena did not bring down the mosque.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.680
[Guest]: You know, I mean, the BJP did not have the guts to accept that they had done that.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.200
[Guest]: And so I said that if my Shiv Sena had done it, then I can be only proud of them because

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.520
[Guest]: I'm not afraid of anybody.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.460
[Guest]: But actually he was afraid of the court, you know, which is why he backtracked.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:17.720
[Guest]: So from then, from the 80s, from 1984 to about 1991, 92, during the riots, etc., it was a

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.040
[Guest]: very sharp Hindutva focus.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.160
[Guest]: Then, you know, the Muslims were also very disappointed with the Congress at that point

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160
[Guest]: of time.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.320
[Guest]: They said that for so many years we have supported them.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.560
[Guest]: People have been saying Muslim appeasement, but where have we got anything from the Congress?

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:38.160
[Guest]: And then, you know, I mean, it is much better to make friends with the Shiv Sena and join

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160
[Guest]: up with them.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.920
[Guest]: I mean, at least let's make friends of an enemy, then we might be protected.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:49.840
[Guest]: So Urdu papers at that point of time, you know, there was an election due in Maharashtra

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.840
[Guest]: in May that day.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.280
[Guest]: Those days, the election used to happen in May.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.440
[Guest]: So in May 1995, there was an election due.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:02.920
[Guest]: And the Urdu papers were full of letters from Urdu readers and intellectuals and professors,

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.120
[Guest]: etc., saying that let's vote for the Shiv Sena this time.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.680
[Guest]: When I broke the story, even Thackeray did not believe it.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.000
[Guest]: He said some reporters are saying this because, you know, how is it possible that you have

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.920
[Guest]: gone against them during these riots, etc., and how is it possible that they will vote

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.920
[Guest]: for you?

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.680
[Guest]: But when the results came out, the Congress won only one seat in Mumbai, which is Colaba,

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.960
[Guest]: where there's a huge Parsi population.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.600
[Guest]: So they probably voted for them in large numbers.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.440
[Guest]: But even the Muslim majority areas like Umarkhadi, Paidoni, etc., Shiv Sena won it.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.640
[Guest]: So then he realized that the Muslims had voted for him.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:46.720
[Guest]: So after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1996 or 1997, he called for the setting

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.760
[Guest]: up of a school or a hospital for the poor in Ayodhya.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.200
[Guest]: He shifted like that.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.360
[Guest]: And then in 1999, he lost the elections again because by this time, the Muslims had kind

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.840
[Guest]: of gone back to the Congress and other parties.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.080
[Guest]: And then he called for the disenfranchisement.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.040
[Guest]: He said, you know, they should not be allowed to vote.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:12.720
[Guest]: So he has always been shifting his stances depending upon how politically convenient

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.720
[Amit Varma]: it is for him.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's also very interesting how, you know, unlike, of course, on the one hand, Shiv Sena

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.720
[Amit Varma]: is shifting from being anti-South Indian, as they were at one point in time, to then

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.800
[Amit Varma]: anti-Muslim, to then anti-North Indian migrants as they later became.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.200
[Amit Varma]: So when they became North Indian migrants, he realized that the Maharashtrians don't

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.880
[Amit Varma]: actually want those jobs, which most of those North Indian migrants take.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:39.080
[Amit Varma]: I was also sort of struck by, like one, of course, the Shiv Sena goes all out on Hindutva

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:44.160
[Amit Varma]: in the early 80s at a time where the BJP themselves, which had just formed, are experimenting with

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi and socialism and other soft things.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And later, the BJP sort of comes around to Hindutva.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, people often lump the two together and say that, okay, both are parties which

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.720
[Amit Varma]: believe in Hindu nationalism.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.760
[Amit Varma]: But as you've pointed out so well in your book, that there is a lot of difference between

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.080
[Amit Varma]: the sort of Hindu nationalisms that they believe in.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.480
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:12.880
[Guest]: You know, the BJP's philosophy is entirely, what do you say, RSS based.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.080
[Guest]: You know, they believe in majoritarianism.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.240
[Guest]: They believe that this is the land of the Hindus and everybody else is a second class

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.240
[Guest]: citizen.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.960
[Guest]: So, the NRC and the citizenship amendment bill that they are bringing out, of course,

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.000
[Guest]: because of outrage, they have had to include other religions, but they have excluded Muslims.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.560
[Guest]: Bal Thackeray's Hindutva was not really excluding Muslims.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.280
[Guest]: I would say rather he was a bit like Shivaji in that sense, you know, I mean, although

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.720
[Guest]: Shivaji was not so sharply communal.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.600
[Guest]: He was for self-rule, Hindu self-rule, but he had a lot of Muslim generals, etc.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:54.200
[Guest]: Thackeray also tends to trust a lot of Muslims and particularly he makes a lot of, he used

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.600
[Guest]: to make a lot of difference between Maharashtrian Muslims, you know, the ones that have the

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.280
[Guest]: Konkan belt and Marathwada, etc.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.560
[Guest]: You know, for him, the Marathi Manus was really important, whether the Marathi Manus was a

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.960
[Guest]: Dalit or whether he was a Muslim or whether he was a Hindu.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.240
[Guest]: Whereas the BJP would, for BJP, it is only the Hindu and a certain kind of Hindu, because

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:21.360
[Guest]: I have a feeling the BJP also discriminates against the Dalits and certain lower caste

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.760
[Guest]: Hindus which will come up at a later date, you know, I mean, but they believe in majoritarianism.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.960
[Guest]: They believe in either throwing these people out or rendering them second-class citizens.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.880
[Guest]: Thackeray was not doing that.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.560
[Guest]: Thackeray said that if they want to live in this country, you know, I mean, they have

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.840
[Guest]: to be loyal to this country.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.560
[Guest]: They have to be true to this country, which is, which even I would say as somebody who

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.880
[Guest]: is a liberal and who believes in secularism, I would also say the same thing.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.040
[Guest]: You know, I mean, BJP's Hindutva is not like that.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.240
[Guest]: You know, a Muslim is a Muslim and a Muslim is a traitor.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.920
[Guest]: He is a terrorist and he has no business to be there.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.520
[Guest]: That is the difference between Thackeray's and BJP's Hindutva.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.600
[Amit Varma]: Another interesting difference which you point out and another sort of interesting dramatic

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.120
[Amit Varma]: strain that's happening in this time is the Brahmin versus Maratha thing comes up here

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.120
[Amit Varma]: again.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:13.600
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, the RSS is all Nagpur based Brahmins and they are also Maharashtrian and they begin

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:22.280
[Amit Varma]: to feel a little resentful of, you know, a lot of the so-called Maratha dominance of

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.840
[Amit Varma]: this movement to the point that you talk about how at one point, you know, Mahajan of course

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.120
[Amit Varma]: is a Brahmin, but his aide Gopinath Munde is an OBC and as a counter to counteract those

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.960
[Amit Varma]: guys they start promoting Nitin Gadkari.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960
[Guest]: No, no.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.880
[Amit Varma]: They started promoting Devendra Fadnavis.

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Devendra Fadnavis I thought was promoted by Mahajan and Munde.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: The RSS started promoting Gadkari and as a counter to that these guys start promoting

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
[Guest]: Devendra Fadnavis.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.720
[Guest]: Because you know, see Gadkari was already part of the RSS at that time.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.480
[Guest]: He became the president of the Maharashtra unit of the BJP and he and Mahajan and Munde

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.360
[Guest]: never really got along.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.160
[Guest]: And I think I mentioned in my book Maharashtra Maximus that at one point of time Munde and

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.400
[Guest]: Gadkari had come to blows literally, you know, I mean, they were ruling on the floor etc.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.400
[Guest]: You didn't mention ruling on the floor.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.280
[Guest]: And then Mahajan set about looking for somebody to counter Gadkari and then he managed to

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.640
[Guest]: get this person who in every which way was like Gadkari, you know, he was from Nagpur,

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:28.320
[Guest]: he was also a lawyer, he was also a law student, his parents were also part of the RSS, you

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.120
[Guest]: know, I mean, there was nothing to and both were the Shastra Brahmins, you know, there

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.520
[Guest]: was really nothing to distinguish between them, except that Munde and Mahajan might

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.640
[Guest]: never have thought that one day they will not be around in this world.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.960
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, this man would kind of overcome everything and he would become

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.120
[Guest]: the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.280
[Guest]: Even Gadkari would not have thought that.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.840
[Guest]: But they deliberately promoted Devendra Fadnavis.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's also very interesting like how you point out that how Mahajan and Munde to counteract

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.760
[Amit Varma]: the RSS support of Gadkari promoted Fadnavis and a couple of decades later, Modi does the

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.080
[Guest]: same thing by making Fadnavis Chief Minister of Maharashtra.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.720
[Guest]: Yes, yes, because Gadkari is really very close to the RSS.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.440
[Guest]: He virtually grew up in the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, which is not the thing with Devendra

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.440
[Guest]: Fadnavis.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.720
[Guest]: His father believed in the philosophy, his aunt was also a minister in the Maharashtra

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.720
[Guest]: government.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:27.760
[Guest]: So they are ideologues, they are RSS ideologues and maybe they have attended a shakha or two.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.040
[Guest]: But you know, it is not like Gadkari is a child of the RSS.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.760
[Guest]: You know, I mean, he was literally brought up over there.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.640
[Guest]: So between Fadnavis and you know, that is what it is.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.400
[Guest]: Mahajan's spotting was very good.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.800
[Guest]: So he picked Devendra Fadnavis.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:47.200
[Guest]: So when it came to a choice between Gadkari and Fadnavis, there is no way any of the RSS

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.160
[Guest]: leaders could argue that Gadkari is better than Fadnavis or why Fadnavis is not as good

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.160
[Amit Varma]: as Gadkari.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.520
[Guest]: Fadnavis is also smoother and less crude in the way he sort of addresses matters.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.520
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.600
[Guest]: He is very clever also, slightly Machiavellian also.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.040
[Guest]: And Nitin Gadkari is more like, you know, I mean, open about those kind of things, you

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.880
[Guest]: know, aa, mai tujhe dikhata hu kind of persons, you know.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.760
[Amit Varma]: And another interesting fault line, which again re-emerges in our narrative here is

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.800
[Amit Varma]: a Maharashtrian versus Gujarati narrative.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Because at this point, the BJP has Modi and Amit Shah, who are kind of running the show

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and the Shiv Sena doesn't really like that because there is still that, you know, simmering

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.560
[Amit Varma]: resentment right from the times of Murariji Desai.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.280
[Guest]: Yes, from the times of Murariji Desai and it has resurfaced itself.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:36.480
[Guest]: Now I have to tell you that my friend's father-in-law, he was a very hardcore BJP voter.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:43.120
[Guest]: And what he told me after this imbroglio last month, he said that, you know, had Nitin Gadkari

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.400
[Guest]: been in the negotiations with Uddhav Thackeray and had he said that we never promised the

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:53.560
[Guest]: Shiv Sena chief ministership for two and a half years, I would have believed Nitin Gadkari.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:58.920
[Guest]: But now I believe Uddhav Thackeray because the Gujarati duo cannot be trusted, he said,

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:03.280
[Guest]: you know, I mean, you know, because, because they will promise anything.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.760
[Guest]: They will promise the moon to anybody.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.640
[Guest]: And, you know, I mean, when it is advantageous to them, aur jab unka kaam ho jata hai, then

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.320
[Guest]: they will kind of withdraw and they will go back on their promise.

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.360
[Guest]: So now I tend to believe Uddhav Thackeray.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.760
[Guest]: And he said, I don't want achche din.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.080
[Guest]: I want sachche din, he said.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.880
[Guest]: So I'm now supporting Uddhav and I'll be voting for the Shiv Sena in the next election.

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: You know, so this has been a turnaround by a Maharashtrian hardcore BJP voter because

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.600
[Guest]: of this distrust of the Gujaratis.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.480
[Guest]: And you know, the thing is the government, the Shiv Sena government has also come because

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:44.940
[Guest]: even Modi and Shah got a little worried because the Shiv Sena were on the point of descending

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.160
[Guest]: on the streets a couple of days before Uddhav got sworn in.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.600
[Guest]: And they were all preparing to target the Gujaratis in Bombay.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.360
[Guest]: And if that had happened, you know, it would have completely gone against Modi and Shah

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.240
[Guest]: because two Gujaratis sitting in the central government, strong, powerful men, and you

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.840
[Guest]: are not able to protect your own in Maharashtra.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.240
[Guest]: And you know, the Gujaratis know about that resentment.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.520
[Guest]: And for a long time, they had put their head under the radar.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.760
[Guest]: You know, they keep their head down and they continue to work and they make some compromises

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.480
[Guest]: with the Shiv Sena if needed.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.520
[Guest]: You do your dhandho and let the boys do whatever on the streets.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.040
[Guest]: Yes, that is what they do.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.720
[Guest]: But you know, it manifests itself in so many ways.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:31.200
[Guest]: You know, I think in my book, I mentioned about, you know, food habits, for example,

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:36.080
[Guest]: this beef ban and you know, imposition of vegetarianism.

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.520
[Amit Varma]: Another difference, that's another difference between the BJP's Hindutva and Shiv Sena's

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.520
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:44.520
[Guest]: The BJP's Hindutva is a vegetarian Hindutva, but Shiv Sena, it's everything.

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.000
[Guest]: Yes, yes, yes, everything.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.520
[Guest]: And there was a fight also because they are building society somewhere in the suburbs,

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:54.160
[Guest]: where, you know, a Maharashtrian family that day was, I think, on a Sunday was cooking

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.880
[Guest]: fish or something.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.400
[Guest]: And the Gujaratis had a Brahma Puja or something like that.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.800
[Guest]: And then they objected to that and they almost came to blows and the police had to be called

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
[Guest]: in etc.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.200
[Guest]: And Shiv Sena's and MNS workers all kind of descended and said, we are not going to allow

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.800
[Guest]: you to impose your vegetarianism on us.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.280
[Guest]: We have a right to eat whatever we want in our house.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.720
[Guest]: We are not imposing it on you.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.560
[Guest]: So these fault lines keep opening up between the two communities.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And another interesting fault line that, you know, emerges later in the narrative is again

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.160
[Amit Varma]: of caste, but the Dalit system, like you pointed out about how one very key moment in Maharashtra

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:32.760
[Amit Varma]: politics was a renaming of Marathwada University to, you know, after Dr. Ambedkar.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that and how that affected the Shiv Sena's fortune.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.360
[Guest]: You know, that move was started by Sharad Pawar during his first term in 1978 as Chief

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.440
[Guest]: Minister.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:48.040
[Guest]: You know, he loves to think of himself as a social engineer and he has done a lot of

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:52.280
[Guest]: social engineering, in fact.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:56.920
[Guest]: But he failed to realize this Maratha Resentment for Dalits, even during his second or third

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:02.560
[Guest]: term as Chief Minister, when he had tried to mix up the populations after the Lathur

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.160
[Guest]: earthquake, he had faced that problem.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.840
[Guest]: But during this time, during the renaming in 1978, he just decided, you know, I mean,

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.480
[Guest]: that he would name that it was just known as Marathwada University.

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.880
[Guest]: And he said there is already a Shivaji University in Kuala Lumpur and other intellectuals had

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.360
[Guest]: been given, you know, other universities named after them.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.080
[Guest]: So he said, we will name this after Babasaheb Ambedkar, because this was also the Karmabhumi

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.200
[Guest]: of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.120
[Guest]: He did not realize the extent of Maratha Resentment.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:35.800
[Guest]: It was real violence, the kind of violence that Mumbai had seen in 1969 during, you know,

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.800
[Guest]: the Bilgaum stir.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:43.280
[Guest]: And later in 1991-92, that kind of violence happened in about 79-80.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.320
[Guest]: And Shraddha Pawar was really very taken aback, you know, because he was a Maratha, he belonged

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.960
[Guest]: to the Maratha, he was slightly liberal, etc.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.920
[Guest]: He thought that all Marathas might be like that.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:00.800
[Guest]: And when the violence really went out of hand, he had to drop the idea of renaming the Marathwada

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.960
[Guest]: University.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.320
[Guest]: And everybody then pushed it on the back burner.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.320
[Guest]: Nobody dared, no chief minister who came after that dared to rename that university.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:14.560
[Guest]: Then he went to the center, but then he came back again in 1993, I think he came back after

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.760
[Guest]: the riots, 1991-92.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:22.320
[Guest]: He came back after that time and in 93, he decided to rename the Marathwada University.

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.680
[Guest]: And by this time, he had learned his lesson a little bit.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.320
[Guest]: So he decided that instead of just calling the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University, I will

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.800
[Guest]: call it the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.880
[Guest]: So it is now known as BAMU, Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.480
[Guest]: But even so, the Marathas did not like it.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.120
[Guest]: You know, I mean, because there is really a sharp focus and sharp divide.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.560
[Guest]: The Marathas consider themselves upper caste.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.840
[Guest]: They don't want to study in a university which is named after a Dalit leader, even if he

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.440
[Guest]: is such a big icon as the father of the Indian constitution, they didn't like it.

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.080
[Guest]: And at that point of time, Thakre again spotted his chance.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.240
[Guest]: He said that I will not allow and Thakre never liked the Buddhist Dalits.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.240
[Guest]: You know, he preferred the Hindu Dalits to the Buddhist Dalits and he didn't like Ambedkar

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.760
[Guest]: very much in that sense.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.080
[Guest]: So he decided to oppose the whole thing.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.800
[Guest]: And that is where a real shift took place because he decided to go to Aurangabad and

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.280
[Guest]: he decided to hold a rally, etc.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.320
[Guest]: Now once again, the government, you know, again, it was a Congress government in place.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.080
[Guest]: They again use the trick, you know, sending the police to him and saying that you either

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.880
[Guest]: go in, you make your speech and come to jail or else you turn around and go back to Mumbai,

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.840
[Guest]: you know, I mean, otherwise you'll be sitting in jail.

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:38.520
[Guest]: And then he just turned around and went and he left the people sitting in the ground.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.800
[Guest]: He did not address them.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:45.120
[Guest]: But then the upper caste Marathas shifted focus to the Shiv Sena instead of voting for

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.120
[Guest]: the Congress.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:51.200
[Guest]: They were Congress voters and Pawar was so confident that because he was a Maratha and

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.760
[Guest]: because he was making the move, the Marathas will understand what he was doing.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:55.760
[Guest]: But they really didn't understand.

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.660
[Guest]: So that led to a, what do you say, voter change in Marathwada.

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:05.480
[Guest]: You know, instead of the Congress used to win elections, Congress NCP used to win elections

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.480
[Guest]: there.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.120
[Guest]: And every time Congress used to win, they shifted focus to Shiv Sena because BJP was

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.360
[Guest]: in alliance of the Shiv Sena and the BJP managed to get and get a leg into that area.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's a very interesting insight about how crucial that vote can be.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And you've also pointed out in your book quite correctly and quite naturally, it's what one

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.000
[Amit Varma]: would expect that the leaders of the Dalit movements, the various Dalit leaders who have

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.400
[Amit Varma]: come up like Athavale and so on, basically acting purely out of self-interest on getting

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.720
[Amit Varma]: the best deal they could for themselves and not necessarily for the upliftment of the

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.320
[Amit Varma]: people that they were representing.

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:42.680
[Amit Varma]: So how has sort of the Dalit vote moved over the last 20-30 years after this?

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Like what has happened nationally, of course, is that all said and done, the Dalits have

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.820
[Amit Varma]: voted more for the BJP than any other party.

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:55.760
[Amit Varma]: So in certain ways, the BJP has sort of succeeded for the moment, at least in wooing that section

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.120
[Amit Varma]: of the World Bank.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.560
[Guest]: How has it been in Maharashtra?

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.520
[Guest]: No, in Maharashtra, it has been largely Dalits always go with the strongest party or the

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520
[Guest]: ruling dispensation.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.600
[Guest]: And they are always looking, the leaders as well as the community is always looking for

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.720
[Guest]: largest from the party in power.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.720
[Guest]: So that is what is happening.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.520
[Guest]: Athavale is the biggest example of that.

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.560
[Guest]: He was first supporting the Congress and then when Sharad Pawar formed the NCP, he went

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.600
[Guest]: to the NCP and then he went to the Shiv Sena and then he went to the BJP.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.080
[Guest]: And every time he got something from these parties and you leave your voters with practically

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.080
[Guest]: nothing.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.440
[Guest]: But, you know, I mean, if you also try to and the same thing is happening with Prakash

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.680
[Guest]: Ambedkar, although he carries the name of his grandfather, Babasaheb Ambedkar, he's

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:39.360
[Guest]: not able to strike out on his own.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.600
[Guest]: He's not able to become an alternative to the Dalit community.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.240
[Guest]: They vote in certain proportion for him, but essentially he's denting the Congress vote

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.760
[Guest]: because if they didn't vote for him or if his candidate was not standing in the fray,

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.360
[Guest]: then they would all be voting for the Congress or they would be voting for the BJP.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.600
[Guest]: And this time everybody says that, you know, I mean, the BJP set up certain political parties

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:03.520
[Guest]: to dent the Congress vote, you know, the Dalit vote, the Muslim vote, etc.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:10.320
[Guest]: And the Dalits have always been dependent upon the bigger parties and they cannot, they

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.760
[Guest]: do not seem to be able to survive, although they have doctors, they have engineers, they

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.760
[Guest]: have pilots, etc.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.960
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they're all educated people, but they somehow don't seem to be able to

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:28.960
[Guest]: form a political group which will challenge parties like the BJP and the Congress and

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.360
[Amit Varma]: come up on their own.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.640
[Amit Varma]: Because politicians everywhere of whatever caste look after their self-interest first.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, with that sort of cynicism, it's kind of hard to get ahead.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Another aspect I wanted to explore was the role of women in politics.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.240
[Amit Varma]: Now Indian politics, like Indian society, is very sexist and misogynist.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.600
[Amit Varma]: But there's one very interesting stand in your narrative of the Shiv Sena that you mentioned

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:58.960
[Amit Varma]: about the role that women played in the Shiv Sena and you mentioned like three particular

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.960
[Amit Varma]: kinds of roles, which I found very fascinating.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.040
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on that?

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.920
[Guest]: You know, see, Thakre did not know what to do with women.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.120
[Amit Varma]: And like all Indian men.

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:18.400
[Guest]: No, you know, this reservation for women came round about 1989 because Rajiv Gandhi, who

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.120
[Guest]: was the Prime Minister at that point of time, you know, he wanted to change the Panchayati

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.200
[Guest]: laws and everything and then they reserved some 30%, 33% seats for women.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.720
[Guest]: At that point of time, frankly speaking, even the Congress, even the BJP, nobody knew what

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.200
[Guest]: to do with that, you know, I mean, because although the Congress and the BJP had their

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:38.800
[Guest]: mahila wings, you know, I mean, women's wings and all that, but they were not really very

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.840
[Guest]: active politicians.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.440
[Guest]: But the Shiv Sena was entirely a male oriented party and the Sena leaders also, when I asked

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.120
[Guest]: one of them, they said, Nangchi party purushi party aahe, you know, I mean, you know, that

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.400
[Guest]: it is very, it is only men in the party.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.320
[Guest]: And then he needed to give the seats, 30% seats have been reserved in the municipal

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.360
[Guest]: corporation.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.880
[Guest]: You need to give women those seats.

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.200
[Guest]: So, you know, he fished out all these people who were either the wives or the daughters

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:11.440
[Guest]: or sisters in laws or mothers of many of these Shiv Sena shakha pramukhs and all those kind

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.440
[Guest]: of things.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.040
[Guest]: And he gave them tickets and many of them won the election.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.080
[Guest]: But you know, I mean, it basically began, it basically began there at the lower levels,

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.400
[Guest]: you know, shakha's and slums, etc.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.120
[Guest]: But then the women defined a role for themselves.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.440
[Guest]: You know, they used to come out in the sense, women used to, domestic servants used to be

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.320
[Guest]: exploited for example, you know, I mean, maybe by their male employers, they used to be exploited.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.040
[Guest]: So they came out with this name and shame kind of a policy.

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:45.440
[Guest]: They would go outside the houses of these men who were mistreating the women, not just

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.200
[Guest]: in homes, but also in factories, for example, you know, sweatshops, etc., where the women

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.000
[Guest]: were employed and you know, they were being treated badly.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.880
[Guest]: So they would go, they would name and shame and the men would get very scared.

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:59.640
[Guest]: So they formed their own, what do you say, militant wing.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.480
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, it was like a sort of Me Too empowered by the Shiv Sena.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.600
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.440
[Guest]: And Tagore used to call them Rand Ragini's, you know, the beauties of the field, you know,

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.240
[Guest]: I mean, Rand Ragini's.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.840
[Guest]: But you know, he really did not know what to do with them.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.760
[Guest]: And he thought that they should be supportive of their husbands, etc.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.000
[Guest]: But you know, interestingly, during the riots, I've said that in my book, Pramod Nawalkar,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.600
[Guest]: who was this senior leader, his wife one day came to him with some bangles and said, wear

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.160
[Guest]: these bangles, you know, because you are capable of nothing else.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.160
[Guest]: So he said, what do you mean?

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.920
[Guest]: You know, he had been going out in the streets and trying to broker peace between the, you

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.560
[Guest]: know, warring communities.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.960
[Guest]: And she said, you should be actually going out there and destroying those people.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.920
[Guest]: But you're brokering peace.

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.360
[Guest]: And this was happening.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.480
[Guest]: And Nawalkar, of course, his family was educated, etc.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.320
[Guest]: But then, you know, later on, Nawalkar realized that this is happening in many Shiv Sena.

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.640
[Guest]: You know, these women, when their husbands were, you know, the husbands were reluctant

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.920
[Guest]: to go out and riot in the streets, because they knew what the consequences would be and

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.960
[Guest]: everything.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.200
[Guest]: So when the husbands were sleeping, they would hide their trousers and pajamas.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.560
[Guest]: And give them petticoats.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.040
[Guest]: Put bindis on them and bangles, etc.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.640
[Guest]: And when the men woke up, you know, they don't have clothes to go out, you know.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.280
[Guest]: So they said that, you know, I mean, you go out now, you know, I mean, this is all that

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.280
[Guest]: you're capable of.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.320
[Guest]: Reluctantly, the men agreed to kind of, you know, go and riot.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.200
[Guest]: And then these women would throw a protective cordon around them.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.920
[Guest]: When the police came that time, the Mumbai police did not have so many women in the police

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920
[Guest]: force.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.320
[Guest]: So they were very afraid of manhandling the women, you know, I mean, any charges could

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.800
[Guest]: be lobbed against them.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800
[Guest]: So they would throw a cordon.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.280
[Guest]: And by that time, those men would disappear into the woodworks.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.720
[Guest]: They would never be able to catch them.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.640
[Guest]: This is a role the women defined for themselves, a real militant role.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.080
[Guest]: And then after the riots were over, they were doing these things, going to offices, seeing

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.400
[Guest]: which woman is being exploited, you know, I mean, somebody would come to them with a

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.760
[Guest]: complaint and officer would be treating somebody badly.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.840
[Guest]: A woman would lodge a molestation complaint or rape complaint.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.040
[Guest]: So they were all there for that kind of a thing.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.800
[Guest]: And at that point, before the riots, they used to make a distinction between themselves

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.200
[Guest]: and what they used to call the air conditioned women.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.400
[Guest]: That is the women who live in high rises, who wear paitani sarees, you know, who wander

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.920
[Guest]: around in cars.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.600
[Guest]: But the riots brought these both sections together.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:25.040
[Guest]: This woman, Shiv Senik, who used to work in this air conditioned house, you know, and

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.720
[Guest]: their common enemy was the Muslim man on the streets, you know, so that kind of brought

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.960
[Guest]: them together.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:39.680
[Guest]: And it kind of changed the fundamental face of the mahila gadi, you know, from being just

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:46.880
[Guest]: what you say, women lumpens, from just being women lumpens, it kind of shifted to more,

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.920
[Guest]: what do you say, sophisticated women who are bound by the common, what do you say, aim

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.640
[Guest]: of protecting themselves from the other.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.800
[Amit Varma]: I found this a very fascinating chapter because on the one hand, the role they play is very

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.360
[Amit Varma]: salutary that they call out the oppression of themselves and other women, because they

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:07.000
[Amit Varma]: now have the Shiv Sena tag behind them and they can say whatever and everyone's scared

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
[Amit Varma]: of them.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.160
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, it's also scary.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:14.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, giving your husband bangles or a petticoat is in itself a slightly patriarchal thing,

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:20.280
[Amit Varma]: because why should somebody wearing bangles or a petticoat be any less brave than somebody

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.280
[Guest]: in trousers.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.840
[Amit Varma]: So that's sort of reinforcing those notions.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is obviously not salutary because they're exhorting their husbands to basically

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.880
[Guest]: go out and kill.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.880
[Guest]: Yes.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:38.160
[Guest]: And you know, the Shiv Sena women were more vicious and righteous than the men.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.040
[Guest]: Why do you think that is?

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.200
[Guest]: You know, they came from a certain strata where they had always faced this problem with

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:48.680
[Guest]: the other, maybe not just the Muslim men, but they always faced the other in the sense

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.720
[Guest]: that employer, you know, I mean, who exploited them or a government officer, you know, I

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.840
[Guest]: mean, who again, you know, in various ways exploited them when they went there for a

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.120
[Guest]: ration card or when they went there for something.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.680
[Guest]: There was this kind of a feeling in them and they were not really hothouse flowers.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.840
[Guest]: They could have come, you know, in fact, I don't know whether it has been reported too

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.880
[Guest]: much, but around that time I was reporting on the riots, they had actually pulled a Muslim

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.840
[Guest]: man out of a bus and got together and beaten him up and left him on the road and he had

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.840
[Guest]: died, etc.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.500
[Guest]: You know, I mean, so they were capable of that kind of a thing.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.880
[Guest]: And the men were not like Pramod Namalkar wanting to go and broker peace between the

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.640
[Guest]: two communities and the wife saying you wear bangles, you're not capable of anything else,

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.360
[Guest]: you know, I mean, men were like that, the riots might not have been so vicious had the

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.320
[Amit Varma]: women not been egging them on.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm just thinking aloud, is it possible that women the way they are in Indian society,

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.480
[Amit Varma]: much, you know, oppressed and, you know, have to face much more hardship than men, that

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.920
[Amit Varma]: they therefore have also have much more pent up anger.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:48.160
[Guest]: Yeah, at a time like this, this is one way it can come out.

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.440
[Guest]: Yes, that is, you know, that is true.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.440
[Guest]: And I call them the right wing feminists.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.600
[Guest]: Generally we associate feminism with the left wing, you know, left intellectuals, etc.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.040
[Guest]: These were absolutely bottom level right wing feminists.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:07.080
[Guest]: And you know, after the riots, they took to, you know, protecting themselves in the sense,

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.080
[Guest]: you know, if a woman came and complained that my husband is treating me badly, my mother

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.840
[Guest]: in law is treating me badly, my father in law, you know, these people would be there

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.520
[Guest]: in the home, they would be beating up that man and things like that.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.440
[Guest]: And those men went and complained to Bal Thackeray that this is what is happening, you know,

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.000
[Guest]: and you have to do something about it.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.160
[Guest]: And even Bal Thackeray did not know what to do about it, because the women had completely

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.660
[Guest]: gone out of hand.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.760
[Guest]: He did not, then he tried to tell them that you have to support your husbands, you know,

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.360
[Guest]: I mean, you have to help them in there.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.040
[Guest]: But they were not listening.

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.280
[Guest]: And many of these women did not like the compromises that he later made, you know, I mean, with

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.440
[Guest]: the Muslims and things like that.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.440
[Guest]: They did not like that.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.960
[Guest]: They said, we are not going to support it, etc.

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.680
[Guest]: You know, so it is a, it is a wing which could have turned into Frankenstein's monster.

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:54.360
[Guest]: But because the women were probably had other preoccupations, like bringing up their children,

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:59.760
[Guest]: you know, I mean, making sure that their families are fed, and, you know, comfortable and all

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.760
[Guest]: that.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.840
[Guest]: They did not have so much time to go out and become monsters.

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.320
[Guest]: But they were capable of being that.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320
[Amit Varma]: This is so fascinating.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, so many novels and graphic novels and web series can be made out of this.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.880
[Amit Varma]: I've taken a lot of your time, so let's skip to the present.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.720
[Amit Varma]: And let's talk about what happened this month.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've obviously been writing a lot about the sort of how the Sena and the BJP can't

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.000
[Amit Varma]: get along and it is not possible that they will ever really be together for a long time.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.800
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, you saw that part of it coming.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Can you sort of and we all know what is Sharad Pawar's opportunism and how you know, no one's

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:38.480
[Unknown]: an enemy forever, no one's a friend forever.

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, you have written a lot about Ajit Pawar's resentments over the years and how

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.440
[Amit Varma]: they have been playing out.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.840
[Amit Varma]: So reading your books, and I read your two books recently after these events happened,

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:54.600
[Amit Varma]: and I was like that, you know, you practically saw it all coming.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.240
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how Maharashtra politics has been for the last seven, eight

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240
[Amit Varma]: years.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:05.120
[Guest]: You know, after Balasaheb Thackeray, Uddhav was slightly directionless.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.160
[Guest]: He did not know which way to swing.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:13.920
[Guest]: Though he has defied all predictions of the critics that the Shiv Sena will collapse after

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.000
[Guest]: Bal Thackeray.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.120
[Guest]: And actually that is what the BJP intended.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:24.440
[Guest]: Right from the time even when Balasaheb was around, the younger lot of BJP leadership

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:28.400
[Guest]: wanted to break the alliance because they thought this alliance was curtailing them

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.400
[Guest]: a little bit.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:34.160
[Guest]: They could not put down roots in the villages, in the talukas, in the block levels, etc.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.800
[Guest]: And you know, people like Nitin Gadkari and Gopinath Munde, who did not get along with

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.640
[Guest]: each other, they agreed that we have to break ties with the Shiv Sena.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.400
[Guest]: But at that point of time, Advani was in the leadership position in the BJP and he was

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.400
[Guest]: always ambitious.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:50.200
[Guest]: You know, I mean, he wanted to become the prime minister, etc.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.800
[Guest]: And he knew that he needed the Shiv Sena.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.080
[Guest]: And if you break ties with the Shiv Sena, you are likely to lose a lot of seats.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.080
[Guest]: Maharashtra in terms of Lok Sabha seats is the second largest state after Uttar Pradesh.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.360
[Guest]: Uttar Pradesh sends about 80 and Maharashtra sends about 48.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.360
[Guest]: Next is Bihar.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.760
[Guest]: After Bihar broke up into Bihar and Jharkhand.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.840
[Guest]: So he did not allow these younger leaders to break ties with Bal Thackeray.

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.980
[Guest]: And you know, they waited patiently for Bal Thackeray to pass away.

01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:19.120
[Guest]: And they thought that after Thackeray dies, the Shiv Sena will collapse.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.520
[Guest]: Which is why in 2014, when Modi realized that he had stormed through the nation and he had

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.520
[Guest]: got such a majority, and he said, and the BJP leader said, this is the time to break

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.240
[Guest]: ties with the Shiv Sena and they'll be completely finished.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.600
[Guest]: And just 15 days before the elections, they broke ties.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.720
[Guest]: They broke the alliance and they thought gone because Uddhav had 12 stents in his heart.

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:44.680
[Guest]: He had just come through this heart operation and they were sure he will not be able to

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.680
[Guest]: campaign.

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.680
[Guest]: They were sure he won't be able to do anything.

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.920
[Guest]: And he comes up with 63 seats in the assembly and the BJP gets only 122, which is of course

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.360
[Guest]: double the Shiv Sena.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.960
[Guest]: But it is far below the mark and it is far less than expected considering how Modi was

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.840
[Guest]: blazing through India at that point of time.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.520
[Guest]: So now they are in a position where they have to ally with the Shiv Sena.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:15.080
[Guest]: Of course, the NCP helped it to win the vote, but they have to ally with the Shiv Sena.

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.620
[Guest]: And for five years, Uddhav Thackeray played the role of an opposition leader.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:20.560
[Guest]: He never allowed the BJP to rest in peace.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.120
[Guest]: He even targeted Modi.

01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.460
[Guest]: He targeted Shah.

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.600
[Guest]: He targeted the government, both in the centre and this one.

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:30.320
[Guest]: And the Congress and NCP were doing nothing at that point of time and he occupied the

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.000
[Guest]: role of the opposition, which was appreciated a lot by the people, including his voters.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.160
[Guest]: It was appreciated a lot by the people.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.840
[Guest]: But by the time 2019 came around, the BJP was now no longer sure, anti-incumbency kicking

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.840
[Guest]: in.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.520
[Guest]: They were no longer sure whether they would be able to win an election on their own.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.880
[Guest]: So Amit Shah kind of, you know, I mean, Kejrol, Persuade, Threaten and somehow brought Uddhav

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.960
[Guest]: on board.

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:58.520
[Guest]: But one strategic mistake that Uddhav made was to lose sight of the Marathi Manus.

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.880
[Guest]: You know, he started a Me Mumbiker policy once upon a time.

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:03.600
[Guest]: Raj Thackeray sabotaged it.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.640
[Guest]: But then Raj Thackeray found his MNS and went.

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.000
[Guest]: And then, you know, Uddhav was going on, I want the Ram temple.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.440
[Guest]: I want the Ram temple.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:13.560
[Guest]: Now if you want to vote for the Ram temple, why do you want to vote for the duplicate

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.160
[Guest]: when you have the original?

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:19.120
[Guest]: You know, the BJP practices Hindutva much better than the Shiv Sena can.

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:23.600
[Guest]: Shiv Sena can at the most sit back and say, I want the Ram temple, but you can't do anything

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.600
[Guest]: about the Ram temple.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:27.360
[Guest]: So there is a vote in Maharashtra.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:31.920
[Guest]: You know, there is a real regional Marathi ethos vote.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.600
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they would vote only for the Shiv Sena.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.520
[Guest]: They would not vote for the BJP.

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.720
[Guest]: But amongst the Marathi Manus, there is also a Hindutva vote.

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:44.440
[Guest]: Now the BJP wants to capture that Hindutva vote.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:48.960
[Guest]: You know, so Uddhav recognized in time what was happening.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.440
[Guest]: He realized that they were not able to finish me from outside.

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:58.800
[Guest]: But if I now become part of their government and I become, play second fiddle to them,

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.120
[Guest]: they'll finish me from inside.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:07.840
[Guest]: And in this arrangement, his young son, inexperienced, raw son would have been made the deputy chief

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:08.840
[Guest]: minister.

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.120
[Guest]: BJP would have expected him to keep quiet.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:13.480
[Guest]: You know, we gave you a deputy chief minister, but Aditya would not understand, you know,

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:16.000
[Guest]: I mean, how they were destroying the party, etc.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.720
[Guest]: So Uddhav recognized that on time and then he pushed.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:22.880
[Guest]: Now if the BJP would have agreed for a two and a half year chief ministership, he would

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.000
[Guest]: have taken that.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
[Guest]: He would not have broken ties with that, but he would have used the two and a half years

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.800
[Guest]: in government to shore up his voter base, Marathi Manus, you know.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.320
[Guest]: But that did not happen.

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:38.520
[Guest]: And then, of course, in the beginning, Sharad Pawar kept saying that we have been given

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.080
[Guest]: the mandate to sit in the opposition, we'll be sitting in the opposition, etc.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.280
[Guest]: But then there was a push from the Shiv Sena.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.040
[Guest]: Sanjay Rao going again and again and meeting Sharad Pawar in this one.

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:55.240
[Guest]: And Pawar, well, he's, you know, I mean, Chanakya and Machiavelli rolled into one.

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.480
[Guest]: So he realized the opportunity.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:00.520
[Guest]: And the Congress was a little wary of this.

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:04.840
[Guest]: But this time the Congress was completely dependent upon Pawar, even for the election.

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:09.880
[Guest]: And you know, the kind of result that they got, what the NCP got, what the Congress got,

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.000
[Guest]: and what the BJP did not get.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.520
[Guest]: Because considering the kind of role that the BJP was on, instead of 105, they should

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:21.360
[Guest]: have got at least about 150, 160 seats on their own.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.360
[Guest]: They were talking about 220, though so be spared.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.680
[Guest]: But I thought they may get 180 because the Congress's best position at the height of

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.360
[Guest]: its power was 180.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.480
[Guest]: I thought they would get 180.

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.200
[Guest]: I also never expected that they would stop at 100 or 105.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.260
[Guest]: You know, so what that shows is, and the NCP got more seats, the Congress actually improved

01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:47.340
[Guest]: upon its 2040 position, considering that they had a chief minister in 2014.

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:49.880
[Guest]: And they were completely down and out in 2019.

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.600
[Guest]: So that was quite commendable.

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.880
[Guest]: Now this has happened entirely because of the kind of voter that you have in Maharashtra.

01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.400
[Guest]: You know, like I said about Chhatrapati Shivaji's socialist ethos, he wanted a Hindu Swaraj,

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.840
[Guest]: but he was not anti-Muslim in that sense.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:10.320
[Guest]: And like someone had told me, being anti-Mughal is not being anti-Muslim.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:14.000
[Guest]: He was anti-Mughal, he was anti-Orenze, but he was not anti-Muslim.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.120
[Guest]: So that ethos remains with the people of Maharashtra.

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.200
[Guest]: And it is a socialist ethos, which takes along Dalits, which takes along Marathas, which

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.240
[Guest]: takes along Brahmins, because even Y.B.

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.840
[Guest]: Chavan and Vasanth Dada Patil and Sharad Pawar had accommodated the Brahmins.

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.680
[Guest]: They had been made, you know, I mean, chairman of the literary societies, you know, I mean,

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.480
[Guest]: and so many other things like that, they were not made to feel left out, like they were

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:36.480
[Guest]: not completely sidelined.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.160
[Guest]: They were also included in governance and government and all the subsidiary bodies.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.440
[Guest]: So everybody takes everybody along and goes.

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:47.800
[Guest]: It's only when RSS comes into the picture that this sharp divide comes between the Brahmins

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:48.800
[Guest]: and the non-Brahmins.

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.960
[Guest]: You know, I mean, without that, there is not such a sharp difference.

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:59.120
[Guest]: So Sharad Pawar realized and during the 2014 assembly campaign, I had been very critical

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.840
[Guest]: of Pawar when he had said, when he had told the people, do you want a return of the Peshwai

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:04.840
[Guest]: to Maharashtra?

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.280
[Guest]: You know, do you want them to gobble up the Marathas the way the Peshwas had done to Chhatrapati

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.840
[Guest]: Shivaji and his progeny?

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.080
[Guest]: And I said, why is he bringing out this caste and things like that?

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.720
[Guest]: But you know, I mean, he's the only leader, I think, in Maharashtra who has a sense of

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.520
[Guest]: history and he knows what has happened in the past, etc.

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:31.040
[Guest]: And then, of course, you know, I mean, the BJP came and the Marathas are the ruling clan.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.600
[Guest]: Marathas are the ruling clan.

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.760
[Guest]: Lots of Maharashtrians will tell you that, you know, they did not really fight for freedom

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.120
[Guest]: in the sense a lot of Brahmins did, M.G.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:48.360
[Guest]: Ranade, Gokhale, you know, all these people were there in the forefront.

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.880
[Guest]: Tilak also, he was also a Brahmin, etc.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.400
[Guest]: He said, only when we came close to independence and then they realized which way the wind

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.600
[Guest]: was blowing, that they quickly jumped into the Congress bandwagon and, you know, they

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:03.160
[Guest]: came close to Mahatma Gandhi, etc. and Pandit Nehru and then they again came and captured

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:06.040
[Guest]: the independent government in Maharashtra, you know.

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.400
[Guest]: So they are the ruling class.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.280
[Guest]: And even when Vasant Rao Naik was the Chief Minister, the longest serving Chief Minister

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.360
[Guest]: for 14 years, he could not do anything unless he had the sanction of the Maratha leaders

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.360
[Guest]: of the state.

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.080
[Guest]: And he was from Vidarbha and everybody grumbles about that, that the longest serving Chief

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.080
[Guest]: Minister of the state and he left Vidarbha backward and undeveloped and he developed

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:33.840
[Guest]: Western Maharashtra because that was a condition of the Marathas to keep a non-Maratha in power.

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.400
[Guest]: You know, there have been exceptions here and there.

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:40.640
[Guest]: Manohar Joshi was a Brahmin, but it was in a Shiv Sena government, etc.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.200
[Guest]: Then when Devendra Fadnavis came, now he belongs to Nagpur, you know, he comes from a RSS

01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:50.800
[Guest]: family and now the RSS, Fadnavis, everybody were determined to kind of sideline the Marathas,

01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.040
[Guest]: not give them, you know, and linked into the cooperative thing.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.360
[Guest]: Cooperative is also captured by Marathas only mostly.

01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:01.200
[Guest]: So all those things kind of kicked in and the Congress and the NCP were also in danger

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:03.920
[Guest]: of losing their identity, you know.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.600
[Guest]: And when Pawar saw what was happening and when there was a push from the Shiv Sena that,

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.320
[Guest]: you know, I mean, let us form the government together, he just grabbed that opportunity

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.520
[Guest]: with both hands and it's only he who could have pulled it off.

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.880
[Guest]: What was the Ajit Pawar side plot?

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.440
[Guest]: You know, see, Ajit Pawar, there is a problem with nephews in Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.640
[Guest]: and Bal Thackeray and Ajit Pawar and Sharath Pawar, etc.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.240
[Guest]: Beware of the nephew.

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:29.240
[Guest]: Yes.

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:34.480
[Guest]: The thing is, blood is thicker than water, blood is always thicker than water.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:41.320
[Guest]: So Thackeray chose Uddhav over Raj and Sharath Pawar is too wily and too wise to declare

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.560
[Guest]: Supriya Sule as his political heir.

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.680
[Guest]: Every time I have asked him that why don't you declare, you know, because a lot of NCP

01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:53.320
[Guest]: people tell me that Pawar Sahib is Pawar Sahib only because YB Chavan took him under his

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:55.600
[Guest]: wing and declared him as his political heir.

01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.920
[Guest]: Now let him choose anybody.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.520
[Guest]: Let him choose us.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:57:59.520
[Guest]: Let him choose Supriya.

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.520
[Guest]: Let him choose Ajit.

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.520
[Guest]: Let him choose a lamp post.

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:05.520
[Guest]: But at least we know who to rally around for the second generation.

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.320
[Guest]: You know, so, but he doesn't do it.

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:10.840
[Guest]: When I ask him, he says he or she will rise from the grassroots.

01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840
[Amit Varma]: He or she.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.840
[Guest]: He or she.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.520
[Guest]: Now the use of the word she has been observed by Ajit Pawar, you know.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:22.280
[Guest]: And when Supriya was first brought into electoral politics, when she was admitted into the NCP,

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:29.800
[Guest]: it was somewhere around 2006-2007, Ajit Pawar had told us reporters that, you know, simply

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:36.120
[Guest]: because Rahul Gandhi is the son of Sonia Gandhi, he doesn't automatically become the number

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.360
[Guest]: one in the Congress or the number two in the Congress.

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:41.080
[Amit Varma]: A sly reference to Supriya.

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.840
[Guest]: You know, so that was the thing.

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:48.600
[Guest]: But Pawar was very careful because in any case, you know, Supriya's education is such

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:50.520
[Guest]: that she can hold her own in Parliament.

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:55.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, I mean, so he kept them separate also like Ajit in the state and Supriya goes

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
[Guest]: to the Lok Sabha.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.680
[Guest]: Yes, he's kept them there.

01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:06.200
[Guest]: But you know, I mean, see Pawar is aging, you know, and he wants to make sure that he

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.600
[Guest]: used to once upon a time say that Rahul Gandhi has no spark, Rahul Gandhi has no spark.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.680
[Guest]: But now lots of people are saying even Supriya has no spark.

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.880
[Guest]: You know, I mean, like she has not grown in the manner that he expected her to grow.

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:23.160
[Guest]: Okay, she's a member of Parliament, she holds good debates, you know, she raises good questions,

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:25.000
[Guest]: you know, she speaks well, etc.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.200
[Guest]: But not like, you know, I mean, like, you know, like a like a blitz across the state,

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:31.200
[Guest]: you know, she's not been like that.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.840
[Amit Varma]: I think it's a bit like reversion to the mean that all children of great parents will always

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.840
[Guest]: disappoint.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:38.880
[Guest]: Yes, it is a bit like that.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.920
[Guest]: But he's very, very concerned about her.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:44.840
[Guest]: He wants to secure and ensure her future.

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:50.120
[Guest]: And he knows that if he leaves, leaves it in Ajit Pawar's hands, Ajit will never do

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.120
[Guest]: it.

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.200
[Guest]: You know, Ajit will sideline her, he'll make her sit at home, at the most make her president

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.640
[Guest]: of the Mahila Agadi or something.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.760
[Guest]: And that is not what he wants for her.

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.040
[Guest]: And Ajit is always afraid that there will be some point where he will choose the daughter

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.040
[Guest]: over the nephew.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Why doesn't he?

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Why doesn't he just get it over with?

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.440
[Guest]: No, he's too wise.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.200
[Guest]: He knows his party will break.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.440
[Guest]: And you know, much as Ajit may not be like him.

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.440
[Guest]: Raj Chakri was a chip of the old block.

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.280
[Guest]: But Ajit Pawar is not so.

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:20.560
[Guest]: So Ajit may not be like him.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:25.760
[Guest]: But there are more people in the NCP who would rather have Ajit as their leader than Supriya.

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.960
[Guest]: So he knows that.

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.560
[Guest]: He knows that the party will break in that sense.

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.040
[Guest]: They'll all go to Ajit.

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.440
[Guest]: And Supriya's future will be again in the doldrums.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.960
[Guest]: So that is why he doesn't do it.

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.040
[Guest]: But somewhere I think Ajit wanted to strike out on his own and tell his uncle that I'm

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:41.760
[Guest]: also very capable.

02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.240
[Guest]: And some years ago, just before he died, Vilas Rao Deshmukh was a former chief minister of

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240
[Guest]: Maharashtra.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.920
[Guest]: Ajit was facing the scandal of the education scam, etc.

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.640
[Guest]: He had told me that Ajit is as wealthy as Sharad Pawar.

02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:56.640
[Guest]: Even wealthier.

02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.040
[Guest]: He said, you know what, it took Pawar 40 years to earn.

02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:02.520
[Guest]: Ajit has earned in 9 or 10 years.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.440
[Guest]: You know, it was a way of telling me that all those allegations are probably true.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.240
[Guest]: But then he said, but there is one thing that he will always be dependent upon Sharad Pawar

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:13.240
[Guest]: for.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.480
[Guest]: He said, the currency with the common man.

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.000
[Guest]: He will never be able to win elections and connect with the common people the way Sharad

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
[Guest]: Pawar does.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.240
[Guest]: The way Sharad Pawar thinks politics, Ajit is not capable of it.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:31.360
[Guest]: And there was also a time, I think there's a central, when Chidambaram was the finance

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.360
[Guest]: minister in the UPA government.

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:40.920
[Guest]: And there is a central body where, I think a finance commission or something, where the

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:45.120
[Guest]: finance minister of some state heads that commission.

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.120
[Guest]: And Sushil Modi, who was the finance minister of Bihar, was the head of that.

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.080
[Guest]: And then this Neetesh Kumar broke off from the BJP.

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.880
[Guest]: And so the BJP was out of the government.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.120
[Guest]: And then they were looking for someone.

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.160
[Guest]: So Chidambaram called Prithviraj Chavan, who was the chief minister, saying, I would rather

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:07.000
[Guest]: now give it to a finance minister from a formless led government than to a BJP led government.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.800
[Guest]: So please recommend your finance minister's name.

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.760
[Guest]: So Prithviraj Chavan asked Ajit Pawar.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:18.200
[Guest]: And Ajit Pawar said, can I have the bureaucrats sitting with me at those meeting?

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:25.520
[Guest]: So Prithviraj Chavan said, no, this is a meeting of finance ministers, not for bureaucrats.

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.520
[Guest]: Bureaucrats can't advise you.

02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.140
[Guest]: He said, then I don't want to be.

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:32.440
[Guest]: I don't want to be because he could not hold his own with the people in Delhi.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:35.720
[Guest]: He's OK in this pocket borrow of Baramati.

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:38.760
[Guest]: He doesn't even understand Vidarbha properly as Sharath Pawar does.

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.760
[Guest]: He doesn't even...

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.800
[Guest]: You know, about Sharath Pawar, one story that I really love about him is, you know, he went

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.800
[Guest]: up in a helicopter.

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.800
[Guest]: In fact, there are two stories.

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:53.480
[Guest]: He went up in a helicopter and that helicopter would not kind of... it could not take off.

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.480
[Guest]: There were headwinds.

02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480
[Guest]: So it could not...

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.480
[Amit Varma]: He was coming from Pune to Bombay, I think.

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.480
[Guest]: Yeah, Pune to Bombay.

02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.520
[Guest]: And then he went back.

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:01.520
[Guest]: He shed some luggage.

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:03.600
[Guest]: He shed some people, still couldn't do it.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.920
[Guest]: So he came by road and he was very late for the meeting that he had.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.400
[Guest]: And he said, I need to have a road which will take me from Pune to Mumbai in two hours.

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.360
[Guest]: And that is how we got the expressway.

02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:17.360
[Amit Varma]: His brainchild, even though Gadkari gets credit in the popular imagination.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.360
[Guest]: Gadkari takes credit for it.

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.400
[Guest]: But like I told you earlier, Sharath Pawar doesn't know how to take credit.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.400
[Guest]: He doesn't know how to hype.

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.400
[Guest]: He doesn't know how to tom-tom.

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.280
[Guest]: But it was his brainchild, you know.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:31.520
[Guest]: But the second story, he was in this helicopter with about two journalists and the chopper

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:33.400
[Guest]: ran out of fuel.

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.560
[Guest]: And the pilot was in a panic.

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:42.960
[Guest]: He said, Sir, we have only about 15 minutes of fuel left and we are nowhere near landing.

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.240
[Guest]: So Sharath Pawar said, you just tell me, you look at your compass and tell me exactly

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.760
[Guest]: where you are.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.680
[Guest]: You know, which is... you give me your coordinates.

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.060
[Guest]: So he told him that we are here.

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:59.560
[Guest]: So Sharath Pawar said that if I go by road, I will turn right.

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:01.800
[Guest]: How do you have to go by air?

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.360
[Guest]: So the pilot took the chopper in that direction.

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:08.120
[Guest]: So he said, then I would turn left.

02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.880
[Guest]: How do you go from here?

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:12.680
[Guest]: You know, so the pilot took this one.

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.040
[Guest]: Then he said, now you kind of go this way, go that way.

02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:17.120
[Guest]: He directed him.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:21.800
[Guest]: Then finally, when they came with just about five minutes fuel left, he said, there has

02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:27.360
[Guest]: to be a school ground here or a market yard here.

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.400
[Guest]: Just see whether it is there and land there.

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.200
[Guest]: You know, they found the school ground and they landed in the school.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And those two journalists are never going to give him bad press ever again.

02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.480
[Guest]: You know, he knows Maharashtra like the back of his hand.

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:48.760
[Guest]: Once when I went, you know, election coverage, I took a car and went all the way from Bombay

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.960
[Guest]: and I went all the way to Lathur, which was the South Maharashtra point.

02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.240
[Guest]: You know, next was Hyderabad or whatever.

02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:56.920
[Guest]: And then when I was coming back, so Pawar said, where are you going?

02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.980
[Guest]: I said, I think maybe I'll halt in either Karad or Pune, Mr. Pawar.

02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:04.520
[Guest]: And then I will go to go to Bombay tomorrow morning.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:09.000
[Guest]: So you know, he actually directed me, go from here, then you will come to this village

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.680
[Guest]: and then you will find this tree and this tree shaped like this.

02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.480
[Guest]: And from there you go like that.

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.080
[Guest]: And then you go so many miles and then this village is there and you turn there.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.800
[Guest]: My head was spinning, you know, I said, how does he know?

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:25.320
[Guest]: And then I told my driver, so he said, understand a little bit, madam, but we will ask and then

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.320
[Guest]: go.

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:30.080
[Guest]: Actually, I cut the distance, you know, I mean, by about two or three hours.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.960
[Guest]: And so he knows Maharashtra like the back of his hand.

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:37.880
[Guest]: Ajit Pawar does not know that, but he probably tried to strike out on his own, tried to tell

02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:40.960
[Guest]: his uncle that I can also do whatever you want.

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:47.960
[Guest]: But the reason why Pawar did not declare anybody has his air and he did not allow people to

02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:52.640
[Guest]: rally around the second generation was why he got the result he got, you know, because,

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:56.480
[Guest]: you know, the moment the MLAs realized that Ajit doesn't have Sharad Pawar's support,

02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:01.680
[Guest]: they all kind of came back and they left Ajit with no opportunity but to come back, you

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:02.680
[Guest]: know.

02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:06.440
[Guest]: So it was a, what do you say, a storm in a teacup.

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:11.160
[Amit Varma]: And Sharad Pawar, the master manipulator and strategist, but not good at optics.

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.160
[Guest]: He can't take credit for things.

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.520
[Guest]: No, no, he just can't.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:21.400
[Guest]: But also note, Amit, that, you know, Sharad Pawar has taken both Raj Thackeray and Uddhav

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:26.600
[Guest]: Thackeray under his wing, Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, both parties who

02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.040
[Guest]: occasionally go against.

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:31.240
[Guest]: North Indians, South Indians are violent, are pro-Hindutva, etc.

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.100
[Guest]: He has secularized them.

02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.560
[Guest]: He has brought them into the mainstream.

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:41.920
[Guest]: You know, the space there, you know, is completely different now.

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.280
[Guest]: He's got to socialize them, socialistic.

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.280
[Guest]: Why?

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.600
[Guest]: Maharashtrian ethos is a socialist ethos.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.520
[Guest]: It is not a pro-Hindutva ethos.

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:59.680
[Guest]: So he has left now the BJP and the RSS, which is only a 5 to 10% vote, pure Hindutva vote.

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:06.080
[Guest]: The rest of them vote for Shiv Sena, vote for MNS, but they're also the Marathi Manus

02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:10.960
[Guest]: vote, which comes up to about 25% and 30%.

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:16.200
[Guest]: So he has separated the two, Hindutva on one side and Marathi Manus on the other side.

02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:22.240
[Amit Varma]: So to end this episode, what I'll ask you for is I'll ask you to evaluate each of the

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.240
[Amit Varma]: five parties.

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.740
[Amit Varma]: I'm also counting MNS.

02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:27.520
[Amit Varma]: Each of the five parties one by one for me, where do they stand?

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:28.520
[Amit Varma]: What is their future?

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:29.520
[Amit Varma]: And so on.

02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Let's start with the Shiv Sena because we've spoken so much about them and you've written

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:36.040
[Amit Varma]: so much about them and you know them all personally.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:41.000
[Amit Varma]: It's been said that Bal Thackeray once said or repeatedly said, in fact, that Uddhav is

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.200
[Amit Varma]: a fine strategist and one of the best minds he knows.

02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Is that true?

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.480
[Amit Varma]: What is your take of Uddhav?

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:52.280
[Amit Varma]: And my follow up question to that is that what is the future of the Shiv Sena in the

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:57.400
[Amit Varma]: sense that in terms of what niche do they occupy in the political marketplace?

02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:01.320
[Amit Varma]: Like initially they started off with the whole Marathi Manus Singh, then they attacked South

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:05.040
[Amit Varma]: Indians for a while, they attacked Muslims for a while and went the Hindutva way.

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.880
[Amit Varma]: They attacked North Indian migrants for a while.

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.880
[Amit Varma]: What niche in the market, where are they going to position themselves in the future?

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:14.360
[Amit Varma]: And what kind of a leader is Uddhav?

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Is he sort of a tactical go with the flow kind of person or does he have an ideology

02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:20.160
[Amit Varma]: and beliefs of his own?

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.360
[Guest]: See, so far he has proved that he's only go with the flow kind of a person.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.520
[Guest]: He has gone with the flow.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.360
[Guest]: But if he wants his party to survive, this is a miracle that he has managed to become

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.480
[Guest]: the chief minister of Maharashtra.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.840
[Guest]: Nobody expected that.

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:41.960
[Guest]: But he must use his stint as the chief minister to broaden the base of the Shiv Sena now.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:49.920
[Guest]: He has to kind of move away from the, what do you say, from the 60s and 70s Marathi Manus.

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.600
[Guest]: The kind of 60s and 70s Marathi Manus, if I may be politically incorrect and say the

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.760
[Guest]: lumpens and the extortionists etc.

02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:59.160
[Guest]: Because Maharashtrians are also very aspirational.

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:01.560
[Guest]: They are youth, they want to take their place in the world.

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:05.800
[Guest]: They want to earn the same kind of salaries that other people are earning.

02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:06.800
[Guest]: They want to go abroad.

02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:09.880
[Guest]: I mean, they want to do things and they never got a chance.

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:12.720
[Guest]: The Shiv Sena voters never got a chance to do this.

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.600
[Guest]: Those Maharashtrians who managed to achieve all these things were never the Shiv Sena

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.600
[Guest]: voters.

02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:20.520
[Guest]: So he has to make sure, you know, I mean, that, you know, Maharashtra also does not

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.960
[Guest]: have a trader class, which is why there are a lot of Gujaratis and Marwadis and Sindhis

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.960
[Guest]: and others.

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.680
[Guest]: From Shivaji's time, they don't have a trader class.

02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.680
[Guest]: And Shivaji had actually invited traders from Gujarat and neighboring states to come and

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680
[Guest]: settle here.

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:39.080
[Guest]: And so, so he has to make sure that, you know, there are some Maharashtrian entrepreneurs

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.240
[Guest]: who are given a kind of, I won't say subsidies, but they're given encouragement, a leg up

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.480
[Guest]: and everything to do something.

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.200
[Amit Varma]: Enabled in a friendly environment.

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Yes, yes.

02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:48.200
[Guest]: That he must do.

02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:49.520
[Guest]: He must broad base the Shiv Sena.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.240
[Guest]: Otherwise, even the stint in power will not take him anywhere.

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.840
[Guest]: And I think he will consciously put the Ram temple in the back burner because according

02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.800
[Guest]: to him, I think what he thinks is that now the Supreme Court has already given its verdict.

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.200
[Guest]: There is no political mileage left in that, you know, I mean, the minority community is

02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.200
[Guest]: not opposing it.

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.920
[Guest]: In fact, many in them are saying that, let it go.

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, we will take the five acres of land and we'll do something over there.

02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:16.520
[Guest]: So there is no political mileage in it, you know, I mean, and then he's already needling

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.560
[Guest]: the BJP saying that don't claim credit for it.

02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:19.680
[Guest]: You know, I mean, you didn't have the guts.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.680
[Guest]: We asked you to pass a law.

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.680
[Guest]: You didn't pass a law.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.080
[Guest]: You know, you're fighting from the shoulders of the Supreme Court.

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.760
[Guest]: So, you know, that politically it is over.

02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.280
[Guest]: So he has to broad base the Shiv Sena.

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.360
[Amit Varma]: But my question there is that if you broad base it, how do you differentiate yourself

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.040
[Amit Varma]: from the NCP and the Congress?

02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.480
[Amit Varma]: Because they are also kind of broad based in a sense.

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:38.840
[Guest]: What is the difference?

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.120
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, that is it, you know, I mean, but you know, this is Marathi Manus.

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:49.560
[Guest]: His competition is mostly with NCP, not so much with the Congress, because the NCP also,

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:55.280
[Guest]: however much it has tried in the past 10-12 years, it has remained only a regional party

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:59.040
[Guest]: and that to Western Maharashtra, you know, Sharad Pawar, such a tall leader like Sharad

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.280
[Guest]: Pawar, he's not been able to give a push to his party beyond Western Maharashtra.

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.280
[Guest]: Vidarbha may there is nothing, you know, I mean, Mumbai also, they don't win anything.

02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.080
[Guest]: They don't get anything in Mumbai.

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.800
[Guest]: So Pawar will also make that effort.

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.800
[Guest]: He will try and see.

02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:17.440
[Guest]: So that will, while the BJP was cannibalizing the Shiv Sena on Hindutva, it is likely that

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.400
[Guest]: the NCP will cannibalize the Shiv Sena on the Marathi Manus thing.

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.920
[Guest]: And once again, I don't know people like industrialist, Kiloskars, Garwaris, I don't know who they

02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.920
[Guest]: will prefer.

02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:34.240
[Guest]: I think they might prefer Sharad Pawar to Uddhav Thackeray.

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:40.320
[Guest]: But you know, if Sharad Pawar doesn't manage to get someone in place, Ajit Pawar, Supriya

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:45.760
[Guest]: Asule, to take his legacy forward, then they might choose Uddhav Thackeray because he's

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.160
[Guest]: a young, he's already put Aditya Thackeray in place, you know, I mean, they might prefer

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:51.160
[Amit Varma]: him.

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:55.560
[Guest]: I think the CM will help his brand a lot over the next few years.

02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:56.560
[Amit Varma]: What about the MNS?

02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they didn't do anything in this election, of course, but are they going to be a force?

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:01.360
[Amit Varma]: Do they have any issues?

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.960
[Amit Varma]: Because like you pointed out, the early issues Raj took up were a non-starter because a Marathi

02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:08.160
[Guest]: Manus had already gotten all the jobs, right?

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:10.160
[Guest]: Bal Thackeray had once.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.400
[Guest]: Actually, Raj Thackeray, I'm beginning to feel a bit sorry for him.

02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.320
[Guest]: You know, he kind of, of course, he tried to take off on the 60s, 70s thing, but it

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.320
[Guest]: didn't work.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.680
[Guest]: I mean, because there are two things, one, of course, the locals have got the jobs.

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.600
[Guest]: The second thing is if you're still fighting for jobs for ferrywallas and, you know, taxi

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:34.080
[Guest]: drivers and all that, that means in 30, 40, 50 years, you know, I mean, the Marathi Manus

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:37.160
[Guest]: has not progressed, you know, I mean, then whose fault is it?

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.600
[Guest]: You know, I mean, it is not anybody else's fault.

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.120
[Guest]: It's your own fault that you were not able to bring them out of it.

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:45.880
[Guest]: Now, he realized that and he stopped his anti-North Indian rhetoric.

02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:48.320
[Guest]: He stopped his anti-Muslim rhetoric, etc.

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.320
[Guest]: And at that point of time, he was occupying a space.

02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.400
[Guest]: During the Lok Sabha elections, he was occupying a space clearly opposed to the Shiv Sena and

02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:00.520
[Guest]: the BJP, you know, and until the assembly elections, when the assembly elections, of

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:03.600
[Guest]: course, he didn't succeed very much, but he was still occupying that space.

02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:07.480
[Guest]: He had wanted an alliance with the Congress and the NCP and he went all the way to Delhi

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.240
[Guest]: and he met Sonia Gandhi.

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.800
[Guest]: You know, I saw that as a paradigm shift that, you know, Sonia Gandhi even gave him an audience,

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.240
[Guest]: you know, I mean, she allowed considering how it used to be between the two parties.

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:25.240
[Guest]: And then apparently Sonia told him directly that, you know, my leaders in Maharashtra

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.800
[Guest]: do not want this alliance because they feel that your votes do not get transferred to

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:35.240
[Guest]: the Congress, which is also true because a lot of MNS voters kind of told me that, you

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.000
[Guest]: know, although Raj was saying vote for Congress and NCP during the Lok Sabha elections.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:51.640
[Guest]: So, you know, I mean, their mentality is that.

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:55.880
[Guest]: Now he has to rescue and he has to save those people.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.080
[Guest]: He has to now evolve something and he's in the most trouble now.

02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:02.080
[Guest]: Congress will survive.

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:09.200
[Guest]: NCP will also survive to a large extent, but either he has to merge with the Shiv Sena

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:10.200
[Guest]: and they have to go back.

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.040
[Guest]: You know, now Uddhav has achieved everything, he has become the chief minister.

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:14.840
[Guest]: They have to go back, you know, he'll be the campaigner.

02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.240
[Guest]: Uddhav will be the chief minister.

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.240
[Guest]: He'll be the strategist.

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:20.320
[Guest]: Either they have to do that or he has to evolve in identity.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.280
[Guest]: How he will evolve, I don't know.

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about the NCP.

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:29.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Sharath Pawar and we probably could, you know, devote a full episode to the man

02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:33.200
[Amit Varma]: because what a fascinating man and what an incredible career he's had.

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.120
[Amit Varma]: But he's growing old.

02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, he's got these two kids who haven't really marked themselves out in spectacular

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.480
[Amit Varma]: ways at all.

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:42.120
[Amit Varma]: What does the NCP stand for?

02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:43.280
[Amit Varma]: What is their future?

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.840
[Guest]: What do you see ahead for them?

02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:48.520
[Guest]: See, NCP is only another wing of the Congress.

02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:51.720
[Guest]: And for the past five years, you know, what has happened today?

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:57.160
[Guest]: We heard that he went, you know, he went and he met Modi in Delhi, Narendra Modi in Delhi.

02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:02.480
[Guest]: And he himself admits that Narendra Modi suggested that the NCP support the BJP and we form a

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.480
[Guest]: government.

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:07.880
[Guest]: And I told him that not possible because my party is a small party.

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.200
[Guest]: What he actually meant is that ideology is very different.

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:11.200
[Guest]: It is not possible.

02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:14.000
[Guest]: He would have got swallowed up faster than the Shiv Sena if he had done.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.680
[Guest]: And over the past five years, there was a bitter fight between NCP supporters.

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.240
[Guest]: You know, there was one group saying that we should align with the BJP and another group

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.960
[Guest]: saying that, no, we should stay secular.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.160
[Guest]: And they almost came to blows about two or three years ago.

02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:30.440
[Guest]: And then suddenly, Sharad Pawar decided that, no, we are realigning with the Congress.

02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.000
[Guest]: And they had begun to lose.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.400
[Guest]: They had been confusing their voters because Pawar was also making very pro-Modi statements.

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:43.840
[Guest]: Sometimes Modi was saying that, he handed me through politics and voters were getting

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.840
[Guest]: confused.

02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:48.840
[Guest]: Then Pawar came out openly with some anti-Modi statements.

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.560
[Guest]: And then the election results that he has got, he has realized that this is the anti-BJP

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.160
[Guest]: vote that he has got.

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.240
[Guest]: So he cannot afford to align with the BJP.

02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:00.680
[Guest]: And he has to face a lot of Zilla Parishad and municipal corporation elections in the

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:02.560
[Guest]: next year or so.

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:07.960
[Guest]: And the BJP has managed to capture his home turf of Pune and also some bodies in Baramuthi,

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:08.960
[Guest]: etc.

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.400
[Guest]: He needs to wrest them back.

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.800
[Guest]: So his near-term focus will be on that.

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.520
[Guest]: How to get it back.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:22.160
[Guest]: And I have a feeling, eventually, there will be a merger between the Congress and the NCP.

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:23.160
[Guest]: There's no way.

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:25.560
[Guest]: There has to be a merger between MNS and Shiv Sena.

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.040
[Guest]: There will have to be a merger between Congress and NC.

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:34.040
[Amit Varma]: At a purely human level, do you think of Sharad Pawar sitting down alone and thinking to himself

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.680
[Amit Varma]: that, look, I've achieved my political peak, which was becoming chief minister and central

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:41.340
[Amit Varma]: minister and all that, and achieved it many times.

02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:43.240
[Amit Varma]: And I'm never going to be prime minister.

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.520
[Amit Varma]: And so my best is clearly behind me.

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And now it's sort of struggling to maintain status quo, running to stand still.

02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Why would he be motivated by that?

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:55.680
[Guest]: He's a political animal.

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.600
[Guest]: He's a real political animal.

02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:01.760
[Guest]: You know, the pictures that we saw, the viral video of him standing in the rain and campaigning,

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.760
[Guest]: pouring rain, etc.

02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:05.920
[Guest]: Lots of NCP people say, but he's like that.

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.920
[Guest]: He was always like that.

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.480
[Guest]: The only thing is, there is so much technology now.

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:11.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, so those pictures become viral.

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.420
[Guest]: You know, I mean, they get shared on social media, etc.

02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:15.420
[Guest]: But he was always like that.

02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:17.280
[Guest]: He will never retire.

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:21.400
[Guest]: He was almost in semi-retirement, you know, just before the Vidhan Sabha elections.

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:25.880
[Guest]: And then they fingered him and then he got up like, you know, like on his horse and charged

02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:29.000
[Guest]: off, you know, I mean, like an ancient knight would do something like that.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
[Guest]: He did.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
[Guest]: He got into his car and he went.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.120
[Guest]: And when I called him for an interview, I want an interview.

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:38.280
[Guest]: He said, I'm not coming back to Mumbai for a very long time.

02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.280
[Guest]: And then I chased him.

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.620
[Guest]: I said, then I will meet you wherever you are, you know.

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.080
[Guest]: So he said, OK, I'll tell you my program.

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:44.080
[Guest]: I went to Nagpur.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.080
[Guest]: He was out of Nagpur.

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.080
[Guest]: I went to Nasik.

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.080
[Guest]: He was out of Nasik.

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:50.800
[Guest]: You know, so he really has the energy even at this age.

02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:52.360
[Guest]: He will never retire.

02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:56.160
[Guest]: And now he's becoming the fulcrum of opposition unity.

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.920
[Guest]: The experiment in Maharashtra has told the opposition that they can achieve it if they

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:01.180
[Guest]: are all together.

02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:03.200
[Guest]: He's becoming the fulcrum of opposition unity.

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.200
[Guest]: And he will still be.

02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:09.280
[Guest]: See, Murarji Desai at the age of 99, he still thought that people will call him to become

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.040
[Guest]: prime minister again.

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.180
[Guest]: You know, they never lose their ambition.

02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.920
[Guest]: I think Sharad Pawar will never lose his ambition.

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:22.280
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if that's more inspiring or more sad, but let's move on to the Congress.

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:23.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, where are they now?

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, nationally, they've been going down just massively.

02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:32.560
[Amit Varma]: They've had two consecutive Lok Sabha elections where they've got like 50 seats on.

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.600
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, they are still getting all those millions of votes, all those crores

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.600
[Amit Varma]: of votes.

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.600
[Amit Varma]: So what are they in Maharashtra?

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Do they have a chance of ever coming back?

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Or is it just a big old machine gradually grinding to a halt slowly?

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.680
[Guest]: See, what the Congress needs to do, frankly speaking, is to build a leadership in the

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.000
[Guest]: states.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.520
[Guest]: You cannot be centralized anymore.

02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:01.920
[Guest]: You know, a party president needs to be there to glue the sides together.

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:08.680
[Guest]: This election, I remember when the Congress and the NCP shared their seats, the Congress

02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:12.480
[Guest]: gave the NCP 125 seats out of 288.

02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.640
[Guest]: And at that point of time, the NCP was virtually on its last legs.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.840
[Guest]: All stalwarts had gone to the BJP.

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.600
[Guest]: You know, I mean, there was hardly any chance and hope.

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:24.200
[Guest]: So I asked one AICC General Secretary that, you know, I mean, why so many seats?

02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:27.520
[Guest]: You could have given 100 and Pawar would have been satisfied.

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.120
[Guest]: So he said, I asked Sunia Gandhi the same thing.

02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:35.520
[Guest]: And Madam told me, tell me, do we have anybody in Maharashtra who can match Sharad Pawar's

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:40.000
[Guest]: level, who can get me the kind of seats that I want from Maharashtra?

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.400
[Guest]: So until you can find me a leader like that, I have to do what Sharad Pawar tells me.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.060
[Guest]: And even in this entire government formation, she went entirely by Sharad Pawar's advice.

02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:53.120
[Guest]: What Sharad Pawar said, she did, she signed on the dotted line.

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:58.200
[Guest]: Even Rahul Gandhi was overruled, even, you know, I mean, some of the South Indian leaders

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:02.280
[Guest]: who remember the anti-South Indian campaign of the Shiv Sena, they were overruled, etc.

02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:05.880
[Guest]: So taking lessons from that, okay, Sharad Pawar, she said, Sharad Pawar technically

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:08.720
[Guest]: NCP, but basically he's a congressman.

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:12.640
[Guest]: And it is because he broke away from the Congress that he has acquired this kind of a stature.

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.920
[Guest]: Now there is Mamata Banerjee who has broken away from the Congress.

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:19.920
[Guest]: So many other people, even Chandrababu Naidu is technically a congressman, you know, I

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:21.520
[Guest]: mean, he went with his father-in-law.

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:25.360
[Guest]: So even if you are not able to get them back into the Congress, you have to develop state

02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:28.960
[Guest]: leaderships because, you know, each state is different from the another.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:31.980
[Guest]: Sitting in Delhi, you will not be, if you want to be a national party, you will never

02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:36.000
[Guest]: be able to understand unless you have regional leadership.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.960
[Guest]: So you have to develop that regional leadership.

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:40.400
[Guest]: If they don't do it, then they are doomed.

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.400
[Amit Varma]: Very wise words.

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:45.680
[Amit Varma]: And now finally, let's end with talking, of course, about the BJP because, and there this

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:50.840
[Amit Varma]: is like the BJP in the Maharashtra is just one arm of this phenomenon that's kind of

02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.400
[Amit Varma]: erupted in Indian politics in the last five years to the dismay of many, but it's all

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.400
[Amit Varma]: very interesting.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.560
[Amit Varma]: So what are they trying to do?

02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:59.560
[Amit Varma]: How do they position themselves?

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:03.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, are they going to be a behemoth in the state as they are nationally, or is

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:06.840
[Amit Varma]: it eventually going to crumble under the weight of its own contradictions?

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:12.320
[Guest]: See, I'll tell you, BJP in Maharashtra also suffers the same syndrome that the Congress

02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:13.400
[Guest]: is suffering.

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:16.840
[Guest]: They have a strong state leadership, although one might dispute that the Congress doesn't

02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:21.840
[Guest]: really have a strong, strong state leadership, but for whatever it is worth, it is there.

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:28.800
[Guest]: Without that national leadership, no leader in Maharashtra will be able to win any number

02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:29.800
[Guest]: of seats.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:35.040
[Guest]: Had it been left entirely to Devendra Fadnavis, they would not even have got 105 seats.

02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:39.480
[Guest]: And at the moment, the manner in which they conducted and particularly Fadnavis conducted

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:44.320
[Guest]: himself, you know, I mean, sidelining lots of his rivals, you know, I mean, and Pankaj

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:49.640
[Guest]: Amundey is complaining that, you know, I mean, he conspired with my cousin to defeat me.

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.560
[Guest]: We hear that she has gone to Udhav and she said, I have the support of 12 MLAs.

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.880
[Guest]: Anytime you say I will come over with my MLAs to you.

02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:00.680
[Guest]: There are a lot of people who are not given tickets because Fadnavis didn't want them

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.280
[Guest]: to contest and did not want it to be a competition.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.120
[Guest]: So there are a lot of factions developing in the state BJP and it is on the point of

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:09.680
[Guest]: cracking and coming to the surface.

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:13.840
[Guest]: And left on his own, Fadnavis will never be able to win an election.

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.520
[Guest]: So until you have the strong leadership in the center, maybe they will win the elections.

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:24.880
[Guest]: But they also need to develop a better, you know, like in the sense that they had given

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:27.040
[Guest]: charge to Nitin Gadkari.

02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:31.200
[Guest]: They would not have lost the government because Nitin Gadkari is a better campaigner.

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:34.560
[Guest]: Nitin Gadkari is better at gluing things together.

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:38.200
[Guest]: You know, he's better at putting together alliances, you know.

02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:40.240
[Guest]: The backroom work would have been much better.

02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:41.240
[Guest]: Yes.

02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:42.240
[Guest]: Yes.

02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:43.760
[Guest]: So they will also have to do a lot of rethinking.

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.760
[Guest]: Until they are there, maybe they will win.

02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:49.520
[Guest]: But even with their being at the height of power, they managed to get only 105 seats

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:50.520
[Guest]: this time.

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:53.400
[Guest]: So what, who knows what they might get next time.

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.160
[Amit Varma]: It's been really fascinating talking to you.

02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.960
[Amit Varma]: You've just brought Maharashtra politics so alive for me.

02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:03.240
