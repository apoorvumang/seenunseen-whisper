00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
[Amit Varma]: How do we evaluate our precedents in prime ministers?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Ideally, we should do so on the basis of their governance.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.720
[Amit Varma]: But governance is complicated, the economy is complicated, policy is complicated, the

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.340
[Amit Varma]: state is a convoluted beast that moves in many directions at once, and disentangling

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.200
[Amit Varma]: all of these is hard.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.680
[Amit Varma]: How much of what happened is down to the decisions of the person at the top.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.040
[Amit Varma]: How many of those decisions were good or bad, regardless of the consequences?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.540
[Amit Varma]: What are the counterfactuals?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.920
[Amit Varma]: What are the counter-narratives?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: In most cases, we can't tell.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.720
[Amit Varma]: So we instead judge our leaders based on our prior perceptions of them, the image we already

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.880
[Amit Varma]: have in our minds.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.440
[Amit Varma]: We rationalize or condemn everything they do, regardless of what they actually do.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Often, we judge them based on the ideological or political tribe we have already chosen.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes, though, a leader is either so bad or so good that even those blinkers are irrelevant.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.120
[Amit Varma]: I feel like that when I think of a man called P. V. Narasimha Rao.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.280
[Amit Varma]: Born 101 years ago on June 28, 1921, Narasimha Rao happened to be the compromise candidate

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.520
[Amit Varma]: when he became the Prime Minister of India in June 1991.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.360
[Amit Varma]: India was in the middle of an existential economic crisis.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960
[Amit Varma]: Bold action was needed to get us out of it.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.320
[Amit Varma]: We needed to go against every political current that had brought India to where it was.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.320
[Amit Varma]: Narasimha Rao was a man of great learning, but India needed a man of great action.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.400
[Amit Varma]: He realized the gravity of the situation and used his political skills to bring about the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.160
[Amit Varma]: famous reforms that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.480
[Amit Varma]: What he did for humanity is incalculable.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And yet, his achievements are today minimized and even mocked by his own party.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.400
[Amit Varma]: There's a haunting image of dogs nipping at his half-burned body on his funeral pyre after

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.440
[Amit Varma]: he died.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's a perfect metaphor for what this country has done to one of its tallest leaders.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360
[Amit Varma]: If it was not for P. V. Narasimha Rao, I may not have been recording this today.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And if you're Indian, you may not have been listening to it.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.020
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist who's been on the show before to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.040
[Amit Varma]: discuss the history of the BJP before Modi.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.280
[Amit Varma]: That's one of the most popular episodes of the show.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'll link it from the show notes.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.120
[Amit Varma]: When Vinay got in touch recently and said he was visiting Mumbai, why don't we meet

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120
[Amit Varma]: for coffee?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.080
[Amit Varma]: I instantly took the chance to invite him back to my home studio to discuss his outstanding

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.920
[Amit Varma]: first book, Half Lion, How P. V. Narasimha Rao Transformed India.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Vinay came over for a meal and a recording.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And we had this conversation.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Vinay's book began with the question of how central Narasimha Rao was to the 1991 reforms.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Would they have happened anyway?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.120
[Amit Varma]: His narrative reveals that without the man who put together the remarkable team that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.800
[Amit Varma]: carried out the reforms, they may not have happened.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.920
[Amit Varma]: His book also paints a fantastic picture of Narasimha Rao, the man.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.160
[Amit Varma]: Here was a boy from humble background whose hunger for learning was second to none.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.080
[Amit Varma]: He was a self-taught polymath who knew 13 languages, 10 of them spoken by humans and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.540
[Amit Varma]: three computer languages that he taught himself when he discovered computers in his 60s.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.000
[Amit Varma]: He was erudite, pragmatic, and when action was required, a man of action.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Vinay's book brings out these aspects of his character and is also unflinching in looking

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360
[Amit Varma]: at the things he got wrong.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.660
[Amit Varma]: Vinay and I spoke about many other issues, and the first half is a freewheeling chat

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.920
[Amit Varma]: on politics, history, political science, why we want the things we want, and a road between

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Bandra Station and Bandra Reclamation that contains all of India within it.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.840
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.780
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.880
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and essays.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.440
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.920
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.040
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.000
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.960
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.200
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.920
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.120
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.720
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.240
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.600
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.080
[Amit Varma]: their Daily Reader.

[Amit Varma]: New batches start every month.

[Amit Varma]: They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up-to-date with

[Amit Varma]: ideas, skills, and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future.

[Amit Varma]: Uplevel yourself.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Vinay, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.680
[Guest]: Thank you very much, Amit.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.960
[Guest]: It's a pleasure to be here.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's especially a pleasure for me because our last episode was actually recorded

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.200
[Amit Varma]: remotely and it's just much better to kind of be sitting here in front of each other,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
[Guest]: isn't it?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this could not be less remote.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Not be less remote.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.760
[Amit Varma]: For the listeners, he is not on my lap.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760
[Amit Varma]: It is a little remote.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.200
[Amit Varma]: But the episode we did together, by the way, if I remember correctly, is the fifth most

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.200
[Amit Varma]: downloaded episode of The Seen and The Unseen.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.600
[Amit Varma]: So I think it struck a chord with a lot of people.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
[Guest]: Oh, thank you.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.720
[Amit Varma]: Let's hope this gets a little higher than that.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.440
[Amit Varma]: Let's hope this gets a little higher than that.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And I want to start off by sort of referring to an episode with you and indeed your book

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.400
[Amit Varma]: on the BJP really eye-opening for me.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And I want to start off by asking you about something that we spoke about.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And then subsequently, you know, there's been a counter narrative to that.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, when Dhirendra Jha's book Gandhi's Assassins came out recently, there was a prominent blurb

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.720
[Amit Varma]: by Christophe Jaffrelot saying that, oh, to the effect of, I don't remember the exact

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.120
[Amit Varma]: words, but to the effect of this proves that the RSS was involved in Gandhi's murder.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And when we spoke, you pointed out how, yeah, Godse was in the RSS in the 1930s.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.280
[Amit Varma]: But then by the early 1940s, he had, I mean, he didn't formally resign, but he had nothing

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280
[Amit Varma]: to do with them.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.800
[Amit Varma]: And most importantly, in his magazine Agrani, for years before he assassinated Gandhiji,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.920
[Amit Varma]: he railed against two targets, which were RSS and Gandhiji, which kind of, you know,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.320
[Amit Varma]: proves that he would have had nothing to, you know, he was completely out of the RSS

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
[Amit Varma]: orbit.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.480
[Amit Varma]: And this book using mostly circumstantial evidence claims seems to imply that, no, he

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.560
[Amit Varma]: was an active part of the RSS, which I didn't see any direct evidence for it was circumstantial.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.240
[Amit Varma]: And also that the RSS is involved in the murder.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.960
[Amit Varma]: So firstly, you know, what would your response to that be?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, the broader question is, is that, you know, I abhor the RSS and obviously

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.160
[Amit Varma]: abhor Godse as well.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.200
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think that one needs to associate them necessarily and force fit them together

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.800
[Amit Varma]: to be against them.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.120
[Amit Varma]: So it's almost as if that this narrative is important for people to prove as they've been

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.560
[Amit Varma]: kind of talking about for the last, you know, since Gandhiji died.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.920
[Guest]: So what's your take on this?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.480
[Guest]: Well, let's stick to the facts for a minute before, you know, the larger narrative, right?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:50.280
[Guest]: It's a clear fact that Godse was a Hindu nationalist in that he believed in Hindutva.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.520
[Guest]: He was a fan of Savarkar.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest]: The criticisms that he had of Gandhi are the exact criticisms the RSS had of Gandhi.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.960
[Guest]: There's no disagreement on that.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.920
[Guest]: Even the RSS would say that, look, we may respect Gandhi, but these are the criticisms

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.960
[Guest]: we had of him, etc, etc, appeasing Muslims, appeasing Muslim League, you know, appeasing

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.520
[Guest]: Pakistan after creation of Pakistan, etc, etc.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.400
[Guest]: So both Godse and the RSS had the same views on Gandhi.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.840
[Guest]: The question and the question for criminal liability is, was the RSS involved in the

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.480
[Guest]: murder of Mahatma Gandhi?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.240
[Guest]: There is no evidence for that, right?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.120
[Guest]: There's a little more circumstantial evidence that says, look, what's the role of Savarkar,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
[Guest]: right?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.280
[Guest]: But in the, and this is not a question that has not been asked.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.680
[Guest]: This is a question that has been asked heavily for the last 75 years.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.640
[Guest]: Immediately after Gandhi's murder, RSS was banned.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.520
[Guest]: The police, which was run by Patel, was not sympathetic to the RSS at all.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.840
[Guest]: And a year later, they found no evidence against the RSS, which is why they removed the ban

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840
[Guest]: on the RSS.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.240
[Guest]: Why would they remove the ban if the RSS was involved, right?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.400
[Guest]: The RSS was not charge-sheeted, people were arrested, but nobody in the RSS was convicted

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.280
[Guest]: or punished for this.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.640
[Guest]: And for decades later, this question has been asked again and again and again, right?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.600
[Guest]: And as you point out, the new book is, you know, is circumstantial evidence and you have

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.280
[Guest]: to then ask the question, why are we interested in that today?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.000
[Guest]: Because somehow you want to tarnish the BJP today with something that happened 75 years

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.400
[Guest]: ago and on which so much research has already been done, right?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.280
[Guest]: And as you said, why can't you just criticize the BJP saying that, you know, and I do that

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.960
[Guest]: in my book saying that, you know, it's treatment of Muslims is unconscionable, etc, etc, etc.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.640
[Guest]: Why do you have to invent these other things, right?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.900
[Guest]: The other thing that has constantly been, I would say, invented on the BJP is that it's

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.680
[Guest]: fundamentally a Brahminical upper-caste organization.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.880
[Guest]: It's not.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.200
[Guest]: And if it has that in the beginning, it's certainly not the case under Modi and, you

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.080
[Guest]: know, Amit, I keep wondering, why can't you just say the problem with the BJP is that

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.920
[Guest]: it's majoritarian, that, you know, 200 million Indian citizens it seeks to exclude from citizenship.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.300
[Guest]: That's bad enough, right?

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.600
[Guest]: Why do you have to, you know, and the problem with doing this and especially things like

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.840
[Guest]: the relationship between RSS and Gandhi's murder, which, by the way, was a Congress

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.120
[Guest]: political platform for decades after, which is, you know, vote mat de do Gandhi ke hatyaron

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120
[Guest]: ko.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.780
[Guest]: That used to be the voting rallying cry, but there's just no evidence for that.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.360
[Guest]: And I feel in some senses, you know, critics of the BJP do themselves disservice with these

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.320
[Guest]: kind of allegations that have been exhaustively studied and exhaustively disproved over seven

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.320
[Guest]: decades.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.160
[Amit Varma]: And, and Dhilendra Jha, by the way, is a wonderful writer.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160
[Amit Varma]: So it's not about him as well.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.880
[Amit Varma]: I loved his previous two books, which I recommend you read, called The Dark Knight and Ascetic

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Games.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.040
[Amit Varma]: The Dark Knight, in fact, has a history of how the whole Babri Masjid controversy started.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.680
[Amit Varma]: Akar Patel first told me about that book.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.020
[Amit Varma]: So a wonderful journalist, not a knock on him.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And this book also has some excellent journalism slash history and, you know, all of that.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.520
[Amit Varma]: But it also seems that there is, you know, a need to kind of push a narrative about a

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.800
[Amit Varma]: party where absolutely everything is black.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And if this has become a dominant narrative that the RSS killed Gandhi, then they've got

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.900
[Amit Varma]: to find a way to kind of talk about it, where I found, you know, my conversation with you

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.120
[Amit Varma]: enlightening on this that, you know, Godse railed against them for years in his magazine

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Agrani.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And yes, you can't necessarily absolve Savarkar in the same way.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.080
[Amit Varma]: But that's again, a whole different story.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And as far as caste is concerned, you know, the fact is that both in 2014 and 2019, more

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.320
[Amit Varma]: Dalits voted for the BJP than they did for any other party.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.680
[Guest]: And it's the same with OBCs and tribals too.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Casteism is pernicious and is unfortunately still a part of Hindu society.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and that's a terrible thing.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.260
[Amit Varma]: And hopefully one day we get past it, though we are nowhere close to doing so.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.180
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't mean that Hindutva per se is necessarily casteist.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:02.640
[Amit Varma]: What Hindutva is, especially as we see it today, is anti Muslim and, you know, and that

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640
[Amit Varma]: is a big problem.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's reason enough, I think, in my mind to sort of oppose it.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've mentioned to me that you've never voted for the BJP and why and so on

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720
[Amit Varma]: and so forth.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And we've just kind of spoken about the anti Muslimness and all of that.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.800
[Amit Varma]: But is it the case that after you came out with these two books on Narasimha Rao, which

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.520
[Amit Varma]: we'll discuss in some detail and which I really love reading, and your book on the BJP for

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Modi that people, especially within academia, within the world of history, began to look

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.960
[Amit Varma]: at you differently, as if in some way, you are an apologist of some sort, just because

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: of the subject that you chose.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.060
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a long time back, I remember I did an episode with Prashant Jha, who wrote the

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.700
[Amit Varma]: book How the BJP won, which is about 2014.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And there is nothing, nothing in that book, which indicates ready supports of BJP.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.240
[Amit Varma]: It's just data analysis and really sharp analysis and all of that.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.120
[Amit Varma]: But I mentioned that book to a friend and said, you really must read this if you want

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.040
[Amit Varma]: to understand why they won in 2014.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.200
[Amit Varma]: And he's like, nah, nah, he must be a BJP guy or whatever.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.960
[Guest]: Have you had to go through that?

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.720
[Guest]: That's a very interesting question, you know, because for my first book, which is what we're

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.880
[Guest]: going to discuss today in detail, the biography on Narasimha Rao, the hot button political

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.580
[Guest]: question was economic liberalization, right?

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.480
[Guest]: And of course, I asked the question, who did it?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.320
[Guest]: Who was the author of liberalization?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.640
[Guest]: And I argue that look, it was a political, not a technocratic process.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.200
[Guest]: And therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the politician in question, which

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.840
[Guest]: is Narasimha Rao.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.280
[Guest]: But an underlying assumption was that liberalization was a good thing, right?

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.960
[Guest]: That it worked, that it, you know, has brought about growth, that it has lifted enormous

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.220
[Guest]: amounts of Indians out of poverty, that it has increased government revenue to the extent

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.760
[Guest]: that it can fund welfare schemes like NREGA, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyano, even the food security

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.160
[Guest]: package that India has in a way in which prior to 1991, Indian government simply didn't have

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.480
[Guest]: the resources.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.000
[Guest]: And while it has increased inequality, which is a problem, Indian inequality by at least

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.040
[Guest]: by Gini coefficient standards is not alarmingly high, it's a problem.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.560
[Guest]: But you know, poverty reduction, high GDP growth are spectacular, right?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.680
[Guest]: Now, when I wrote that, I was worried that I would get pushback from lots of people who

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.220
[Guest]: felt that liberalization was a bad thing, right?

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.720
[Guest]: I did not, right?

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.920
[Guest]: And I was not tarred saying that, oh, you are a, you know, neoliberal, right?

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.480
[Guest]: And I think, Amit, it's because in India, that battle has been won, you know, that in

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:39.640
[Guest]: a deep way, whether it's Mayawati or Samajwadi Party or DMK, the broad agreement is that,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.060
[Guest]: you know, the state has to retreat from the market broadly, right?

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.480
[Guest]: And instead, the state has to play an active role when it comes to welfare schemes and

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: the two are connected, because when the state retreats from the market and allows for private

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.520
[Guest]: enterprise, state taxation goes up, and it's able to use that increased revenue for welfare

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.520
[Guest]: schemes, which then allows them to win votes, right?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.400
[Guest]: This is a broad social democratic contract that has now become common sense in India.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.200
[Guest]: And it has become common sense that look, if you want welfare schemes of the NREGA scale,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.800
[Guest]: you know, you better get high GDP growth.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.680
[Guest]: And if you want high GDP growth, the state better retreat from the market, right, roughly.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.360
[Guest]: So that has not happened, right?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.760
[Guest]: So the second book, on the other hand, Amit, I have got pushback, saying that, you know,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.440
[Guest]: are you an apologist for the BJP, right?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.240
[Guest]: And I find that a ridiculous argument that just because I'm saying that they're not fascist,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.860
[Guest]: they are, you know, driven by elections, they are focused on winning elections.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.520
[Guest]: And I'm arguing that if you want to beat them, beat them on the electoral battlefield, right?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.200
[Guest]: And I was thinking about Amit that, you know, I mean, I'm not invested in Hindu nationalism

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.120
[Guest]: in that I'm not going to spend my entire career writing books on Hindu nationalism.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.140
[Guest]: But something that I did notice is that there's very little academic, genuine academic debate

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.960
[Guest]: on Hindu nationalism, you know, I mean, I did my PhD in Princeton, I just finished doing

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.480
[Guest]: teaching a semester at Princeton.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.440
[Guest]: So I'm quite familiar with global academia when it comes to India.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.120
[Guest]: And also, of course, Indian academia, when it comes to India, I teach at Ashoka University.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.080
[Guest]: And, you know, if you wanted a genuine debate on the BJP, genuinely, you'd be hard pressed

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.520
[Guest]: to find an ideologically diverse panel, academic panel, right?

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520
[Guest]: That's a problem.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.720
[Guest]: Because academia works best when you have peer pushback and peer review, right?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.520
[Guest]: When you have groupthink in academia, it's deadly, because there's no other way in which

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.080
[Guest]: academic truths are validated.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.080
[Guest]: It's not validated by the external world, by the number of books you sell by a third

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080
[Guest]: party.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.440
[Guest]: It's, you know, especially social science, humanities is inherently subjective.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.840
[Guest]: So what you hope keeps academic honest is peer review.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.560
[Guest]: And that just doesn't exist for Hindu nationalism, right?

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.760
[Guest]: And the debates on Hindu nationalism are minor, you know, is it fascist or is it on the way

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
[Guest]: to fascism?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
[Guest]: Right?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760
[Guest]: And that's a problem.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.240
[Guest]: And I worry and I and you know, this book was in some sense, an attempt to counter that

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.720
[Guest]: saying that, look, you know, it's dangerous when academics and intellectuals tend to have

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.000
[Guest]: just one narrative, right?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.360
[Guest]: And if you notice, the right wing keeps pushing back against academia saying this.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.000
[Guest]: And I think that it has more than a kernel of truth, of course, to what extent they use

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.280
[Guest]: the right wing uses this is very different, you know, and they use it often to stifle

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.720
[Guest]: debate rather than to say, let's have better debate, right?

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.120
[Guest]: But they are onto a kernel of something saying that, you know, you don't have ideological

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.220
[Guest]: heterogeneity on a very, very hot button question in India.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.480
[Guest]: On the other hand, on economics, you do and I'm happy about that.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.800
[Guest]: You know, if you wanted to have a panel on is liberalization good or bad, even though

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.000
[Guest]: there is broad political consensus that it's a good thing, you would have intellectual

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.320
[Guest]: disagreement and I'm even though I literally load a book saying that liberalization is

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320
[Guest]: a good thing.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.080
[Guest]: I'm happy that there are academics who are constantly pointing to flaws in the way India

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.200
[Guest]: did liberalization in 1991.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.280
[Guest]: And that makes for a healthy academic atmosphere.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I'm one of them who criticizes the 91 reforms, because I feel we didn't reform

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.600
[Amit Varma]: enough, right, which is, I think, one point of view, which would have been absent at the

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.120
[Amit Varma]: time, because I think the academic world would have been against them at the time, but I

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.680
[Amit Varma]: guess gradually it turned I mean, you get mugged by reality.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.040
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.400
[Amit Varma]: And I had a great episode in the 91 reforms with Shruti Rajgopalan and Ajay Shah, which

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.960
[Amit Varma]: I linked from the show notes.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And what you mentioned about poverty going down and inequality going up is a point I

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.560
[Amit Varma]: keep making, I mean, on the show and in columns that people confuse the two people often rage

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.600
[Amit Varma]: against inequality when actually is poverty that they mean, you know, a common question

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.880
[Amit Varma]: that I like to ask people on the subject is, in which of these two countries would you

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.680
[Amit Varma]: rather be poor, Bangladesh or the USA?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.440
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, everybody would rather be poor in the USA.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.160
[Amit Varma]: But the truth is, the USA has far more inequality than Bangladesh.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.200
[Amit Varma]: And now that Bangladesh is having healthier economic growth than before, hopefully that's

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.560
[Amit Varma]: changing and it would be changing in the direction of poverty going down and inequality going

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.240
[Amit Varma]: up because everybody is getting richer, but the rich are getting richer at a faster rate

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.400
[Amit Varma]: than the poor.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.080
[Amit Varma]: But what is important here is what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt calls a doctrine of sufficiency,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.580
[Amit Varma]: that do you have enough to live an autonomous life with a certain amount of dignity?

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And if you have that, that's what matters.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.360
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, when you are a nation that is as poor as India is, your first priority

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.080
[Amit Varma]: is always to kind of get rid of poverty.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.140
[Amit Varma]: So before we kind of get to your book on Narasimha Rao, which is so illuminating and fascinating

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:31.080
[Amit Varma]: and so resonant, even in modern times, I'd like to know a little bit more about you.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, typically, I do spend an hour, an hour and a half with my guests talking about the

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640
[Amit Varma]: past life.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.480
[Amit Varma]: So I had assumed that I must have done that with you the last time we spoke.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.480
[Amit Varma]: But even though that was, I think, three hours, 40 minutes, we didn't spend that much time

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.400
[Amit Varma]: you did speak a lot on writing your writing process, which I loved and many of my writing

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400
[Amit Varma]: students have loved.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.080
[Amit Varma]: I keep quoting you, you know what you said about perfection being the enemy of production,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.840
[Amit Varma]: which sinks in with what I believe about writing as well, that your priority should be to get

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.160
[Amit Varma]: it done and not to get it right.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.200
[Amit Varma]: And often just getting it done again and again is the way to get it right.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.740
[Amit Varma]: But we didn't speak about your childhood.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.100
[Amit Varma]: And I just found out today that you are a Bombay boy, and you were kind of born and

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.400
[Amit Varma]: brought up here and all of that.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that, you know, what was, how did you grow up?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.400
[Amit Varma]: What were your childhood years like?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.360
[Guest]: So I grew up in Bombay, my dad worked for Exim Bank, which is a PSU, public sector enterprise.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.280
[Guest]: And in 1991, he moved.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.600
[Guest]: And it was a dislocating period for us, if I look back at it, because, you know, when

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: you're in a public sector unit, and this is pre 1991, pre Narsimha Rao, you know, you

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.640
[Guest]: have a car, you have a driver, you live in an apartment, there's a certain sense of stability,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.640
[Guest]: right?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.080
[Guest]: And then he, you know, he tried to make it on his own and, you know, big bad world of,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.920
[Guest]: you know, the private sector.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.800
[Guest]: And I saw, you know, that change of 91 taking place in my family, right?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.560
[Guest]: What did that mean was opportunity, but it was much more, you know, winner takes all,

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.900
[Guest]: there was an element of insecurity, there was an element of risk.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.160
[Guest]: So I grew up with that.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.240
[Guest]: So in that sense, 91 shaped me.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.200
[Guest]: I spent much of my childhood in Bandra, right next to Leelavati Hospital, I don't know how

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.840
[Guest]: many of your listeners know that.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.920
[Guest]: But it was quite a fascinating part of Bandra and Bombay that I grew up in, I still remember

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.640
[Guest]: that I used to take this road from Bandra station, all the way back home to Bandra reclamation.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.760
[Guest]: And that one road told me much more about India than I learned, you know, at Princeton

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.120
[Guest]: or anywhere else.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.640
[Guest]: You begin that road in Bandra station, which is a cosmopolitan place, people of all castes

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.360
[Guest]: and communities and classes come there.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.080
[Guest]: And then you walk a little more and you know, you cross Lucky restaurant and as you enter,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.840
[Guest]: it's a Sunni Muslim part.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.560
[Guest]: So there are Indian Muslims, many of them are Sunni.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.560
[Guest]: And you know, you'll see butcher shops there, you know, these are lower middle class Muslims,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.960
[Guest]: you see many electronic stores, etc, etc.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.320
[Guest]: You just walk for a minute on the straight road and you'll see a Jain temple, right?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.760
[Guest]: And I'm just, you know, I used to turn back and I used to see meat shops and I used to

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.840
[Guest]: look in front and I used to see this Jain temple, right?

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.400
[Guest]: And then I used to see Jains basically crossing to go to the temple and they wouldn't look

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.620
[Guest]: left or right because otherwise they'd see meat.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.960
[Guest]: And you know what, there was coexistence, there was coexistence, right?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.240
[Guest]: And in 1991, during the, sorry, just before that, during the riots, the 1992, the Babri

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.320
[Guest]: Masjid riots, that road was not badly hit at all, right?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.200
[Guest]: Tells you that, you know, India has an ancient tradition of tolerance and coexistence.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.760
[Guest]: Anyway, you walk a little more on that road, you cross the Jain temple and it's a Marathi

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760
[Guest]: area.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760
[Guest]: There's a Marathi school there.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.400
[Guest]: A little more and you enter into the Bandra Bazaar, which is heavily Catholic.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.760
[Guest]: And you know, these are middle class Catholics, but they have permanent structures, permanent

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.080
[Guest]: buildings, right?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.840
[Guest]: And the thing that used to strike me is that unlike any other community, Hindu, Muslim,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.780
[Guest]: whatever caste, whatever region, the Catholic areas, the public space was clean, you know?

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.280
[Guest]: And so it wasn't just that, you know, that the house was clean and the kachra would fall

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280
[Guest]: on the street.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.760
[Guest]: The street itself was clean, right?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.780
[Guest]: And it has always stayed with me that, you know, sometimes, you know, there are certain

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.800
[Guest]: religious or intellectual traditions that make a public sphere more possible than others,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800
[Guest]: right?

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.880
[Guest]: And the way you treat strangers, you know, whether you're able to keep not just your

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.400
[Guest]: house clean, but the road in front of you clean is not just randomly distributed, right?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.360
[Guest]: And anyway, the Catholic area would end and then there would be a Bangladeshi slum, which

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.920
[Guest]: you would walk across.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:31.240
[Guest]: And then there would be a set of middle class Maharashtrian buildings where we lived and

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.200
[Guest]: around reclamation and many of the labor for those middle class Maharashtrian buildings

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.360
[Guest]: would come from the Bangladeshis, right, who lived in those slums.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.120
[Guest]: And it still struck me that the, you know, if I, again, you know, this is just anecdotal,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.560
[Guest]: I haven't done survey data, but most of the people who lived in those buildings would

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.880
[Guest]: be sympathetic to the Shiv Sena, right?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.440
[Guest]: And they live cheek by jowl with the other, right?

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.240
[Guest]: Bangladeshi Muslims who, you know, Baltakray would rail against.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240
[Guest]: But there was coexistence.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.560
[Guest]: I mean, I must have walked thousands of times on that street up and down to Bandra station

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.200
[Guest]: and reclamation and back.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.840
[Guest]: And I would, you know, at the time, I didn't like it, I was like, I wish I could take an

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.520
[Guest]: auto or a car to go to the station.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.840
[Guest]: But on hindsight, I think that journey taught me more than a lot of books I've read.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840
[Amit Varma]: That's so resonant.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you should write an essay about that walk, perhaps, I mean, there's so much in

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200
[Amit Varma]: What went wrong?

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, I once in an episode with JP Narayan, episode 149, which I link from

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.860
[Amit Varma]: the show notes, was on one of my usual rants about, hey, India is so illiberal and look

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.920
[Amit Varma]: at communalism, look at caste, look at gender.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And he said that if you look at it another way, if you look at the lived realities of

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.560
[Amit Varma]: people, there's also a deep liberalism here, because it is also so assimilative.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.360
[Amit Varma]: You look at our food, you look at our clothes, you look at the street that you just described,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.440
[Amit Varma]: It's in its lived reality, it can also be incredibly assimilative, and it would seem

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.520
[Amit Varma]: that the majority of people in the concrete live their lives that way.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So what went wrong?

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things that I felt while, you know, reading Akshay Mukul's book, which

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.160
[Amit Varma]: also we discussed when we last spoke, and I know you have some disagreements with it,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.080
[Amit Varma]: was that there was always this intolerant, illiberal strain, this bigoted strain, so

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.380
[Amit Varma]: to say, running through Indian society, it was always there, it was not a political creation.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.740
[Amit Varma]: And the politics that we see today is the supply side of the political marketplace responding

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.240
[Amit Varma]: to a demand that was already there, like I had an episode with Veer Sanghvi about his

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.680
[Amit Varma]: memoir, and in that he speaks about how Rajiv Gandhi's big win in 1984 was partly the Hindu

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.200
[Amit Varma]: vote turnout, because, you know, the anti-Sikh stuff and all of that.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.500
[Amit Varma]: And that was what made the BJP in a sense, shift direction from, you know, their sort

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.420
[Amit Varma]: of the socialism that they came to propound in 1980, Gandhian socialism, back to integral

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.780
[Amit Varma]: humanism, back to back to integral humanism and quoting this Hindu vote.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.660
[Amit Varma]: So it was supply responding to demand and then a race to the bottom from there.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.540
[Amit Varma]: So what's your take from your road which goes from station to reclamation and where all

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540
[Amit Varma]: of India lives?

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.540
[Guest]: How have we come here?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:12.020
[Guest]: Well, firstly, you know, the data backs up my analysis of that road.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.900
[Guest]: So if I would urge your readers to read the 2022 Pew survey on religions, which shows

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.700
[Guest]: you that most Indians live segregated lives in that, you know, their best friends, their

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.340
[Guest]: neighbors tend to be people who are from their religious group.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.140
[Guest]: But it's also a deeply tolerant life.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.140
[Guest]: So in India, segregation and tolerance go hand in hand and we will live among ourselves,

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:38.940
[Guest]: we will marry amongst ourselves, but you too will achieve liberation through your sect

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.180
[Guest]: or your religion and you have as much right to live here as I do, right.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.740
[Guest]: So in India, you know, it's really communities living cheek by jowl, they're not individuals

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:52.460
[Guest]: living, it's not Western style cosmopolitanism, it is groups living, but groups living side

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.580
[Guest]: by side and having some interactions like economic interactions, but not others.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.820
[Guest]: For example, eating food together or marrying together, right.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:06.100
[Guest]: The other way of saying this is that, you know, if you see this segregation as bigotry,

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.020
[Guest]: you will say the bigotry goes hand in hand in tolerance, right.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.300
[Guest]: That has always been the nature of India that, you know, that it's not that this has always

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.780
[Guest]: been spooked, there's been riots, you know, for a very long time, there's been Hindu Muslim

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:23.620
[Guest]: conflict wasn't invented by the British, right, as Marxist historians like to say, it's an

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:30.300
[Guest]: age-old issue, but that has gone hand in hand with Hindus and Muslims living together, right.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.380
[Guest]: And in the book, we'll talk about it, but in Narsimha Rao book around 1993, Narsimha

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:40.720
[Guest]: Rao was Prime Minister and then he, Samuel Huntingdon has written this article called

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.720
[Guest]: Clash of Civilizations, which then became a book Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.200
[Guest]: of the World Order in Foreign Affairs and Narsimha Rao has friends in the US who send

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.020
[Guest]: him the latest academic articles and he's reading it and in his archives, I found and

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.620
[Guest]: if you see in my book, I have a photo of Narsimha Rao's version of Clash of Civilizations with

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:05.220
[Guest]: his notes and the notes are very telling and these notes that Narsimha Rao writes on Clash

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.180
[Guest]: of Civilizations was written just a few months after the end of Babri Masjid, right, December

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.060
[Guest]: 6, 1992, just a few months after that.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:18.060
[Guest]: And also keep in mind that Narsimha Rao grew up in a part of India that had a very strong

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.060
[Guest]: Muslim influence.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.060
[Guest]: It was Nizam's Hyderabad state.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.220
[Guest]: Many of his childhood friends were Muslims, right and he writes there in the margin that

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:31.860
[Guest]: if Samuel Huntingdon is trying to explain why Islam is in conflict with other religions,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.420
[Guest]: why does he not explain the moments in which Islam is not in conflict?

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.780
[Guest]: In other words, you have a theory there, Sam Huntingdon provides a theory for why there

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:46.700
[Guest]: is a clash of civilizations from time immemorable between Islam and its neighbors, right and

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.300
[Guest]: he provides a theory for that based on the nature of Islam.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.940
[Guest]: But then you should also have a theory for when Islam coexists with its neighbors as

00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:00.060
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao says happened through his childhood, right and then you should equally say what

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:05.380
[Guest]: is it about Islam that allows you to live in coexistence with Islam, right and that

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.220
[Guest]: definitely when I was reading that, I was remembering my own childhood and walking up

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:17.880
[Guest]: and down this road for so long and this element of coexistence, but you know Amit, that experience

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:26.420
[Guest]: of walking down that road taught me very early to be suspicious of a cosmopolitan individual

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.220
[Guest]: right centric narrative of India.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.020
[Guest]: It just doesn't exist, right and given that I have some sense of where your economics

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:39.020
[Guest]: is headed, I think some of India's economic tragedies can also be put down to the fact

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.100
[Guest]: that we don't treat individuals with any dignity in this country.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.100
[Guest]: It's all about groups.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a fantastic insight and I'll think aloud and I'll just kind of ask you

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.380
[Amit Varma]: a question because it strikes me that when you live like this segregated but tolerant,

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.100
[Amit Varma]: right, where you have groups living side by side and not a cosmopolitan individualistic

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.100
[Guest]: kind of…

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.300
[Guest]: I'm sorry to interrupt you, you know, since you know, we both have our bones in Bombay,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.700
[Guest]: you know, if you live in Bombay, what everybody ends up talking about is real estate and look

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.180
[Guest]: at the politics of buildings in Bombay, Jain only buildings, no vegetarians allowed.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.700
[Guest]: So we are reproducing in the most visually cosmopolitan thing you can have which is an

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.500
[Guest]: apartment complex.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.180
[Guest]: We are reproducing old communities living together, you know, no garlic in this building,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.940
[Guest]: no onion in that building.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.980
[Guest]: This is not just a Muslim building, this is a Bora building only, this particular hospital

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.660
[Guest]: has been built by Boris only.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.700
[Guest]: We are reproducing exactly that, right?

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.880
[Amit Varma]: You have a ton of individual choices which individuals have the right to make leading

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.140
[Amit Varma]: to what is a bad collective outcome, a bad social outcome.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.620
[Amit Varma]: So my musing is this and I'm strictly thinking aloud based on what you just said that consider

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.700
[Amit Varma]: two scenarios and one scenario is that you live as we do where you have people living

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.940
[Amit Varma]: in groups segregated but tolerant and they're living in peace like in that lane you mentioned

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:08.900
[Amit Varma]: and as in India for you know, most of our history in most places and in the other scenario

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.500
[Amit Varma]: you have a cosmopolitan atomized existence individuals living in flats and apartments

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.620
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.780
[Amit Varma]: My sense is that the first situation where you think in terms of groups is likely to

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.300
[Amit Varma]: break down at some point or the other simply because what you are really doing by living

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.140
[Amit Varma]: in groups is saying that this is my in group and those are the other and at one point you

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:35.060
[Amit Varma]: say I will be tolerant to the other but wherever you are hit by say extreme scarcity or all

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.900
[Amit Varma]: kind you know, there can be other triggers you can hit the other as well whereas if you're

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:45.140
[Amit Varma]: living an individual atomized existence that kind of hatred against a particular group

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.940
[Amit Varma]: of people is less likely.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.620
[Amit Varma]: So in the second scenario where your cosmopolitan and individual rights matter, you'll have

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.780
[Amit Varma]: serial killers, perhaps those are the outliers, but in the first scenario, you could have

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.380
[Amit Varma]: a genocide at some point or the other.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.460
[Amit Varma]: In fact, given a large enough sample size, it's inevitable.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.020
[Guest]: Well, let me push back against that, you know, and I'm happy you said this because I was

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.500
[Guest]: you know, with you Amit, I'm worried will we ever have even four hours if we chat will

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.500
[Guest]: we have a disagreement.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:15.420
[Guest]: So I'm happy that you said this because I would push back to say that to defend India's

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.260
[Guest]: segregation but tolerance, right to defend it.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.420
[Guest]: Firstly, it's all we have, right.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.100
[Guest]: So as a reality, you know, if you are thinking about changing India, you got to work with

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.580
[Guest]: the India you have.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.020
[Amit Varma]: So we don't we're not living in Switzerland.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.540
[Amit Varma]: I meant in terms of a thought experiment, I completely agree that me certainly I don't

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.540
[Amit Varma]: know about you.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm a complete misfit in this society.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.580
[Amit Varma]: Because I think in terms of individuals, I refuse to put labels on someone and say, oh,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, that person is this caste or this religion or whatever.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.780
[Amit Varma]: And I reject all those labels when applied to me as well, you know, so even if I'm born

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.080
[Amit Varma]: a Hindu, I'm an atheist, you know, I'm not going to accept any labels.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.340
[Amit Varma]: Even a label of atheists, you know, you, you know, I'm who I am.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.420
[Amit Varma]: And so but I completely recognize that in our society, our society is always pretty

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.620
[Amit Varma]: much destined for the foreseeable future to be group.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:09.460
[Guest]: I think the best we can hope for Amit is that in the short term, we make a distinction between

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.420
[Guest]: the public and the private lives of Indians.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.320
[Guest]: And we say, look, in a private life, you marry who you want.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.700
[Guest]: If that means you marry somebody from your caste or your religion, that's your choice.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.460
[Guest]: If you want to have lunch or dinner with people only, you know, commensuality, right, that's

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.980
[Guest]: the origin of jati, whatever, not origin, a key feature of jati, you eat, inter dining,

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.480
[Guest]: you don't want to do inter dining, you want to eat only your kind of food, your particularities,

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.900
[Guest]: you have every right.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.540
[Guest]: But there is this thing called public sphere, it means voting, it means employment, right?

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.660
[Guest]: It means behavior of strangers in the street, right?

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.800
[Guest]: In those things, you have to behave like an individual, right?

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.060
[Guest]: So the best I think we can push for, right, is to say that there is this private life

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.060
[Guest]: and private sphere.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.900
[Guest]: And if you want to be comfortable living a group life, go ahead.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.220
[Guest]: But insofar as we have these public spheres and public lives, please don't think about

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.180
[Guest]: your caste, your religion, because you're all in it together.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.740
[Guest]: Because just the nature of the group is all 1.4 billion Indians, right?

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.860
[Guest]: I would say that's a more achievable equilibrium than a Swiss society where everybody thinks

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.580
[Guest]: as individuals in India, which, you know, I just don't see, at least in our lifetimes,

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.340
[Guest]: that realistically happening, right?

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.980
[Guest]: And one thing we've seen with, you know, the old modernization theory was that with industrialization,

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:33.620
[Guest]: right, with the move from farm to factory, groups would kind of atomize and you'd move

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.580
[Guest]: from rural group based societies to individual urban societies.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.320
[Guest]: You just haven't seen that, right?

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.100
[Guest]: And in that sense, Indian modernization looks more and more like Japanese modernization,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:51.740
[Guest]: where you're able to both keep old traditions as well as reinvent new traditions of groups,

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.620
[Guest]: rather than move towards what the United States or Europe looks like, though, even there,

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.020
[Guest]: as we see now, group dynamics are playing a very big role.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.020
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.220
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I'm glad you mentioned the word atomization, because people often use

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.700
[Amit Varma]: that to beat up on a straw man version of libertarianism, where they say, oh, you see

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.620
[Amit Varma]: the world as atomized individuals, all our connections will be lost and blah, blah, blah.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.780
[Amit Varma]: And my response to that is no, you know, the world that I see is based on a respect of

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.380
[Amit Varma]: consent and voluntary action, you know, I see myself as an individual, but I'm, I'm

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.620
[Amit Varma]: a part of different communities of choice, I keep trying to reach out from different

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.820
[Amit Varma]: kinds of bonds.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.780
[Amit Varma]: So that whole term atomization at some level, goes to that straw man argument, which people

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.860
[Amit Varma]: often kind of throw.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:41.620
[Amit Varma]: But that was a delightful sort of diversion you took into that street from Bandra station

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.620
[Guest]: to Bandra reclamation.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.900
[Guest]: I'll take I'll take you down that I'll take I mean, let's walk so and you'll see what

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:48.900
[Amit Varma]: Done, done.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.940
[Amit Varma]: See, I mean, if this was on YouTube, the next shot would be we are in that lane.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.860
[Amit Varma]: So tell me more about your childhood.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.140
[Amit Varma]: So you know, where are you going to school?

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.340
[Amit Varma]: What's your vision of yourself at this point?

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.420
[Amit Varma]: What are the what do you read?

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.420
[Amit Varma]: What do you listen to?

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.980
[Amit Varma]: What is the sense of the texture of your days?

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.100
[Guest]: So you know, I used to go to school place to my 10th standard a school called Arya Vidya

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.100
[Guest]: Mandir Bandra.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:15.060
[Guest]: That's where I spent seven to eight years of my life.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.140
[Guest]: And you know, the joke, we went when my Narasimha Rao book came back, the joke I used to say

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.860
[Guest]: was, look, I went to a school where everybody knew Mahesh Bhatt's third or second wife,

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.300
[Guest]: nobody had heard of Narasimha Rao.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.580
[Guest]: And I remember saying this at, you know, one particular event.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.900
[Guest]: And the person who spoke after me was Vikram Bhatt, you know, who is, again, if my memory

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.340
[Guest]: serves Mahesh Bhatt's younger brother.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.020
[Guest]: And he, you know, he began by saying, you know what, I have to be honest with you.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.900
[Guest]: I didn't know who Narasimha Rao was, but I sure knew Mahesh Bhatt's second wife, you know.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.940
[Guest]: So that was the school I went to, right.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.860
[Guest]: It was a school in, you know, where it was an Arya Samaj school.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:57.660
[Guest]: So we had a disproportionate number of Hindus, mainly Sindhis and Punjabis, you know, ex-refugees

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:03.620
[Guest]: or from ex-refugee families, who'd kind of made it, you know, in Khar, Bandra area, Santa

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.180
[Guest]: Cruz, those areas.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:10.300
[Guest]: And we had a high proportion of Parsis because, you know, Arya Samaj worships fire.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.100
[Guest]: And you know, Parsis said, okay, we also are happy worshipping fire.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.020
[Guest]: So we had a disproportionate number of Parsis, right.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.380
[Guest]: And it was an interesting school because, you know, my parents came from a professional

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.380
[Guest]: background.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.060
[Guest]: My mother taught at Bombay University, she taught sociology.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.940
[Guest]: And my dad was an IIT engineer, and he had his own consultancy, he had gone private.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:33.340
[Guest]: But you know, most of my students came from business backgrounds, right?

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.620
[Guest]: Most of my fellow students.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.940
[Guest]: So for example, around Bandra station, again, those of you are familiar with Bandra, you

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:46.620
[Guest]: have a series of jewellery shops, you know, where Hill Road meets Bandra station.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.260
[Guest]: Lots of my classmates, you know, were scions of those jewellery shops, you know.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.940
[Guest]: So it was a radically different world from those who come from a professional background,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:01.180
[Guest]: you know, and it gave me a very, an instinct that look, I like to read books, but I'm very

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:06.060
[Guest]: familiar with the fact that other people don't read books, you know, and I like that diversity,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:10.940
[Guest]: you know, that I don't want to only seek out people like me who, you know, who like books

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:16.060
[Guest]: and who, you know, who quote and, you know, like whatever, you know, the life of the mind.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.860
[Guest]: Many people are not like that and all power to them, right?

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:24.340
[Guest]: And you know, what does it look like to grow up to inherit your father's jewellery business,

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340
[Guest]: you know?

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.340
[Guest]: What does it look like to grow up to inherit your father's Skoda business, Skoda car dealership

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.740
[Guest]: in Sakinaka?

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.140
[Guest]: So I had a pretty strong instinct for that, you know, and in that sense, I'm pretty happy

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.340
[Guest]: I didn't go to Delhi and, you know, a certain world in Delhi where, you know, I'd only be

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.940
[Guest]: hanging out with people like me.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.360
[Guest]: I think this has given me a good instinct for people who are different.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.780
[Guest]: Of course, you know, the class background was not heterogeneous, you know, people were

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:55.460
[Guest]: broadly wealthy and certainly most people were wealthier than my parents were.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.340
[Guest]: But it, you know, it was certainly an interesting Khar, Bandra, you know, background, you know,

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.480
[Guest]: for example, the school, we used to go swimming as a school every week to Khar gym, right?

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.940
[Guest]: And I used to joke that Khar gym is the only place in the world where in the bar Sindhi

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.740
[Guest]: is the lingua franca, right?

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.980
[Guest]: That's, you know, Sindhi is the language that is spoken.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.660
[Guest]: So it's a very different kind of deal.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.900
[Guest]: And then after my 11th and 12th, I think my parents thought I was getting out of hand.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.700
[Guest]: And I went to Rishi Valley school, which is a Jindu Krishnamoorthi school.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:32.600
[Guest]: I mean, the stereotype of the school is, you know, you sit in on classes under a tree.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.240
[Guest]: And I think that that stereotype says a lot about the school, two of the happiest years

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240
[Guest]: of my life.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.820
[Guest]: I'm very happy that I didn't go there throughout, because if I'd gone there throughout, I wouldn't

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.440
[Guest]: know how to cross a road with traffic, you know, because it's a it's a rural school,

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:53.940
[Guest]: you live, you know, in a, you know, in a pretty sort of, you know, inside baseball community.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.520
[Guest]: And then I went to National Law School, Bangalore for five years.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.460
[Guest]: So I, you know, I studied law.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.460
[Guest]: And after that, you know, I found a lot of my students, a lot of my fellow students in

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.660
[Guest]: National Law School Bangalore were going to these fancy American universities, for what

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:13.220
[Guest]: we call an LLM or a master's in law, and places like Harvard, Yale, which was be out of reach

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.860
[Guest]: if I was even going to IIT.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.300
[Guest]: And I just I applied because I thought it would be a good sixth year.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.760
[Guest]: So I went to Harvard Law School, I spent one year and I think at that time, I had an epiphany

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.860
[Guest]: a myth, which is that if after going to Harvard Law School, I can't do what I love, then who

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.460
[Guest]: can do what they love, right?

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.100
[Guest]: And suddenly, all that pressure, everything mounted, right?

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.100
[Guest]: But who am I kidding, right?

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:40.020
[Guest]: If you know, after Harvard Law School, if I do something conventionally foolish, people

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.060
[Guest]: think I'm eccentric, not crazy.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.100
[Guest]: And there's a world of a difference between both those those words, right?

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.300
[Guest]: Eccentric people are, you know, people with options who choose to do funny things.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.700
[Guest]: Crazy people are just crazy, right?

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.560
[Guest]: And I asked myself a simple question saying, what do I like doing on weekends, right?

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.380
[Guest]: And I liked, you know, I used to follow Indian politics, I written a couple of peaches pieces

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.740
[Guest]: for Times of India and Hindu and just crafting writing and crafting the narrative on politics

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.720
[Guest]: is something that I found fun.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.580
[Guest]: And I said, Look, this is what I clearly like doing when nobody's forcing me to do anything

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.580
[Guest]: else.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.460
[Guest]: Let's see if I can make a career out of that.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:19.900
[Guest]: And at that stage, I was quite keen to do a PhD in political science, I thought I would

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.220
[Guest]: get into Harvard, I didn't eventually, but I decided to take a bit of a break because

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.960
[Guest]: I didn't want to go degree from degree.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.420
[Guest]: So I came back to India and work for some years with Indian Express, again, fascinating

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.980
[Guest]: time in Delhi, I was on the editorial pages.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.820
[Guest]: So I was a sub editor, doing you know, cleaning copy, but I was also writing edits, and I

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.220
[Guest]: will occasionally do reporting pieces.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.660
[Guest]: And that's when my I would say my love for journalists, right?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:49.500
[Guest]: And you know, people who really are in the trenches, especially reporters, because the

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.260
[Guest]: thing with reporters is that, you know, you may spend a full day, right?

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.820
[Guest]: Seeing a story that only takes up 100 words, right?

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:02.620
[Guest]: But other than the 100 words, that entire experience you've had is within you.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:07.460
[Guest]: And so when I used to meet older journalists, the euphemism, we use a senior journalist,

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.460
[Guest]: I would find that them to be rich with anecdotes rich with experiences.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.140
[Guest]: I was also very lucky to meet Shekhar Gupta at that time, who has, you know, definitely

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.540
[Guest]: become a bit of a mentor, he may not know it, but, you know, at least from my end, because

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:26.220
[Guest]: I mean, many of your readers may see his cut the clutter, your viewers may see his cut

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.860
[Guest]: the clutter.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.060
[Guest]: That's how he was to us that he would just walk to the journalist, and then he would

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.340
[Guest]: narrate incident after incident.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:38.660
[Guest]: And that's when I learned the power of being able to talk about politics through a story,

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.660
[Guest]: right?

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.700
[Guest]: And an emphasis on contemporary history.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.300
[Guest]: So I think I owe him a lot.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.300
[Guest]: I also, you know, was very grateful to get to know Raj Kamal Jha, who's also a very well

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.900
[Guest]: known author.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:56.300
[Guest]: But he brought a certain aesthetic and discipline to writing that I've learned a lot from.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.380
[Guest]: And you know, again, maybe I'm just ranting here Amit, but you know, my time in Delhi

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.900
[Guest]: is a bit of Alice in Wonderland, right?

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.980
[Guest]: And I completely agree with the criticism of Lutyens Delhi that there are a bunch of

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.980
[Guest]: privileged, you know, ex ISO officers kids, right?

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.260
[Guest]: That's a correct, I mean, like all stereotypes, of course, there are many people not like

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.260
[Guest]: that.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.340
[Guest]: But that stereotype, the Arnab stereotype has a kernel of truth to it, right?

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.300
[Guest]: And amidst that people like Shekhar Gupta and Raj Kamal Jha who are genuinely talented,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300
[Guest]: right?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.700
[Guest]: It's very rare to find and when I found them, I was like, I used to stick to them, right?

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.780
[Guest]: And that's the one thing I learned that it's important to pick your mentors, right?

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.540
[Guest]: And Raj just the aesthetics of writing Raj told me never use the word I when you write

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.140
[Guest]: because very powerful.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.100
[Guest]: So use it sparingly only when that I is going the word I is going to make a difference.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.180
[Guest]: I follow that in both my books, no I, right?

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.620
[Guest]: This third person because you know what, I'm a boring person here, because you're asking

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.780
[Guest]: me I'm telling you about the street, etc, etc.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.920
[Guest]: But quite honestly, I came here prepared to talk about Narsimha Rao, not myself.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.740
[Guest]: Because frankly, the subject is much more important than you are.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:07.140
[Guest]: And yeah, and after that, I spent six years in Princeton, doing a PhD in political science,

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.580
[Guest]: I learned how to write a book, a book length project, I learned how to research.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:17.000
[Guest]: It was fascinating, but I was always very sure I wanted to come back to India.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.820
[Guest]: And I would have come back to frankly, Indian Express and journalism, at least that's what

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.040
[Guest]: I told them.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.660
[Guest]: But luckily, you know, this Ashoka University was opening up.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.500
[Guest]: And now that I'm there, I don't want to be anywhere else.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.140
[Guest]: I mean, I get five months a year off to do my own research.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.480
[Guest]: It's an unbeatable proposition.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.860
[Amit Varma]: So you know, many strands I want to follow.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:41.140
[Amit Varma]: But before all of them, you know, you mentioned being in that school surrounded by kids or

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:45.120
[Amit Varma]: business people and filmy people who know the parts more than Narsimha Rao.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.820
[Guest]: One of the buts was close to my age group.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.820
[Guest]: There you go.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.820
[Amit Varma]: Pooja's brother.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.820
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.820
[Guest]: Okay.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.820
[Amit Varma]: Rahul Bhatt.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.820
[Amit Varma]: The friend of Headley.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.820
[Amit Varma]: Rahul.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.820
[Guest]: He was my physical trainer at a gym I went to for a brief while.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.820
[Guest]: That's right.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.460
[Guest]: He was also David Headley's physical trainer.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.460
[Amit Varma]: That's how they got to know each other.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460
[Guest]: So that's what David Headley and I have in common.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.940
[Amit Varma]: Though I have to clarify, I never knew David Headley.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:11.500
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, I think circa 2001-2002, I used to go to the gym in Marine Drive where Rahul

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.740
[Amit Varma]: was my trainer.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.580
[Amit Varma]: So I just finished reading this fascinating book that I'd recommend to all my listeners

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.700
[Amit Varma]: called Wanting by Luke Burgess.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.700
[Amit Varma]: Abhijit Bhaduri had recommended it to me in the episode we did together and I picked it

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.700
[Amit Varma]: up subsequently.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.780
[Amit Varma]: And it's a superb book.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:31.940
[Amit Varma]: And the central thesis of the book is that most of what we want is not some inner desire.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.220
[Amit Varma]: It is imitative.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.460
[Amit Varma]: It is mimetic, in a sense, we look at what the people around us want.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.420
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, we adopt their desires to become our desires.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.860
[Amit Varma]: Burgess's sort of realization was based on like this line of thinking about wanting and

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.160
[Amit Varma]: desire came from a philosopher called Rene Girard.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.580
[Amit Varma]: And Rene Girard, I think a few decades ago, was asked to teach a class on literature.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.860
[Amit Varma]: And he wasn't a literature guy, but he agreed to teach the class because he needed the money.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:05.260
[Amit Varma]: And then as he read all these books, he found in them a thread that had not that he that,

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, other people who taught literature hadn't spoken about, which was basically that

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.040
[Amit Varma]: in all these novels and books and all that he read, all the characters seem to want something

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.320
[Amit Varma]: not intrinsically, but because some someone around them wanted it or they were expected

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.820
[Amit Varma]: to want it, and so on and so forth.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.900
[Amit Varma]: And that's where the great tragedies took place.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.980
[Amit Varma]: And the concept I was left with from Burgess's book was one about reflecting why we want

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:33.820
[Amit Varma]: what we want, and two about the distinction between thick desires and thin desires, right?

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:39.080
[Amit Varma]: And thin desires being sort of relatively superficial desires, which may be really intense,

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.060
[Amit Varma]: but which are which you've still picked up from somewhere else, and they're not intrinsic

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.700
[Amit Varma]: to you that, oh, I want a Mercedes C class, or I want this or I want that I want to go

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.900
[Amit Varma]: on a holiday there, and so on and so forth.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.100
[Amit Varma]: And you think you want that, but you probably want that because of a bunch of other factors.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.460
[Amit Varma]: And intrinsically, you don't really want that and thick desires, on the other hand, would

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.460
[Amit Varma]: be what you intrinsically want.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.460
[Amit Varma]: That's who you really are.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.380
[Amit Varma]: And I found this a very good frame to just examine my own life and my own choices and

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.780
[Amit Varma]: think about the things that I wanted, and why did I want that, like I was reading this

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.060
[Amit Varma]: book sort of on vacation, this is a bit of a digression, but there is a sport called

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.660
[Amit Varma]: match poker, not quite like poker, but something like it.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And I won the national championship there with my team a couple of times, I was part

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.020
[Amit Varma]: of Team India, we went and we won the Asian championship.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.940
[Amit Varma]: And then recently, last month, we went to the World Championship, where all the teams

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.940
[Amit Varma]: that we had thrashed in the Asian championship finished ahead of us.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.500
[Amit Varma]: It was pretty devastating for various reasons, like regular team members had visas rejected

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.240
[Amit Varma]: and all kinds of shit happened.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And I was while reading this book thinking about okay, why was I so upset?

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.460
[Amit Varma]: And that you know, the reason like the first reason I got drawn to that particular form

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.220
[Amit Varma]: of poker as it were, is because it was so different from poker that you had to work

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.460
[Amit Varma]: it out from first principles and there was an intellectual challenge.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.600
[Amit Varma]: So the intellectual challenge drew me in.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.060
[Amit Varma]: But most of the devastation that I felt was because I wanted the glory of winning a World

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.860
[Amit Varma]: Championship with Team India, even though I've already won an Asian championship with

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:07.860
[Amit Varma]: them, right?

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.860
[Amit Varma]: And why did I want that?

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.500
[Amit Varma]: Is it something so intrinsic?

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:16.340
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's part of most of our desire for validation is completely unnecessary and

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340
[Guest]: pointless.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.340
[Guest]: And most of them are thin not thick.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, most of them are thin not thick.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.460
[Amit Varma]: And this was a thin desire.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.140
[Amit Varma]: And I have thicker desires.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.620
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that you avoided a trap here.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.380
[Amit Varma]: Because when you went to that school, it is quite possible that you could have, you know,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.460
[Amit Varma]: picked up desires or things that you wanted to do, which were thin desires from the people

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.020
[Amit Varma]: around you from the milieu around you.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.060
[Amit Varma]: And you know, even when you did law, perhaps you go down certain paths, because they are

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.060
[Amit Varma]: great parts.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.060
[Amit Varma]: Everybody wants them.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Howard Law School, like who would turn that down.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.340
[Amit Varma]: But luckily, you said you had that epiphany.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.580
[Amit Varma]: And I'm presuming that what happened next, that process of seeking truth by doing the

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.500
[Amit Varma]: reporter's job by engaging with the world and everything that you've been doing.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.780
[Amit Varma]: That's a thick desire.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:03.460
[Amit Varma]: So if you sort of reflect on this journey of yours, you know, but does any of this make

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.460
[Amit Varma]: sense?

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.460
[Amit Varma]: Were there thin desires before you found?

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.500
[Guest]: It makes a lot of sense.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.460
[Guest]: Of course, there were thin, makes a lot of sense.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.580
[Guest]: That is very clarifying, Amit.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.300
[Guest]: So definitely there are thin desires.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.260
[Guest]: Of course, the problem with thin desires is you realize them too late, right?

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.820
[Guest]: That you think they are thick desires, right?

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.780
[Guest]: You think that there's something intrinsic and later you said, no, this is not what I

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.420
[Guest]: really wanted, or I was I was influenced.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.940
[Guest]: So you know, so I definitely see that.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:34.140
[Guest]: But I think that at Howard Law School was an epiphany in that it told me that I didn't

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:39.300
[Guest]: have to play the thin desire game, you know, that, you know, I should ask myself, what's

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.300
[Guest]: the thick desire?

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.540
[Guest]: And to me, the thick desire is what you do on weekends, you know, and is there a way

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.540
[Guest]: to monetize that?

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.540
[Guest]: I mean, look, I'm not crazy.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.380
[Guest]: I mean, you know, I, you know, I have to make my own way in the world and I have to, you

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.420
[Guest]: know, pay for myself.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.860
[Guest]: So, you know, what can I do, which is, which links my thick desire, what I like to do on

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.580
[Guest]: Saturday, Sunday, into, you know, being able to provide a, you know, a good livelihood

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.740
[Guest]: for myself and my family, right?

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:08.740
[Guest]: That you know, but so I think that gave me the epiphany until then, I definitely back

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:13.300
[Guest]: of the mind, I have this thing that, you know, I have to, you know, I have to succeed in

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.900
[Guest]: the way society defines success.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.100
[Guest]: And after studying in National Law School, Bangalore and Howard Law School, that way

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:24.220
[Guest]: was actually pretty simple, which was to get a corporate law job and work on Wall Street.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.180
[Guest]: There was actually various and I did interview for some of them.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.800
[Guest]: But I had a second epiphany while at Harvard Law School, I took this course called it was

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.100
[Guest]: I think Introduction to Corporate Law, or 101 Corporate Law by this professor called

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.740
[Guest]: Guhan Subramaniam, who was a joint appointment between Harvard Business School and Harvard

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.740
[Guest]: Law School.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:42.740
[Guest]: And he was superb.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.540
[Guest]: He was absolutely brilliant.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.740
[Guest]: And I worked my ass off and I still got I think a B or a B plus.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:53.660
[Guest]: And I think that was another epiphany because it told me that corporate law was not meant

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.900
[Guest]: for me that, you know, if I have the best teacher in the world, and I work really hard,

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.500
[Guest]: I'm still not good at it.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.700
[Guest]: So why should I waste a career doing that?

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.820
[Guest]: You know, I think that and by the way, I, you know, a lot of my students who I teach

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.980
[Guest]: and who I give a B or a B minus, I tell this story to saying that, look, it's a signal,

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.660
[Guest]: it means that if you didn't work hard, it's a signal to work hard.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.260
[Guest]: If you worked hard, it means that perhaps this kind of course is not meant for you.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.220
[Guest]: And that's a good thing, because there are a million courses out there, the million things

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.220
[Guest]: you can do, right.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.140
[Guest]: So actually knowing what you're not good at is a good thing.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.140
[Guest]: So yeah, so I think that but thanks for clarifying that Amit, you put it better than I could.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.780
[Amit Varma]: Luke Burgess put it better than either of us could, I guess.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.340
[Amit Varma]: No, and I was thinking of the same thing when I read your book on Narasimha Rao and we'll

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.620
[Amit Varma]: talk about the book in detail later.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.940
[Amit Varma]: But this strand about what do you want and why do you want it also struck me because

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.180
[Amit Varma]: in many ways, it seems to me that Narasimha Rao was a puppet of circumstance, you know,

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.620
[Amit Varma]: getting married at the age of 10.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.260
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've written here, quote, Rao would later describe his arranged marriage

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.740
[Amit Varma]: as an act beyond his control as so much of his later life would be.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.980
[Amit Varma]: He was, quote, within quotes, disappointed, but not shocked.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.540
[Amit Varma]: His inner self remained unaffected, stop quote.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:10.600
[Amit Varma]: And later you talk about how he became and how, you know, there was a pull to academics.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.700
[Amit Varma]: And he had once said that had he not been a politician, he would have been an academic

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.300
[Amit Varma]: in Oxford or Cambridge.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:21.380
[Amit Varma]: At another point, you write about choosing politics, where you write, quote, his choice

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:27.180
[Amit Varma]: of a career in politics was not an affirmation, merely the preclusion of other alternatives.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.540
[Amit Varma]: In other words, he was a hopeless midfield, but a mundane existence would have driven

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.900
[Amit Varma]: him mad, stop quote, which is again resonant.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:37.780
[Amit Varma]: And so you look at Rao's life, and he's a product of circumstance and serendipity in

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:42.700
[Amit Varma]: so many ways, rising in power as a compromise candidate, because he hadn't chosen a tribe,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.380
[Amit Varma]: for example, you know, whether it's his becoming chief minister or later prime minister and

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.620
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:53.220
[Amit Varma]: But at a deeper level on the subject of wanting, it kind of made me think that there is an

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.220
[Amit Varma]: inner mystery there.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:58.260
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps what he wanted was the life of scholarship, of reading and writing.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.540
[Amit Varma]: And of course, he did write that semi autobiographical novel.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.580
[Amit Varma]: And you know, he was trying to write it in the 70s.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:09.260
[Amit Varma]: But politics called him back when, you know, Indira Gandhi got him to Delhi as a general

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.260
[Amit Varma]: secretary.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.500
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and one thing that is fairly obvious and almost a banal observation as

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:18.140
[Amit Varma]: we are, of course, all creatures of circumstance, you know, whether it's a circumstance of the

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.660
[Amit Varma]: genes we happen to have all the things that happened to us, that's right.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:27.740
[Amit Varma]: But in terms of wanting is our wanting what we want also, perhaps, a matter of circumstance

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.940
[Amit Varma]: like the other thing that you point out with Narsimha Rao was that he did want political

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:38.620
[Amit Varma]: power that he did in a way, pull strings and maneuver and try to, you know, lie and bribe

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.220
[Amit Varma]: all of that, you know, to become prime minister when he did to become president in 82 when,

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:47.340
[Amit Varma]: you know, Zia-ul-Singh was chosen instead, and again later when Venkatraman was chosen

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.340
[Amit Varma]: instead.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.780
[Amit Varma]: So he did want that power, even though he was, in a sense, an accidental politician.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:59.540
[Amit Varma]: So just I think one way of looking at lives and reading lives is also as a web of desires

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.700
[Amit Varma]: and trying to figure out where they come from and what they do to you.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.100
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud, this is a bit of a ramble, but what are your thoughts?

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.860
[Guest]: No, I think that's, you know, that's quite illuminating.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:14.580
[Guest]: I hope, by the way, you didn't structure just to say that my musings are equivalent to Narsimha

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:21.780
[Guest]: Rao's musings as he grows up, you know, because I certainly haven't thought of it that way.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.700
[Guest]: The way I thought of Narsimha Rao is as follows, you know, I mean, an uncle of mine who has

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:32.060
[Guest]: had a huge influence on my life has always tells me this, which is that God gives you

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.740
[Guest]: a certain set of cards, right?

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.300
[Guest]: Some of them are aces, some of them are not.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:41.100
[Guest]: The question is how well you play those cards and as a poker player that, you know, must

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.980
[Guest]: resonate with you, right?

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:49.580
[Guest]: I think Narsimha Rao had a very early epiphany that he can't control the cards dealt to him,

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.580
[Guest]: right?

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.580
[Guest]: He's married at the age of 10.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.740
[Guest]: He's married at the age of 10, right?

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.820
[Guest]: You know, his family around him is illiterate, semi-literate.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.980
[Guest]: The family around him is semi-illiterate, right?

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:03.100
[Guest]: What he can control is what he can do with those cards, right?

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.820
[Guest]: So yes, the family around him is semi-literate, but he's a precocious student.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.180
[Guest]: He loves learning.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:12.500
[Guest]: So his father sees that and sends him to a school in a different village, even if it

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.700
[Guest]: means that Narsimha Rao is cut off from the rest of his family, right?

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.740
[Guest]: And by the way, this is a learning that is hugely helpful to him when he becomes prime

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.740
[Guest]: minister.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.420
[Guest]: You know, look at the cards that are dealt to him, right?

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:29.340
[Guest]: One is India is facing the biggest economic crisis, you know, it has ever faced arguably,

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.340
[Guest]: right?

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:35.340
[Guest]: The Berlin Wall has collapsed, so India's best friend in the global stage, Soviet Union

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.660
[Guest]: is kind of withdrawing, right?

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:42.380
[Guest]: India has secession issues in Assam, Kashmir and Punjab.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.540
[Guest]: In fact, I think in Kashmir and Punjab, if my memory serves, elections couldn't even

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:49.460
[Guest]: be held when Narsimha Rao became prime minister, right?

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:54.180
[Guest]: And his Congress predecessor has been murdered by the LTT, that's Rajiv Gandhi.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.380
[Guest]: These are the cards that he's been dealt with, right?

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.860
[Guest]: And look at the other set of cards dealt with him, right?

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:07.300
[Guest]: He is not popular in his own party, his party is not a majority in Parliament, right?

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.060
[Guest]: He lacks individual charisma, God has not given him charisma, and he has to in some

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.140
[Guest]: sense report to Sonia Gandhi.

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.900
[Guest]: These are the cards dealt to him, right?

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.420
[Guest]: The question is, how do you play it?

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:23.540
[Guest]: And the argument of the book is he played it better than anyone could have played it

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.500
[Guest]: in those five years, right?

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:30.260
[Guest]: So I think that realization he has from a very early age that there are tons and tons

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.140
[Guest]: of things outside his control.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.020
[Guest]: And he's not, you know, he's not going to die on that hill.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.700
[Guest]: He's not going to complain, God, why did you do this to me?

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.100
[Guest]: He's not going to do that.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.140
[Guest]: Given the situation, he's going to make the best of the cards that have been given

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.140
[Guest]: to him.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.060
[Guest]: And I think that's an early childhood realization that Narsimha Rao inherits.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:53.180
[Guest]: And I would argue that that's his core skill set, to know when to lose, to know when to

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.140
[Guest]: win and to know when to cheat, you know.

00:56:56.140 --> 00:57:00.940
[Amit Varma]: And there's also sort of a poignancy to the metaphor you made with poker and the cards

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.940
[Amit Varma]: you're dealt.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:07.020
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, in poker, what happens is that, you know, that even though it's a

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.180
[Amit Varma]: game of skill, luck plays a huge part.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.820
[Amit Varma]: The quantum of luck is much more than in other sports, you know, I play 100 points of tennis

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.100
[Amit Varma]: with Nadal, I will lose all 100.

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.580
[Amit Varma]: But if, you know, you take the best poker player in the world, and he plays a newcomer

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.420
[Amit Varma]: who just knows the rules, it's going to be more like 52-48.

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.820
[Amit Varma]: So what you need for skill to express itself is volume.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:30.500
[Amit Varma]: So you don't play one hand, you play hundreds and thousands and really a decent sample size

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.740
[Amit Varma]: in poker would perhaps be 100,000 or more.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.740
[Guest]: That's interesting.

00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:34.740
[Guest]: I didn't think of that.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.820
[Amit Varma]: And in life, you don't have that.

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.980
[Amit Varma]: You don't have a sample size in life, you can't put in volume.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.780
[Amit Varma]: As the phrase goes, you get that one hand, you do with it what you can.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.420
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting through the course of the book to see how that worked out, how that

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.940
[Amit Varma]: worked out with his marriage, where they did stay together in a way for 40 years, have

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:56.420
[Amit Varma]: kids and all of that, but also had independent lives outside of that, or rather he did she'd,

00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:00.420
[Amit Varma]: you know, couldn't so much because just the privilege of being male, I guess.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.820
[Amit Varma]: And then even later, like, I completely agree with, you know, what he achieved during his

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:09.160
[Amit Varma]: five years, like you mentioned in the book that quote, in terms of the quantum of transformation

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:15.540
[Amit Varma]: brought about, Rao ranks with other 20th century revolutionary figures such as Nehru, Deng Xiaoping,

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.860
[Amit Varma]: FDR, Reagan, Thatcher, and Charles de Gaulle.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.980
[Amit Varma]: But the difference you point out is that none of them faced all of these obstacles, which

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:27.100
[Amit Varma]: you just outlined, and he alone faced them and he made the most of the cards.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.660
[Amit Varma]: And another way of looking at that is that, you know, when he was Home Minister, when

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.740
[Amit Varma]: the Sikh riots happened, you outlined it in your book in detail, that it's fashionable

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.420
[Amit Varma]: now to blame him and say he was a Home Minister, the riots happened.

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.940
[Amit Varma]: But as you say, what really happened was that he was given a message at a point in time

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.500
[Amit Varma]: that now all reports of this and the control of the police will be with the PM or with

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.380
[Amit Varma]: the Prime Minister's office.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.620
[Amit Varma]: And those are the cards he's dealt.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.140
[Guest]: But by the way, I do say that I think he played it badly, right, in the sense, I call it his

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.140
[Guest]: vilest hour.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.140
[Guest]: You do.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.140
[Guest]: That's what I call it.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.380
[Guest]: Because those were so he was held a bad set of cards.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.860
[Guest]: He was given a direct order by the PMO to stand down.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.700
[Guest]: And that even though he was Home Minister and in Delhi, the Delhi police report to the

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:12.340
[Guest]: Home Minister, he was told on the day that Indira Gandhi died, that there would be riots

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.080
[Guest]: the next day and police will report directly to the PMO.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.740
[Guest]: So he was held a bad, he was dealt a bad set of cards.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.540
[Guest]: If he had protested, he would have had to resign and his career would have been over

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:23.940
[Guest]: in the Congress.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.300
[Guest]: But he could have done that, right?

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:31.340
[Guest]: He chose to protect his career over preventing genocide of innocent Sikhs, right?

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.420
[Guest]: And I would, I would judge him harshly.

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.340
[Guest]: But yes, he was dealt a bad set of cards there, no doubt about it.

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.660
[Amit Varma]: I would, I agree with you in terms of it being his vilest hours and one has to judge him

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:41.660
[Amit Varma]: harshly.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.100
[Amit Varma]: But what he did there was consistent with what you point out he did in all the other

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:52.300
[Amit Varma]: situations where rather than argue against the cards dealt to him, he just accepted it

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.380
[Amit Varma]: and ensured his own survival within the system.

00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:01.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, in that sense, he was being as rational at that moment as he was after 91, where he

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.100
[Guest]: did everything he did, where he was completely masterful.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.100
[Guest]: I think that's right.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.100
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.120
[Amit Varma]: So it's an example of how, you know, people contain multitudes.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.100
[Amit Varma]: It is so easy to praise, praise Narsimha Rao as India's best Prime Minister.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.340
[Amit Varma]: And as you point out in your book, Arun Jaitley does.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.500
[Guest]: Arun Jaitley is India's best Congress Prime Minister.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.500
[Amit Varma]: Oh, that's what he said.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.460
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, condemn him for his inaction in 84, for example.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.340
[Amit Varma]: In the same way, you know, I think Vajpayee was a damn good Prime Minister.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.940
[Amit Varma]: And there are other things that you can condemn him for as well.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.420
[Amit Varma]: So people contain multitudes and Nehru as well, ditto.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.740
[Amit Varma]: There are things you can condemn him for and there are things you have to praise him for.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: We'll come back to Narsimha Rao later.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.020
[Amit Varma]: But in that personal journey, there were other strands I wanted to pick up on and one was,

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:54.860
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about gaining a particular aesthetic and an approach from Raj Kamal Jha, who, by

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.260
[Amit Varma]: the way, also contains multitudes because I absolutely hated his first book, The Blue

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.260
[Amit Varma]: Bedspread.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:05.820
[Amit Varma]: I thought it was purple, ornate prose and, you know, maybe the mimetic desire to write

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:09.900
[Amit Varma]: like Arundhati Roy, who was, you know, who wrote similar ornate purple prose, except

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:15.280
[Amit Varma]: that he seemed almost a parody, but obviously a great journalist and editor from everything

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280
[Amit Varma]: that I've heard.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280
[Amit Varma]: I've never met him.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.260
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the influence he had on you, like the bit about the I I

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:26.580
[Amit Varma]: completely get in journalism, there has to be no I. I focus a lot on getting my guests

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.660
[Amit Varma]: to use the I because that personal journey is really for me what brings the show alive.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And what makes each of my guests more than an expert on a subject, but an actual human

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120
[Amit Varma]: being on a journey.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:44.780
[Amit Varma]: So I aim for the personal, but in the journalistic context, you know, I can, you know, I totally

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.180
[Amit Varma]: agree with Raj there.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:50.740
[Amit Varma]: But tell me a little bit about, you know, figuring out in terms of aesthetic, in terms

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.260
[Amit Varma]: of approach, in terms of ethic, how he influenced you and how you changed?

01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:01.300
[Guest]: Well, firstly, definitely the I, right, and the I is also deeper in the sense that what

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:06.140
[Guest]: he constantly instilled in me was that the subject is greater than the observer, you

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:12.220
[Guest]: know, and he's in doing so he's rebelling against a recent fashion, which says that

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:18.300
[Guest]: because the observer cannot be detached from the observed, let's talk about the observer

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.300
[Guest]: instead, right?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300
[Guest]: That's what happens.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.100
[Guest]: And I look academia's full of this stuff, right?

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.020
[Guest]: Because you need to be sort of self reflective or self self reflexive.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:33.060
[Guest]: It just becomes like a, you know, sort of an ego massage, that actually, you should

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.980
[Guest]: be writing about tribals in Jharkhand.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.740
[Guest]: But, you know, you're talking about your caste privilege, class privilege, gender privilege,

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.380
[Guest]: but actually that, you know, there's a way in which that becomes talking about yourself,

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.180
[Guest]: I don't want to know about you, I want to know about the tribals in Jharkhand, right?

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:51.740
[Guest]: So he, so I think he really pushed me into, you know, take realize that the subject that

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.260
[Guest]: what you're seeing what you're reporting is much more important than you are, of course,

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.940
[Guest]: you have bias and be a little aware of it, but don't be so aware of it, that that becomes

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.380
[Guest]: a center of the story rather than what you are seeing, you know, I think the second thing

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:12.180
[Guest]: that Raj has instilled in me, you know, look, you know, he won't consciously call himself

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180
[Guest]: a mentor.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.180
[Guest]: But you know, I would say that it's a one way I've learned a lot from him, is that the

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.620
[Guest]: art of telling a story, you know, that what it means to tell a story, what it means to

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:28.460
[Guest]: talk about the interiority of people, right, to give you one example, in the BJP book,

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.780
[Guest]: which is what we talked about in the last episode, the book, you know, consciously ends

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.420
[Guest]: with Modi's ascension on the national stage.

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.220
[Guest]: And it's about, you know, Vajpayee and Advani's life and through them, we get to know Hindu

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.260
[Guest]: nationalism before Modi.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:46.140
[Guest]: But Raj, you know, when I was talking to him while researching the book had a very interesting

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:51.420
[Guest]: point he said, look, everybody reading the book will be reading the book backwards in

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.860
[Guest]: the sense they will be reading the book knowing that Modi is in power today, that Hindu nationalism

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.540
[Guest]: is hegemonic today.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.620
[Guest]: And knowing this, they are looking at the at the past.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:05.260
[Guest]: So you can't like go ahead and write the story of the past pretending that there's no Modi,

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.260
[Guest]: right?

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:10.380
[Guest]: So it has to lead up to Modi, it shouldn't be about Modi, it has to lead up to Modi,

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:15.780
[Guest]: but it should be well aware and sensitive to the fact that the story only makes sense

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:20.160
[Guest]: for people reading today, given that they're obsessed about Modi, they're obsessed about

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.740
[Guest]: Hindu nationalism, right?

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:27.340
[Guest]: And he gave me this example of this book that he had liked a lot, which is by Lawrence Wright.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.940
[Guest]: I think it's called the Looming Tower, right?

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.940
[Amit Varma]: A super book.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.060
[Guest]: So I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I haven't read the book, but I'll paraphrase what he told me.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:39.460
[Guest]: And he told me that, look, it's the story of Al-Qaeda until 9-11, right?

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.700
[Guest]: So that isn't that right?

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.700
[Guest]: That's right.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.700
[Guest]: That's right.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.980
[Guest]: But everybody reading it is reading the story of Al-Qaeda given 9-11.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.320
[Guest]: So how do you, you know, and it's a bit of a balancing act, because, you know, everything

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:56.980
[Guest]: that Osama does, you know, in the 1990s, shouldn't be, you know, saying that, ah, this is what

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980
[Guest]: he did.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:03.020
[Guest]: And therefore, this helps 9-11 make sense, because that's a bit too reductionist.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.420
[Guest]: On the other hand, that's what the reader cares about.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.020
[Guest]: So how do you make that balancing act, right?

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:12.660
[Guest]: And his answer to that, by the way, Raj's answer, and I really appreciate that, is often

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.300
[Guest]: more aesthetic than it is analytical.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:21.060
[Guest]: So it's a treatment of a story, rather than the facts or the narration of the story, right?

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.020
[Guest]: I've learned a lot from him about that.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.340
[Guest]: The third thing I've learned, which is, I think, the most important thing is that, you

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.460
[Guest]: know, I mean, Indian Express under him, he's now the editor in chief, makes a conscious

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.180
[Guest]: effort to not be left wing or right wing, right?

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.180
[Guest]: Because it feels that the complex story is actually in the middle.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.780
[Guest]: So it's, you know, it's very critical of Modi, Indian Express houses Pratap Bhanu Mehta,

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:48.220
[Guest]: who's I would say, the arguably the most famous Modi critic in India.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:52.820
[Guest]: And it has gotten him into enormous trouble, not least in my own university, which is shameful.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.460
[Guest]: But it's certainly not right wing.

01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:00.500
[Guest]: It's not a left wing paper, either, it gives plenty of space to Ram Madhav, you know, it's

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.780
[Guest]: quite critical of cancel culture, etc, etc.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.220
[Guest]: And even when it comes to Modi, it's critical of Modi, it also says that there's, you know,

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.140
[Guest]: tons of things that Modi does right, like the welfare schemes, for example.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.900
[Guest]: And it, you know, and, and I think that has to do in part with Raj's aesthetic of focusing

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.180
[Guest]: on the middle, and on the complexities in the middle, right, and I've certainly for

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:26.460
[Guest]: both my books, have taken some of that aesthetic, which is that look, it's a really boring question

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.060
[Guest]: to say, I want to write a book, which says that Modi is the son of God, right?

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.940
[Guest]: Or I want to write a book saying Modi is the son of Hitler, I mean, those are terrible

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.980
[Guest]: books to read, right?

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:41.580
[Guest]: The complexity of the story is somewhere in between and being able to tell that story,

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.580
[Guest]: right?

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.420
[Guest]: And being able to draw people from the left and the right to engage with you, regardless

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.740
[Guest]: of their ideological beliefs by saying that, look, I have my own sensibility, right?

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:58.620
[Guest]: But the facts that I'm telling you, and the story that I'm telling you is honestly done,

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.900
[Guest]: and adds value to you, even if you don't agree with my ideological position.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.020
[Guest]: And I think, you know, looking back, some of that comes from both, you know, what Raj

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.980
[Guest]: is doing with Indian Express, and frankly, what Shekhar Gupta is doing with the print,

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.980
[Guest]: right?

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.460
[Guest]: Which is it infuriates people on the left, it infuriates people on the right.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.220
[Guest]: But it tries its best to do what you said, which is to resist categorization.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I absolutely agree with you.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.580
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, like, one of the small tips I give my writing students in one of my webinars

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.740
[Amit Varma]: is about how when you're writing an op-ed or an opinion piece, you want to engage with

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:36.340
[Amit Varma]: the opposite argument and not a strawman, but the best version of the opposite argument.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.580
[Amit Varma]: And what it does, and there's a tactical reason for this, what it does is that today, what

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:46.460
[Amit Varma]: has happened on social media is you have vocal minorities, consisting of tribes.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:50.420
[Amit Varma]: And within these tribes, you have people raising their stature by attacking the people in other

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.900
[Amit Varma]: tribes by attacking people in their own tribes for not being pure enough, and never addressing

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.980
[Amit Varma]: arguments.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.260
[Amit Varma]: And these are extremely vocal.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.380
[Amit Varma]: So it seems like everybody is like this, but these are minorities.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.340
[Amit Varma]: The vast silent majority of people realize that everything is complicated, and they are

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.380
[Amit Varma]: confused and they want to figure shit out.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:11.780
[Amit Varma]: So if you go there with the attitude that everything is complicated, here's what I think

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:12.940
[Amit Varma]: and here's why.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.900
[Amit Varma]: And here's why I think the other point of view is wrong.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.180
[Amit Varma]: And you take that intellectually honest approach, you get a lot more credibility and you have

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.820
[Amit Varma]: a lot, you have a much better chance of convincing readers, because they haven't immediately

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.820
[Amit Varma]: pegged you as partisan.

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:30.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's so easy to tell who's preaching to the choir, and who's not in a sense.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:36.220
[Guest]: I want to sort of go back to that, you know, I want to add to that, that, you know, it's

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:42.140
[Guest]: not just that readers are getting irritated when people are partisan, readers get and

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:47.700
[Guest]: viewers and in your case, listeners get irritated with moral preachiness, yeah, which is that,

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.980
[Guest]: you know, somebody beginning with the moral high ground and telling you, you have to agree

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:58.220
[Guest]: with me, otherwise, you're a bad person, you know, and it irritates the shit out of readers

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.620
[Guest]: and viewers and listeners, right?

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:05.300
[Guest]: And but they just feel so bullied that they can't even say it, right?

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:10.040
[Guest]: And I think that you confront a viewer or a listener or a reader with saying, look,

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.780
[Guest]: this is a point of view, these are the facts, right?

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.860
[Guest]: But hey, no pressure, man, make up your own mind, look at it your own way and come to

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860
[Guest]: your own conclusion.

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:22.020
[Guest]: And you know what, you presume I'm a good person, I presume you're a good person, you

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:27.500
[Guest]: know, and I find that a much more refreshing attitude and frankly, a much more honest attitude.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.300
[Amit Varma]: And a much more healthy attitude.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:35.040
[Amit Varma]: And so sort of going back to the second of the three learnings that you said you had

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.780
[Amit Varma]: from Raj Kamal Jain, one of them was that people who read your book, which is about

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.900
[Amit Varma]: the BJP before Modi, will read it knowing the ending.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.660
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, in some way, the narrative has to play to that play to the ending.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:51.380
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not sure I'm and again, I'm just thinking aloud, and no doubt you've thought this through

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.380
[Amit Varma]: more.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:58.620
[Amit Varma]: I'm not sure that that's always the best approach to take in the sense that if you think about

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:04.300
[Amit Varma]: the world in probabilistic ways, there can be many outcomes today from where we are,

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.500
[Amit Varma]: it seems that Modi was inevitable.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:13.100
[Amit Varma]: But in 1980, or in 1988, or in 1992, when Modi wasn't necessarily inevitable at any

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.420
[Amit Varma]: of those points in time, like if you think of the world in probabilistic way, like how

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.580
[Amit Varma]: I explain it is that, imagine you're flipping a coin, and there's a 50% probability.

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:26.180
[Amit Varma]: And as you flip it, there are two parallel universes which form and in one universe,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.380
[Amit Varma]: its heads in the other universe's tails, and so on down the line for infinite parallel

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.500
[Amit Varma]: universes of which we occupy only one.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.500
[Amit Varma]: And with the benefit of hindsight, we behave that whatever happened was inevitable, but

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:43.420
[Amit Varma]: actually, it wasn't, you know, and I wonder if thinking of what has happened as inevitable

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:50.660
[Amit Varma]: can lead you to the trap of sort of then framing history in a way that it leads to this and

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:55.140
[Amit Varma]: exactly this, like, for example, Keshava Guha has made the point earlier and that, you know,

01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:00.380
[Amit Varma]: if Pramod Mahajan hadn't died, for example, you know, within the BJP, or if within the

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.980
[Amit Varma]: Congress, people like Madhavraj Shindia and Jitendra Prasad and Rajesh Palit hadn't died,

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:07.280
[Amit Varma]: maybe politics would be completely different today.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.820
[Amit Varma]: Maybe Mahajan would be PM and maybe there'd be a real opposition in the Congress instead

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.780
[Amit Varma]: of what we have now.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.180
[Amit Varma]: So all of those possibilities are open.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.860
[Amit Varma]: But if you, you know, keep the reader in mind that the reader knows the end, I mean, isn't

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:20.860
[Guest]: that a danger?

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.500
[Guest]: No, firstly, I completely agree with you, right?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:29.340
[Guest]: Which is that it's deeply wrong to think about the present as inevitable, right?

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:35.620
[Guest]: In fact, both my books on Narsimha Rao and on the BJP, the central point of both books

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.220
[Guest]: is that these were contingent affairs, that these were demand side, they were the journey

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:46.180
[Guest]: shaped the destination that we have to know the 100 years of the BJP to get to today,

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.180
[Guest]: right?

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.420
[Guest]: Because each of those years shape, you know, the way we came to today, right?

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.780
[Guest]: And it wasn't inevitable.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.220
[Guest]: I focus a lot, you know, critics say a bit too much on personalities, right?

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.740
[Guest]: But to me, personalities are important, because they are full of like what you the example

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:04.500
[Guest]: you just gave by Keshav Goa on, you know, Pramod Mahajan dying or Madhavraj Shindia

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.220
[Guest]: dying, what effect it has on the Congress.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.900
[Guest]: So I completely hear you on that.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:16.540
[Guest]: I think what Raj meant and what I took from him was not that the reader should first be

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.980
[Guest]: told that the present today, this is the only journey that could have happened.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:26.380
[Guest]: It is that that's there in the back of their mind while they are reading your book.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.180
[Guest]: So you have to address it, right?

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.700
[Guest]: Again, I haven't read Looming Tower, but my impression is that Lawrence Wright is not

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.400
[Guest]: arguing that it was inevitable that the towers would fall.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.140
[Guest]: It is that the reader reading me about the various contingent events that leading up

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:48.340
[Guest]: to the fall of the Twin Towers is having both the towers in the back of her mind or back

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.340
[Guest]: of his mind.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.820
[Guest]: And I have to be respectful of that.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.580
[Guest]: I can't pretend that that didn't happen because that's what the readers and the viewers and

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.980
[Guest]: listeners are seeing.

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:02.780
[Guest]: That's what I've taken, you know, I've kept in mind like for the Narsimha Rao book, you

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:07.500
[Guest]: know, a very important fact that, you know, I didn't want to hide away from was that Narsimha

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.060
[Guest]: Rao has been shamefully treated today, right?

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.420
[Guest]: That's the reality of today that he's been erased.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.180
[Guest]: And I wanted you to, you know, I wanted to keep the reader, the one thing in the mind

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.980
[Guest]: of the reader that when I, you know, the reader is probably asking, hey, why do you want to

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.820
[Guest]: write 300 pages on this guy, right?

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.580
[Guest]: Nobody's going to say that on Vajpayee Advani, but plenty of people would have said that

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.580
[Guest]: about Narsimha Rao and I have to be sensitive to that, right?

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.020
[Guest]: And I think that's what I took from that, that, you know, the reader is looking at the

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.020
[Guest]: present and then reading your book, right?

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.420
[Guest]: So be respectful for that, but don't pander to the prejudice that the present is an inevitable

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.940
[Guest]: consequence of the past.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.540
[Amit Varma]: Very well said.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, if you're listening to this in India, then I think you, you know, no matter

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.180
[Amit Varma]: who you are or where you are, you owe a debt to Narsimha Rao in some way.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what he did in those five years is just apart from the bare facts of lifting

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.020
[Guest]: hundreds of millions of people, I mean, if you have a mobile phone, thank Narsimha Rao,

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.580
[Guest]: like forget like any complicated thing, right?

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.780
[Guest]: You know, if you drive on a road with a public private partnership, a lot of high quality,

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.260
[Guest]: you know, toll roads are like that, thank Narsimha Rao, right?

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.220
[Amit Varma]: But sorry, go on and on and on.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.320
[Amit Varma]: And for many people, if you have food on the plate, because he got hundreds of millions

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.780
[Amit Varma]: of people, literally, it sounds like just a number, right?

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:27.620
[Amit Varma]: But hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, I mean, it's just such a profound

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.580
[Amit Varma]: consequence, and it's not necessarily the case that it would have happened anyway.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.580
[Amit Varma]: No.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.700
[Guest]: So, you know, as your book also kind of makes clear, which is why I'm totally with you that

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:42.940
[Guest]: I don't want to give the impression that there's a straight line between the past and the present.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, it could have gone in various different directions, as you pointed out in

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.340
[Amit Varma]: your book.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.380
[Amit Varma]: And I hadn't realized this, but I was so alarmed when I read that little bit about how Pranam

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:56.740
[Amit Varma]: Mukherjee was trying to angle for the finance minister position, when Manmohan became the

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.740
[Guest]: minister.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, can you imagine?

01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.740
[Amit Varma]: It would have been a catastrophe.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.740
[Amit Varma]: It would have been a catastrophe.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.900
[Amit Varma]: You know, because he was a catastrophe, eventually, when he got to the post in 2009.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:05.900
[Guest]: No, no.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:11.700
[Guest]: There is a straight line before his finance ministership in the 80s, where he encouraged,

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:17.420
[Guest]: you know, reliance style crony capitalism, and his finance ministership, you know, in

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:24.340
[Guest]: the waning years of the UPA, where, once again, you know, it was old style crony capitalism.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:30.900
[Guest]: I mean, your listeners would remember what he did to Vodafone, for example, it's absolute

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.900
[Guest]: catastrophe.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.900
[Unknown]: Yeah, yeah.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.220
[Guest]: And by the way, that's not the only catastrophe.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:40.020
[Guest]: Imagine if, so Pranam Mukherjee was a long shot, right, as even as finance minister he

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:44.460
[Guest]: was a long shot, because, you know, he had been sort of expelled, or he had left the

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.740
[Guest]: Congress under Rajiv and had come back and was being rehabilitated by Narasimha Rao.

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.780
[Guest]: But imagine if N.D. Tiwari, remember him, right?

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.100
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you know, that, frankly, that, you know, he was a more likely candidate,

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.100
[Guest]: right?

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.100
[Guest]: Or Sharad Pawar, right?

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.580
[Guest]: It would have been crony capitalism.

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:06.260
[Guest]: These are, you know, this, and it was within a whisker of happening.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.660
[Amit Varma]: That's just such a fascinating period of time.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.740
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to your getting to history, for example.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm curious about that shift now from journalism to history, because part of that epiphany

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.940
[Amit Varma]: that you had in Harvard Law School was, you like reporting, you like that kind of life,

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.980
[Amit Varma]: you like writing about stuff and all that.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Where does the shift to actually writing history happen from there?

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:34.500
[Amit Varma]: And what does it mean that you have taken this unconventional route to writing history

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:40.180
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, you know, whenever I talk to academic historians, I get this little

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:44.860
[Amit Varma]: sense of resentment against the likes of even Ram Goha and Manu Pillai, who are not traditional

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860
[Guest]: historians, right?

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860
[Guest]: They kind of come from outside.

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:54.500
[Guest]: Most, by the way, most or many academic historians resent Ram Goha and 99% of that is just sheer

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.500
[Guest]: envy.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.540
[Guest]: Because he sells more than them.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.780
[Guest]: And when they tell ordinary people, you know, people who are not academics, I'm a historian

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:07.220
[Guest]: on India or South Asia, they say, oh, like Ram Goha, and they burn, they burn when they

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.220
[Guest]: heard that sentence.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:12.080
[Amit Varma]: And not only does he sell more than them, he also writes better than them.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.380
[Amit Varma]: So frankly, it's just, you know, plain causality happening there.

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:22.220
[Guest]: So I have one gripe, you know, with Ram, and I've told him this many times, which is that,

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:27.500
[Guest]: you know, his books are rich in primary sources, which is the most important thing, but they

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.660
[Guest]: lack respect for secondary sources.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.220
[Guest]: Look on Gandhi, lots of people have written about, right?

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:37.700
[Guest]: And what Ram has done is dived into the archives, focused on primary material, but I just wish

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:43.180
[Guest]: he could have also, you know, told us what others have written about, about Gandhi.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.540
[Guest]: Because look, there's a long tradition of that.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.060
[Guest]: That's also one reason why academic historians are hurt.

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.020
[Guest]: Because they're like, look, this guy's writing on stuff that we have written about too.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.980
[Guest]: And of course, he has original material, original research, they're fantastic.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.900
[Guest]: But why doesn't he acknowledge us?

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.100
[Guest]: And I think that, you know, that is a legitimate criticism.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.100
[Guest]: Look, I'm a big Ram Goha fan.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.820
[Guest]: But I would say that, you know, if he, you know, he should inform the reader a little

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.740
[Guest]: more on others who have written about the similar subject.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I agree.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.140
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also a big Ram Goha fan.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:18.180
[Amit Varma]: I got attacked on Twitter recently, because I defended him against someone who called

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:22.340
[Amit Varma]: him a sanghi uncle, quote, unquote, a sanghi uncle, Ram Goha of all people.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.420
[Amit Varma]: And then Ram saw the Twitter fracas, and he wrote to me, and he said that, no, no, listen,

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.300
[Amit Varma]: don't defend me, just stay out of this.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.540
[Amit Varma]: So it can get a little ugly.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.740
[Amit Varma]: But just sort of speaking about those secondary sources, and just a question that occurs to

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:41.660
[Amit Varma]: me that at one level, of course, that you don't just want to go to the primary sources

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.140
[Amit Varma]: and see Gandhi's letters and Gandhi's writings and what others wrote on him at the time,

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.820
[Amit Varma]: but also how other historians have interpreted that and looked at that.

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.500
[Amit Varma]: But you know, there's a term George Soros coined in his book, The Alchemy of Finance

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.100
[Amit Varma]: called reflexivity.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:00.300
[Amit Varma]: And his point was that the way people think of the world changes the world.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:06.300
[Amit Varma]: So if you think the reality is x and reality is actually y, reality will actually start

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.900
[Amit Varma]: moving from y to x if enough people think that is the case.

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.140
[Amit Varma]: Does this have an effect on historical figures whose careers play out over a long period

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.660
[Amit Varma]: of time, that they pay attention to what others are writing about them, or that what others

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:23.700
[Amit Varma]: are writing about them can shape a public mood and then change the way they behave?

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.940
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, for that reason, also, you need to take account of this?

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:33.460
[Guest]: That's a good question, actually, look, my first book, Naseem Anand is dead, so he's

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.100
[Guest]: not going to listen to me, right?

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.100
[Amit Varma]: My book.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.540
[Amit Varma]: But during his lifetime, because if you're looking at secondary sources, you might also

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:44.900
[Guest]: be looking at what a newspaper said about him in 1967, which can change the way he reacts.

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.500
[Guest]: Look, it's a good question, right?

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:51.300
[Guest]: I'm not going to give you a flippant reply, which is that, you know, do writers about

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.820
[Guest]: history help shape history through this causal pathway, namely that leaders and people of

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.980
[Guest]: influence are being influenced by that history?

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:04.340
[Guest]: It's a good question, you know, but just one pushback a little bit.

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.380
[Guest]: I don't, I'm not a historian.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:10.580
[Guest]: So I call myself a political scientist, my PhD is in political science.

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:15.900
[Guest]: I'm an associate professor of political science at Ashoka, where I have some similarity with

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:21.020
[Guest]: historians is that I use archives, but I use interviews, historians don't use interviews,

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.020
[Guest]: right?

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020
[Guest]: So I use a ton.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.160
[Guest]: So that's what I have in similarity with reporters.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:31.860
[Guest]: So to me, the two primary sources that I use our newspaper archives, documents, you know,

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.180
[Guest]: private papers, etc. and as well as interviews, and frankly, the interviews are what I love

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.940
[Guest]: the best, right?

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:43.620
[Guest]: But the big difference I have with historians is that I'm interested in causation.

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.380
[Guest]: Historians don't like to think of, you know, the world in that way.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:51.020
[Guest]: So for example, when it comes to the rise of the BJP, I'm interested in what helped

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.060
[Guest]: the BJP rise, right?

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:57.260
[Guest]: When it comes to Nassim Maraou, I'm interested in making the causal argument that Nassim

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:02.300
[Guest]: Maraou caused liberalization, right, or certainly caused the success of liberalization.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.300
[Guest]: So I'm making a causal claim.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.820
[Guest]: And thirdly, unlike historians, most of the secondary sources I refer to tend to be political

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.580
[Guest]: scientists, right?

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:16.260
[Guest]: So certainly, so I would call myself a political scientist who uses historical methods, as

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.700
[Guest]: well as journalistic methods, right?

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:23.220
[Guest]: But again, maybe it's the Harvard Law School syndrome, Amit, I don't feel insecure as having

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.820
[Guest]: to prove that I'm one amongst them.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.140
[Guest]: I mean, whatever, man, I'm like a tenured professor in a university, right?

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:34.080
[Guest]: I teach students, you know, I just spent a semester teaching at Princeton.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.140
[Guest]: So you know, I don't have that insecurity at that level.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.860
[Guest]: And B, and at a deeper level, Amit, having spent lots of time with academics, I don't

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.540
[Guest]: think academics are any smarter than non-academics, right?

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.060
[Guest]: Just like it's like saying, are doctors smarter than non-doctors?

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:53.060
[Guest]: No, it's just that doctors have gone through a certain training, and know some methods

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:58.220
[Guest]: that non-doctors don't know, but their IQ may not be better than the patient, right?

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:03.300
[Guest]: And so similarly, I have, I'm under no illusion that academics are, you know, the smartest

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.300
[Guest]: people in the room.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.300
[Guest]: No, they're not.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:09.620
[Guest]: They just have done a PhD, most of them, and they have, you know, some kind of methodological

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:14.980
[Guest]: training that gives them certain advantages and doesn't give them many other advantages.

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.260
[Guest]: So this idea of having to write for academics, I don't think that they're the smartest people

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.260
[Guest]: in the room.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.860
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not disrespecting academics.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.980
[Guest]: But I think that they're just, you know, as smart as bankers or as smart as journalists

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.980
[Guest]: on average.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.180
[Guest]: There's no particular difference, right?

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.180
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:34.460
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Sturgeon's law would apply here as well, which is, you know, 95% of everything

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.460
[Amit Varma]: is crud.

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.780
[Amit Varma]: And everything is what?

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.780
[Unknown]: Crud is the term he uses, it's a synonym of crap.

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:45.060
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, like one difference we'll often make is that we listen to some music today

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.860
[Amit Varma]: and then we'll say, it was so good in the 60s, Beatles were there, Rolling Stones was

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.860
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:50.860
[Amit Varma]: But that's a selection bias.

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:51.860
[Amit Varma]: You're looking at the survivors.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, the survivorship bias coming into play.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:00.820
[Amit Varma]: Like 95% of music was crap then and it's crap now and if you have to compare the outliers

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:05.460
[Unknown]: to the outliers, this can often give a romantic tinge to the way that you sort of look at

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.460
[Amit Varma]: the past.

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.900
[Amit Varma]: But staying with academics for a while, like, in another context, the context of economics,

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:18.180
[Amit Varma]: Ajay Shah had once, you know, lamented on the show, that so many talented economists

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:23.180
[Amit Varma]: prefer to play that whole academic game, the circle jerk, as it were, and circle jerk is

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:27.500
[Amit Varma]: a word I'm using, Ajay is too polite to use such terms, but that whole academic circle

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.380
[Amit Varma]: jerk where they're writing for fellow academics and they're getting plaudits there and so

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.380
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth.

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.040
[Amit Varma]: It's a reflexive game and they're not really growing.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.180
[Amit Varma]: And the incentives of that seem terrible to me because, you know, then you're sort of

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:45.140
[Amit Varma]: driven into directions to follow certain kinds of fashionable dogmas of the moment and so

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.140
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:51.780
[Amit Varma]: And Ajay's deeper point, which I think would resonate with you as well, given your book

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:56.580
[Amit Varma]: and Narsimha Rao, is that there are very few of these economists, therefore, who are choosing

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.160
[Amit Varma]: to stay back and engage with the real world.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:04.300
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points and one of the themes he speaks about to give context to this is

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:10.380
[Amit Varma]: how there was actually a community of economists in the government at one point in time, economists

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.860
[Amit Varma]: and wonks and bureaucrats who believed in reform, who right from the 80s were doing

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.580
[Amit Varma]: the groundwork for reform so that when that moment came, you know, even before Narsimha

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:24.260
[Amit Varma]: Rao asked Manmohan Singh to be finance minister, Naresh Chandra, his cabinet secretary, had

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:28.660
[Amit Varma]: given him a paper outlining all the reforms that should happen because that community

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.180
[Amit Varma]: of wonks and bureaucrats had prepared it.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:36.460
[Amit Varma]: And he says that that's dying out there, that it was vibrant through the 90s, it was vibrant

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.060
[Amit Varma]: in Vajpayee's time.

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.260
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't see that anymore in the younger generation who are playing the academic circle

01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:42.260
[Amit Varma]: jerk game.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:46.500
[Guest]: No, I think there are two reasons for that, there are two reasons for that.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:52.940
[Guest]: The first reason is that, you know, the government is less receptive, right, let's be honest.

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:58.580
[Guest]: In the 1980s, you had people like LK Jha, Abid Hussain, Manmohan Singh, Montek Singh

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:05.380
[Guest]: Aluwalia, you know, Rakesh Mohan, you know, these are all fine intellects, right?

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.140
[Guest]: Rakesh Mohan did his PhD in Princeton, Manmohan Singh, you know, you know, was at Oxford and

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:13.900
[Guest]: Cambridge, Montek Singh Aluwalia, you know, was in the World Bank and you know, people

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.740
[Guest]: like LK Jha, Abid Hussain were first rate intellects, right?

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.820
[Guest]: And they were not just persuaded about the importance of liberalization, they knew how

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:26.420
[Guest]: to work the system and these two are not the same thing, right?

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.700
[Guest]: So that as you mentioned, when you had a determined Prime Minister or a talented Prime Minister

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.020
[Guest]: like Narsimha Rao, you have a note available to him saying do X, right?

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:39.100
[Guest]: And hire Y, which is hire Manmohan Singh, right?

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:44.500
[Guest]: I worry that this government and now I'm straying away from my research into, you know, speculations

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.500
[Guest]: on the present.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:50.860
[Guest]: I worry that this government under Narendra Modi has contempt for, you know, economists

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.620
[Guest]: as intellectuals and that's a problem, right?

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:59.900
[Guest]: Because in a country like India, a developing country, we don't have left-wing intellectuals,

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.700
[Guest]: right-wing intellectuals, left-wing economists of high quality.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:07.640
[Guest]: We have what we have and we have to use those few resources for national development.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.980
[Guest]: You can't just say that everyone with a foreign degree and, you know, who speaks English should

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.980
[Guest]: be junked.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:16.780
[Guest]: The RSS is not producing world-quality economists.

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:20.380
[Guest]: So you should go to war with the army you have.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.700
[Guest]: And so I think that one reason for what you mentioned is that this government is less

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.700
[Guest]: receptive.

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.460
[Guest]: They're less receptive for people of the quality of Arvind Subramaniam, they're less receptive

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:33.400
[Guest]: of people like Raghuram Rajan and that's a problem, right?

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.320
[Guest]: But the second thing you said, which is that part of the reason is that academia itself

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:44.980
[Guest]: is being so professionalized that you're not finding, A, people who work on real issues

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.420
[Guest]: and B, people who are willing to engage with policy and government.

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.340
[Guest]: I think, unfortunately, that's true too.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.580
[Guest]: I can't speak so much on economics only through friends who are, you know, who are economists.

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.280
[Guest]: It's certainly true of political science, right?

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.940
[Guest]: It's certainly true of the humanities.

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.420
[Guest]: I can see that.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.460
[Guest]: And it is a larger tragedy.

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.040
[Guest]: There's a third thing, and I think I should have mentioned this earlier when I was talking

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:13.940
[Guest]: about my life history, which is that when I finished my PhD in Princeton, I was determined

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.340
[Guest]: to come back to India.

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:19.160
[Guest]: No matter what, I didn't want to look for a job in the US.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:26.940
[Guest]: And part of that was, Amit, it was a deep-seated feeling that the creation of knowledge has

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.700
[Guest]: jurisdictional issues, right?

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:35.140
[Guest]: Or to put it differently, if you're an economist whose aim is to get tenure in a US university,

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:41.880
[Guest]: you won't focus, or it's much harder for you to focus on issues of economics in India.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.340
[Guest]: It's just much harder for you to look at, you know, what is happening in American economics.

01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.980
[Guest]: You'll try to find the analogy in India, right?

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.140
[Guest]: For example, in political science, so many of my friends in the US are obsessed with,

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:57.020
[Guest]: you know, Trump is the fascist, you know, Modi is India's Trump, right?

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.500
[Guest]: Which is absolute rubbish.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:04.700
[Guest]: I think that's a third problem, which is we are seeing a brain drain of high quality scholars

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.100
[Guest]: to the West.

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:10.460
[Guest]: And the incentives to produce in the West are very different from the incentives to

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.460
[Guest]: produce in India.

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.900
[Guest]: And then I would say the main reason I came back to India was that I felt I would be stifled

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:17.900
[Guest]: in the US.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:21.460
[Guest]: I would have to produce things that help me get tenure there.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.860
[Guest]: Even if it meant lying about India or exaggerating about India, or more likely focusing on topics

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:29.920
[Guest]: that are not hot in India, right?

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.620
[Guest]: And that's not something I wanted to do.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.020
[Guest]: And I think that's a third problem that, you know, explains what you're just saying, which

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.780
[Guest]: is that we're seeing a brain drain.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:42.980
[Guest]: Now we have institutions like Ashoka, Kriya, and, you know, hopefully, state and central

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.980
[Guest]: universities also revive some of them like IISc are excellent, right?

01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:48.780
[Guest]: We need to push that.

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:54.220
[Guest]: And you know, when I met senior BJP leaders for this book, for the BJP book, my second

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:59.820
[Guest]: book, they were constantly complaining saying, it's an anti-national institution.

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:04.100
[Guest]: I'm like, do you want the anti-nationals to be in India or do you want them to be abroad?

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.260
[Guest]: You know, don't you want them to be in India, because at least they're focusing on Indian

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.260
[Guest]: issues, right?

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.620
[Guest]: Don't you want to create, when you say make in India, don't you want institutions of higher

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.900
[Guest]: learning also to be made in India?

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:19.820
[Guest]: I think that matters hugely, you know, and you know, in an interview elsewhere, I've

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.540
[Guest]: said that self knowledge is a sovereign asset.

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.260
[Guest]: And I would say I believe that very strongly, right?

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:31.260
[Guest]: I mean, Amit, if you are doing this podcast, you know, sitting in the US or the UK, right

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:35.980
[Guest]: about India, but with half an American audience or half a UK audience, the questions you would

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:40.260
[Guest]: ask me or the questions you would ask others, the kind of people you would pick would be

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.620
[Amit Varma]: vastly different, wouldn't it?

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.460
[Amit Varma]: So you know, this, what you said about, you know, your argument to these BJP leaders about

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.180
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't you rather have your anti-national people within the country reminds me of this

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:56.420
[Amit Varma]: famous quote, I think it's by Lyndon Johnson, where he got someone in his government, and

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.340
[Amit Varma]: they asked him that, you know, why have you got this person in your government, he's your

01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.340
[Amit Varma]: enemy.

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.260
[Amit Varma]: And he said, quote, it's probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out than

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.260
[Unknown]: outside the tent pissing in.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:10.140
[Amit Varma]: And here it seems that how the BJP leaders would look at people in Ashoka would be that

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.300
[Amit Varma]: they're inside the tent pissing in.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.100
[Amit Varma]: That's how I think they look at it.

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:18.180
[Amit Varma]: A quick anecdote before I go to my follow up question, you sort of mentioned, you know,

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.420
[Amit Varma]: people in the US who might think that, you know, talk about Trump and Modi and this and

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.420
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.980
[Amit Varma]: I was once told by Steve Bannon, that Modi is India's Reagan.

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:27.980
[Amit Varma]: This really happened.

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.580
[Guest]: So I'd won this prize called the Bastia Prize.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:30.580
[Guest]: Yeah, twice.

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.580
[Guest]: You're the only person to win it twice.

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:34.780
[Amit Varma]: No, Tim Harford won it a second time after my second time.

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.420
[Amit Varma]: So I was the first person to win it twice.

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.420
[Guest]: Right.

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.740
[Amit Varma]: But so the second time when I went, I there was a ceremony, I gave a speech.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:45.580
[Amit Varma]: And the next day, the organizer of the ceremony called me and said there is a particular lady,

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.540
[Amit Varma]: I won't take her name, but a very influential person in Republican Party circles and the

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:54.060
[Amit Varma]: daughter of a very influential tech magnate.

01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.100
[Amit Varma]: And he said that she wants to speak to you.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.620
[Amit Varma]: She really loved your speech.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.980
[Amit Varma]: So I said, Okay, I mean, why not?

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:00.340
[Amit Varma]: I'm open to meeting people.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.860
[Amit Varma]: And then I googled her and all of that.

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:06.180
[Amit Varma]: And I found that there are a bunch of people who are supporting Ted Cruz at the time.

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:07.740
[Amit Varma]: This was 2015.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:10.540
[Amit Varma]: The primaries had just kind of kicked off.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:15.140
[Amit Varma]: So the next day I go and into this fancy building and there is this lady and with her there

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.620
[Amit Varma]: is Steve Bannon, who I hadn't heard of before, right?

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:21.100
[Amit Varma]: I had no idea what the alt-right is or any of that.

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:22.380
[Amit Varma]: So they introduced themselves.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.340
[Amit Varma]: And he said, I do a magazine called Breitbart.

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.700
[Amit Varma]: And we heard your speech and your speech was great.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.620
[Amit Varma]: And would you like to start India's version of Breitbart?

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.340
[Amit Varma]: And I that's kind of how I reacted.

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.020
[Amit Varma]: I kind of laughed because I didn't know the term alt-right then.

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.020
[Amit Varma]: This is 2015.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.660
[Amit Varma]: But I knew that they were broadly conservative.

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.340
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I'm not conservative.

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.820
[Guest]: You know, I would not agree with most of the views.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.300
[Guest]: I wouldn't even call Breitbart conservative.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.020
[Amit Varma]: I would just say they're right wing.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.020
[Amit Varma]: No, exactly.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.020
[Amit Varma]: They're nativist, protectionist.

01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.140
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they're beyond the pale.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.300
[Amit Varma]: But at that time, I hadn't read Breitbart.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.940
[Amit Varma]: In my mind, it's something vaguely conservative and why are they talking to me, you know?

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.260
[Amit Varma]: At most, if you have to put a label, you could say I'm libertarian.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.540
[Amit Varma]: So I said, No, no, I don't think it's a fit.

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:02.500
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, I believe in immigration, you guys are against that.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:07.060
[Amit Varma]: And I believe in gay rights, and you guys have issues with that, and so on and so forth.

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.060
[Amit Varma]: And but and then we just chatted quietly.

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.060
[Amit Varma]: And they were very nice.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:13.300
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, Steve Bannon looks at me and he said, Don't you think Modi is just

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.700
[Amit Varma]: like Reagan?

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.260
[Amit Varma]: And again, that's exactly how I reacted.

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:19.580
[Amit Varma]: And I kind of said, Are you like kidding me?

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:20.580
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure you know, Reagan.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.060
[Amit Varma]: So clearly, you don't know Modi.

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:27.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's absolutely the opposite, if anything, but interesting anecdote aside,

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:31.820
[Amit Varma]: and I wrote a post on that encounter, which I will link from the show notes.

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:35.700
[Amit Varma]: My follow up question is somebody you should do seen on the unseen with Steve Bannon.

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.420
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I don't think I would.

01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.780
[Guest]: I mean, why not?

01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:43.900
[Amit Varma]: Because you know what, because and we were discussing this before the thing, that my

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:48.300
[Amit Varma]: show works best when people come here without a filter when they speak honestly from the

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.420
[Amit Varma]: heart.

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.860
[Amit Varma]: And the problem with people in politics is that there'll be an agenda, there'll be a

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.580
[Amit Varma]: narrative, there'll be a particular way they want to present themselves, which is also

01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:02.100
[Amit Varma]: why I don't have, I don't even invite politicians on this show, except you know, someone like

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.100
[Guest]: Shashi Tharoor.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.100
[Guest]: No, I see your point.

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:05.100
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:11.020
[Guest]: And you know, the whole logic of a four hour podcast is, you know, is premised on honesty.

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.980
[Amit Varma]: Honesty and trust, yeah, that you know, you can have that mutually respectful conversation

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.100
[Amit Varma]: and polite to each other.

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:20.260
[Amit Varma]: And it isn't someone trying to peddle a narrative, which won't work.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:24.260
[Amit Varma]: But so to get back to my follow up question, the reason I mentioned academia, and both

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:30.660
[Amit Varma]: of us went off on, you know, talking about that is, tell me a little bit about history,

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:35.860
[Amit Varma]: the way history is studied and pursued in academia, because someone who is not related

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:40.540
[Amit Varma]: to academics or to history, their impression of history would be that history is an inquiry

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.700
[Amit Varma]: into what happened in the past.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:46.900
[Amit Varma]: And it is a presentation of the results of that, that there are facts about the past,

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.540
[Amit Varma]: you turn it into a story, you present it, and that's history.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.420
[Amit Varma]: That's how normal people think of history.

01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:54.060
[Amit Varma]: But within academia, that's not it.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.540
[Amit Varma]: That's not the thing alone.

01:33:55.540 --> 01:34:01.720
[Amit Varma]: Within academia, and academic history, there are prisms that you have to look through ideologies

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.980
[Amit Varma]: that you have to superimpose on history, you have to look at it in a particular way, anything

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.500
[Amit Varma]: that falls outside that prism, and is not useful to you, you have to cast it aside.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.100
[Amit Varma]: And that pollutes the field.

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:16.380
[Amit Varma]: And that perhaps is one more reason why a lot of good history actually comes from people

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:22.380
[Amit Varma]: outside, you know, that academic line, like people like Niram Guha, and Manu Pillay, and

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.500
[Amit Varma]: so many great Western historians as well, in fact, who are castigated for being popular

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.500
[Amit Varma]: historians.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.020
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this, because, you know, many of my listeners would have

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:36.980
[Amit Varma]: heard phrases like Marxist historian, and so on and so forth, kind of give me a sense

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:40.940
[Amit Varma]: of what are the different schools of history?

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.860
[Amit Varma]: What are the approaches to history?

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:47.260
[Amit Varma]: And when a newcomer like you comes in, how do you make sense of all this and set that

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:48.260
[Amit Varma]: path for yourself?

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:52.660
[Guest]: Well, you know, first up, I don't think I'm qualified to answer that question, because

01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.900
[Guest]: I'm a political scientist, right?

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.540
[Guest]: So history is a distinct field.

01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:00.500
[Guest]: I'm not a historian, I don't teach courses in history.

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.580
[Guest]: I have some amateur interest in history, especially ancient India.

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.260
[Guest]: So I'm reading up quite a bit about it.

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:09.100
[Guest]: I mean, you know, shout out to those who haven't read Upindar Singh's work, I just finished

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:14.180
[Guest]: reading her ancient India culture of contradictions, I could not recommend it more.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.780
[Guest]: It has an ideological point of view.

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.860
[Guest]: It's also very, very, very good, right?

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:24.780
[Guest]: And it tells you that, you know, that the two things may go hand in hand that, you know,

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:29.780
[Guest]: a historian has a perspective, but within the perspective, you can be good or bad, right?

01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:34.340
[Guest]: Or to give you the example of Rumila Thapar, who I broadly disagree with, not even broadly,

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.060
[Guest]: I specifically disagree with, right?

01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:41.300
[Guest]: She's a Marxist historian, or I would say her guru, Didi Kosambi, who I would say is

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:47.060
[Guest]: even more of a Marxist historian, absolutely brilliant man, both of them are very good.

01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:51.460
[Guest]: While I can't answer the question of different ways of thinking of history, because I'm not

01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:55.260
[Guest]: a trained historian, you know, I use historical sources.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.660
[Guest]: But I am a political scientist, I'm interested in power and politics.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:03.140
[Guest]: I would only push your listeners that don't reject someone because of ideology.

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:08.220
[Guest]: I mean, you know, the, you know, to call Rumila Thapar a Marxist historian and should not

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.140
[Guest]: be a conversation ender.

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.380
[Guest]: It should be a spur for you to pick up her books, read it.

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:15.580
[Guest]: And if you disagree with it, you disagree with it.

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:21.460
[Guest]: So to give you just one example, she's written an absolutely brilliant book on Somnath, right?

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:26.420
[Guest]: The many voices of Somnath, the many stories of Somnath, where her argument is that the

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.420
[Guest]: destruction of Somnath in I think the 11th century by Mohammed of Ghazni, she doesn't

01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.500
[Guest]: dispute that it happened, right?

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:39.820
[Guest]: But what she disputes it is that this narrative that it's a historical wound in Hindu civilization,

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:44.760
[Guest]: she says was not the case until the 19th century when the British made it the case, right?

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.260
[Guest]: And Hindus did not see it in quite this way.

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:52.200
[Guest]: And most of the sources we have, which talk about the barbarity of Mohammed of Ghazni

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:57.820
[Guest]: in destroying Somnath are Muslim sources and Persian sources, right, who had an incentive

01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:03.380
[Guest]: to exaggerate, to make Mohammed of Ghazni seem like the protector of the faith rather

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:07.380
[Guest]: than somebody who wanted to make money and came to India to loot, right?

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.540
[Guest]: Now I happen to disagree with the book, right?

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:13.060
[Guest]: Because she's going somewhere with the argument, isn't just an argument and I disagree with

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.060
[Guest]: it.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.660
[Guest]: But it's a very, very good book, right?

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:19.980
[Guest]: And it's, you know, something that you mentioned earlier, whether you agree or disagree, let's

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.020
[Guest]: see whether we can pick the best person who argues on either side.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:26.260
[Guest]: And certainly Romila is one of them, right?

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:31.140
[Guest]: A critique of Romila Thapar, if people are interested, there's this writer in Swarajya

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:36.260
[Guest]: magazine, which is a center-right magazine called Arvindan Neelkantan, who I quite admire,

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:40.100
[Guest]: who's written like a detailed critique of various things Romila Thapar has done.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:44.180
[Guest]: And what I liked about him and I told him that is, you know, I think he comes from an

01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:48.820
[Guest]: RSS tradition and I told him that, look, you treat her with respect, right?

01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:54.340
[Guest]: You disagree with her and in the few sentences where he's a bit disrespectful, I told him,

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.380
[Guest]: please don't write that, you know, because the power of an argument is that, you know,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.580
[Guest]: Romila Thapar is excellent, right?

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580
[Guest]: She's serious.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.180
[Guest]: I have no need to question her bona fides, right?

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.420
[Guest]: But these are the ways in which her interpretation has made errors, right?

01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:14.700
[Guest]: And so for those who are non-academics, who are attacking historians, this is what I would,

01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:19.740
[Guest]: I'm not, I mean, I agree with many of the criticisms, as I said, I'm not in agreement

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:23.180
[Guest]: with Romila Thapar's project at all, right?

01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.960
[Guest]: But she's very, very good, right?

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.460
[Guest]: And to attack her, you have to treat her respectfully and be as good, right?

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:33.420
[Guest]: There's this American show called The Wire.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.220
[Guest]: Some of your listeners may have heard about it.

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:39.140
[Guest]: And there's this man there called Omar and Omar's famous line is that if you, you know,

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.500
[Guest]: if you're trying to shoot the king, you better not miss, right?

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:48.580
[Guest]: So if you're trying to go after someone like Romila Thapar or Didi Kosambi, these are great

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:49.940
[Guest]: scholars, right?

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:53.540
[Guest]: So make the effort to kind of rise to the occasion.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:54.540
[Amit Varma]: Does that make sense?

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.740
[Amit Varma]: No, that makes a lot of sense to me.

01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:01.500
[Amit Varma]: And The Wire, of course, is, you know, one of the great TV series of all time.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.980
[Amit Varma]: I mean, The Wire and Decalogue are, for me, the gold standard.

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:04.980
[Guest]: You really...

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:05.980
[Guest]: Which is the other one?

01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:06.980
[Guest]: Decalogue.

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.980
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I haven't seen it.

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.980
[Amit Varma]: Which is pre-OTT times.

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.060
[Amit Varma]: It was made in 1989 or 1990.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:16.500
[Unknown]: It's a series of 10 short films for Polish television by the director Krzysztof Kieślowski.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:22.860
[Amit Varma]: And each episode is loosely inspired by one of the Ten Commandments, even though I don't

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.860
[Guest]: think they were believers.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.860
[Guest]: I should write this down after the show.

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:25.860
[Amit Varma]: I want to see this.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:26.860
[Amit Varma]: Oh, it's a masterpiece.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.620
[Amit Varma]: It is, for me, the pinnacle of cinema.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.340
[Amit Varma]: And I've spoken about it on the show before.

01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.580
[Amit Varma]: And I kind of go on and on about it.

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.860
[Amit Varma]: So I won't kind of repeat that bit.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.780
[Amit Varma]: But I want to get a little specific here.

01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:42.180
[Amit Varma]: Like when you say you disagree with Romila Thapar's project, what is the specific disagreement?

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:45.660
[Amit Varma]: For example, with that book, what would have been your specific disagreement?

01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:51.500
[Amit Varma]: And also, and these two might even have the same answer, that because the term goes around

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.060
[Amit Varma]: a lot, Marxist historian, what does it really mean?

01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:55.940
[Amit Varma]: What is the lens you're looking at?

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.780
[Amit Varma]: And I accept that you're not a historian, and you've clarified that you're a political

01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780
[Amit Varma]: scientist.

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:04.100
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, as someone who's read much more of this stuff than I have, certainly

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:08.740
[Amit Varma]: enough to have disagreements with Romila Thapar, I've read her a little bit, but I don't know

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.260
[Amit Varma]: enough to have disagreements.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.260
[Amit Varma]: So but just expand a little bit on that.

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:18.220
[Guest]: So I'm not a, you know, neither am I a Marxist or a scholar of Marx, nor am I a historian.

01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:25.420
[Guest]: But loosely put, I would say, you know, Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar, Didi Kosambi, Didi Kosambi

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.220
[Guest]: is really the great scholar, you know.

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:30.900
[Guest]: So if anyone, you know, as I said, you know, if you want to aim for the king, you best

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.900
[Guest]: not miss, first aim for Didi Kosambi, you know.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:39.420
[Guest]: And you know, for those of you who don't want to read his work, there's an excellent talk

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:45.100
[Guest]: that Pratap Bhanu Mehta, the political theorist, Pratap Bhanu Mehta gave on Didi Kosambi in

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:50.780
[Guest]: a Didi Kosambi lecture, a named lecture on him on YouTube, right, which sort of, you

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:53.840
[Guest]: know, lays out Didi Kosambi's view of history.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.580
[Guest]: And it gives you a good sense of what the Marxist lens as applied in India is, which

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:02.300
[Guest]: is a different, slightly different from the European and American Marxists, right.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.160
[Guest]: So the Indian Marxists, you know, are a little different breed.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:14.060
[Guest]: One thing they all have in common is the emphasis on class, right, and material dialecticism

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:20.540
[Guest]: as applied to class and class analysis, and a belief that the real struggle or the story

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.220
[Guest]: of history is class struggle, everything else is an epiphenomena, right.

01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:34.580
[Guest]: So to take that to the specifics of Romila Thapa's book on Somnath, her argument is that

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:41.580
[Guest]: the motivation of Mohammed of Ghazni was not religious, right, and the insult and the humiliation

01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:45.460
[Guest]: that the Hindus felt was not religious, right.

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:51.540
[Guest]: And it was invented much later on by the British, right, who had their own kind of agenda.

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:57.260
[Guest]: So that would be one very strong emphasis that other axes of motivation are considered

01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.400
[Guest]: to use Marxist phrases epiphenomena, right.

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.880
[Guest]: The other, so I would say that is a very important element, that there are peasant struggles,

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.520
[Guest]: that you are looking at different modes of production, and during these different modes

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.000
[Guest]: of production, feudalism, capitalism, what is the underlying class struggle that is going

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.960
[Guest]: on and that forms the basis of history, right.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.560
[Guest]: So for example, a lot of Marxist historians would see the failure of the national movement

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:30.860
[Guest]: as not looking at class revolution and focusing on nationalism instead, right, and scholars

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.520
[Guest]: like Bipin Chandra, Aditya Mukherjee, Mridula Mukherjee, who are again historians, but they

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.880
[Guest]: are kind of, they are off the left, but they are Congress historians who are critiquing

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:47.760
[Guest]: Marxism or Marxist historians by saying that actually the national movement was a class

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.400
[Guest]: revolution, right.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.520
[Guest]: So that is sort of, you know, defeating the Marxist on their own terrain, right.

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.440
[Guest]: So I would say that, you know, broadly put, that becomes the way of analysis.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.700
[Guest]: It is not the only school of Indian scholarship.

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:06.600
[Guest]: So for example, two other scholars that I admire greatly on ancient India also happen

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.000
[Guest]: to be my colleagues in Ashoka University, that is Upinder Singh, who we have mentioned

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.860
[Guest]: and Nayanjot Lahiri, who has written really a classic on Ashoka.

01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:20.160
[Guest]: Another scholar who is not a Marxist, but who understood Marxist ways of writing is

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:26.500
[Guest]: Airavadan Mahadevan, who was a former IAS officer who dedicated his life to decode the

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.040
[Guest]: Indus Valley script.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.040
[Guest]: Again he was not a Marxist.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:35.920
[Guest]: So, by no means is the Indian tradition on studying ancient India, and this is my, you

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.100
[Guest]: know, this is all I am focusing on, is a Marxist tradition, right, but you know, you have high

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:46.120
[Guest]: quality scholars that come out of India who also happen to be Marxist, but not all of

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.120
[Guest]: them are.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And when you set about writing first the book on Narsimha Rao and then the book on the BJP,

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.960
[Amit Varma]: what was sort of your models for this?

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Like what are you looking back at?

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:01.720
[Amit Varma]: Like when you say that you were writing about history, but it wasn't history per se, quote

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:07.240
[Amit Varma]: unquote, and, you know, it was more using historical facts to talk about political science.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.000
[Guest]: I'm just answering, you know, so I'm saying I'm not a historian in a disciplinary sense.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.960
[Guest]: So most of your listeners who are not academics or not in a university would say that what

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.960
[Amit Varma]: is Vinay talking about?

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.960
[Amit Varma]: He is a historian, right?

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.960
[Guest]: He's rewriting history.

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960
[Guest]: Yeah, he's writing history.

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.440
[Guest]: He's writing, you know, he's writing about the past, like Narsimha Rao existed in the

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.440
[Guest]: past.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.600
[Guest]: He's writing about the past, right?

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.920
[Guest]: But the reason I'm pushing back is that over time, the discipline of history across the

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.900
[Guest]: world and the discipline of political science have moved in that history is considered firmly

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:40.920
[Guest]: in the humanities, along with anthropology, comparative literature, English, etc.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:46.080
[Guest]: And political science has moved closer to social science, like economics, social science.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.080
[Guest]: One is, of course, the use of data and numbers, right?

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.080
[Guest]: But that's not the only thing.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.240
[Guest]: I mean, I would say in political science, the big difference is that our focus is on

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.960
[Guest]: causality, causal mechanisms, causal influence.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.160
[Guest]: Why did something happen?

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.040
[Guest]: Historians will say, look, you can't put a finger on it.

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.440
[Guest]: There are multiple reasons for why it happened, right?

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:09.800
[Guest]: Whereas I am interested, that's very much my training, you know, and as I said, historians,

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.840
[Guest]: the main method they use is archives, right?

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.840
[Guest]: They don't use survey data, for example, historians don't do that.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.840
[Guest]: They don't do interviews.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.840
[Guest]: No, I don't do survey data.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.880
[Guest]: But I do a ton of interviews, which is some, you know, or what we now fashionably call

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.220
[Guest]: oral history.

01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:27.040
[Guest]: But that's what journalists have been doing for a very long time, right?

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:32.240
[Guest]: So it's just, I mean, again, if you're, I'm answering this, presuming that at least 1%

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.680
[Guest]: of your listenership are academics to make that distinction.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.560
[Guest]: But if you're not an academic, it's not a substantive difference.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.760
[Guest]: It's basically a disciplinary difference, you know.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.040
[Amit Varma]: So when you talk about methodology, you know, and a lot of it is based on interviews.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, it seems to me that it must be especially tricky to write books like what you've done.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:58.040
[Amit Varma]: I was about to say history, but I'll just say to write the two sort of biographies that

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.600
[Amit Varma]: you've done, at least in the Narasimha Rao book to a certain extent, it's not exactly

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:07.120
[Amit Varma]: a biography biography, but it encompasses elements of that, that one when you're writing

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.640
[Amit Varma]: about events from a historical perspective, but that still that, you know, many of the

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:17.320
[Amit Varma]: characters are alive, and kicking and interested in how the world will view them or how the

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.480
[Amit Varma]: world will view events and all of that, there then comes a trap of how much do you rely

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480
[Amit Varma]: on interviews?

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.480
[Amit Varma]: And how much do you rely on oral history from people who were participants and who will

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.920
[Amit Varma]: want to push one side of the story?

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, what you've done scrupulously in both books, is that wherever there are multiple

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.520
[Amit Varma]: versions of something, you've pointed out what those multiple versions sort of are,

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:43.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, but you know, how careful do you then have to be like, when you're covering

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:48.200
[Amit Varma]: a particular event, do you then tell yourself that if this is likely to be something that

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.760
[Amit Varma]: is contentious, I should get a larger sample size of people to speak to from different

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.760
[Amit Varma]: points of view?

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.840
[Amit Varma]: How do you how do you handle that?

01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.680
[Guest]: Academics wrestle with this question a lot.

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.240
[Guest]: This is that when it comes to interviews, this is the all the problems that you listed.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.080
[Guest]: But reporters do it on an everyday basis, and they have found a solution, right?

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.880
[Guest]: You have good reporters, you have bad reporters, any story you do, right, any story you do,

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.240
[Guest]: a reporter will speak to various interested participants by definition, because the interested

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.600
[Guest]: participants are also the sources, right?

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.860
[Guest]: And then the question is the question you just asked, which is how do you balance the

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:26.880
[Guest]: fact that the source has an interest in the story and is spinning something to do, right?

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.200
[Guest]: And this is what the skill of a reporter is, which is you get the source to speak, but

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:36.040
[Guest]: you're very, very cognizant that the reporter comes from, the source comes from a certain

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.040
[Guest]: position.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.040
[Guest]: So one way to do it is to try to balance it, search for the other side, so that at least

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.320
[Guest]: you have multiple voices there, right?

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.440
[Guest]: Two is do a preliminary fact check for the source, is the source, you know, lying, you

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.320
[Guest]: know, is the source reliable?

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.180
[Guest]: Ultimately, look, this comes down to human judgment, right?

01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.240
[Guest]: Why is Bob Woodward, Bob, Bob Woodward, right?

01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.840
[Guest]: Same issues, all the people he interviews, having, you know, when he interviews Trump,

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840
[Guest]: Trump has an interest in Trump, right?

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.440
[Guest]: Now, how do you, you know, so how do you balance it out?

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:13.000
[Guest]: And so I found myself Amit, in answering this question, not relying on academia, I think

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.600
[Guest]: for historical sources, like archives, and for secondary sources, and for research design,

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:21.840
[Guest]: academia was excellent.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:26.400
[Guest]: My PhD training helped me, it didn't help me for interviews, I had to go back to my

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.240
[Guest]: Indian Express days.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.080
[Guest]: I was actually a not a great reporter, I was an edit, you know, an editor, copy editor

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.400
[Guest]: pretending to be a reporter, but I knew tons of high quality reporters, how do you do that?

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.520
[Guest]: How do you answer the questions that you just asked me, right?

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.160
[Guest]: And I think this is what it is that if you if you find it's a contentious issue, get

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.840
[Guest]: multiple points of view, right, you know, but you shouldn't, you know, strive for balance

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.680
[Guest]: when there is none, you know, you shouldn't say, you know, some, you know, x believe that,

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.400
[Guest]: you know, the final solution happened, y believed it didn't happen.

01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.400
[Guest]: That's ridiculous.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.520
[Guest]: There are facts in the middle.

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.640
[Guest]: So do your own research, right?

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:08.400
[Guest]: And frankly, Amit, I found that doing my own research was hugely helpful when I interviewed

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.400
[Guest]: people, right?

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.400
[Guest]: So, for example, when I interviewed Manmohan Singh for the Narsimha Rao book, I had done

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:17.920
[Guest]: enough research, you know, I read some of the things he had written, some of his reviews

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:22.280
[Guest]: from the 70s, etc, etc, when I was asking him questions, and I could see that he was

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280
[Guest]: impressed.

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.060
[Guest]: And that was important for me, because I was in my early 30s.

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:29.980
[Guest]: And here I was, you know, interviewing an ex Prime Minister about economics, right and

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:34.320
[Guest]: about liberalization, and I have to prepare, because that's when they take me seriously,

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.320
[Guest]: right.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.760
[Guest]: But preparing also means that I can call out when somebody is saying something that is

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.720
[Guest]: factually untrue.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:46.160
[Guest]: The third thing is what you said that when you have a very contentious issue, rely on

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.760
[Guest]: multiple people when you have like a, like, for example, suppose, you know, what Manmohan

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.200
[Guest]: Singh was wearing at a particular point of time or Narsimha Rao was wearing, or what

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.320
[Guest]: was Narsimha Rao's health, I'm happy only relying on his doctor because it's relatively

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.320
[Guest]: uncontentious.

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:05.620
[Guest]: Now, this requires human judgment, there's just no way to run away from that, right.

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:10.380
[Guest]: And at some level, I am asking the reader to trust me.

01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:15.300
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to do while asking the reader to trust me is also to be as transparent

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:21.560
[Guest]: as I possibly can, in most cases, tell them the sources, right, give the page number if

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.700
[Guest]: I'm using a book or an article so that they can read it themselves, right.

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.720
[Guest]: And I realized, Amit, that, you know, all of this, which is the process by which you

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:34.840
[Guest]: get interviews, the process by which you look at documents, is all about building trust

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.340
[Guest]: with the reader, right.

01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:40.080
[Guest]: And readers know that immediately, I'm sure you, you know, you have the same experience

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.580
[Guest]: with your podcast listeners, very quickly, they know whether you're lying to them or

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.080
[Guest]: not, whether you're selling them something or not, right.

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.660
[Guest]: And that changes who you are, you know, you're very careful in asking questions to your your

01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:59.200
[Guest]: own interviewees, because you know that the podcast listener is trusting you, right.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.160
[Guest]: And I was very conscious of that burden that you know, I was, you know, in some sense,

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.040
[Guest]: I felt I was an agent of the reader.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:10.160
[Guest]: And you know, when I was interviewing Manmohan Singh or anybody or Nassim Rao's doctor or

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.560
[Guest]: his cook, I was there on behalf of the reader, right.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.900
[Guest]: And as I said, a lot of this I learned from reporting rather than academia.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:23.080
[Amit Varma]: So just thinking aloud, I think the one difference between what I do and what you do is that

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.880
[Amit Varma]: a podcast, essentially, a conversation like this is a work in progress, it's not finally

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:32.000
[Amit Varma]: edited, a lot of the stuff is just thinking aloud, and so on and so forth.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.400
[Amit Varma]: So my listeners, because of the intimacy of the medium, they'll know that I'm acting in

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:40.880
[Amit Varma]: good faith, that I'm making the best honest effort I can, but am I always right?

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Or will I always say something today that, you know, that I will agree with tomorrow

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680
[Amit Varma]: also?

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.400
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, I've changed my mind on the show.

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.320
[Unknown]: But you have to come up with a finished product.

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320
[Guest]: That's what they say.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:59.480
[Amit Varma]: But yes, maybe more finished, because I have the luxury of doing many edits, right?

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.860
[Guest]: You can't rewrite, right?

01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:03.200
[Guest]: You can edit, but you can't rewrite.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:07.200
[Guest]: But you know, the issue remains the same, which is, you know, I look back at the books

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.400
[Guest]: and I've made mistakes, you know, like each book has, you know, more than 1000, you know,

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:16.800
[Guest]: I would say, I mean, I'm just flipping maybe 2000 footnotes each roughly, right?

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.520
[Guest]: Some of them are erroneous, right?

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:22.440
[Guest]: I've, you know, in later editions, I've made an attempt to change sometimes somebody, you

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.840
[Guest]: know, something as simple as the spelling of a person, I've sometimes got it wrong,

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.040
[Guest]: I try to change it, right?

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:31.200
[Guest]: Readers are okay with that, right?

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:35.880
[Guest]: Saying that, look, on margin, you make a product like this, some errors are inevitable, as

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:40.120
[Guest]: long as you're honest, and you self correct, and the error is not massive.

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.120
[Guest]: It's okay, right?

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.960
[Guest]: It's like a relationship, yeah, no relationship is perfect.

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:47.440
[Guest]: You know, husband, wife are constantly fighting, both are imperfect.

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:51.640
[Guest]: The relationship with the reader and the writer also presumes that the writer is imperfect.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:55.600
[Guest]: And by the way, I also presume the reader is imperfect, yeah, which is why I take so

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.400
[Guest]: much effort to make the bitter medicine in the book palatable to the reader by putting

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.160
[Guest]: some honey, because I know that, you know, the reader saying, what's happening on Facebook,

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:09.720
[Guest]: what's happening on WhatsApp, I have to constantly bring the reader from that to focus on the

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:10.720
[Guest]: book, right?

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.840
[Amit Varma]: So it's, it's a relationship like anything else.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Elaborate on that with a concrete example, like what is a bitter medicine?

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.540
[Guest]: What is the honey?

01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:20.720
[Guest]: So the bitter medicine is the facts of the book, right?

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.360
[Guest]: So to give you an example, in the Nassim Rao book, I have two chapters on Nassim Rao's

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360
[Guest]: economics, right?

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:31.600
[Guest]: The economic liberalization reform now, other than Amit Verma and economists, everybody

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.880
[Guest]: else finds this instinctively boring.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:34.980
[Guest]: What is fiscal deficit?

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:36.120
[Guest]: What is monetary deficit?

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.380
[Guest]: What is fiscal policy?

01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.800
[Guest]: Monetary policy is something that is sleep inducing.

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.800
[Guest]: This is a fact.

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.800
[Guest]: I'm not blind to that, right?

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:46.080
[Guest]: I would have loved to be in a world in which readers love it with as much passion as I

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.080
[Guest]: do.

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:52.440
[Guest]: I know they don't, which is why I began that chapter with gold leaving South Bombay, right?

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:56.920
[Guest]: From the RBI headquarters and going to Sahara airport and being loaded, you know, and in

01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:01.480
[Guest]: being doing that India is, you know, is selling is spawning its family silver.

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.200
[Guest]: Why do I do that visual, right?

01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.240
[Guest]: I do that visual because that's the honey, right?

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:09.280
[Guest]: Which is entrapping the reader to read the rest of the book, right?

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.080
[Guest]: For the next chapter, which is the Nassim Rao's economics from 92 to 96, where he, you

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.560
[Guest]: know, where he plays the middle overs, not just as an opening batsman, I begin by talking

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:24.000
[Guest]: about Chanakya and Chanakya's various ways in which the king should deal with enemies,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
[Guest]: right?

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.260
[Guest]: Samadhana, Bheda Danda, etc, etc.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.260
[Guest]: Why do I do that?

01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:30.260
[Guest]: Right?

01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:32.360
[Guest]: It's to basically give the honey, right?

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:37.760
[Guest]: That entraps, you know, or that makes it palatable to read about, you know, jet airways opening

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.960
[Guest]: or this, you know, or, you know, licenses to banks, etc, etc, which I know that the

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:43.960
[Guest]: reader may not like.

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.840
[Guest]: And look, in doing so, it's like anything else, it's any other relationship, Amit, you've

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.840
[Guest]: had this conversation with me, right?

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.160
[Guest]: Now imagine a friend of yours who has no interest in your podcast, right?

01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:58.300
[Guest]: I hope you have some like that, you know, and you want to explain this conversation

01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:00.280
[Guest]: or this book on Nassim Rao to them.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:05.120
[Guest]: You in your mind are, want to be honest to the book, but at the same time, you know that

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.480
[Guest]: your friend's attention is limited, and you want to pick out something juicy to tell the

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:14.080
[Guest]: friend to capture the friend's attention, so that they get the core argument what you're

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.460
[Guest]: trying to say, right?

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:20.200
[Guest]: It's no different, you know, for me, it's like a grandmother test, or my, you know,

01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:25.160
[Guest]: I have a daughter, my daughter test, can you tell the story to capture their attention?

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.580
[Guest]: That doesn't mean you lie.

01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:31.960
[Guest]: That doesn't mean you needlessly simplify, but it's incumbent on you to make it interesting

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.320
[Guest]: to somebody who you know, who for whom it's not otherwise interesting.

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:36.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's well said.

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And speaking, speaking of friends who don't listen to the podcast, that's almost all of

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.720
[Amit Varma]: them in the sense that for a long time, I did not know the kind of following this podcast

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:49.400
[Amit Varma]: have because none of my friends listen to podcasts at all, leave alone mine.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, it's only serendipitously that in the last couple of years, it kind of hit

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:58.760
[Amit Varma]: me that the show does mean a lot to many people, and some of them are now my friends.

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.760
[Guest]: So but I have, I have retained the friends who don't listen to podcasts.

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:06.520
[Guest]: And just think back, if you can just tell me, I know this is the other way.

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:10.480
[Guest]: But you know, think of a book you recently read, right?

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:15.480
[Guest]: And you know, to a friend who doesn't read books, you want to tell Wow, I really had

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.520
[Guest]: a good time.

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:17.520
[Amit Varma]: How do you do it?

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.800
[Amit Varma]: I told you about Wanting by Luke Burgess a little while back.

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.520
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I even sort of ironically made you want to read the book because of, you know,

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.080
[Guest]: mimetically, which is what the book is about.

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.080
[Guest]: Yes.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.080
[Guest]: But you know how you did it?

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:33.840
[Guest]: You did it by saying there's something called thick and thin description.

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.040
[Guest]: Look back into your life, namely my life, and what part is thick and thin.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.840
[Guest]: And you know what the most interesting thing to anybody is that person.

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you got to make it relatable.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600
[Guest]: You made it relatable.

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600
[Guest]: You got to make it.

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600
[Amit Varma]: That's the honey.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's the honey.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And what you say about economics being boring for most people is sadly true, which is why

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, the most famous Hayek in the world, sadly, is Salma Hayek and not Frederick Hayek.

01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.200
[Amit Varma]: So what are you going to do about that?

01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:57.680
[Amit Varma]: No, but it's your job to change that.

01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:58.680
[Amit Varma]: That's my job.

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.240
[Guest]: Or at least to move the needle a little bit towards, you know, the one Hayek over the

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.240
[Guest]: other Hayek, right?

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.600
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I totally do that to the extent that there might be friends will, you know, see

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.840
[Amit Varma]: me coming and say, Oh, no, he's going to talk about Hayek again.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.960
[Amit Varma]: But so here's the next question.

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.640
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that when you start writing the book, you have a broad sense of a frame

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:20.800
[Amit Varma]: of what the book is, you know, the questions that you're asking, that's right.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And you may not know the exact answers.

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And then you get into the book and then structure reveals itself and so on.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.080
[Amit Varma]: And it begins to form.

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Now what happens here is that on the one extreme, you can have the approach that you just know

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:35.800
[Amit Varma]: the conclusion you want to reach.

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.280
[Amit Varma]: And once you've got enough facts to kind of make a case for that, you end the book, which

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.760
[Amit Varma]: is which you've completely avoided, obviously, and there's far more rigor and depth in that

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:49.680
[Amit Varma]: the other approach, which you're closer to, but which you also kind of avoided is that

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:54.520
[Amit Varma]: you just go endlessly into rabbit holes forever, like one of my favorite biographers is Robert

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.360
[Guest]: Caro, you must have read him.

01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.360
[Amit Varma]: And even before the Lyndon Johnson, like in the mid 60s, the Masterpiece, yeah.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:06.160
[Amit Varma]: So in the mid 60s, he started writing a book called The Power Broker, which he thought

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.160
[Amit Varma]: he'd write in a year.

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.000
[Amit Varma]: It took him eight, nine years.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's a masterpiece.

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:17.080
[Amit Varma]: It's I think it's a million words and was cut down to 900,000 and 100,000 pages, right?

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.080
[Guest]: Yeah, it's huge.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.080
[Guest]: On Robert Moses.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, on Robert Moses.

01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just a biography of Moses, as a person, therefore, you know, a biography,

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:30.040
[Amit Varma]: it's also a study of power and what power does to human beings, and therefore a work

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:31.440
[Amit Varma]: of political science.

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's also the biography of a city, the city of New York, and it works at so many

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:36.720
[Amit Varma]: different levels.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:41.960
[Amit Varma]: And after that, he in the late 70s, he began this biography of Lyndon Johnson, which is

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.480
[Amit Varma]: supposed to be five volumes, four are out, he's in his 70s, at some point, hopefully

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:49.360
[Amit Varma]: the fifth will be out, but like 40 years have gone by 45 years have gone by.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:55.120
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, it took him longer to write the fourth volume than it took Lyndon Johnson

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.400
[Amit Varma]: to live, you know, the period that are being described there.

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:03.320
[Amit Varma]: So incredibly meticulous and just, you know, remarkable and thank God he exists.

01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:05.160
[Amit Varma]: But everybody can't afford to be like that.

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:11.560
[Amit Varma]: So how do you like kind of find that balance that it must be so seductive, certainly it

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:15.240
[Amit Varma]: would be for me like so often when I read a book like yours, in fact, you know, I find

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.320
[Amit Varma]: myself going to the footnotes, and then I'll just enter rabbit holes.

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And that just goes on and on.

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:23.520
[Amit Varma]: When you're actually writing, you're doing the research, how do you get yourself to a

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.280
[Amit Varma]: point where you say that this is enough?

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.160
[Amit Varma]: I've got it, I move on to the next thing.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.480
[Guest]: Very good question, right?

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:33.640
[Guest]: So to, by the way, somebody you must interview is Patrick French.

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:34.640
[Guest]: Have you?

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:35.640
[Guest]: I haven't yet.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:39.400
[Guest]: So Patrick French has written the best biography I've read of anyone, which is a biography

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.400
[Guest]: of V.S.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.440
[Guest]: Naipaul, called the world is what it is, I find it the best biography.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:48.600
[Guest]: And it's astonishingly deeply critical of Naipaul yet an authorized biography, it's

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:50.760
[Guest]: unbelievable how he pulled it off.

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:55.840
[Guest]: And he gave me this advice, he said, look, some version of perfection is the enemy of

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.840
[Guest]: production, right?

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.080
[Guest]: So when should you stop research and start writing?

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.580
[Guest]: And he said, you know, you'll always have four books you should read, three people you

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:07.040
[Guest]: should interview, two archives you should go to before you start writing, right?

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.980
[Guest]: So don't, don't stop, don't wait, stop and write and leave things blank, right?

02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:16.800
[Guest]: So I've learned that, which is that research and writing is not a linear process, it's

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:17.840
[Guest]: an iterative process.

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:22.320
[Guest]: So you do some research, and then you start writing and you leave blanks and then you

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.800
[Guest]: go for one other step of research, where your job is only to fill the blanks up, right?

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.000
[Guest]: Because otherwise, you're waiting for this mythic sense of completion, before you begin

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
[Guest]: to write.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
[Guest]: And that's a mythic sense.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.960
[Guest]: And frankly, I learned that while doing a PhD in the wrong way, I think I wasted an

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:41.200
[Guest]: entire year looking for something that was a delta 10%, right?

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.760
[Guest]: So the question is the following that you keep doing research, right, at some point,

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.720
[Guest]: you have to say that, look, if I spend another one year doing research, it's only going to

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.920
[Guest]: improve the book 5%.

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:52.960
[Guest]: That's when you should stop.

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:57.200
[Guest]: So when you're at 80% or 90% there, you should stop and start writing.

02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.720
[Guest]: And then use the research phase post starting the writing to actually do a little more focused

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:03.720
[Guest]: research, right?

02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:07.400
[Guest]: I don't know whether that that makes sense, because too many people I know, especially

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.400
[Guest]: those who do PhDs or writing books are like, you know, they're spending years and years

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.400
[Guest]: and years.

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.400
[Guest]: One more book I have to read, one more book I have to read, one more book I have to read.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.280
[Guest]: It's wrong, you know, so you should stop when you're even 70% and you should start writing

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.000
[Guest]: and leave holes and then do a second round of research.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.920
[Guest]: On the larger question that you asked on, you know, structure, how do I go about the

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:30.920
[Guest]: book?

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.360
[Guest]: I am quite a structured guy, right?

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:38.160
[Guest]: So for both the books, there was a historical fact element, Nassim Rao was born at a certain

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.920
[Guest]: time, died at a certain time.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:46.080
[Guest]: So what I did was for both of them, I had done about a year of general soaking and poking,

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:47.080
[Guest]: not focused research.

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:48.320
[Guest]: Generally, should I do the book?

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:49.320
[Guest]: What should it be about?

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:52.440
[Guest]: Nassim Rao's book, of course, start to finish took a year, but I'm saying for the second

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440
[Guest]: book, right?

02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.840
[Guest]: Very early on in the process, I wrote a mock table of contents, right?

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.200
[Guest]: Saying that it will be a 350 page book, there'll be an introduction, there'll be a conclusion

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.400
[Guest]: and then the 30 page chapters and I think Ram told me that don't have chapters more

02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:09.080
[Guest]: than 20 to 25 pages gets too boring, right?

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:13.920
[Guest]: So if you have a 250 page book, you know, you should have at least like 15 chapters,

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:16.800
[Guest]: you know, so keep small short chapters.

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.760
[Guest]: So very early on, I write a mock table of contents and in both books, I've realized

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:26.360
[Guest]: that at the end, when I look back at the original table of contents, it was actually 50% there,

02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.360
[Guest]: right?

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:31.760
[Guest]: So when I write a table of contents, right, then every book and archive I'm writing, I'm

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.360
[Guest]: putting into one of the chapters and I also divide the chapters into sub chapters.

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.440
[Guest]: So when I'm reading a book, secondary literature, which is meant for say my Nassim Rao book

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:45.840
[Guest]: or the BJP book, I'm instinctively saying, ah, this is a nice paragraph, you know what,

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.000
[Guest]: it should be in chapter 6, section 4.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.800
[Guest]: So I write the CH 6, section 4 and then I go back and I and in my word document, I say

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.960
[Guest]: this is what you have to do, right?

02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:01.400
[Guest]: And of course, once you read what your table of contents is changes a little bit.

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.700
[Guest]: So you know, one of my favorite phrases, it's a unfortunate phrases, you should be prepared

02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:07.280
[Guest]: to kill your babies.

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:11.680
[Guest]: So if you have a great idea for a book early on, and you have a great theory for your book

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.020
[Guest]: early on, while doing research, you know, that theory may be wrong, you should be honest

02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.680
[Guest]: enough to change your view.

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.360
[Guest]: So don't be wedded to an original idea, right?

02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.480
[Guest]: You may have even spent a month doing research to realize actually, that's a total waste,

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.480
[Guest]: right?

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.800
[Guest]: So be honest enough and make the changes.

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.680
[Guest]: So what happens is, then I tinker with the chapters, I change the headings, I increase

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.640
[Guest]: the size, I move it up and down, I do that, but as I said, even at the end, 60% is what

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.040
[Guest]: I began with, right?

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.760
[Guest]: But it really helps in focused research, because every time I'm doing research, I'm telling

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:50.120
[Guest]: myself, okay, I've talked to him, you know, let's say I'm talking to Nassim Rao's cook,

02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:53.520
[Guest]: as he's speaking, I'm saying, oh, man, that was a nice sentence.

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.960
[Guest]: That is chapter six, section two, oh, man, that's a nice section.

02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:02.260
[Guest]: That was chapter one, you know, and then I, you know, as he's speaking, I write down,

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.400
[Guest]: and then I immediately go and move it to that particular word document where it is, which

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.720
[Guest]: means that when I'm about to write, right, a 25 page chapter, I have 40 pages of notes

02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.760
[Guest]: for those chapters broken up into sections, and each section says where that primary material

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.760
[Guest]: is, right?

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.400
[Guest]: So if that's, you know, everybody has their way of doing it, this is my way of doing it.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:28.120
[Guest]: The big con of this way of doing it, which is a structured way, is that I might very

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.360
[Guest]: early get committed to an idea rather than inductively making your way through an idea,

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.360
[Guest]: right?

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.920
[Guest]: And so the one way to solve that is not to be too wedded to the original table of contents,

02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:40.440
[Guest]: but that's the con.

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.720
[Guest]: So the but the pro of what I'm doing is you can finish things quickly, and wastage is

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.720
[Guest]: less.

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:48.720
[Guest]: So to put it differently, and tell me when I'm getting boring on this, because I can

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:55.080
[Guest]: speak endlessly on this process, which is that when I was doing my PhD, I used to ask

02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:01.720
[Guest]: around to other people doing PhD, how much of that actually made it to your dissertation?

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.320
[Guest]: Which is the same question asking that anybody writing a book, how much of the research you

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.880
[Guest]: did made it to the actual book, actual pages, right?

02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:13.120
[Guest]: And I found that for PhD students, it was, you know, 30 to 40%.

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.120
[Guest]: Can you believe it?

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:15.120
[Guest]: 60% is wasted.

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.920
[Guest]: 60% is you're going down rabbit holes that don't make it to the book.

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:22.440
[Guest]: Now some of that is inevitable in a process where you're doing original work.

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.280
[Guest]: But my argument is, can you make it from 30 to 40% to 60 to 70%?

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:30.720
[Guest]: You've doubled your productivity, still, there will be 30% wastage.

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:36.200
[Guest]: And that's what it means to do original work, but it's not going to be 60% wastage.

02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.920
[Guest]: Was that too detailed an answer?

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:38.920
[Amit Varma]: It's a fantastic answer.

02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:40.920
[Guest]: I'm really passionate about this stuff.

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:45.520
[Guest]: And I want to spread the word, but you know, I'm deeply aware that it may be too bitter

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.200
[Guest]: a medicine without enough honey.

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:49.680
[Amit Varma]: No, no, it's a fantastic answer.

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And you correctly spoke about the pros and the cons.

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And for listeners who are enjoying this, let me tell you that we spoke for almost at least

02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.880
[Amit Varma]: 45 minutes about the writing process itself in our earlier episode.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:02.720
[Amit Varma]: So they should kind of go and listen to that.

02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:05.960
[Amit Varma]: And Joan Didion once said, I don't know what I think until I write it down.

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:13.040
[Amit Varma]: So the process of writing as you know, part of a process of thinking about something of,

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:19.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, improving your own understanding of the material is something that I totally

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.880
[Amit Varma]: get and what like fiction writers will often talk of an approach to structuring a novel

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.020
[Amit Varma]: as you know, they'll talk of the architect and the gardener.

02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:31.160
[Amit Varma]: So the architect is someone who's making a map where this is the house, this is the land

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:34.920
[Amit Varma]: it occupies, these are all the rooms, you do all of that.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:38.640
[Amit Varma]: And the gardener is just pottering around messing around with stuff.

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:42.380
[Amit Varma]: And there isn't a right or wrong, different approaches work for different people, it kind

02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.960
[Amit Varma]: of depends on who you are.

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think in a sense, what you're saying is that you're more of an architect.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:50.400
[Amit Varma]: And of course, within each room, within each unit, you are still doing gardening, you're

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.040
[Amit Varma]: still leaving that space open.

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.240
[Guest]: I'd say that's right.

02:06:54.240 --> 02:07:00.320
[Guest]: But I think that's okay, as long as you're aware of the flaws of being only an architect.

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:04.560
[Guest]: And if your approach is a gardening approach, all power to you, but be aware that there

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:09.120
[Guest]: are problems, because then you're gardening everywhere, without knowing where the house

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.280
[Amit Varma]: layout is here.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:15.120
[Amit Varma]: So when you started in the Narsimha Rao book, were you aware of the answer that you eventually

02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.120
[Guest]: arrived at?

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:20.720
[Guest]: No, no, I knew the structure of the book, I kept pushing to say, why should I care?

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:25.320
[Guest]: And you know, the answer I, and for even for the new books I'm thinking about, I'm always

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:31.800
[Guest]: asking this question, Amit, which is why should someone who doesn't care one ounce about politics,

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.600
[Guest]: who doesn't visit Bari Sons in Delhi, who doesn't listen to Seen and the Unseen, what

02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:38.560
[Guest]: should they get from this book, right?

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.620
[Guest]: So is there something larger that Narsimha Rao's life could hold?

02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:44.760
[Guest]: But I didn't find an answer until I was midway.

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:49.720
[Guest]: And the answer is one sentence was Narsimha Rao tells us, how do you bring about change

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:50.840
[Guest]: without power?

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:54.680
[Guest]: How do you first gather power and influence and then wield it because he didn't have a

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:55.920
[Guest]: mandate, right?

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.180
[Guest]: He had only constraints.

02:07:57.180 --> 02:08:01.580
[Guest]: So under tremendous constraints without power, how do you then bring about change?

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:03.000
[Guest]: That's the central question, right?

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.200
[Guest]: And the central answer was he did it, because he knew how to be a lion, a fox and a mouse,

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.160
[Guest]: which we'll talk about.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:16.240
[Guest]: But you know, I had so many people outside of politics, policy, the world of Amit Verma,

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.120
[Guest]: coming to me and telling me this book resonated with me, you know, startup founders would

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:23.760
[Guest]: come and say, you know, people think that startup founders have all the power.

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:27.320
[Guest]: I don't, I can't fire my design person, right?

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:31.600
[Guest]: I want to come into the room and I think it's a lousy website, but I can't, I have to suck

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.600
[Guest]: up to them.

02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:35.360
[Guest]: I have to like, you know, because there's a shortage of labor, right?

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:41.240
[Guest]: I had, you know, a top bank, a country head of a top bank, MNC, telling me, you know what,

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:46.200
[Guest]: this book totally resonated with me, because people think I'm the CEO or the MD of the

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:47.600
[Guest]: of the India version of MNC.

02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:50.140
[Guest]: But I have two people in London breathing down my neck.

02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:55.360
[Guest]: And all my deputies in India are reporting to their lion counterparts in London, not

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:56.360
[Guest]: me.

02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.640
[Guest]: So I have to first construct power, I don't have power given to me on a plate, I don't

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.720
[Guest]: have a mandate given to me on a plate, I have to first construct that power, and then use

02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.840
[Guest]: it to bring about change in my bank, right?

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:10.960
[Guest]: Which is frankly the Nassim Rao story, which is you don't, you know, it's so easy to say

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:14.960
[Guest]: that if you have power and mandate, you should do ABCD to transform India.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.420
[Guest]: First, how do you get that power?

02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:17.600
[Guest]: How do you get that mandate?

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.760
[Guest]: How do you make sure that you're operating within the constraints?

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.520
[Guest]: Every person is dealt with a bunch of cards, right?

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.520
[Guest]: Some of those cards are strong, some of them are weak.

02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:29.600
[Guest]: It varies from person to person, but how do you play with the cards that you're given?

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous.

02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:35.920
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, before we go for a break, after which we'll discuss sort of your book

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.240
[Amit Varma]: on Nassim Rao, quick final sort of questions about your personal journey.

02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'm curious about your teaching.

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, what is teaching like for you?

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:44.920
[Amit Varma]: Do you enjoy it?

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you're teaching political science and not history.

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And as you have been at pains to point out, in fact, the title of the episode could be

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Vinesh Sitapati, political scientist, not historian, not historian.

02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:59.120
[Amit Varma]: So no, no, I'm just kidding.

02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:00.560
[Amit Varma]: I won't do that to you.

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:07.240
[Amit Varma]: But so what is sort of teaching like and what does it mean to teach in a place like Ashoka,

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.560
[Amit Varma]: for example, because I've heard very good things about the place.

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And I've had many episodes with different faculty members, with different faculty members

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:16.720
[Amit Varma]: of Ashoka.

02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:17.720
[Guest]: I've heard some of that.

02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:21.160
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, I've heard complaints from people saying, oh, Ashoka is becoming so woke

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and so this and so that.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:29.640
[Amit Varma]: So what is it like teaching young people, you know, and how much does that change the

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.440
[Amit Varma]: person you are and the writer you are, the act of teaching, because just as the act of

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.880
[Amit Varma]: writing makes you a better thinker, I would imagine that the act of teaching makes you,

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, much more knowledgeable about the subject you're teaching, because after all,

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.880
[Amit Varma]: you have to explain it to Nani ji and to dozens of curious teenagers who are challenging you.

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.440
[Guest]: Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:55.200
[Guest]: So first off, again, I'm addressing to the non-academics who are hearing this.

02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:00.400
[Guest]: Most people who do PhDs and want to be an academic don't do this for teaching, right?

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.080
[Guest]: Nobody says I want to do a PhD because I want to teach kids.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.080
[Guest]: Nobody does that, right?

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.080
[Guest]: Then you're a school teacher.

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.720
[Guest]: If you're a university professor, the main focus is research.

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:10.720
[Guest]: It's not teaching.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:15.000
[Guest]: And I was under this illusion too, that look, I've done my PhD, I want to write my books,

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.920
[Guest]: I want to do research, but for a living, I have to do some teaching, because, you know,

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.920
[Guest]: teaching is a revenue center, right?

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.280
[Guest]: Research is a cost center.

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:26.120
[Guest]: So I have to, in a university, learn to teach.

02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.860
[Guest]: So I reluctantly said, look, let me do some teaching and let me be half decent at it.

02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:33.480
[Guest]: But Ashoka kids make demands, right?

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:35.840
[Guest]: They work hard, they expect you to work hard.

02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.000
[Guest]: And it has been transformative.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.720
[Guest]: I've grown to love teaching, right?

02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.600
[Guest]: My student evaluations are good.

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.120
[Guest]: I don't think students like me very much.

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.760
[Guest]: I think they respect me, right?

02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:47.080
[Guest]: I try to be a tough teacher.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:51.680
[Guest]: What I try when I teach is to tell students that, look, I'm not going to waste your time

02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:53.400
[Guest]: by massaging your ego.

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:57.680
[Guest]: You know, your parents have paid good money to come here, Ashoka is an expensive education.

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:00.720
[Guest]: And instead, I'm going to try to add value to this to you.

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:05.440
[Guest]: So that at the end of this course, you said, okay, I, you know, paisa vasool toh hua hai.

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:06.620
[Guest]: And what does that look like?

02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.760
[Guest]: It doesn't look like pandering, right?

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:10.120
[Guest]: But I'm going to tell you a bunch of things.

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:13.920
[Guest]: I'm also going to sort of focus on a ways to think about things.

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:17.640
[Guest]: So I've grown to like it and I've grown to enjoy it hugely.

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:22.040
[Guest]: I just spent a semester as a visiting associate professor at Princeton teaching Princeton

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.080
[Guest]: undergrads on Indian politics.

02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.080
[Guest]: I like that too.

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.600
[Guest]: It's a totally different cultural context.

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:33.540
[Guest]: It has certainly helped my research in the sense that it has allowed me to ask questions

02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:40.800
[Guest]: and demand answers that non students will not have the guts to ask, you know, one of

02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:43.900
[Guest]: the beauties of being a 17 or 18 year old.

02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:45.280
[Guest]: And let me give you this example.

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:49.680
[Guest]: When I was at Harvard Law School, I attended a talk where Amartya Sen was speaking.

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.520
[Guest]: And after he finished during the question answers, some undergrad got up and said, Professor

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.280
[Guest]: Sen, I don't think you understand the concept of supply and demand.

02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.280
[Guest]: And he went on, right?

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:04.000
[Guest]: And you know what, when he finished, there was some giggling in the back of the audience.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000
[Guest]: But you know, Amartya Sen didn't giggle and he answered the question, right?

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
[Guest]: That's powerful.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.680
[Guest]: Because sometimes you ask foolish supply and demand questions.

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.860
[Guest]: But sometimes 17, 18 year olds ask the nub of the questions, right?

02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:19.920
[Guest]: And I think in the in the New Testament, if my memory serves, there's a line from the

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.600
[Guest]: Cornetian called to be a fool for the sake of Christ, right?

02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.760
[Guest]: Say foolish things, say stupid things, because out of those four, five, one will be a brilliant

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:30.760
[Guest]: idea.

02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:35.520
[Guest]: And undergrads really exemplify that, you know, they will often ask, you know, something

02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.960
[Guest]: about the BJP or something about Narasimha Rao that is the correct question to ask.

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:44.140
[Guest]: But everybody else is too afraid to ask it because it sounds simple, right?

02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:46.160
[Guest]: So undergrads really push you on that.

02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:51.920
[Guest]: So you know, the BJP book, for example, before I wrote it, I took a course called right wing

02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.760
[Guest]: politics in India, and right wing politics more generally, where I was looking at other

02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:02.120
[Guest]: political parties also like AKP in Turkey, Likud in Israel, Christian, Christian Democrats

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.520
[Guest]: in Europe, who are also kind of center right parties to kind of nestle the BJP story.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:08.440
[Guest]: Very, very helpful, you know.

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:13.680
[Guest]: So I have, you know, the teaching has been something that is not something that I imagined

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:16.200
[Guest]: I would like, but I like it.

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:17.840
[Guest]: And it gives me a lot of joy.

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:19.200
[Guest]: And frankly, it helps my work.

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:22.440
[Guest]: And there's a last thing, Amit, which is the researchers, right?

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.800
[Guest]: And people of the mind like you.

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.360
[Guest]: One of the things we suffer a lot is loneliness.

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.000
[Guest]: Because you know, you know, who, you know, it's not in an odd way, thinking is not a

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000
[Guest]: group activity.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.560
[Guest]: It's a solitary, solitary pursuit.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:37.760
[Guest]: And if you're sitting in some library, or you're reading up, you know, when you're reading

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:41.960
[Guest]: a book in preparing, preparing for this, it's a lonely activity, you know, now, if you want

02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:44.280
[Guest]: to put a spin on it, you call it solitude.

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.840
[Guest]: So which is why for the world of research, the world of teaching is great.

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:54.580
[Guest]: Because if you know, you're as a researcher, you're selfish, you know, self motivated.

02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:57.760
[Guest]: As a teacher, you have to give more than you take, right?

02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:01.880
[Guest]: And if a student, you know, shows you to be foolish, I actually enjoy it.

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:05.560
[Guest]: It means that, you know, I've trained my student to be smarter than me, right?

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560
[Guest]: Also keeps you grounded.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.040
[Guest]: I remember that, you know, I had gone for an interview with Dr. Manmohan Singh soon

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:16.120
[Guest]: after he stepped down as Prime Minister for the Nassim Mara book.

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:20.560
[Guest]: And he was, you know, elegance personified, you know, he spoke to me, he sat on the same,

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:24.920
[Guest]: you know, sofa that I did was reading, he saw me off, you know, he was in advanced years,

02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.680
[Guest]: he saw me off outside, you know, outside his house to the car.

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:31.520
[Guest]: And then I went from there to Ashoka University, right?

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:36.120
[Guest]: And as it was the first or second day of class, and as I was entering in the mess, there was

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:39.680
[Guest]: a bunch of students, you know, in a circle, and they didn't know who I was.

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.680
[Guest]: So I overheard them.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.880
[Guest]: And one of them says, you know, my teacher's name is Sitapati.

02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:46.880
[Guest]: And the other kid shouted, he should have been called Ram.

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:49.880
[Guest]: And then all of them laughed, right?

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:53.400
[Guest]: And it brought me down to earth immediately, right?

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:59.480
[Guest]: And for all the criticisms you have of cocky 17, 18, 19 year olds, they have the ability

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.680
[Guest]: to bring you to earth very quickly.

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.520
[Amit Varma]: It's such a fantastic story about how you end up being called Ram and Ram Guha will

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:15.200
[Unknown]: be wondering at this and thinking that he would be Sitapati Guha somewhere else.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.840
[Amit Varma]: Does being a tenured professor change your perception of time and how quickly you need

02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:23.080
[Amit Varma]: to do things and so on and so forth?

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Because I would imagine if you're a salaried person writing a book on the side, it's one

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.240
[Amit Varma]: kind of project.

02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.880
[Amit Varma]: If you are, you know, just a freelancer or a journalist writing a book on the side, it's

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.200
[Amit Varma]: another kind of project.

02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.640
[Amit Varma]: If you're a professor, you know, you've got more time, like you mentioned in your job,

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.600
[Amit Varma]: you get five months of the year when you can do whatever you want.

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.720
[Amit Varma]: So how does that then play into the kind of books that you want to write or that you think

02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.720
[Guest]: about?

02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:52.480
[Guest]: It's an enormous luxury, enormous, right?

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:57.240
[Guest]: Like, as I said, I have no illusions that academia are the smartest people on earth.

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:01.520
[Guest]: I certainly don't think academics are the most curious people on earth, right?

02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.960
[Guest]: Like most, you know, a lot of people outside of academia, many of them listening to your

02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:09.080
[Guest]: podcast are more curious than academics, maybe smarter than most academics.

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:13.160
[Guest]: It's just that they have a regular job and they want to earn and they want to, you know,

02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:14.160
[Guest]: support their family.

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:16.320
[Guest]: And these are all honorable things to do, right?

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:18.880
[Guest]: I'm deeply aware of that privilege, right?

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.200
[Guest]: Which is why I'm like, you know, if I, you know, if I'm not working on a book or an article,

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:25.080
[Guest]: I'm like, yaar, agar main nahi kar sakta hoon toh kaun karega?

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.720
[Guest]: Who should be, you know, because I've got a structure, I've got time, I've got, you

02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.800
[Guest]: know, for this kind of thing, all power to those who hold regular jobs, and who want

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.200
[Guest]: to write, you know, this, you know, I read a book on Panipat, written amateur book on

02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:42.800
[Guest]: Panipat, I mean, not amateur book, it's a very good book, but it's a historical book

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.000
[Guest]: on Panipat written by a eye doctor, who's doing this on the side, all power to him,

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.920
[Guest]: you know, I wish there were mechanisms in which people like that who are outside academia

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:58.800
[Guest]: formally, but who are brighter than most academics and more important, more curious and harder

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.120
[Guest]: working than most academics, who are able to engage with academia, academics can read

02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:08.040
[Guest]: the early drafts, give back feedback, I hope that there's a mechanism in which the synergy

02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:09.880
[Guest]: happens.

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:15.440
[Guest]: Because I'm very, very aware that I'm, I'm far luckier than they are.

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.400
[Guest]: And those you know, the and I don't use the word amateur in a negative way at all, I would

02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:25.800
[Guest]: just mean that non academic historians or non academic writers, I'm deeply aware of

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:31.360
[Guest]: how passionate they must be, because they are fighting the demons at home, the demons

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.280
[Guest]: at work and yet producing.

02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, even Narsimha Rao finally finished his book in his own day.

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:39.120
[Unknown]: That's right.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.120
[Unknown]: Yeah.

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:41.360
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's take a quick commercial break.

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:46.480
[Amit Varma]: And then we'll get to the crux of the matter, which is life in times of Narsimha Rao.

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:47.480
[Guest]: Thank you.

02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:53.960
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:58.840
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, the art of clear writing.

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.280
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community

02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.280
[Amit Varma]: interaction.

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.440
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:13.640
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.560
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:18.560
[Amit Varma]: it.

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:22.640
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing.

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.680
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.320
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:42.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:49.080
[Amit Varma]: And I'm chatting with Vinay Sitapati on his excellent book Half Lion on PV Narsimha Rao.

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:53.840
[Amit Varma]: One final meta question before we actually get to the book itself and to Narsimha Rao

02:19:53.840 --> 02:20:00.040
[Amit Varma]: itself, that out of all the possible subjects that you could have picked, you know, why

02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:04.080
[Amit Varma]: this specific subject you've already spoken about how you wondered would this be interesting

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:05.840
[Amit Varma]: to people and so on and so forth.

02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:10.580
[Amit Varma]: And I agreed with you that it's a crucial period of our history.

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:12.720
[Amit Varma]: But why Narsimha Rao itself?

02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And what did you think at the first was a core question behind the book, because one

02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:21.480
[Amit Varma]: of the core questions that you've articulated is understanding how Narsimha Rao achieved

02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.320
[Amit Varma]: so much despite having so little power.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:29.080
[Amit Varma]: But at the start of this, did you have a sense of how little power he actually had?

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:30.080
[Guest]: No, I didn't.

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:35.840
[Guest]: I actually didn't know much more about Narsimha Rao than what was there in the Wikipedia entry.

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:41.280
[Guest]: And in that sense, it was actually quite lucky because I didn't come in with baggage, I didn't

02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:46.280
[Guest]: come in with having to prove that I want to give Narsimha Rao his, you know, his space

02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.280
[Guest]: in the spotlight.

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.280
[Guest]: I didn't have any of that.

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:49.280
[Guest]: I'm not Telugu.

02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:54.320
[Guest]: You know, I have no particular interest in Narsimha Rao's like legacy, you know, in any

02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:56.080
[Guest]: personal sense.

02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:01.320
[Guest]: But as I told you right in the beginning of this conversation, you know, my own family's

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:04.040
[Guest]: fortunes and lives have changed in the early 90s.

02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:08.640
[Guest]: And I intuitively knew that the early 90s was a period of change in India.

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:13.880
[Guest]: And while I was doing my PhD at Princeton, I had even organized or co-organized a conference

02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:19.640
[Guest]: called the political consequences of economic growth, saying that when you have economic

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:23.560
[Guest]: growth in the 90s jumpstart, what are the political consequences?

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:27.400
[Guest]: And we had a panel there saying, what are the political predeterminants of economic

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.400
[Guest]: growth?

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.400
[Guest]: So what are the kind of politics you need for economic growth?

02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:37.360
[Guest]: So I was thinking a little bit at that time about, look, what were the political conditions?

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:42.600
[Guest]: And Narsimha Rao, of course, was prime minister in the early 90s when liberalization happened.

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:46.680
[Guest]: And then I read a book which transformed me, which was a book by Ezra Vogel, who's I think

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:51.860
[Guest]: a Yale historian on Deng Xiaoping and it was called Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation

02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:53.280
[Guest]: of China.

02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:54.880
[Guest]: And it was a two biographies.

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:57.880
[Guest]: It was a biography of China changing in the 80s.

02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:02.560
[Guest]: And it was a parallel biography of Deng Xiaoping who was instrumental in that change.

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:06.040
[Guest]: And I finished reading that book and I said, you know, a book like this needs to be written

02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.400
[Guest]: about India and it's about India changing in the 90s and the Deng Xiaoping trigger was

02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:13.560
[Guest]: this man called Narsimha Rao, who I didn't know much about.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:17.320
[Guest]: But that's what piqued my interest because even then, and maybe as a political scientist,

02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.200
[Guest]: I was like, look, change in India doesn't happen because of a blueprint or because of

02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:24.640
[Guest]: ideas or because of a technocrat.

02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:27.020
[Guest]: There also needs to be a political will.

02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:29.640
[Guest]: How did that political story unfold?

02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:33.080
[Guest]: And so that pushed me to Narsimha Rao, I still didn't know much.

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:37.880
[Guest]: And then I did some background research, I read up the secondary literature on the debates

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:43.800
[Guest]: on foreign policy changing in the 90s, economic policy, welfare schemes, and I said, ah, it's

02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:49.280
[Guest]: not just that the first McDonald's came in the early 90s, a lot else changed in India.

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:53.720
[Guest]: And then I was lucky enough, you know, by talking to people, one of them introduced

02:22:53.720 --> 02:23:01.400
[Guest]: me to Narsimha Rao's son, Prabhakar Rao, and I went all the way to Hyderabad to visit him.

02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:05.800
[Guest]: And as I was going to visit him, I just thought, you know, I was going to Hyderabad, hometown

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:08.560
[Guest]: of Narsimha Rao, everybody would know who he is.

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:12.320
[Guest]: And I got into this cab from the airport, and I was driving to Narsimha Rao's son's

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:16.880
[Guest]: house for the first time, and I asked the cab driver, have you heard of Narsimha Rao?

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:19.920
[Guest]: And the guy thought for a second and said, yeah, he's the guy on whom the flyover is

02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.040
[Guest]: named.

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:25.440
[Guest]: And so nobody knew about him, even in his hometown, that was a catastrophe, right?

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:29.360
[Guest]: And so I met Prabhakar Rao, and we got chatting, and then I met him a couple of times, I met

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.760
[Guest]: somebody else, others in his family.

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:35.880
[Guest]: And then he told me, look, Vinay, I've spoken to other members of my family, we've decided

02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:36.880
[Guest]: to trust you.

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:39.200
[Guest]: Until then, he was still KG, come with me.

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:45.160
[Guest]: And I went with him to his, in his office, I went to an attic of his office, where there

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:49.160
[Guest]: were about 45 cartons, and he said, you can access it, right?

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:52.640
[Guest]: If there's anything sensitive, I trust that you will run it through me.

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:53.960
[Guest]: But otherwise, you can access it.

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:59.020
[Guest]: And I told myself at that time itself, that I'm so lucky to have to deal with an air who's

02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:06.040
[Guest]: not like breathing down my neck, and not trying to, you know, censor everything I'm doing.

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:09.680
[Guest]: And then as I began to access the papers, I was mind blown.

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:13.280
[Guest]: I was like, this has never happened to any politician in India.

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:17.880
[Guest]: You know, Narsimha Rao, we had government documents with file notings on the left.

02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:22.480
[Guest]: There were Narsimha Rao's private diaries, even his books in various languages, Marathi,

02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:26.720
[Guest]: Hindi, English, I opened it and I could see his notings, right?

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:29.680
[Guest]: And so you had, you know, his letters, right?

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:32.000
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao was a was a fan of computers.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.760
[Guest]: So on a dot matrix printer, he used to print out his diary, he used to write down his diary.

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:43.480
[Guest]: So for example, when Rajiv Gandhi denies him a ticket in April 91, to contest the Lok Sabha

02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.800
[Guest]: elections, and so he's forced to retire.

02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:48.840
[Guest]: He writes that this is one of the saddest days of my life.

02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:51.280
[Guest]: So you have that level of intimacy, right?

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.440
[Guest]: Or another noting, the day after Rajiv has been murdered by the LTT, and his body has

02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:58.420
[Guest]: been brought to 10 Janpath.

02:24:58.420 --> 02:25:03.320
[Guest]: And all the congressmen are hovering around the body pretending to cry, but actually maneuvering

02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:05.440
[Guest]: to see who will succeed him.

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:10.040
[Guest]: And Narsimha Rao as he is there, Pranab Mukherjee sides by Narsimha Rao and said, look, you

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.080
[Guest]: should be the heir, you should be the next person.

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.160
[Guest]: And Narsimha Rao writes in his diary, I kept quiet saying it shouldn't be me, it should

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:22.080
[Guest]: be N.D. Tiwari, knowing full well that N.D. Tiwari was unacceptable, because I knew the

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.960
[Guest]: kind of person Pranab Mukherjee is, right?

02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:25.960
[Guest]: Think about it, right?

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:28.880
[Guest]: He, you know, you're getting that level of detail.

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:33.640
[Guest]: So you know, I'll be honest with you, Amit, the book success is primarily because I got,

02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:38.780
[Guest]: you know, I, you know, I got my hands on this incredible resource, which is the private

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:40.440
[Guest]: archives of Narsimha Rao.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:45.440
[Guest]: I of course did about 100 interviews to supplement it, but it's really those private archives.

02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.360
[Guest]: You know, if I had blown this up, you know, it would have been unforgivable, because after

02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:56.480
[Guest]: being given this kind of access, you know, it would have been unforgivable had it been

02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:58.360
[Guest]: a bad book.

02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.080
[Amit Varma]: That's such a fantastic story.

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I love the way you write about his early years as well.

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:09.200
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, early on in your book, you write quote, living on the edge of five

02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:14.680
[Amit Varma]: linguistic cultures, villagers here spoke Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, Kannada and even Samoria.

02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And in this land of the Nizam, the language of power was Urdu, while the language of courtly

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:19.960
[Amit Varma]: life was Persian.

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:22.760
[Amit Varma]: Narsimha Rao would go on to speak 10 languages.

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.360
[Amit Varma]: These were the tongues he inherited at birth.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, he taught himself Tamil, as you mentioned at a later point in the book,

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.600
[Amit Varma]: because he went to some felicitation of his in Tamil Nadu and couldn't understand what

02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:33.600
[Amit Varma]: was being said.

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:37.440
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, he learned three computer languages when he was in his 60s.

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:41.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, when Rajiv Gandhi was saying that, you know, we need to enter the computer age

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.440
[Amit Varma]: or such like, our older politicians can't do it and he called up his son and said, send

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.440
[Amit Varma]: me a computer.

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.440
[Guest]: That's right.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:50.320
[Amit Varma]: And before you know it, not just send me a computer, he's not doing Google search.

02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.720
[Guest]: He's programming in three languages.

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:54.720
[Guest]: Yeah, COBOL, BASIC and then you could write code in UNIX.

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:56.600
[Amit Varma]: And here's sort of my question.

02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.880
[Amit Varma]: He's born in June 29th, 1921 in this village called Bangara.

02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is 26 years before India becomes independent, right?

02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:14.840
[Amit Varma]: This is, you know, to think that till the age of 26, his conception of India was not

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:17.400
[Amit Varma]: what our conception of India is.

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:21.260
[Amit Varma]: His conception of society was not what our conception kind of is.

02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.480
[Amit Varma]: Most of the people around him was semi literate.

02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.700
[Amit Varma]: You speak about at one point when he's growing up, his father realizes that this little boy

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.320
[Amit Varma]: of mine already knows more than the village teacher.

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:34.560
[Amit Varma]: So he has to be sent to another village where he is all alone at the age of seven, just

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:35.560
[Amit Varma]: for education.

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:36.560
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:41.400
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, I can imagine that seven year old saying to himself, what you said to yourself

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:44.920
[Amit Varma]: when you got his papers that I can't waste this opportunity.

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:47.800
[Amit Varma]: And a seven year old must be thinking the same thing.

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:53.880
[Amit Varma]: So it's not as if you are figuring out thick desires and thin desires, or you know, what

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:54.880
[Amit Varma]: does a kid want?

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.400
[Amit Varma]: The kid has an opportunity.

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.080
[Amit Varma]: It is the only opportunity.

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.960
[Amit Varma]: He's got to get the job done, and that's kind of where he is.

02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.240
[Amit Varma]: And as a person writing about history, I'm being very careful not to use the word historian,

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:08.040
[Amit Varma]: you will note.

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:14.540
[Amit Varma]: As a person telling stories about the past, do you make that mental effort of forgetting

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:19.480
[Amit Varma]: everything that we know now, and just putting yourself in the shoes of that little boy and

02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:21.760
[Amit Varma]: tracing the journey that he is taking?

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.120
[Guest]: I try to do that, you know, it's hard, right?

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.640
[Guest]: Because I'm also keenly aware of the context.

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:30.000
[Guest]: And I think that's also important.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.000
[Guest]: So to give you one example, Nasma was a bright kid, right?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.280
[Guest]: And that's his all him.

02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:41.280
[Guest]: I mean, I don't want to sound rude here, but the rest of his family are no patch on him.

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:47.920
[Guest]: And as I mentioned that it was a wealthy family, they were revenue intermediaries for the Nizam.

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:50.520
[Guest]: But it was not an educated family, right?

02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:54.520
[Guest]: And part of that reason is structural, which you should know, which is that in Nizam's

02:28:54.520 --> 02:29:00.160
[Guest]: Hyderabad state, most of the officials and bureaucrats were Muslim.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:06.120
[Guest]: So for a Hindu, like Nasima Rao, the family, there was no particular government service

02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:07.280
[Guest]: at the end of education.

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.600
[Guest]: So why, you know, why take to education, right?

02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:12.600
[Guest]: You need to know this, right?

02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.400
[Guest]: But you also need to know that he is a bright man.

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:17.860
[Guest]: So there's both going together.

02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:20.800
[Guest]: So you have to have the internal world of Nasima Rao.

02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:23.240
[Guest]: He's a man who has a felicity for languages.

02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.760
[Guest]: But you should also know that he comes from a part of India, which is kind of, you know,

02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:32.680
[Guest]: northern Telangana, right, very, very close to the Maharashtra border, where within a

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:38.400
[Guest]: few hours, you could find people who spoke Kannada, who spoke Odia, who spoke Marathi,

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.720
[Guest]: and of course, who spoke Telugu, right?

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:44.840
[Guest]: And that matters because when I went to his village Vangara, there were people there who

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.940
[Guest]: knew a smattering of Kannada, who knew some Odia, who knew Marathi, so both matter, right?

02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:55.360
[Guest]: So as a biographer, I can't only look at the internal world of Nasima Rao, kind of the

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:59.360
[Guest]: triumph of the will, here's this bright man beating the odds, because the odds are determined

02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:01.040
[Guest]: by the circumstance.

02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:05.300
[Guest]: And that is a larger theme that, you know, runs through this book, which is this tension

02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:07.360
[Guest]: between structure and agency.

02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:11.120
[Guest]: I got to focus on Nasima Rao, but I got to look at the cards handed to him.

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:15.280
[Guest]: And the cards handed to him on language were actually a good set of cards, because he was

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:21.260
[Guest]: in the geographic absolute center of India, very close to Nagpur, but still in Telangana,

02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:25.440
[Guest]: in what is today's Telangana, and so he had access to all these languages.

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:29.300
[Guest]: But you know what, he played those cards very well.

02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:33.880
[Guest]: So I mentioned that between 77 and 1980, when the Moraji government is in power, the Congress

02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:34.880
[Guest]: is out of power.

02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:38.480
[Guest]: Nasima Rao is General Secretary in Delhi and has very little to do.

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:42.300
[Guest]: So you know what, what he does, he goes to JNU and enrolls in a Spanish language class

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:44.400
[Guest]: and learn Spanish, right?

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:49.240
[Guest]: And he drives his own car, parks his car in Jawaharlal Nehru University and learn Spanish,

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:50.240
[Guest]: right?

02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:51.400
[Guest]: Nobody else in his village does that.

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:56.400
[Guest]: And that's a good example of how agency and structure both matter in understanding Nasima

02:30:56.400 --> 02:30:57.400
[Guest]: Rao.

02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:58.400
[Guest]: Does that make sense, Amit?

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.720
[Amit Varma]: That makes a lot of sense.

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also sort of, like, I sometimes wonder that at one level, we are creatures of circumstance,

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.560
[Amit Varma]: like we discussed earlier, you know, combination of your genes and the things that happen to

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.600
[Amit Varma]: you and the life that you have.

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, the structure and in many ways, you could say structure even determines

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:16.440
[Amit Varma]: the agency to some extent.

02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:21.200
[Guest]: But they're separate, you know, they're separate, like, as I said, right, that, you know, there

02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:24.400
[Amit Varma]: are lots of people who speak many languages in Nasima Rao's village.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Nobody spoke 10.

02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:26.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:31.840
[Guest]: You know, so that's so and I don't want to see the Marxist reduce all possible agency

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.840
[Amit Varma]: to structure.

02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:33.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.840
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:35.840
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to do that.

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:40.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, whereas Hollywood reduces all structure to agency, you know, I don't do that either.

02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:46.640
[Amit Varma]: So the question I was coming at is this, that one view is that we are creatures of circumstance

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:47.960
[Amit Varma]: to a large extent.

02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:53.120
[Amit Varma]: The other view is that there is nevertheless something essential about people that survives

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.120
[Amit Varma]: through them.

02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Like when I look back on myself as a young person, on the one hand, I don't know how

02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:01.440
[Amit Varma]: anyone could have been friends with me when I was 20, because I was an absolute asshole.

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:03.600
[Amit Varma]: And hopefully one has changed.

02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:07.940
[Amit Varma]: And I would think I've changed enough to almost be a different person.

02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, there are some essential things that remain, like if you go on Facebook

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:16.440
[Amit Varma]: and you look at your school friends, and you might notice that they're all pretty much

02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:17.440
[Guest]: the same.

02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:18.440
[Guest]: Right.

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:20.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, they might be chubbier, they might look completely different, but the characteristics

02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.600
[Amit Varma]: are basically the same.

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And in trying to get to the essential in Nasima Rao, I was struck by this paragraph you wrote

02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:32.720
[Amit Varma]: about that separation at seven, when you wrote, quote, the separation of seven year old Rao

02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:36.960
[Amit Varma]: from his family would haunt him for the rest of his life, shaken from the settled rhythms

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:39.440
[Amit Varma]: that centuries of cultivation had given his family.

02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:43.440
[Amit Varma]: He was now on his own, visiting his parents only once every five months, education would

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:47.520
[Amit Varma]: propel Rao from village to town to city, into politics and into power, it would make him

02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:48.860
[Amit Varma]: Prime Minister of India.

02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:52.060
[Amit Varma]: But it would also cut him off from clan and community.

02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:55.520
[Amit Varma]: It would make him remote, squirreled away among ideas and words from which he could

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.720
[Amit Varma]: never be sent away.

02:32:56.720 --> 02:33:01.520
[Amit Varma]: He would develop a distant relationship with his children, a beleaguered one with his eldest

02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:05.160
[Amit Varma]: son Ranga, stop quote, and about his marriage, married at 10.

02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.520
[Amit Varma]: And he resented that marriage.

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:10.120
[Amit Varma]: And he resented that that lasted 40 years, but he was at a distance from it.

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:11.320
[Amit Varma]: Most of the time he was somewhere else.

02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:16.640
[Amit Varma]: He had other fulfilling relationships, as you point out, and everybody involved kind

02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:18.720
[Unknown]: of goes through the motions.

02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:26.160
[Amit Varma]: And that sense of him always being a perennial outsider, you know, sort of disaffected, never

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:33.200
[Amit Varma]: having close confidants, or at least not, not a multiplicity of them not having someone

02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:37.600
[Amit Varma]: whom he could think of as his clan or his community, perhaps that's a sense he gets

02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:43.000
[Amit Varma]: that he's a loner, this is a path he's on, he's maneuvering his way through it.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:48.160
[Amit Varma]: And eventually history places him at this point in time, and he does what he has to

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:49.160
[Amit Varma]: do.

02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:53.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, so when you read his papers, is, you know, that's one sense and am I correct in

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:57.400
[Amit Varma]: thinking that this seems essential to me, this para seems essential to me.

02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Apart from that, what else do you sense about him?

02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:08.800
[Amit Varma]: Like we have spoken of his sort of almost fatalistic tendency to accept the cards given

02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:13.920
[Amit Varma]: to him and then do whatever is rational, whether it is in the wildness of not acting before

02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:21.560
[Amit Varma]: the 84 riots, or whether it is in the enormous will that he did show in 91 when he took over

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:24.720
[Amit Varma]: with the country in a mess and acted to kind of resolve it.

02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:30.360
[Amit Varma]: So if you had to, say, give an elevator speech description of Narasimha Rao, the person,

02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, to someone who doesn't know anything about him, a man from Mars, what would you

02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:34.800
[Guest]: say?

02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:39.200
[Guest]: So I would say that the description you gave of an introvert, lonely introvert is a core

02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.400
[Guest]: feature, but it's half the story.

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:45.000
[Guest]: The other half is that he's curious and action oriented.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.720
[Guest]: So he has a bit of Hamlet, which is what you just described, and he has a bit of Don Quixote,

02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:51.480
[Guest]: which is an actor, right?

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:55.480
[Guest]: So you know, the sort of I think it was Dostoevsky, but I could be wrong, who said that the two

02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:00.640
[Guest]: great Western fictional figures is Hamlet and Don Quixote, one who thinks but doesn't

02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:05.160
[Guest]: act, and the other who acts without thinking and Narasimha Rao exemplified both.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:09.040
[Guest]: And I think that's important, because what you just described and the paragraph you just

02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:18.040
[Guest]: read, gives rise to an introvert who loves books, who's a theoretician.

02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.760
[Guest]: And that is a well known feature of Narasimha Rao, right?

02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:25.680
[Guest]: Even a negative feature, the joke about him is analysis until paralysis, that he used

02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:28.120
[Guest]: to pout without spouting, right?

02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:34.600
[Guest]: And that gives rise to kind of the stereotype of a distant intellectual, who is like Nero,

02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.320
[Guest]: you know, when the Rome is burning.

02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:37.720
[Guest]: And that's absolutely not true.

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:38.720
[Guest]: That's half the story.

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:41.480
[Guest]: The other half is he was curious.

02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:45.200
[Guest]: He was action oriented, you know, I spent some time talking about how he brings about

02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:49.920
[Guest]: agricultural reforms in his own village, how he makes modification to the cotton plant

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.200
[Guest]: to push people from growing rice, you get less money from rice into growing cotton,

02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.600
[Guest]: he goes to Gujarat, he gets the cotton seed, how as Prime Minister of India, I give so

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:03.800
[Guest]: many examples of how he's rolling his sleeves and is at the center of economic reforms.

02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:06.320
[Guest]: He's not just a theoretician in the background.

02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:12.240
[Guest]: His genius was that to pretend to be a theoretician, so that he did not get the blame for liberalization,

02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:13.240
[Guest]: right?

02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:19.160
[Guest]: But the heart of the book is to show you the other end of the or the reverse of the para

02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.680
[Guest]: that you quoted that here was an action oriented curious guy, who knew how to get the job done,

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:25.680
[Guest]: right?

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:30.080
[Guest]: And so the duality of Narsimha Rao, which is why the title of the book is Half Lion,

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:34.240
[Guest]: is that he was half a thinker, but he was half a doer.

02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:40.400
[Guest]: And at his best, this synergy between an intellectual with deep analytical skills, and a man who

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:45.520
[Guest]: understood every inch of the state and how to bring about transformation in India is

02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:46.960
[Guest]: a central feature of the man.

02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.640
[Guest]: So he had a bit the best of Don Quixote and the best of Hamlet, right?

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:55.940
[Guest]: I would say that duality at its best gives rise to Narsimha Rao.

02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:58.120
[Guest]: And that is really the central feature of this book.

02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:01.560
[Guest]: If he was only a thinker, he would not have been able to transform India.

02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:05.700
[Guest]: And if he was a doer, he wouldn't know what to transform and how to go about it.

02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:09.560
[Amit Varma]: This is such a fascinating way to think about the man and, you know, just thinking of your

02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:14.160
[Amit Varma]: book, for example, his period as Chief Minister, I think he was more Don Quixote than Hamlet.

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:18.600
[Unknown]: And we'll sort of get to that.

02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:23.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, here's my other question, and a key way in which Narsimha Rao is different from so

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:26.920
[Amit Varma]: many people before and after him in Indian politics.

02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'd once written a column on Narendra Modi based on something a friend of his told

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000
[Amit Varma]: me.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.840
[Amit Varma]: This person was friendly with him in the aughties, he worked with him in Gujarat.

02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.300
[Amit Varma]: And she described how she was once at his home, and it was a gathering of personal friends

02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:42.120
[Amit Varma]: and people he knew personally.

02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:46.620
[Amit Varma]: And Mr. Modi started telling a story about how his mother had been very ill once.

02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And he went to switch on the fan and he switched it on and the fan didn't turn on because there

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.560
[Amit Varma]: was no electricity.

02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And as he said, narrated the story, he started crying.

02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And my friend's point in telling me the story about Modi was that he is an experiential

02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Prime Minister, what I would call an aankho dekhi politician.

02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.120
[Amit Varma]: So when he comes to power in Gujarat as Chief Minister, what are his priorities?

02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:11.760
[Amit Varma]: It's electricity because he's experienced it himself.

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.120
[Amit Varma]: It's roads because he's walked on them, he's experienced it himself.

02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.920
[Amit Varma]: But his great failing as a Prime Minister is that his knowledge is limited to that.

02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:26.760
[Amit Varma]: He is not expanding his knowledge and there are some concepts which are beyond experience,

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:29.520
[Amit Varma]: spontaneous order, positive sum game, so on and so forth.

02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And that becomes his failing because then he cannot possibly get a handle on the economy

02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:36.600
[Amit Varma]: or on the larger currents in society and so on.

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And the point of my column was read more because we form pictures of the world by joining dots,

02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.240
[Amit Varma]: our experience only gives us so many dots.

02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:44.240
[Amit Varma]: You have to read more.

02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.840
[Amit Varma]: You can't blame Modi for not being a reader as a kid because circumstances, humble background,

02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.120
[Amit Varma]: not his fault at all.

02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.240
[Amit Varma]: But then what you should do is try to cultivate a reading habit and at least surround yourself

02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.720
[Amit Varma]: with experts, people who know and, you know, not try to imagine that your folksy instincts

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:00.840
[Amit Varma]: will be right in every particular.

02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And it seems that Narsimha Rao is not just the opposite of this, but that is in fact

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:12.080
[Amit Varma]: an outlier among politicians in the sense that one of the threads that struck me through

02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:17.480
[Amit Varma]: your book is how this guy is constantly reading, reading, reading, learning, learning, learning.

02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Even that example in his 60s, he gets a computer, he doesn't learn how to surf Google.

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:23.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there wasn't Google then.

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:25.680
[Amit Varma]: He learns three computer languages.

02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:29.080
[Amit Varma]: You've described in another incident that he goes to his village and there is some fancy

02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:31.000
[Amit Varma]: machine which isn't working.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.720
[Amit Varma]: And he actually opens it up himself, figures out that the steel is dry and that might be

02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:38.760
[Amit Varma]: one reason the motor is not rotating and he has it lubricated with kerosene and the next

02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:39.760
[Amit Varma]: day it works.

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:40.760
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:42.040
[Amit Varma]: So, and again, a man of action here.

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is really a combination in a sense of the introspective Hamlet thinking about

02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:49.740
[Amit Varma]: stuff and Don Quixote actually acting on it.

02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:56.040
[Amit Varma]: This I find remarkable because I, you know, I can't think of other figures in Indian society.

02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:00.400
[Amit Varma]: Definitely Nehru, obviously a very well-read man and also a man of action, but also a man

02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:06.000
[Amit Varma]: closed in certain ways to reconsidering his priors, whereas Narasimha Rao till the end

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.400
[Amit Varma]: of his life was always reconsidering his priors, most notably for liberalization, because he

02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:12.920
[Amit Varma]: was a socialist until then.

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:19.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about this sort of aspect of the man and how this played into what his trajectory

02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:25.500
[Amit Varma]: was that like at one level, it is a bunch of accidents which take him to the top.

02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:30.360
[Amit Varma]: At another level, it is the fact that he wasn't tribal and therefore he was always a contributor

02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:34.320
[Amit Varma]: or a convenient compromise candidate, whether when he became chief minister or prime minister

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.480
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.080
[Amit Varma]: But was this urge also a big factor?

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:45.300
[Amit Varma]: And does it not make doubly tragic that the elites of Delhi, you know, look down on him

02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:47.600
[Amit Varma]: almost as a country bumpkin kind of person?

02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's a story where Rajiv Gandhi is sitting with a friend and Narasimha Rao,

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:55.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, just puts his foot on his lap and he's scratching his foot, which is like a

02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:56.320
[Guest]: common...

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.320
[Guest]: His foot as in puts Narasimha Rao's foot.

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, he puts his own foot on his lap and he's scratching it, as in fact, I'm practically

02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:02.400
[Unknown]: doing now.

02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.240
[Amit Varma]: My foot is on my lap as we speak right now, on my green sole chair.

02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.480
[Amit Varma]: And Rajiv Gandhi's friend whispers in his ear and then with great disgust, you know,

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:12.440
[Amit Varma]: grabs a foot and puts it back down.

02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, they're treating him like a country bumpkin, but they are the well educated

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:20.200
[Amit Varma]: English speaking sophisticated country bumpkins and he's a man of learning and knowledge.

02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:21.600
[Guest]: No, you're absolutely right.

02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.880
[Guest]: You know, that story is Rajiv Gandhi is, you know, sitting opposite Narasimha Rao and you

02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:29.920
[Guest]: know, in the villages, sometimes you find somebody, people sitting cross legged or with

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:35.040
[Guest]: the foot, you know, on your other thigh and you're massaging your foot while talking,

02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.560
[Guest]: you know, in elite, in sort of urban settings, you don't do that, but Narasimha Rao was doing

02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.000
[Guest]: that and Rajiv Gandhi's friend whispers into Rajiv Gandhi and then, you know, puts Narasimha

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.360
[Guest]: Rao's foot down, which is quite humiliating, right?

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:53.240
[Guest]: But it brings to a different sort of insecurity that Narasimha Rao had, which is that he was

02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:56.200
[Guest]: a man of enormous learning, right?

02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:59.560
[Guest]: Yet it was a learning unmediated by the West.

02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.500
[Guest]: So he, you know, I think English was the fifth language he learned.

02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:04.960
[Guest]: So he was already a cosmopolitan, right?

02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:09.920
[Guest]: He goes to, if my memory serves, he goes to the abroad to the US for the first time only

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:12.840
[Guest]: in 1952, right?

02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:17.040
[Guest]: To visit his daughter Saraswati, who's having her first child.

02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:19.960
[Guest]: He goes to New York and that's a transformative experience.

02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:22.360
[Guest]: But you know, that's the first time he goes there.

02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:28.080
[Guest]: He was an accomplished translator from Marathi to Telugu, from Hindi to Telugu.

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.520
[Guest]: He could campaign, you know, like in India, we know of people campaigning in two different

02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.520
[Guest]: constituencies.

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:38.000
[Guest]: But when was the last time you heard of people campaigning simultaneously in Marathi and

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.560
[Guest]: in Telugu, right?

02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:44.040
[Guest]: When he was campaigning in Hanamkonda, because he contested two seats, Hanamkonda and Ramtek.

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.280
[Guest]: Ramtek is near Nagpur in Maharashtra.

02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:48.440
[Guest]: He's contesting in two languages.

02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:52.880
[Guest]: And then he contests later on in Bairampur in Odisha and campaigns in Odia, right?

02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:58.880
[Guest]: So here was a man under whom, you know, to be honest with you, Rajiv Gandhi is an intellectual

02:42:58.880 --> 02:42:59.880
[Guest]: pygmy, right?

02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:04.080
[Guest]: I mean, no disrespect to Rajiv Gandhi, but where and where are we talking about?

02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:08.320
[Guest]: And yet look at the stereotypes we build for ourselves that somebody who goes to Cambridge

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:12.560
[Guest]: University and somebody who may have gone, you know, to an elite school, Doon School

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.120
[Guest]: or whatever is, I'm not sure Rajiv went there, I think he did.

02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:17.720
[Amit Varma]: I think he went to Doon School.

02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.240
[Guest]: He's just considered to be, you know, modern and intellectual cosmopolitan and Narsimha

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:25.240
[Guest]: Rao's seen as a country bumpkin.

02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:29.280
[Guest]: As Natwar Singh told me, and I quoted in the book, Natwar Singh was former foreign minister

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:31.040
[Guest]: of India.

02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:34.200
[Guest]: Unlike Nehru, Narsimha Rao did not have to discover India.

02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:35.560
[Guest]: He already knew it.

02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:41.400
[Guest]: He had a deep sense of the local indigenous culture of India and cultures of India.

02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:45.520
[Guest]: You know, his Urdu was so good that when the president of Pakistan, Farooq Lagari comes

02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:51.560
[Guest]: to Delhi, Narsimha Rao talks to him and his Urdu is better than Farooq Lagari's Urdu.

02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.520
[Guest]: As a student, his Persian was excellent.

02:43:54.520 --> 02:44:00.600
[Guest]: So this is a man who was an unusual cosmopolitan, but Amit, I have to emphasize this that lot

02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:07.400
[Guest]: of people see this aspect to Narsimha Rao to the exclusion of his action oriented side.

02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.600
[Guest]: They see this as the Hamlet side of Narsimha Rao, not the Don Quixote side.

02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:15.920
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao had held every single position in India, you know, from a local position

02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:21.400
[Guest]: to state minister, chief minister, union minister, before he became prime minister.

02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.760
[Guest]: He had a ton of conventional experience.

02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:28.040
[Guest]: In that sense, when Rajiv Gandhi died, he was a conventional candidate because he was

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:31.480
[Guest]: the most experienced candidate in government.

02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:36.460
[Guest]: You know, there was talk of him as you mentioned earlier in this episode of him becoming president

02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:39.580
[Guest]: of India in I think 1982 and again 1987.

02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:42.600
[Guest]: So he was almost up there, right?

02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:45.260
[Guest]: And so in some sense, he was an uncommon intellect.

02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:48.760
[Guest]: He had uncommon experience and a man of action.

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:52.880
[Guest]: That combination is very, very, very hard to find, you know.

02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:56.600
[Guest]: And I think India was, you know, this is one of the central points of the book that India

02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:02.040
[Guest]: was very lucky to have a man with this kind of intellect, this kind of experience and

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:08.700
[Guest]: this kind of action oriented self when India had this kind of crisis in 1991.

02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:15.160
[Guest]: So it was a, India, you know, should thank its stars that the confluence of events that

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.600
[Guest]: took place in 1991 was luckily in India's favor.

02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:24.320
[Guest]: It could, you know, just imagine in a similar situation, Andy Tiwari, who is not a man of

02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:28.680
[Guest]: action, who is not particularly learned and who has experience.

02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:29.960
[Guest]: So I give him that, right?

02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:35.000
[Guest]: He has been chief minister of, several times he has been chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.960
[Guest]: Then he became chief minister of Uttarakhand.

02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:39.680
[Guest]: But he lacks the other two, he's not a man of action.

02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And he certainly is not an intellectual.

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:43.160
[Amit Varma]: But he was enormously virile.

02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Apparently, he was bonking people well into his 80s, right?

02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:50.120
[Guest]: There was a video, I think he was Andhra Pradesh governor.

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And there was a video, he had to step down as a consequence.

02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:57.720
[Amit Varma]: And he could have bonked India as well, if he was prime minister.

02:45:57.720 --> 02:45:58.720
[Amit Varma]: What am I saying?

02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Have I ever used a word like this on my show?

02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:07.880
[Amit Varma]: But so to kind of continue, and what also struck me is that it's almost as if the rest

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:14.160
[Amit Varma]: of his life in different ways, was preparation for the role that he played in 91, like, you

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.640
[Amit Varma]: know, the Don Quixote side of him in 1972, when he becomes chief minister of AP would

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:20.760
[Amit Varma]: have been a complete disaster in 92.

02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:26.680
[Amit Varma]: I was, you know, looking at just immediately post-independency alliance against the Nizam.

02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And you write about it, quote, the ensuing struggle against the Nizam brought together

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:33.440
[Amit Varma]: the unlikeliest of allies.

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:37.360
[Amit Varma]: The Indian National Congress wanted to dethrone him and integrate Hyderabad straight into

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:38.880
[Amit Varma]: secular democratic India.

02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.680
[Amit Varma]: The Hindu Mahasabha and Arya Samaj disliked the Islamic ruler, and in Telangana region,

02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.040
[Amit Varma]: an armed insurrection against landlords had morphed into a communist rebellion.

02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:53.120
[Amit Varma]: These three elements gave rise to an anti-Nizam movement that was secular, religious and radical

02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:55.040
[Amit Varma]: all at once, stop quote.

02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:00.080
[Amit Varma]: And so there is a scaldron where there are all these different forces coming together.

02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:04.200
[Amit Varma]: And Narasimha Rao is a young man, he's in his late 20s at this point, kind of watching

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.200
[Amit Varma]: all of this.

02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:10.680
[Amit Varma]: He has, you know, one mentor in Ramananda Tirtha, who is more of a radical kind of leader.

02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Another leader is sort of Burgula Ramakrishna Rao, as you describe, much more moderate.

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:17.440
[Guest]: He becomes the first chief minister of Hyderabad state.

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Who becomes the first chief minister and much more moderate and all that.

02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And this is the point you write about how Narasimha Rao decides not to choose sides.

02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Like his daughter Eswani Devi described him as an ajat shatru, someone with no enemies.

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And to me, this also seems like a really fundamental quality in what he achieved in 1991 onwards.

02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, just building that consensus, bringing people together, making it happen,

02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:44.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of all of that.

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:48.340
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about those early years.

02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:50.280
[Amit Varma]: What kind of politician was he?

02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:51.720
[Amit Varma]: Was he an ambitious politician?

02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Did he want to rise to the top?

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.280
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense of those sort of years?

02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Like your first chapter is, this chapter is titled Andhra Socialist 1921-71, 50 years,

02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.080
[Amit Varma]: big span of time.

02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:06.120
[Amit Varma]: What's happening as he gets from here to there?

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:07.960
[Guest]: So two things, Amit.

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.640
[Guest]: One is that to understand what Narasimha Rao is up to in this period, you know, 51-71,

02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:15.060
[Guest]: you have to understand the structure of the Congress Party.

02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.080
[Guest]: The Congress Party is India at that time.

02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:21.560
[Guest]: Some of your younger listeners may find that hard to believe when they see today's Congress

02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:23.960
[Guest]: Party, but the Congress was India.

02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.400
[Guest]: And the Congress structure was built around different factions, right?

02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.220
[Guest]: So there was no opposition party of any worth.

02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:33.800
[Guest]: So the opposition parties of India were within the Congress.

02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:36.280
[Guest]: So there was a left wing, there was a right wing, there was a Dalit wing, there was a

02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:40.760
[Guest]: Brahmin wing, there was a pro-landlord wing, there was a pro-tenant wing, there was a pro-farmer

02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:42.600
[Guest]: wing, there was a pro-consumer wing.

02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:44.120
[Guest]: That's the nature of Congress Party.

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:49.360
[Guest]: And at another level, there was a Burgul Ramkrishna Rao wing, there was a Ramananthirtha wing.

02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:53.880
[Guest]: In other words, there were factions which are based on personalities as much as ideology,

02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:55.960
[Guest]: something that you see in India even today.

02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:57.760
[Guest]: So you and I, Amit, are in Maharashtra.

02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:02.760
[Guest]: And if you look at the Congress today in Maharashtra, well, it may be very small, but even so there's

02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:08.280
[Guest]: a Prithviraj Chavan wing, there's a Ashok Chavan wing, etc., etc.

02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.400
[Guest]: That's just a structure of the Congress, right?

02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:13.940
[Guest]: And when all these different wings and faction leaders are fighting about who should become

02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:18.080
[Guest]: chief minister, no one of them can become chief minister because the others threaten

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:19.120
[Guest]: to leave.

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:21.800
[Guest]: And what you end up with is a consensus candidate, right?

02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:22.920
[Guest]: That's what you end up with.

02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:28.720
[Guest]: Nassim Rao's genius was he was always a consensus candidate because he never had a faction behind

02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:29.720
[Guest]: him.

02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:31.240
[Guest]: He never sought to cultivate people.

02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:33.160
[Guest]: He never sought to build a power base.

02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.000
[Guest]: Now, this might sound foolish, you know, in politics, you should have chamchas, you should

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.000
[Guest]: have cronies.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.560
[Guest]: Nassim Rao lacked this.

02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:42.560
[Guest]: That's why he was seen as safe by everybody around him.

02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:46.440
[Guest]: That's why in 1971, he becomes chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.

02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:50.520
[Guest]: And I must emphasize here for those of you who haven't read the book Half Lion that,

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:56.720
[Guest]: that period 1971 to 73 is very important in understanding Nassim Rao because that's when

02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:01.200
[Guest]: he is Don Quixote, you know, Indira Gandhi selects him because she wants to push for

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:05.600
[Guest]: a left wing reform, which is land reform in Andhra Pradesh.

02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:13.040
[Guest]: She wants to move, land has already moved from the zamindars to the revenue intermediaries,

02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:16.840
[Guest]: the Deshmukhs or the Doras, who are the spine of the Congress party.

02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:19.440
[Guest]: These are the Reddys, the Brahmins, the Khammas.

02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.080
[Guest]: And Indira Gandhi wants to move the next level to give land to the tiller and to the landless

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.120
[Guest]: Dalits.

02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:27.080
[Guest]: And that's what Nassim Rao decides to do.

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.160
[Guest]: He gives provocative speeches.

02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:30.840
[Guest]: This antagonizes landlords.

02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:33.680
[Guest]: This antagonizes other castes such as Khammas and Reddys.

02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:35.400
[Guest]: They protest against him.

02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:40.840
[Guest]: And Nassim Rao who feels he's in an honorable cause, he's a rebel, he's a revolutionary,

02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:44.880
[Guest]: he goes all out, he goes on the forefront.

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:49.200
[Guest]: The protests he gets are so strong, Nassim Rao has to step down.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.320
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi asks him to step down and he feels his career is over.

02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:58.060
[Guest]: The big lesson he learns from this is that if you want to bring about reform, you have

02:50:58.060 --> 02:51:00.000
[Guest]: to do it through the back door.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.920
[Guest]: You have to do it subtly, otherwise the enemies to reform will gang up against you and you

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:07.720
[Guest]: will have, you will be destroyed, you will have to step down.

02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:10.720
[Guest]: It's the single biggest learning he takes as Prime Minister.

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:15.520
[Guest]: There's no doubt in his mind that India has to change on economics, on welfare schemes,

02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:21.280
[Guest]: on foreign policy, but he has to do it in a way that doesn't antagonize his enemies,

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:25.280
[Guest]: that doesn't antagonize those who are upholding the older order.

02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:30.520
[Guest]: For that you need subterfuge, you need to pretend to not do anything while doing something.

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:35.720
[Guest]: That is Nassim Rao's great genius and he learns that by being a failure as Chief Minister.

02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:39.520
[Guest]: Now look, many Chief Ministers in India fail, many politicians fail.

02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:45.040
[Guest]: What makes Nassim Rao unique is he converts his own failure into a learning experience

02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:49.840
[Guest]: and he realizes what not to do and when he comes back to power, he's a chastened man,

02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:54.880
[Guest]: which means you must reform, you must change, India has to change, but you have to do it

02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:02.000
[Guest]: in a way in which you pretend to continuity and that is the genius of Nassim Rao.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And the other lesson in this and I wonder if you would say that it's an early example

02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:11.600
[Amit Varma]: of the Congress's centralizing impulse is in that concept of the nominated Chief Minister,

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:16.640
[Amit Varma]: that basically Indira Gandhi took over power at the center, started centralizing power

02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:21.240
[Amit Varma]: and decided that she wanted a Chief Minister who would do her bidding, not necessarily

02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:26.320
[Amit Varma]: someone who has roots and who has independent power of her own and in a sense, she's kind

02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:32.280
[Amit Varma]: of trying to gather weak men who cannot threaten her around herself and Nassim Rao being an

02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:38.120
[Amit Varma]: early version of this and this then leads to the dilemma that while he is politically

02:52:38.120 --> 02:52:41.080
[Amit Varma]: weak, the reason he is there is he doesn't have backing of his own.

02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:46.280
[Amit Varma]: He's not a, you know, mass leader in that sense, so he always won the elections he contested,

02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:51.080
[Amit Varma]: but except the very first one, but he's not a mass leader in that sense and he's politically

02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:55.620
[Amit Varma]: weak, but he's been put in a position of strength, but he can't really do much in that position

02:52:55.620 --> 02:53:00.160
[Amit Varma]: of strength as he finds out when he's in his Don Quixote phase.

02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:04.880
[Amit Varma]: And is there something broader also happening here that what happened to him in the microcosm

02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:09.600
[Amit Varma]: is also happening at a larger level, where Indira Gandhi by strengthening herself actually

02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:10.600
[Guest]: weakens the Congress?

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:11.600
[Guest]: Oh, absolutely.

02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:20.200
[Guest]: I mean, I would look upon that period, which is 1967, 68, 69, 70, all the way to 71, as

02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:25.440
[Guest]: I would say the worst four years in India's first republic, because by deinstitutionalizing

02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:30.600
[Guest]: the Congress by doing exactly what you said, Indira Gandhi sets the tone for other political

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.600
[Guest]: parties.

02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:37.040
[Guest]: So all the regional parties, caste based parties that are growing in India post 1967, they

02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:41.080
[Guest]: are looking at the Indira Gandhi model of the Congress, not the Nehru model of the Congress.

02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:47.360
[Guest]: And even today, if you look at the state we are in, right, Shiv Sena is completely deinstitutionalized.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:51.440
[Guest]: You know, the father headed the Shiv Sena, now the son heads it and his chief minister

02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:56.120
[Guest]: and, you know, soon the grandson will head it, right, Aditya Thackeray would head it.

02:53:56.120 --> 02:54:01.360
[Guest]: And in doing so, you know, older leaders, leaders who want to rise will go, you know,

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:02.720
[Guest]: will be furious, right?

02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:06.280
[Guest]: The same deinstitutionalized story you are seeing in the DMK to some extent, right?

02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:08.520
[Guest]: The father has given way to Stalin.

02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:12.000
[Guest]: And a lot of the regional bosses are like, when will our turn come, right?

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:17.440
[Guest]: So that's, so the tragedy that you mentioned that is going on during this period, 67 to

02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.000
[Guest]: 71, is not just something Indira Gandhi inflicts on the Congress.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:27.000
[Guest]: It's something that by mimicking, right, all other political parties bar the communists

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:30.960
[Guest]: and the BJP are mimicking, are taking from Indira Gandhi.

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:32.600
[Guest]: And I think that's a serious tragedy.

02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:37.840
[Guest]: And I think one of the big problems in Indian politics is how deinstitutionalized and hollowed

02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:40.400
[Guest]: out parties have become in India.

02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:44.160
[Guest]: And I worry that that period set the template for it.

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:48.360
[Amit Varma]: And did that then also make feudalism inevitable?

02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:53.800
[Amit Varma]: For example, I was telling you just before this that I read this delightful sort of essay

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:59.280
[Amit Varma]: on Leela Naidu by one of her friends, where Leela Naidu, he mentions at one point that

02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:02.520
[Amit Varma]: when she grew older, she would constantly share gossip with him.

02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:05.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the pieces of gossip that she shared is that she had heard that Indira Gandhi's

02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:10.480
[Amit Varma]: daughters-in-law kept the fridge locked, so that the servants could not access the food

02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:12.800
[Amit Varma]: because they were worried the servants would steal the food.

02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:15.000
[Amit Varma]: So they didn't care if the food went to waste.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.800
[Amit Varma]: But they kept the fridge locked because they wanted control of it.

02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:23.360
[Amit Varma]: And that feels like what the Gandhis have actually done to the Congress Party today.

02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:27.640
[Amit Varma]: Of course, when I mentioned this before the recording, you gave the counterpoint to that,

02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:30.200
[Amit Varma]: that in 2009, one would not have said this.

02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:31.960
[Amit Varma]: But that is kind of where we are.

02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:38.680
[Amit Varma]: But then does that centralizing impulse inevitably mean that there will be feudalism?

02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:42.920
[Amit Varma]: Because if there aren't alternative leaders around a leader to challenge them, then the

02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:49.760
[Amit Varma]: family or the people, you know, in the greatest proximity to power will eventually make sure

02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:55.720
[Amit Varma]: they hold the power and their popular leaders simply therefore aren't allowed to emerge

02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:56.720
[Guest]: in any way.

02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:00.360
[Guest]: Yeah, and I think it's, yeah, I completely agree with you.

02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:07.560
[Guest]: And it goes one step further, which is over time, family control of political parties

02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:09.920
[Guest]: become a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?

02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:14.720
[Guest]: Which is that the family says that look, unless we have a family, the second-rung leaders

02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:19.840
[Guest]: are so corrupt and so self-serving, that they will split the party and destroy the party.

02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:22.240
[Guest]: That unfortunately also happens to be true.

02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.120
[Guest]: So today, if you say that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi should leave

02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:30.960
[Guest]: the party, I don't quite trust the others in the political party, right?

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:36.360
[Guest]: But that is a consequence of now several decades of hauling out that began with Indira Gandhi.

02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:40.560
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi is right to say that eventually there was nobody but Indira Gandhi who could

02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:43.900
[Guest]: hold the party together, but that's a process that she started.

02:56:43.900 --> 02:56:48.800
[Guest]: And so, you know, Sonia Gandhi today is in this conundrum, right?

02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:52.680
[Guest]: Which is that it is a feudal party in the sense that, you know, or let's say it's a

02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:57.560
[Guest]: family-based party, but the alternative to a family-based party might even be worse.

02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:00.080
[Guest]: It may not be a democratic party, right?

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:05.160
[Guest]: The instincts of the second-tier Congress leaders that we see today are not particularly

02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:07.320
[Guest]: non-feudal, right?

02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:11.240
[Guest]: So you are choosing between two suboptimal or two worse outcomes.

02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:16.800
[Guest]: In one outcome, you have the Nehru-Gandhis in power, in the other outcome, you don't

02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:20.400
[Guest]: have them in power and things are even worse in the Congress, right?

02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:27.760
[Guest]: So I do feel that that period is a terrible period in India and it could have gone differently.

02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:32.720
[Guest]: I mean, frankly, Indira Gandhi, had she not done this, maybe in the 1971 elections, the

02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:36.840
[Guest]: Congress would have lost, but you know, they lost six years later in 1977.

02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:40.480
[Guest]: All that meant was Indira Gandhi six years earlier would have been in opposition, she

02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:45.760
[Guest]: would have come back to power, but she wouldn't have destroyed the party for just three, four

02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:48.160
[Guest]: extra years in power.

02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And is it inevitable in just the structure of parties and the nature of power?

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the structure of parties in India, but the nature of power is universal in that

02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:59.240
[Amit Varma]: power corrupts always.

02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:04.360
[Amit Varma]: So is it then necessary that even a party like the BJP will eventually go down that

02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:05.360
[Amit Varma]: road?

02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Like at one point, you could have said that institutionally is pretty decentralized, you've

02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:10.600
[Amit Varma]: got local leaders, you've got shit happening.

02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Recently, one hears about how, you know, Modi and Shah have centralized a lot of the power

02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.040
[Amit Varma]: and you have perhaps one rival power source coming up in Adityanath.

02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.760
[Amit Varma]: As someone who studied the BJP really closely, do you feel that, you know, there is a move

02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:25.760
[Amit Varma]: in that direction?

02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Or are there safeguards within the party, which will not allow it to happen?

02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:33.080
[Amit Varma]: And if so, what are those safeguards that were not there in the Congress?

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:36.600
[Guest]: So I actually pushed back a little bit, I don't think it's inevitable, right?

02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:43.280
[Guest]: I don't think what Indira Gandhi did in the early 19, in the late 60s, early 70s was inevitable.

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:48.040
[Guest]: I think power corrupts, but that doesn't follow that the cadre is destroyed and one individual

02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:49.040
[Guest]: seizes power.

02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:50.040
[Guest]: It doesn't follow.

02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:51.040
[Guest]: Right?

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:54.760
[Guest]: I'll give you the DMK example that even though Stalin is in power, they still have somewhat

02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:57.800
[Guest]: of a cadre, the communists, of course, they don't have power, but they still have somewhat

02:58:57.800 --> 02:58:58.800
[Guest]: of a cadre.

02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:01.320
[Guest]: The BJP definitely has a strong cadre, right?

02:59:01.320 --> 02:59:05.120
[Guest]: And it remains so and the RSS plays a big role in keeping that happening.

02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:10.520
[Guest]: I would, I would actually say the following that given that Modi is so much more popular

02:59:10.520 --> 02:59:16.600
[Guest]: than his party, right, it is surprising that in the in the in the BJP, both Amit Shah and

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:22.840
[Guest]: Modi follow the formal protocols of the party, even though they don't have to, right?

02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:28.240
[Guest]: And I would say that after Modi and after Amit Shah, the BJP's health will be immeasurably

02:59:28.240 --> 02:59:30.720
[Guest]: better than it was when they took the party.

02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:35.480
[Guest]: So I'm actually going to stick my neck out and say that both Amit Shah and Modi are institutional

02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:36.480
[Guest]: builders.

02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:41.160
[Guest]: It is the reality in India today that Modi, you know, is the number one leader in the

02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:42.160
[Guest]: BJP.

02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:46.240
[Guest]: And the number two leader is actually number 10, because Modi is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

02:59:46.240 --> 02:59:47.240
[Guest]: 9.

02:59:47.240 --> 02:59:52.160
[Guest]: And the next leader, you can call it Adityanath, Amit Shah, whoever, is actually the 10th most

02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:54.880
[Guest]: popular leader in the BJP.

02:59:54.880 --> 03:00:00.840
[Guest]: And that even though Modi is a centralizer, his instincts, he has not destroyed the party,

03:00:00.840 --> 03:00:05.840
[Guest]: the party still has autonomous centers, the RSS is still autonomous, the reason they go

03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:09.120
[Guest]: behind him is actually a pretty simple reason, he wins elections.

03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:12.680
[Guest]: If he stops winning elections, people in the BJP will complain, right?

03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:16.360
[Guest]: So I'll actually push back on that just to tell you that there is an alternate model

03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:20.720
[Guest]: that the Congress could have followed, which is, but it would have been a party would then

03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:25.920
[Guest]: would have had to focus on an ideological core, and would have had to articulate an

03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:32.880
[Guest]: ideological, not just a catch all party, but a certain clear ideology.

03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:37.480
[Guest]: In the 1960s, that ideology sometimes wins, you sometimes loses, the BJP had the same

03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:39.400
[Guest]: ideology for 100 years.

03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:43.320
[Guest]: And they have won elections, they have lost elections, the Congress's tragedy and Indra's

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.160
[Guest]: tragedy was, she could not conceive of an India without the Congress.

03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:52.320
[Guest]: And she was willing to do what it takes to just give the Congress a little more power

03:00:52.320 --> 03:00:54.120
[Guest]: for a little more years.

03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:57.360
[Guest]: And that came at the cost of the destruction of the party.

03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:01.320
[Guest]: So I'm going to push back and look, many people disagree with me on this saying that look

03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:07.560
[Guest]: in India, the de institutionalization of a party is the norm is inevitable.

03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:09.440
[Guest]: And that power corrupts, right?

03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:13.320
[Guest]: And an individual in power will always try to, you know, make it a mom and pop show.

03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:15.080
[Guest]: I don't think it was inevitable.

03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:17.760
[Guest]: That's certainly not the party that Nehru ran.

03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:21.760
[Guest]: There was no reason that that would be the party that Indira Gandhi ran.

03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:26.920
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, as a former poker player, I can come at it from, I can cite the law

03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:31.280
[Amit Varma]: of truly large numbers, and the law of truly large numbers basically is that given enough

03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:35.280
[Amit Varma]: iterations, everything is inevitable, the most unlikely event is inevitable.

03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:39.200
[Amit Varma]: And here, I would say given enough iterations, power will corrupt even if it doesn't corrupt

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:41.520
[Amit Varma]: a particular set of people on top.

03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Because but what you are saying is that within the BJP, there are institutional safeguards.

03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:53.320
[Guest]: Why should the sentence power corrupts mean that a party becomes personality centric that

03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:59.200
[Guest]: doesn't follow because frankly, carders expand the power of the party expand like Modi likes

03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:02.880
[Guest]: having a committed carder, because he wins elections.

03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:05.680
[Guest]: If he destroys the carder, he may lose elections, right?

03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:11.680
[Amit Varma]: And I think what you're saying is that the BJP has enough institutional safeguards such

03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:16.360
[Amit Varma]: as a very presence of the RSS behind it, that makes sure that that personality cult cannot

03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: form even if power was to corrupt.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.480
[Guest]: Also, I don't you know, let me stick my neck out a second time.

03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:24.400
[Guest]: I don't think Modi believes in his personality cult.

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:29.640
[Guest]: I think Modi fully recognizes that you need a party, you need social media, you need money.

03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:33.720
[Guest]: You know, it's not that you know, the the old story where you know, Indira Gandhi would

03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:37.240
[Guest]: you know, put a you know, the joke was if Indira Gandhi even puts a lamppost as a candidate,

03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:38.480
[Guest]: the lamppost will win.

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:40.680
[Guest]: Modi well realizes that's not the case.

03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but my point is that it's not about Modi, forget Modi tomorrow, it could be Adityanath

03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:47.560
[Amit Varma]: day after it could be Yati, it could be anybody else.

03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And inevitably, if you have a large enough sample size, there will be someone corrupted

03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:53.480
[Amit Varma]: enough to try to centralize power.

03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And your point is that's not possible within the BJP because there are enough safeguards

03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:58.480
[Amit Varma]: which they want in the Congress.

03:02:58.480 --> 03:02:59.480
[Amit Varma]: Is that correct?

03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:00.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:04.240
[Guest]: And you know, they may centralize power, but it may not be in the cost of having a coherent

03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:05.680
[Guest]: carder.

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:10.960
[Guest]: What Indira does is, you know, destroys any, you can still have ultimate power with the

03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:16.440
[Guest]: Prime Minister, but give chief ministers with some like, today, you know, the chief ministers

03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:22.000
[Guest]: of the BJP, whether Shivraj Singh Chauhan, you name it, right, Adityanath are not puppets

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:23.000
[Guest]: of Modi.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:24.800
[Guest]: I don't think that's the right sentence, right?

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:28.800
[Guest]: In fact, if anything, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was a competitor of Modi, right, for Prime

03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:31.280
[Guest]: Ministership, yet he's Prime, he's Chief Minister.

03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:33.560
[Guest]: This would be unthinkable in the Congress Party.

03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:38.480
[Guest]: And the reason I'm sort of jostling with you on this, Amit, is not just to create a rare

03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:41.480
[Guest]: point of disagreement between us, because I think that's important too.

03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:42.840
[Amit Varma]: I love the disagreement.

03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.120
[Amit Varma]: One thing I don't disagree because we are so polite on the show, but disagreement for

03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:48.120
[Amit Varma]: them is Twitter screaming.

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:52.640
[Guest]: No, no, no, no, but you know, because we seem to agree on a lot, I want to at least have

03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:53.640
[Guest]: one or two differences.

03:03:53.640 --> 03:03:58.980
[Guest]: But I want to emphasize here as a political scientist with all my heart, that the tragedy

03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:05.960
[Guest]: of the Congress, especially the tragedy of the Congress Party organization was not inevitable.

03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:10.960
[Guest]: And it was a series of choices that began with Indira Gandhi, and then became a self-fulfilling

03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:15.200
[Guest]: prophecy because she handed out down to her, you know, to Rajiv Gandhi, she handed down

03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:19.680
[Guest]: a such a corrupt party, that Rajiv said, I have to further centralize, otherwise, am

03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:22.580
[Guest]: I going to give these jokers decentralized power?

03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:24.160
[Guest]: But that was not inevitable.

03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:27.080
[Guest]: It was something that Indira Gandhi created.

03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's an open question, I guess we are actually talking past each other, because

03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:33.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm not even talking about the current BJP.

03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:38.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm just saying in the larger scheme of things, you know, given enough leaders, somebody or

03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:42.440
[Amit Varma]: the other is going to try the same thing that Indira tried in the BJP as well.

03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:46.520
[Amit Varma]: But maybe not in the, maybe the question is moot because the sample size you need for

03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:48.600
[Amit Varma]: that is too large.

03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:50.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's get back to Narsimha Rao.

03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:57.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you speak about how that period as Chief Minister ended disastrously, even

03:04:57.400 --> 03:05:01.260
[Amit Varma]: though he was well intentioned, he was trying to do things like reduce land holdings to

03:05:01.260 --> 03:05:05.360
[Amit Varma]: such an extent that his own land holdings would be decimated, right?

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:09.960
[Amit Varma]: But he's and despite opposition within, you know, half the cabinet, because they are,

03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:13.040
[Amit Varma]: of course, you know, of landlords, they're landlords.

03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:14.840
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and he did that.

03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:19.160
[Amit Varma]: And you write at one point, and this is a lovely sentence, quote, Narsimha Rao, the

03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Chief Minister was pouring kerosene all over himself, all that was needed was a matchstick,

03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:25.160
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

03:05:25.160 --> 03:05:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And so okay, eventually, the Chief Ministership is set on fire, he's sacked, game is over.

03:05:29.960 --> 03:05:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Now he's in exile for a couple of years, where he is, you know, not in a political position

03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:37.720
[Amit Varma]: anymore.

03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:39.360
[Amit Varma]: How did that exile change him?

03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:46.280
[Guest]: That's an important question, Amit, because, and just take a step back for a second.

03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:51.240
[Guest]: Most politicians don't know what to do with exiles, because they are 24-7 politicians,

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:52.240
[Guest]: right?

03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:56.200
[Guest]: Exile means that you've lost an election, you've stepped down as Chief Minister, all

03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:00.120
[Guest]: the hundreds of people waiting to meet you have disappeared.

03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:01.880
[Guest]: There's nobody willing to meet you.

03:06:01.880 --> 03:06:04.280
[Guest]: If you don't have hobbies, what else do you do?

03:06:04.280 --> 03:06:05.280
[Guest]: Right?

03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:08.280
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao was very good at exile because he had hobbies.

03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:11.880
[Guest]: You know, he could even paint, he could, you know, he could read books, right, he could

03:06:11.880 --> 03:06:19.760
[Guest]: learn languages, you know, he could, you know, when the first exile between 1973 and 74,

03:06:19.760 --> 03:06:24.200
[Guest]: he begins to write the book that would eventually become the Insider, right?

03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:27.760
[Guest]: So he knew, he had things to occupy himself during exile.

03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:32.080
[Guest]: This is very rare for politicians, which is why politicians when they are in exile, and

03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:36.400
[Guest]: all politicians will be in exile at some point or other, make foolish mistakes like leaving

03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:41.520
[Guest]: the party, making statements, making compromises to get back to power, to get something to

03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:44.600
[Guest]: get a Rajya Sabha ticket, Narsimha Rao didn't have to do that.

03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:46.120
[Guest]: And I think that's what made him unique.

03:06:46.120 --> 03:06:49.880
[Guest]: The other person, by the way, who had this is Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was a man with

03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:55.040
[Guest]: a lot of interest, poetry, he loved the good life, he had, like Narsimha Rao, he had a

03:06:55.040 --> 03:06:57.000
[Guest]: philosophical attitude to life.

03:06:57.000 --> 03:07:01.760
[Guest]: So when he was not in power, right, he had things to occupy himself, when he was sidelined

03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:07.760
[Guest]: in my first book, I point out that from roughly 1985, all the way to 1995, for 10 years, he

03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:13.520
[Guest]: had been exiled from his party functionally, but you know, he knew things to occupy himself,

03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:18.240
[Guest]: he didn't do anything foolish as leaving the party, splitting the party, etc, etc.

03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:24.480
[Guest]: So Narsimha Rao was both used to exile, and B, did not do anything foolish during exile,

03:07:24.480 --> 03:07:29.080
[Guest]: which meant that when the stars realigned, Indira Gandhi got him back as General Secretary,

03:07:29.080 --> 03:07:30.080
[Guest]: right?

03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:35.920
[Guest]: Again, in 1991, a few months before the elections, when Rajiv Gandhi basically kicked him out

03:07:35.920 --> 03:07:40.220
[Guest]: of politics, Narsimha Rao said, fine, I'm going to use this exile, I'm going to become

03:07:40.220 --> 03:07:44.480
[Guest]: a monk in the Kotralam monastery, and I'm going to become a Hindu monk, I'm going to

03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:46.520
[Guest]: close my bank accounts, right?

03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:50.040
[Guest]: Somebody else could have said, who does Rajiv Gandhi think he is, put a press conference,

03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:51.040
[Guest]: etc, etc.

03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:55.560
[Guest]: And you know what, if he had done that, and Rajiv Gandhi had been assassinated, the Congress

03:07:55.560 --> 03:07:58.520
[Guest]: wouldn't have gone to him to become Prime Minister, they went to him to become Prime

03:07:58.520 --> 03:08:01.940
[Guest]: Minister because he accepted his exile with grace.

03:08:01.940 --> 03:08:06.260
[Guest]: And I want to give you the contrary picture of N.D. Tiwari, also who was in his last legs

03:08:06.260 --> 03:08:11.500
[Guest]: in the 1991 elections, and Rajiv had told him don't contest the Lok Sabha elections.

03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:16.640
[Guest]: But N.D. Tiwari was worried that his chance to become Chief Minister in 91 was ending

03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:17.640
[Guest]: in UP.

03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:21.880
[Guest]: And as you know, as your readers know, the Samadwadi party, etc comes to power, the Congress

03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:24.560
[Guest]: has been finished since then, has never come back in UP.

03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:25.880
[Guest]: So N.D. Tiwari knew this.

03:08:25.880 --> 03:08:31.680
[Guest]: So he disobeyed an order of Rajiv Gandhi and stood for Lok Sabha elections in UP and lost.

03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:34.960
[Guest]: And that's one of the main reasons why he could not become Prime Minister when Rajiv

03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:38.280
[Guest]: died, because he had disobeyed an order of Rajiv Gandhi, right?

03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:42.720
[Guest]: So this is an example of Narasimha Rao who doesn't make foolish decisions during his

03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:43.720
[Guest]: exile.

03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:48.840
[Guest]: I'll give you a third example, Amit, which is in 1977 to 1980, another period of exile

03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:49.840
[Guest]: for Narasimha Rao.

03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:54.920
[Guest]: As all of you know, that's when the Janata government is in power, Indira Gandhi, cases

03:08:54.920 --> 03:08:57.160
[Guest]: have been filed against Indira Gandhi.

03:08:57.160 --> 03:09:01.800
[Guest]: Many of Indira Gandhi's close supporters like YB Chavan leave the Congress during this period.

03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:03.680
[Guest]: Narasimha Rao doesn't leave the Congress.

03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:04.680
[Guest]: What does he do?

03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:06.400
[Guest]: He goes to JNU to learn Spanish.

03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:08.200
[Guest]: He doesn't make a foolish mistake, right?

03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:09.240
[Guest]: He bides his time.

03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:14.040
[Guest]: So in 1980, when Indira Gandhi comes back to power, Narasimha Rao is one of the few

03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:19.240
[Guest]: people to have remained loyal to Indira Gandhi during the three years in which she had been

03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:21.080
[Guest]: hounded by everybody else.

03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:23.380
[Guest]: So how does Indira Gandhi reward him?

03:09:23.380 --> 03:09:28.000
[Guest]: She makes him Foreign Minister of India, which is one of the top four ministries in the Union

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:29.000
[Guest]: Cabinet.

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:34.600
[Guest]: It tells you that Narasimha Rao's big talent was that he knew how to occupy himself during

03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:40.440
[Guest]: exile, and he did not make foolish short term decisions to come back to power during exile.

03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:44.720
[Guest]: He knew that, look, he had a philosophical turn, what goes down comes up, you know, and

03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:46.560
[Guest]: that's exactly what happens to him.

03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:49.840
[Guest]: I know that's a long answer to your question, but does that make sense?

03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:50.840
[Amit Varma]: Makes a lot of sense.

03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And long answers are the best answers because they have the best chance of carrying complexity.

03:09:56.120 --> 03:09:58.760
[Amit Varma]: And at this time, like you said earlier, he also made an American trip.

03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:02.200
[Amit Varma]: He visited his daughter and so on and so forth.

03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:10.080
[Amit Varma]: And this time being 1973-74, so is this a significant trip?

03:10:10.080 --> 03:10:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Is this something that we look at as changing his outlook in any way in the sense that he

03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:21.120
[Amit Varma]: was a classic socialist all the time before that, you know, even when he was a modernizer,

03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:25.440
[Amit Varma]: as you've pointed out in the 60s, it was a modernizer from a point of view of the state

03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:30.840
[Amit Varma]: doing modernizing things and not, you know, liberalizing and enabling people and markets

03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:32.060
[Amit Varma]: to do what they do.

03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:36.640
[Amit Varma]: So did this sort of, and he had a love for technology, you point out how on another trip

03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:40.600
[Amit Varma]: he brought back a Texas calculator for his son and all of that, he was into that.

03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:44.160
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, he's in India all his life, he goes to the US, he sees how life there

03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:46.480
[Amit Varma]: is so much better and all that.

03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Does that, you know, change his outlook?

03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:53.720
[Amit Varma]: You also mentioned at one point that he realizes when he's spending time in his village with

03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:59.060
[Amit Varma]: villagers that the land reforms alone haven't changed anything, that they're still poor,

03:10:59.060 --> 03:11:03.280
[Amit Varma]: and that therefore the handouts don't solve the problem, you also need to connect them

03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:07.880
[Amit Varma]: to markets where they can flourish through voluntary trade with others.

03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:11.920
[Amit Varma]: And in some cases, he manages to do that where he moves them from rice, which is an unprofitable

03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:16.620
[Amit Varma]: crop to other cash crops, and, you know, they enter markets and start making money.

03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:23.280
[Amit Varma]: So is there some kind of discernible metamorphosis happening in ideological terms?

03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:27.700
[Amit Varma]: Because initially, why he was socialist in his 60s, what else could you be back then?

03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:32.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, I can't, it's easy to sit here in 2022 and talk about economic freedom and this

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:33.560
[Amit Varma]: and that.

03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:39.520
[Amit Varma]: At that point in time, there was no exposure to those ideas, there wasn't widespread understanding

03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:42.120
[Amit Varma]: of the failures of socialism as we have today.

03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:43.680
[Amit Varma]: So that's completely understandable.

03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:48.400
[Amit Varma]: But over time, do we see sort of a gradual shift?

03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And also in general, through reading his papers, writing this biography, what comment would

03:11:55.400 --> 03:12:02.760
[Amit Varma]: you have on his openness to new ideas, which is also a remarkably important quality, a

03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:07.680
[Amit Varma]: quality which, for example, Nehru didn't have, right, much to our nation's detriment, you

03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:12.180
[Amit Varma]: know, and no politician, I mean, I can't think of any politicians who really have as much

03:12:12.180 --> 03:12:14.360
[Amit Varma]: of that as Narsimha Rao clearly did.

03:12:14.360 --> 03:12:16.760
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sense of his intellectual journey?

03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:21.800
[Guest]: So I think to answer the first part of your question, that trip he makes in 73-74 to the

03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:25.640
[Guest]: US is transformative, right?

03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:29.800
[Guest]: You know, he travels quite a bit in the, I mean, in within New York, he's traveling,

03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:34.720
[Guest]: he's amazing, you know, he buys calculators from Texas Instruments, he goes to Wisconsin,

03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:38.440
[Guest]: and he meets, you know, this famous Telugu scholar, Velchiru Narayan Rao.

03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:42.400
[Guest]: And in, you know, Madison, Wisconsin, he, you know, he's invited for dinner, and he

03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:44.560
[Guest]: finds the best Telugu food.

03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:47.680
[Guest]: And he's saying, you know, all these ingredients you're getting here in the Midwest, I can't

03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:49.860
[Guest]: even get in North India, you know.

03:12:49.860 --> 03:12:55.040
[Guest]: So he sees the power of American capitalism, and he sees the dynamism and entrepreneurship

03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:57.600
[Guest]: in America quite clearly, right?

03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:00.900
[Guest]: And the next time he's visiting the US, he's now an expert on the US.

03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:06.240
[Guest]: So his eldest daughter, who's, who's accompanying him, who I think is semi literate, she sees

03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:09.680
[Guest]: a washing machine, she doesn't use know how to use it, and I'll teach you how to use the

03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:10.680
[Guest]: washing machine.

03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:13.860
[Guest]: He's now the expert, he's been this, you know, second time.

03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:19.080
[Guest]: So he definitely is very excited, like a child about the, you know, entrepreneurship, technological

03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:23.920
[Guest]: improvement in the US, that directly manifests itself when he's foreign minister.

03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:29.200
[Guest]: So in 1980, to onwards, when he's foreign minister, you also see India moving away from

03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:32.240
[Guest]: the Soviet Union towards the US, right?

03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:36.040
[Guest]: That doesn't manifest itself in his economic policies.

03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:40.800
[Guest]: So Narsimha Rao, one of the things I realized was that on economics, he was a cipher until

03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:41.800
[Guest]: 1991.

03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:47.040
[Guest]: It was the, you know, he had held so many positions from Hindu, Hindu Endowment Board,

03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:51.680
[Guest]: you know, industry, defense, foreign policy, he had held all this, he'd never held economics

03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:54.800
[Guest]: or sorry, he had not held industry either.

03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:58.960
[Guest]: So he never held finance, economics, he never held these positions.

03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:04.600
[Guest]: There's nothing in his archives that showed that the either the US trip or his in the

03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:09.800
[Guest]: 80s, his economic thinking had changed, you know, he didn't have much to think about it,

03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:12.680
[Guest]: whatever little he thought about it was still protectionist.

03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:17.880
[Guest]: It was really 1991 that transformed him and he realized the crisis, he realized that we

03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:18.880
[Guest]: had to change.

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:23.760
[Guest]: I think it's amazing that he changes on, he just flips on a dime at that point, right?

03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:30.780
[Guest]: And I was actually looking in the 70s for this aha moment where he realizes the importance

03:14:30.780 --> 03:14:34.000
[Guest]: of liberalization and the importance of capitalism.

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:39.280
[Guest]: I just couldn't find it, you know, there's a very famous story, possibly apocryphal of

03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:43.320
[Guest]: Gorbachev, right, traveling in the United States.

03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:46.080
[Guest]: And I think his car breaks down somewhere, it's an apocryphal story, I haven't been able

03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:47.600
[Guest]: to find a footnote.

03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:52.700
[Guest]: And you know, there's a Walmart nearby, he goes there to a Walmart, right, in rural America,

03:14:52.700 --> 03:14:56.160
[Guest]: and he's amazed at the range of things that Walmart carries.

03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:02.000
[Guest]: And suddenly he has a eureka moment that he, right, as the head of Soviet Union, as a Soviet

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:08.460
[Guest]: elite has less products he can buy in Moscow, than a rural American farmer who goes to Walmart

03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:09.880
[Guest]: in rural America.

03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:14.160
[Guest]: And that's when he has this aha moment about the power of capitalism and actually giving

03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:15.720
[Guest]: consumers choice.

03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:17.720
[Guest]: So I had the story in the back of my mind.

03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:22.200
[Guest]: And I kept looking to see whether there was this aha moment, when Nassima Rao goes to

03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:26.360
[Guest]: US or after and I couldn't find it, I was unhappy, I couldn't find it.

03:15:26.360 --> 03:15:31.280
[Guest]: But you know, I wanted to be or I had too much of a commitment to my reader to manufacture

03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:32.280
[Guest]: it.

03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:38.240
[Guest]: And the answer has to be Amit that on economics, he did not have a change until 1991.

03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:43.880
[Guest]: On other things, especially foreign policy, the ardent socialist had softened his position,

03:15:43.880 --> 03:15:44.880
[Guest]: but not on economics.

03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:45.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, as foreign minister, he would also have been watching Deng do what

03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:54.920
[Amit Varma]: he did in China, and you would have kind of seen those movements and you know, what's

03:15:54.920 --> 03:15:55.920
[Amit Varma]: going on there.

03:15:55.920 --> 03:16:01.880
[Guest]: So, you know, Pranab Mukherjee once mentioned, he did because I give a quote there also,

03:16:01.880 --> 03:16:07.240
[Guest]: where he's amazed at what Deng is doing, transforming the economy, transforming China.

03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:12.320
[Guest]: But he notices something others don't, which is Deng is transforming China while pretending

03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:18.720
[Guest]: to be a Maoist, like Deng is making China capitalist while pretending to be a communist.

03:16:18.720 --> 03:16:23.400
[Guest]: And I have a quote here saying that, you know, where he's where Nassima Rao says that Deng

03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:30.440
[Guest]: Joe Ping reminds him of one of those Sanskrit shlokas or Sanskrit quotations, which the

03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:34.160
[Guest]: same sentence can be read one way or read the other way, right.

03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:40.120
[Guest]: And I mentioned here also that one of Nassima Rao's favorite Telugu poems was this poem,

03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:45.200
[Guest]: which if you read it one way, it was the Ramayana, the same text, if you read a different way,

03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:47.320
[Guest]: it was the Mahabharata, right.

03:16:47.320 --> 03:16:48.740
[Guest]: And Nassima Rao loved that.

03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:52.440
[Guest]: And that's frankly, exactly what he did as prime minister that he said, I'm a Nehruvian,

03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:58.160
[Guest]: I'm a socialist, India believes in socialism while he's opening up India's economy, right.

03:16:58.160 --> 03:16:59.360
[Guest]: That's what he learned from Deng.

03:16:59.360 --> 03:17:05.240
[Guest]: So it's not so much the importance of the economy, but the how to bring about change

03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:10.720
[Guest]: in a system that is so one way, you cannot have radical changes, you have to pretend

03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:12.600
[Guest]: to continuity while bringing more change.

03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:18.640
[Guest]: And just to give you an example, after reading this book, you know, a CEO came to me, and

03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:22.520
[Guest]: she told me that she had just become CEO.

03:17:22.520 --> 03:17:26.880
[Guest]: And her first instinct was to say that the previous CEO is a fool, and I'm going to bring

03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:29.880
[Guest]: about changes, and I'm going to make this change that change.

03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:33.440
[Guest]: But she said, Look, I read your book, and I realized that if I do that, then all the

03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:38.320
[Guest]: people the old CEO has appointed who are still there in the system will resent her, and we'll

03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:39.560
[Guest]: we'll push back against her.

03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:45.320
[Guest]: So what she had to say was that, oh, the previous CEO was fantastic, all his choices was fantastic

03:17:45.320 --> 03:17:49.600
[Guest]: while she brought about changes, which were radically different from the old CEO.

03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:54.480
[Guest]: And I said, man, you understood this book much better than I have, because that's exactly

03:17:54.480 --> 03:17:55.720
[Guest]: the point of Nassima Rao.

03:17:55.720 --> 03:18:00.560
[Guest]: And I can tell you, Amit, any of your listeners listening to this, who work in organizations,

03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:05.640
[Guest]: right, realize that, you know, will agree with me that changing the DNA of organizations

03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:06.800
[Guest]: are really hard.

03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:12.400
[Guest]: And socialism was in the DNA of the Indian state was in the DNA of the Congress Party,

03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:15.760
[Guest]: just like communism was in the DNA of the Chinese state.

03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:20.280
[Guest]: And the way to do it is the Deng Xiaoping and Nassima Rao way, which is to pretend to

03:18:20.280 --> 03:18:25.960
[Guest]: continuity in a system, while simultaneously through your actions bringing about radical

03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:26.960
[Amit Varma]: change.

03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is pretty much as profound an insight from politics that can be applied to everything

03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:37.480
[Amit Varma]: as say, Doris Keynes Goodwin's team of rivals, right, how Lincoln put his cabinet together,

03:18:37.480 --> 03:18:41.840
[Amit Varma]: where instead of just putting his supporters in his cabinet, he got his greatest rivals,

03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:45.400
[Amit Varma]: including the guy he defeated in the presidential elections and put them in the cabinet.

03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:48.760
[Amit Varma]: And that was one big reason for his success in winning the Civil War.

03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:49.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's almost cliched.

03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:58.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, both of these could be LinkedIn posts, in a sense, which are so, you know, Pranam

03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:02.720
[Amit Varma]: Mukherjee once told Nassima Rao that during this period, he thought Nassima Rao was invaluable

03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:05.440
[Amit Varma]: to Indira Gandhi, she could not function without him.

03:19:05.440 --> 03:19:10.520
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about what he's actually doing in government, like, one gets that when he's

03:19:10.520 --> 03:19:15.400
[Amit Varma]: out of power, he's not creating a political fuss, because there are other facets to his

03:19:15.400 --> 03:19:16.400
[Amit Varma]: personality.

03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:19.720
[Amit Varma]: He's learning Spanish, he's going abroad and buying calculator, he's doing all of these

03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:20.720
[Amit Varma]: things.

03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:26.340
[Amit Varma]: And the way that he gets to power is often by being inoffensive to everyone in the sense

03:19:26.340 --> 03:19:28.720
[Amit Varma]: that this is not someone who threatens me.

03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:34.320
[Amit Varma]: So let me give him an important ministry like foreign ministry or so on and so forth.

03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:40.240
[Amit Varma]: But when he's actually in power, when he's in that position, one in terms of governance

03:19:40.240 --> 03:19:45.040
[Amit Varma]: in the ministry itself, what is his approach and what is the kind of work that he is doing?

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And how do you rate him as a minister?

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And two, in a political sense, as Indira Gandhi's aid, what's his role there?

03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:55.040
[Amit Varma]: And what role is he playing for her?

03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:59.520
[Guest]: So I think that as in government, Nassima Rao was good at three different things.

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:02.440
[Guest]: Firstly, he was just a consummate draftsman.

03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:07.960
[Guest]: So I would say that, you know, from the 1970s, every piece of paper that would exit the Congress

03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:10.320
[Guest]: party would have his fingerprints on it.

03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:14.560
[Guest]: So he just knew, you know, in a cabinet meeting, he knew how to, you know, write what the minute

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:17.280
[Guest]: look like, he knew what to write the cabinet agenda.

03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:21.600
[Guest]: So, you know, now look, Pranam Mukherjee was good at this, Jayaram Ramesh is very good

03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:22.600
[Guest]: at this, right?

03:20:22.600 --> 03:20:27.120
[Guest]: So this was a talent that Nassima Rao had that he was a draftsman, right?

03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:32.960
[Guest]: The second talent he had is that in any ministry that he took charge of, he quickly understood

03:20:32.960 --> 03:20:35.240
[Guest]: the issues because he applied himself, right?

03:20:35.240 --> 03:20:39.640
[Guest]: So a lot of ministers think of a ministry as an ego trip, right?

03:20:39.640 --> 03:20:41.340
[Guest]: So Nassima Rao didn't think that.

03:20:41.340 --> 03:20:46.640
[Guest]: So for example, he had been defence minister and foreign minister and Rajiv Gandhi made

03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:49.040
[Guest]: him education minister or HRD minister.

03:20:49.040 --> 03:20:52.540
[Guest]: Now, for most people, this is a demotion, but Nassima Rao is not a demotion.

03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:58.840
[Guest]: He quickly gets in, he understands the mechanics of the Navodaya school, you know, he knew

03:20:58.840 --> 03:20:59.840
[Guest]: all of that.

03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:03.200
[Guest]: So I think the second thing that he was very good at was in the ministry, he would very

03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:05.280
[Guest]: quickly get to the issues.

03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:09.160
[Guest]: And he was a good, he could brief the Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi or Indira Gandhi about

03:21:09.160 --> 03:21:14.040
[Guest]: the issues because he actually applied himself to the specifics of the ministry.

03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:18.680
[Guest]: When it came to foreign policy, you know, he, you know, he told his son, his grandson,

03:21:18.680 --> 03:21:23.880
[Guest]: I think, when Nassima Rao travelled to a country, he first read up about the country, the culture,

03:21:23.880 --> 03:21:25.040
[Guest]: the people, the politics.

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:28.880
[Guest]: Can you think of any other foreign minister in India bar Jai Shankar doing that?

03:21:28.880 --> 03:21:29.880
[Guest]: Out of the question, right?

03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:34.080
[Guest]: Again, when he was defence minister, I mentioned here, he's quickly, you know, getting involved

03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:38.520
[Guest]: in the nuclear program, this, that and later on when Arunachalam, who was heading the nuclear

03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:42.960
[Guest]: program at that time comes to him, and you know, he says, you please draw out what the

03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:47.880
[Guest]: nuclear process looks like, he said, okay, this is where the chain reaction takes place.

03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:49.640
[Guest]: So he's getting involved.

03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:51.920
[Guest]: And then he's briefing Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.

03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:52.920
[Guest]: That's a skill.

03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:58.680
[Guest]: Ask yourself, even today, how many ministers actually have depth in their department or

03:21:58.680 --> 03:22:04.240
[Guest]: their subject expertise, rather than looking at the ministry or being a minister as an

03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:08.840
[Guest]: ego trip, which tells them their relative importance in the pecking order, for most

03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:10.720
[Guest]: of people, it's in the latter, right?

03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:16.880
[Guest]: The third skill Nassima Rao had was that he could balance action and theory very well,

03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:17.880
[Guest]: right?

03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:21.360
[Guest]: So, for example, and these were skills that he came to as prime minister also, and this

03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:22.680
[Guest]: is outside his department.

03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:27.200
[Guest]: For example, he told Rajiv Gandhi that, you know, getting involved in Sri Lanka is an

03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:28.200
[Guest]: error, right?

03:22:28.200 --> 03:22:30.000
[Guest]: Rajiv Gandhi didn't listen to him.

03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:31.760
[Guest]: But he said that, right?

03:22:31.760 --> 03:22:36.120
[Guest]: On the other hand, he pushed for the Navodaya schooling system, which is residential schools

03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:40.800
[Guest]: for poor people, where the teacher actually lives in the place, right?

03:22:40.800 --> 03:22:44.520
[Guest]: So that to prevent teacher absenteeism, because the teacher is living in the school, the teacher

03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:48.760
[Guest]: is less likely to bunk and Rajiv Gandhi, you know, took, you know, took charge of that

03:22:48.760 --> 03:22:50.200
[Guest]: or agreed with that.

03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:53.680
[Guest]: So he had this ability, I think all three, right?

03:22:53.680 --> 03:22:55.320
[Guest]: He was a good draftsman.

03:22:55.320 --> 03:22:57.440
[Guest]: He had subject matter expertise.

03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:00.640
[Guest]: So he was as good as the bureaucrat.

03:23:00.640 --> 03:23:04.320
[Guest]: To give you an example, Modi today, by all accounts, listens to the secretary in every

03:23:04.320 --> 03:23:07.400
[Guest]: department, every ministry rather than listening to the minister.

03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:12.160
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao knew as much about foreign politics or foreign policy as the foreign secretary,

03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:13.160
[Guest]: right?

03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:19.960
[Guest]: I unearthed a document here, which the Indian ambassador to China writes to Narsimha Rao,

03:23:19.960 --> 03:23:20.960
[Guest]: right?

03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:26.360
[Guest]: About the Chinese situation and Narsimha Rao is writing in the notes on the margins, highly

03:23:26.360 --> 03:23:28.360
[Guest]: detailed pushbacks.

03:23:28.360 --> 03:23:32.440
[Guest]: I don't know too many ministers who could second guess a foreign secretary or an ambassador,

03:23:32.440 --> 03:23:36.360
[Guest]: because an Indian ambassador to a country has subject matter expertise, right?

03:23:36.360 --> 03:23:39.240
[Guest]: So I would say Narsimha Rao had all these three.

03:23:39.240 --> 03:23:44.240
[Guest]: It's a unique skill, but you know, look, Pranab Mukherjee had these skills, right?

03:23:44.240 --> 03:23:47.040
[Guest]: He was invaluable too, right?

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:52.500
[Guest]: What he lacked which Narsimha Rao had is the ability to act and to act decisively when

03:23:52.500 --> 03:23:55.680
[Guest]: he became prime minister.

03:23:55.680 --> 03:24:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Seeing this, the landscape changes in the sense Indira Gandhi is assassinated and what

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:06.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, the aftermath happens, we've already sort of alluded to the riots and then eventually

03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Rajiv Gandhi takes hold of the party.

03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:16.640
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, you also in fact, quote Tacitus, where Tacitus, after whom I think

03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:18.840
[Amit Varma]: the term taciturn comes, right?

03:24:18.840 --> 03:24:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And Tacitus says, quote, the higher a man's rank, the more eager is hypocrisy and his

03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:28.760
[Amit Varma]: looks are more carefully studied, so as to neither betray joy at the decrees of one emperor

03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:33.040
[Amit Varma]: nor sorrow at the rise of another, while he mingled delight and lamentations with his

03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:34.040
[Amit Varma]: flattery.

03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:35.040
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Isn't it a wonderful quote?

03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:37.920
[Guest]: It's a remarkable quote.

03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:44.840
[Guest]: And so opposite, so correct to describe Narsimha Rao when Indira Gandhi died and Rajiv Gandhi

03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:50.160
[Guest]: is rising and he's very, very careful that he knows that he was close to Indira Gandhi.

03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:52.480
[Guest]: Now he has to become close to Rajiv Gandhi.

03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and unlike Pranab Mukherjee, who makes a mess of it, lobbied for the position of

03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Prime Minister and eventually, and then when he was in exile, just left the party and threw

03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:02.520
[Guest]: a tantrum.

03:25:02.520 --> 03:25:06.280
[Guest]: I think it was Pratap Mehta who told me that the difference between Narsimha Rao and Arjun

03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:14.320
[Guest]: Singh was Narsimha Rao was clever, Arjun Singh was clever by half and Pranab Mukherjee was

03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:19.160
[Guest]: clever by half and Narsimha Rao, as the, you know, given the quote that you mentioned like

03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:20.160
[Guest]: was being clever.

03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, sometimes I think the kind of cleverness that you're alluding to is not

03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:30.440
[Amit Varma]: just the cleverness to say the right thing, but also to shut up at the right time.

03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:31.440
[Unknown]: That's right.

03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Which, you know, Narsimha Rao would perhaps had done.

03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:39.680
[Guest]: I got to tell you, I, you know, I was just reading this book to prepare for this conversation

03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:43.760
[Guest]: because you know, I last read the book six years ago when I had written the book.

03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:47.400
[Guest]: And I was just telling myself, I wish I had internalized this year, you know, that I should

03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:50.320
[Guest]: keep quiet at key moments.

03:25:50.320 --> 03:25:51.320
[Guest]: I just don't do that.

03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:53.120
[Guest]: I say what I think.

03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:58.160
[Guest]: But Narsimha Rao knew, you know, the importance of silence or when not to say something, when

03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:01.540
[Guest]: to step back, when not to die on that hill.

03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:04.640
[Guest]: Something I think I should, having reread the book, I think I should learn now.

03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:08.560
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, I was thinking a little while earlier that Narsimha Rao with his learning

03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:12.280
[Amit Varma]: and knowledge and experience would have made such a fantastic guest for this podcast.

03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:15.440
[Amit Varma]: But now what you just said, I don't know how much he would have told me and if he even

03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:16.440
[Amit Varma]: if he...

03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:17.560
[Guest]: So that's problem one.

03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:21.000
[Guest]: Problem two is, you know, I give the story about Narsimha Rao meeting Bill Clinton in

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:22.000
[Guest]: 1994.

03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:25.840
[Guest]: And Bill Clinton really doesn't like the meeting when Narsimha Rao is, you know, is nervous

03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:30.520
[Guest]: and his response to being nervous is to give a long lecture as an academic, long academic

03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:31.520
[Guest]: lecture.

03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:32.520
[Guest]: He could do that too.

03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:36.720
[Guest]: So either he would be silent to your questions, Amit, or he would give long winded, boring

03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:39.840
[Guest]: academic answers that would bore your listeners.

03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:41.240
[Guest]: I don't know which is worse.

03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:45.320
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I would, I would get great masala out of him if he agreed to speak, but he would

03:26:45.320 --> 03:26:48.720
[Amit Varma]: have to agree first and now it's a problem because he's been dead for a long time.

03:26:48.720 --> 03:26:51.540
[Amit Varma]: So what can one do about that?

03:26:51.540 --> 03:26:55.360
[Amit Varma]: But why did you say that you wish you had internalized that quality of knowing when

03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:56.360
[Amit Varma]: to shut up?

03:26:56.360 --> 03:26:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Are you someone who gets yourself into spots by speaking too much?

03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:00.200
[Guest]: I don't know.

03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:01.480
[Guest]: I haven't yet got myself into spots.

03:27:01.480 --> 03:27:04.760
[Guest]: But you know, I normally if somebody asked me a question, I try to give the straightforward

03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:11.960
[Guest]: answer, even if it's politically incorrect, whatever, you know, maybe, you know, God knows,

03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.920
[Guest]: but you know, maybe it's a Nassim Barraus is a more professionally astute way to go

03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:16.920
[Amit Varma]: about it.

03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I hope you don't get cancelled from Ashoka University for something you say

03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:22.320
[Unknown]: in future.

03:27:22.320 --> 03:27:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So watch your mouth, as it were.

03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, we've already kind of discussed the aftermath of the assassination where of the murder when,

03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:34.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, the riots happen and he's been told the police can't report to him and you've

03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:38.040
[Amit Varma]: described him it as his wireless star and so on and so forth.

03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:41.560
[Amit Varma]: And so I won't go over that sort of area again.

03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:46.640
[Amit Varma]: But once the new cabinet sort of settles down, and now he's made the defense minister, you

03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:48.760
[Amit Varma]: know, what's the scene like?

03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:53.800
[Amit Varma]: Because what Rajiv Gandhi does is he gets a whole bunch of his cronies, people he's

03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:55.920
[Amit Varma]: been to school with many of them at Doon School.

03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So people like Arun Singh and Satish Sharma and Arun Nehru was there, Mani Shankar Iyer,

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:02.280
[Amit Varma]: all of these people.

03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:06.600
[Amit Varma]: So he gets these Lutyens elite as it were, and these are the Lutyens elite I think we

03:28:06.600 --> 03:28:08.160
[Amit Varma]: truly should look down upon.

03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:14.340
[Amit Varma]: And he gets this Lutyens elite of English speaking elites who have, you know, no sense

03:28:14.340 --> 03:28:16.120
[Amit Varma]: of India per se.

03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:18.360
[Amit Varma]: And Narsimha Rao is in the cabinet as well.

03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:19.360
[Amit Varma]: So what's the deal?

03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:25.360
[Amit Varma]: How is he kind of jockeying for position within this bunch of people?

03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And what do you think he wants at this point, like he's already tried and failed to be nominated

03:28:30.480 --> 03:28:35.920
[Amit Varma]: for the presidency when, you know, Indira Gandhi chooses Zehl Singh over him.

03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:36.920
[Amit Varma]: What's happening here?

03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:39.920
[Guest]: Well, he wants to continue to be in power like all politicians.

03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:44.280
[Guest]: I mean, I hope I haven't given your listeners the view that Narsimha Rao is bathed in milk.

03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:45.320
[Guest]: He's not, right?

03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:49.720
[Guest]: So he's as ambitious as, you know, complexity is both ambitious and unambitious.

03:28:49.720 --> 03:28:52.000
[Guest]: But he certainly wants to continue to be in power.

03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:58.400
[Guest]: His single focus is to be as close and useful to Rajiv Gandhi as he was to Indira Gandhi.

03:28:58.400 --> 03:29:02.600
[Guest]: The most important thing is he recognizes what you just said, that he's an outsider

03:29:02.600 --> 03:29:05.040
[Guest]: in Team Rajiv, right?

03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:06.520
[Guest]: And he has to reinvent himself.

03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:11.040
[Guest]: And I have this wonderful story here about how he overhears Rajiv Gandhi making some

03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:12.440
[Guest]: allusion to computers.

03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:14.560
[Guest]: He's not heard the phrase before.

03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:16.320
[Guest]: You know, this is the mid 80s, right?

03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:18.480
[Guest]: And Narsimha Rao is in the 60s.

03:29:18.480 --> 03:29:20.760
[Guest]: And he asks his son, what is this computer?

03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:23.480
[Guest]: Send me a, you know, send me a sample.

03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:27.040
[Guest]: And his son sends him a sample from Hyderabad to Delhi of a computer.

03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:29.120
[Guest]: It comes by Indian Airlines.

03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:34.120
[Guest]: And Narsimha Rao doesn't, you know, you know, hire somebody to teach him, does that a little

03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:37.920
[Guest]: bit and as I mentioned, very soon learns COBOL, BASIC and UNIX, right?

03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:44.160
[Guest]: And it's just an example of how Narsimha Rao is using his skill at curiosity to refashion

03:29:44.160 --> 03:29:48.760
[Guest]: himself and retool himself to be as useful to Rajiv Gandhi as he is to Indira Gandhi.

03:29:48.760 --> 03:29:50.100
[Guest]: And he successfully so.

03:29:50.100 --> 03:29:52.080
[Guest]: He becomes foreign minister again.

03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:57.320
[Guest]: For Rajiv Gandhi to give him the education ministry is not actually a demotion from defense,

03:29:57.320 --> 03:30:01.000
[Guest]: but he's giving it to him because he feels that Narsimha Rao has something to offer and

03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.400
[Guest]: something to add to it, right?

03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:06.120
[Guest]: And for him, education is a priority sector.

03:30:06.120 --> 03:30:07.880
[Guest]: So Narsimha Rao is retooling himself.

03:30:07.880 --> 03:30:14.440
[Guest]: But you know, by the time he, Narsimha Rao reaches 1991, he's old, Rajiv Gandhi decides

03:30:14.440 --> 03:30:17.320
[Guest]: that his career is over, right?

03:30:17.320 --> 03:30:20.640
[Guest]: He tries again to become president in 1987.

03:30:20.640 --> 03:30:25.000
[Guest]: But his close friend R Venkatraman, who was the same vintage at him become president himself,

03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000
[Guest]: but Narsimha Rao could have become president.

03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:30.080
[Guest]: He was well within the realm of becoming president.

03:30:30.080 --> 03:30:33.960
[Guest]: But the key thing here is that when Rajiv Gandhi asks him to step down, doesn't give

03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:36.520
[Guest]: him a ticket, Narsimha Rao doesn't rebel.

03:30:36.520 --> 03:30:42.200
[Guest]: As I mentioned earlier, he accepts with equanimity his fall.

03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:46.480
[Guest]: Most politicians will create a ruckus, give a press conference, abuse, Narsimha Rao doesn't

03:30:46.480 --> 03:30:48.060
[Guest]: do that, right?

03:30:48.060 --> 03:30:52.640
[Guest]: And yet, as I point out, there's a key moment when Narsimha Rao hears that Rajiv Gandhi

03:30:52.640 --> 03:30:57.520
[Guest]: has been murdered, when at the time he hears it, he's in shock, a doctor has to come to

03:30:57.520 --> 03:30:59.240
[Guest]: kind of settle him down.

03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:04.120
[Guest]: But very soon, in just a few hours, he realizes that by virtue of being one of the senior

03:31:04.120 --> 03:31:08.760
[Guest]: most leaders of the Congress, who stepped down when the Nehru-Gandhis asked him to do

03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:11.760
[Guest]: it, he is now best primed to become prime minister.

03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:16.800
[Guest]: And within a few hours, he's, you know, he's, he's, you know, moving to Delhi, maneuvering,

03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:18.800
[Guest]: trying to become prime minister.

03:31:18.800 --> 03:31:21.120
[Guest]: That's that's amazing political instinct.

03:31:21.120 --> 03:31:26.040
[Guest]: And it taught me that Narsimha Rao's key skill was when he realized that the cards he had

03:31:26.040 --> 03:31:28.840
[Guest]: been dealt with are not good.

03:31:28.840 --> 03:31:33.160
[Guest]: And I'm sure there's a poker analogy, Amit, I just don't know enough poker, he, you know,

03:31:33.160 --> 03:31:37.600
[Guest]: he knows he has a bad hand, so he plays it on defense.

03:31:37.600 --> 03:31:42.880
[Guest]: And when suddenly the hand turns for him, he ends up with a good hand, he plays aggressively.

03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:46.320
[Guest]: Is there an analogy in poker for that?

03:31:46.320 --> 03:31:50.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'd have to think of one, there are various situations in which I mean, you know,

03:31:50.600 --> 03:31:54.080
[Amit Varma]: it's common in poker, of course, that a bad hand turns into a good hand, but often it

03:31:54.080 --> 03:31:59.160
[Amit Varma]: is not in your control, but you can play even a bad hand in such a way that a better hand

03:31:59.160 --> 03:32:05.240
[Amit Varma]: can fold, because, you know, and so I won't go too far with the poker, but certainly what

03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:09.680
[Amit Varma]: he the canniness he showed in suggesting ND Tiwari's name, as you point out, it's just

03:32:09.680 --> 03:32:15.120
[Amit Varma]: an example of the kind of mind games he's playing, that he is simultaneously by that

03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:18.240
[Amit Varma]: signaling that, hey, I am not desperate for this position.

03:32:18.240 --> 03:32:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I'm not a threat to anyone.

03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:23.640
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, he's putting forward a candidate who he knows is unacceptable.

03:32:23.640 --> 03:32:24.920
[Guest]: So they're going to come back to him.

03:32:24.920 --> 03:32:31.080
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm going to just read out if you don't mind, but I have the book with me.

03:32:31.080 --> 03:32:34.560
[Guest]: The diary entry of Narsimha Rao.

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:40.520
[Guest]: This is the day after Rajiv has been murdered, the all the congressmen are around the body

03:32:40.520 --> 03:32:45.080
[Guest]: or shards of the body in 10 Janpat pretending to cry while maneuvering to become the next

03:32:45.080 --> 03:32:46.440
[Guest]: Prime Minister.

03:32:46.440 --> 03:32:51.760
[Guest]: And while Narsimha Rao is there, and just you know, just an advertisement to the reader,

03:32:51.760 --> 03:32:56.160
[Guest]: this book is being made into an OTT series directed by Prakash Jha.

03:32:56.160 --> 03:33:01.480
[Guest]: And I've requested Mr. Jha that they must have this visual, which is that the dead body

03:33:01.480 --> 03:33:05.960
[Guest]: is there and then around them all these congressmen in white wearing the Congress topi are all

03:33:05.960 --> 03:33:10.880
[Guest]: pretending to cry, but actually they're doing guspus on who to succeed, right.

03:33:10.880 --> 03:33:15.360
[Guest]: And suddenly what happens is that Narsimha Rao writes in his diary that while we and

03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:20.900
[Guest]: I'm quoting here, while we were hanging around the dead body in 10 Janpat, Pranab took me

03:33:20.900 --> 03:33:26.680
[Guest]: aside and told me that there was genuine agreement on me being elected Congress President.

03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:30.640
[Guest]: Rao doesn't say yes, yes, I should become Congress President, because if he does that,

03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:33.960
[Guest]: Pranab will tell everybody look Narsimha Rao wants to become Congress President and then

03:33:33.960 --> 03:33:35.920
[Guest]: everybody would gun for him.

03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:41.000
[Guest]: So Narsimha Rao, this is what Narsimha Rao says, I knew that Pranab's report was too

03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:47.240
[Guest]: good to be true, either he was himself a dupe or he was party to some kind of design and

03:33:47.240 --> 03:33:49.080
[Guest]: was trying to lull me.

03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:54.280
[Guest]: He had done this role many times in those crucial years of Indiraji, I did not want

03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:55.280
[Guest]: to react.

03:33:55.280 --> 03:34:01.040
[Guest]: I mentioned about my health and said I was I feel a bit diffident, Narsimha Rao is pretending

03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:02.320
[Guest]: to Pranab.

03:34:02.320 --> 03:34:08.760
[Guest]: I suggested NDT who is ND Tiwari instead, taking care to add that I was not refusing

03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:12.640
[Guest]: yet it would be good if he came up after a consensus.

03:34:12.640 --> 03:34:18.400
[Guest]: I also knew that ND Tiwari would be unacceptable as or more so than myself in the scheme of

03:34:18.400 --> 03:34:19.400
[Guest]: things.

03:34:19.400 --> 03:34:24.160
[Guest]: This paragraph tells me everything you want to know about Narsimha Rao maneuvering.

03:34:24.160 --> 03:34:28.360
[Guest]: Just imagine that visual Pranab coming and whispering and look this is written that night,

03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:29.360
[Guest]: it's his diary.

03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:33.400
[Guest]: So that this is happening in the day and in the night Narsimha Rao is writing this and

03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:38.760
[Guest]: it just told me and it also told me how lucky I was as a biographer to get access to the

03:34:38.760 --> 03:34:43.600
[Guest]: innermost thoughts of Narsimha Rao in the day that he does it.

03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:47.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah that's incredible and I can think of a lesser man either enthusiastically saying

03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:52.560
[Amit Varma]: yes yes or even putting his arm around Pranab's shoulder and saying that if I become PM I'll

03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:55.520
[Guest]: make you FM which would have been as big a disaster for India.

03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:58.760
[Guest]: Disaster because imagine what Pranab would have done, he would have gone and told Sonia

03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:02.680
[Guest]: Gandhi that look Narsimha Rao wants to be Prime Minister and immediately they would

03:35:02.680 --> 03:35:04.800
[Amit Varma]: have killed him.

03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:06.360
[Amit Varma]: So this is beautiful.

03:35:06.360 --> 03:35:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Now before we get to the 1991 phase when he takes over as PM, a final question I want

03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:16.080
[Amit Varma]: to ask you about the earlier period which comes from something really interesting where

03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:20.840
[Amit Varma]: you point out that there were once a set of papers you know with the heading human resource

03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:25.200
[Amit Varma]: development and there were a bunch of papers and and that happened to have an excerpt that

03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:30.360
[Amit Varma]: happened to have something that Rao had handwritten himself and that included, I'll read this

03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:34.600
[Amit Varma]: bit out, quote with human resource development as a heading it contained an excerpt from

03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:39.360
[Amit Varma]: an author Rao enjoyed, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, I hope I'm pronouncing that right and the

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:44.440
[Amit Varma]: excerpt is this is the Saint-Exupéry's words, quote a rock pile ceases to be a rock

03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:50.400
[Amit Varma]: pile the moment a single man contemplates it bearing within him the image of a cathedral,

03:35:50.400 --> 03:35:51.400
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Incredible quote right and now your words continue, below this Rao had written woman

03:35:55.920 --> 03:36:02.320
[Amit Varma]: and child development, health, youth affairs, sports, culture, labor, question mark and

03:36:02.320 --> 03:36:06.720
[Amit Varma]: you continue, the note was returned to Rao and he slipped it into the pocket of his kurta

03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:10.840
[Amit Varma]: later that morning he went to see the Prime Minister which is Rajiv Gandhi, he told Rajiv

03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:15.480
[Amit Varma]: stop quote and now Rao's words we see a rock pile of disorganized underutilized human resources

03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:19.840
[Amit Varma]: you see a cathedral, you see a cathedral, we can fashion it but we need to go beyond

03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:24.560
[Amit Varma]: just the ministry of education, stop quote and now you continue Rao persuaded Rajiv to

03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:28.720
[Amit Varma]: integrate the departments of culture, youth affairs, sports, women and child development

03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:32.560
[Amit Varma]: and later health with education into the new HRD ministry, stop quote.

03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Like first of all I just love this image of somebody sees a rock pile and somebody sees

03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:42.720
[Amit Varma]: a cathedral, a stunning image and also it seems to me that all of these you know culture,

03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:47.560
[Amit Varma]: youth affairs, sports, women and child development are amenable to scaling right.

03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:53.200
[Amit Varma]: You make a small difference here, it reverberates into something much bigger, it's not static,

03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:58.480
[Amit Varma]: it scales massively and that's exactly the thing about liberalization as well that economic

03:36:58.480 --> 03:37:04.160
[Amit Varma]: freedom also scales in a similar way where the state is playing an enabling part as it

03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:11.560
[Amit Varma]: does in all of these subjects you know and this struck me as really interesting and kind

03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:16.600
[Amit Varma]: of wise from Rao in getting you know I mean I don't know if he chose this ministry or

03:37:16.600 --> 03:37:20.960
[Amit Varma]: asked for it or whatever but he was clearly reveling in it but in these specific subjects

03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:25.040
[Amit Varma]: and labor was left out because it had more to do with taking care of the interests of

03:37:25.040 --> 03:37:30.160
[Amit Varma]: labor currently and all of that not so scalable but unless you change the labor laws which

03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:33.520
[Amit Varma]: of course hurt labor more than they help them but that's a different story but all of these

03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:38.540
[Amit Varma]: are extremely scalable and liberalization in the end also proves to be that.

03:37:38.540 --> 03:37:45.520
[Amit Varma]: So does this sort of indicate that his mindset is broader and thinking at you know a different

03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:50.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of level than the typical politician who when in put in charge of a ministry may

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:54.040
[Amit Varma]: have an engineering mindset that let us tinker, we will fix this, we will fix that, we will

03:37:54.040 --> 03:38:00.320
[Amit Varma]: fix this but is he perhaps showing a more of an enabling mindset here which also might

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:05.680
[Amit Varma]: explain why he was more open to Naresh Chandra's note as cabinet secretary so a few years later.

03:38:05.680 --> 03:38:11.840
[Guest]: That's a good question Amit. I would say that when it came to welfare schemes you're absolutely

03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:16.000
[Guest]: right that he had an enabling mindset, he had a visionary mindset, he could think out

03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:21.320
[Guest]: of the box. That's what we see you know throughout and look he knew what he was talking about.

03:38:21.320 --> 03:38:26.320
[Guest]: He was education minister and health minister in Andhra Pradesh, he was education minister

03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:30.720
[Guest]: in Delhi so he knew how the state education function, how the center education function

03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:35.320
[Guest]: and he had imagination to say let's transform and he found in Rajiv Gandhi a willing prime

03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:42.080
[Guest]: minister because Rajiv was passionate about this too right. I don't see this on in economics,

03:38:42.080 --> 03:38:47.840
[Guest]: I just don't see it. He was a same old stodgy protectionist right and you know again I've

03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:52.280
[Guest]: thought about this many many times that is there some because there's so much from his

03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:56.720
[Guest]: life that tells you about how he was prime minister in other ways like how he managed

03:38:56.720 --> 03:39:01.360
[Guest]: the politics of reform, how he managed welfare schemes, foreign policy. There isn't anything

03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:05.720
[Guest]: about economics you know and as a biographer I have to go with the evidence and all evidence

03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:10.920
[Guest]: points to the fact that he was a mild protectionist on economics. He hadn't really thought about

03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:16.480
[Guest]: it but when Naresh Chandra shows him that note he wakes up. He says India has to change

03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:22.080
[Guest]: and once he decides to do that he moves with remarkable alacrity.

03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:26.520
[Amit Varma]: So you know I'll I won't discuss any more of that bit about how he becomes prime minister

03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:30.160
[Amit Varma]: but I recommend everyone read it because it's a racy read and these are going to be the

03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:37.000
[Amit Varma]: best couple of episodes in the most fascinating episodes in the OTT. You know the way he maneuvers

03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:42.040
[Amit Varma]: himself to the Congress presidency, the farmhouse meeting with Shankar Dayal Sharma, the way

03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Sharath Pawar tries to get in the way and become the prime minister saying that no on

03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:50.800
[Amit Varma]: principle the party president cannot be leader of the Lok Sabha and bla bla bla. Let's talk

03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:55.680
[Amit Varma]: about actually coming to power and he comes to power and his cabinet secretary Naresh

03:39:55.680 --> 03:40:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Chandra gives him this note and at this moment he's effectively still a man alone in the

03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:04.040
[Amit Varma]: cabinet. He hasn't chosen the people around him. He certainly hasn't chosen the finance

03:40:04.040 --> 03:40:09.400
[Amit Varma]: minister and all of these choices that he makes will now be influenced by this note.

03:40:09.400 --> 03:40:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the note. What was the problem and what did the note say?

03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:19.880
[Guest]: So just to give you a background before I answer that question. Since the early 1980s

03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:25.220
[Guest]: there was a push within the Indian system to liberalize the economy in terms of ideas.

03:40:25.220 --> 03:40:30.520
[Guest]: So there was an LK Jha report, there was an Abid Hussain report, Montek Singh had, Alu

03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:36.960
[Guest]: Walia had authored a famous M document, you know, and Rakesh Mohan had also authored a

03:40:36.960 --> 03:40:43.000
[Guest]: new industrial policy. What were all these pushing back against? All these were pushing

03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:48.060
[Guest]: back against what we call the License Quota Permit Raj. What was this License Quota Permit

03:40:48.060 --> 03:40:53.400
[Guest]: Raj? It had three components. First was that it closed off large sections of the Indian

03:40:53.400 --> 03:41:02.080
[Guest]: economy to private entrepreneurs. Only the public sector could enter and where, for example,

03:41:02.080 --> 03:41:07.280
[Guest]: making watches, only HMT could do it and HMT was used to making heavy tools, Hindustan

03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:12.120
[Guest]: machine tools, heavy industry. So you ended up with terrible HMT watches that people still

03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:17.520
[Guest]: wore because they didn't have any options. And you had then a few sectors where the government,

03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:22.000
[Guest]: their private sector could participate, but they needed all kinds of licenses. So that

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:25.840
[Guest]: was the first thing the government did. The second thing as part of the License Quota

03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:33.000
[Guest]: Permit Raj was that the size of private companies was stymied by making capital difficult for

03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:38.120
[Guest]: them because of bank nationalization, right, by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices

03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:44.000
[Guest]: Act, for example. So many ways in which the size of private businesses was stymied, they

03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.840
[Guest]: couldn't actually access the capital markets without permission from the what was called

03:41:48.840 --> 03:41:54.520
[Guest]: a CCI at that time. The third element was you were sealing off India from the world.

03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:59.840
[Guest]: So heavy tariffs when it, entry barriers when it came to foreign goods, heavy restrictions

03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:06.000
[Guest]: on foreign capital entering India, a rupee that was artificially valued, so it made exports

03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:12.760
[Guest]: very difficult, etc, etc, etc, right. Since the 80s, many bureaucrats were making arguments

03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:18.680
[Guest]: that these three pillars had to be dismantled, right. The blueprint that Nassim Harao got

03:42:18.680 --> 03:42:25.360
[Guest]: was essentially a dismantling of these three wings, right, to make most of the Indian economy

03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:30.460
[Guest]: accessible to the private sector to invest, right, to reduce restrictions on the growth

03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:35.800
[Guest]: of the private sector, and three, to allow foreign capital and goods to enter India,

03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:40.720
[Guest]: right. This was what the blueprint talked about. The blueprint also said that unless

03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:46.320
[Guest]: you do it, the Indian foreign exchange was so low that we would default on an IMF loan,

03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:50.440
[Guest]: we didn't have enough money. I mention in the book reasons, short term reasons for why

03:42:50.440 --> 03:42:55.900
[Guest]: the Indian economy was suffering, why we lacked foreign capital. Listeners only have to look

03:42:55.900 --> 03:43:01.360
[Guest]: to Sri Lanka today to see that it was very, very similar situation. Now, hopefully Sri

03:43:01.360 --> 03:43:06.280
[Guest]: Lanka learns from Nassim Harao and uses this for long term reforms of the economy. Hopefully

03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:10.360
[Guest]: they do that. Nassim Harao was able to do that. But I just want to give you that this

03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:12.400
[Guest]: is the background to that particular document.

03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, it's a great background. And, you know, and just speaking of what Indira did,

03:43:18.160 --> 03:43:22.400
[Amit Varma]: like people castigate her for the emergency and all that, which she should be castigated

03:43:22.400 --> 03:43:27.720
[Amit Varma]: for. But for me, her economic policies were as disastrous, if not more, I think they kept

03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:32.000
[Amit Varma]: millions of Indians in poverty for decades longer than they should have. They were a

03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:36.200
[Amit Varma]: crime on humanity. And people don't often think of economics as such a dry subject,

03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:40.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, License Raj, this, that. But the point is, you have real consequences on real

03:43:40.320 --> 03:43:45.200
[Amit Varma]: human beings. That's, you know, exactly what happened with her. But you know, that rant

03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:46.200
[Amit Varma]: aside, it's also...

03:43:46.200 --> 03:43:52.920
[Guest]: Just to add to your rant, people unfairly criticize Nehru. He had a mild antipathy towards

03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:57.200
[Guest]: the private sector. But look, he was obsessed with growth. And when he looked around himself

03:43:57.200 --> 03:44:01.760
[Guest]: in the 40s, the country that was able to grow was the Soviet Union. It was the growth model,

03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:07.240
[Guest]: just like China is today. And so he adopted fire plans, etc, etc. Is Indira Gandhi who

03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:12.960
[Guest]: turned this mild antipathy towards the private sector into complete antipathy and instead

03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:18.000
[Guest]: of favoring growth, she favored her political survival. So I would put the blame squarely

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:19.000
[Amit Varma]: on Indira Gandhi.

03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.920
[Amit Varma]: I would put it squarely on her as well. And what makes her particularly evil, and I use

03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:27.760
[Amit Varma]: that word advisedly, is that she didn't even believe that this was the right way for India

03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:33.280
[Amit Varma]: to go. It was just a matter of political positioning. She wanted to position herself as different

03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:38.080
[Amit Varma]: from the coterie than in charge of the Congress. And therefore, this massive leftward tilt

03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:42.800
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, slogans like Gareebi Hatao, when what she was actually doing was perpetuating

03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Gareebi. And there's even an amusing anecdote in your book where you talk about how PV Narasimha

03:44:47.400 --> 03:44:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Rao at a conference of the Andhra Pradesh backward classes declares, quote, we will

03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:57.800
[Amit Varma]: not tolerate capitalists, even if he is a Harijan, stop quote, you know, similar to,

03:44:57.800 --> 03:45:01.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, Nehru's, when Nehru told JRD Tata that do not speak to me of profit, it is a

03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:08.760
[Amit Varma]: dirty word. Stop, quote, I didn't know that. Yeah, that's a pretty kind of famous. So he

03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:14.080
[Amit Varma]: also had not just a slight distrust, but a fair antipathy. But you're right that, you

03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:19.120
[Guest]: know, he was obsessed with growth. You have to give him that. His policies, much as they

03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:24.240
[Amit Varma]: were wrong, and they hurt us and didn't allow us to go the East Asian miracle way, at least

03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:27.760
[Amit Varma]: you can understand where they came from. He was well intentioned, he wanted the best.

03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:32.280
[Guest]: I would say more, you know, he set the template for East Asian growth, because you look in

03:45:32.280 --> 03:45:37.320
[Guest]: the 50s, East Asia was not growing. What Nehru was able to do was move an economy that was

03:45:37.320 --> 03:45:41.600
[Guest]: growing negatively to a 3% growth rate. See, we call it Hindu rate of growth. That's the

03:45:41.600 --> 03:45:46.280
[Guest]: wrong phrase. But that rate of growth was much higher than what the British left India

03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:52.400
[Guest]: with. And so frankly, by 19 mid 1960s, the stage was set perfectly for Indira Gandhi

03:45:52.400 --> 03:45:57.340
[Guest]: to do what the East Asia was doing at that point. East Asian growth began in the 60s.

03:45:57.340 --> 03:46:03.560
[Guest]: That was the Indira Gandhi period. And you know, Nehru had provided more of a base than

03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:10.680
[Guest]: say, Thailand or Malaysia or Indonesia had at that point. So it was Indira Gandhi who

03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:12.080
[Amit Varma]: completely blew it up.

03:46:12.080 --> 03:46:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Indira Gandhi completely blew it up in multiple ways. And the interesting thing is that today

03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:21.800
[Amit Varma]: people try to do a little rewriting of history and say that, oh, Rajiv Gandhi really started

03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:27.800
[Amit Varma]: the reforms and all of that. But as you sort of show in your book, that initially there

03:46:27.800 --> 03:46:32.800
[Amit Varma]: was, you know, the talk of reforms did come from policy wonks and bureaucrats and so on

03:46:32.800 --> 03:46:38.680
[Amit Varma]: within his administration, but he showed absolutely no will from it, turned away from it.

03:46:38.680 --> 03:46:44.560
[Guest]: Well, just pushing back a little bit, he initially tried. So, you know, in 1985, he gives a speech

03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:49.160
[Guest]: against power brokers in the Congress. You know, he expands what was called the Open

03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:53.960
[Guest]: General License. So more and more sectors became available in the Indian economy for

03:46:53.960 --> 03:46:59.520
[Guest]: the Indian private sector to invest. He was the most pro-American Prime Minister since

03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:05.160
[Guest]: then. So in that sense, his instincts to liberalize what I would say more than Narasimha Rao.

03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:09.000
[Guest]: What he lacked, and this is the key argument of the book, is the politics of reform. He

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:15.640
[Guest]: just didn't know how to do it. So from 1986-87, when he had strong headwinds, Bofors, the

03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:21.480
[Guest]: growth of Hindu nationalism and the BJP, Salman Rushdie's satanic verses being banned, he

03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:26.760
[Guest]: completely lost balance, you know. And that's the point of the book, which is that, look,

03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:30.760
[Guest]: the ideas were there in the 80s. Four Prime Ministers, including Rajiv Gandhi, had the

03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:36.280
[Guest]: ideas, right? Prime Ministers such as VP Singh, Chandrashekhar, especially Chandrashekhar

03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:41.400
[Guest]: and even Rajiv Gandhi even had the instincts to liberalize. If you remember, VP Singh was

03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:47.160
[Guest]: the liberalizing finance minister of Rajiv Gandhi, right? What they lacked is the political

03:47:47.160 --> 03:47:53.320
[Guest]: ability to remain in power and push through reforms. That's the core ingredient that Narasimha

03:47:53.320 --> 03:47:57.960
[Guest]: Rao book brings. And I want to repeat this, that liberalization in India is not about

03:47:57.960 --> 03:48:03.960
[Guest]: good ideas. Good ideas are well known in India, right? It's not even about political will.

03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:09.240
[Guest]: It's about political ability, right? That's the key ingredient, the political instincts

03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:15.320
[Guest]: or the political will to reform existed with Rajiv Gandhi initially, but then he just couldn't

03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:20.120
[Guest]: manage the headwinds of actually running government and he retreated. Narasimha Rao was able to

03:48:20.120 --> 03:48:26.440
[Guest]: manage parliament, manage party, manage Sonia Gandhi and bring about change. That's the

03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:32.280
[Amit Varma]: central point of the book. When I think of Rajiv Gandhi as CM is just someone who is

03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:36.520
[Amit Varma]: bumbling through governance, who has no core convictions. For example, you use a fantastic

03:48:36.520 --> 03:48:41.240
[Amit Varma]: phrase, comparative communalism, right? In the context of first he does Shabano, then he

03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:45.320
[Amit Varma]: overcompensates by opening the gates of the Babri Masjid, then he overcompensates to that by,

03:48:45.880 --> 03:48:50.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, with the satanic versus ban. We were the first country in the world to ban that book

03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:55.400
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. So he's just bumbling from one thing to the other. You could say,

03:48:55.400 --> 03:49:00.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, to go back to our thick and thin thing, he has no thick convictions. It's all thin

03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:05.080
[Amit Varma]: convictions. He's just following sort of the winds of the moment. Or do you feel that he had

03:49:05.080 --> 03:49:10.600
[Guest]: thick convictions of any sort? I think he had the, you know, I would be favorable to say he had a

03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:17.240
[Guest]: thick conviction to liberalize, but he simply didn't have the chops to see it through. And when

03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.200
[Guest]: that happened, when he had pushback, it's not that he lacked conviction, he lacked courage.

03:49:22.200 --> 03:49:26.200
[Guest]: And there's a slight difference between the two, right? He had the beliefs were intact,

03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:31.320
[Guest]: you know, but he just lacked, you know, when there was pushback, he just lacked the ability

03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:36.200
[Guest]: to navigate that. He was a child. That's, you know, children have thick convictions, right?

03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:38.520
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, I think they are thin, but intense.

03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:45.000
[Guest]: I mean, because the way you describe thin was that they came from other people, you know,

03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:49.160
[Guest]: I felt that again, who knows, I haven't gone to Rajiv's mind and certainly the book is not on

03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:56.200
[Guest]: Rajiv, but I felt that his, you know, he was sincere and his belief in transforming India was

03:49:56.200 --> 03:50:01.480
[Guest]: deeply held. But that's not all you need in politics. That's the point I make again and again,

03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:07.560
[Guest]: right? That thick conviction needs ability to actually transform that on the ground, right?

03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:13.880
[Guest]: I may deeply, deeply believe that I want to end poverty, right? But unless I have the chops and

03:50:13.880 --> 03:50:19.320
[Guest]: the mechanisms to do it, that deeply held thick conviction matters for not, right?

03:50:19.320 --> 03:50:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And not just that, you may believe you want to end poverty and you may even have the political

03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:28.920
[Amit Varma]: chops to do whatever it takes, but you may have a misunderstanding of the problem to begin with.

03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:30.440
[Guest]: I don't think Rajiv had a misunderstanding.

03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:32.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm not saying he did.

03:50:32.120 --> 03:50:34.200
[Guest]: But I think he had a correct understanding.

03:50:34.200 --> 03:50:39.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm just pointing out that these are all the qualities that would go into change that

03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:44.120
[Amit Varma]: one, you have to have the conviction, two, you have to have the understanding of what requires

03:50:44.120 --> 03:50:47.960
[Amit Varma]: to be done and three, you would need the political chops to kind of pull it off.

03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:52.520
[Amit Varma]: So moving away from Rajiv, because like you said, your book isn't about Rajiv and why we

03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:53.320
[Guest]: even talking about him.

03:50:53.320 --> 03:50:56.600
[Guest]: But you know, for me, the tragedy of Rajiv was even the greater,

03:50:56.600 --> 03:51:01.640
[Guest]: you know, just to end that, which is here's a man who had convictions, who had a mandate.

03:51:01.640 --> 03:51:06.280
[Guest]: I mean, he had the largest mandate, I think 404 or 405 seats in parliament,

03:51:06.280 --> 03:51:11.160
[Guest]: much more than Narendra Modi, almost, you know, more than 100 more than Narendra Modi, right?

03:51:11.160 --> 03:51:12.040
[Guest]: So imagine, right?

03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:16.840
[Guest]: Imagine somebody who is 25% stronger than Narendra Modi is at the moment, right?

03:51:16.840 --> 03:51:18.520
[Guest]: Or even 30% stronger.

03:51:18.520 --> 03:51:20.360
[Guest]: Just imagine what that looks like.

03:51:20.360 --> 03:51:22.680
[Guest]: And still he messed it up, right?

03:51:22.680 --> 03:51:25.000
[Amit Varma]: It's unforgivable, really.

03:51:25.880 --> 03:51:27.160
[Amit Varma]: It's unforgivable.

03:51:27.160 --> 03:51:34.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's sort of now talk about, you know, he sees Red Note from Narendra and there is a

03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:37.640
[Guest]: body of work which has gone on, Rakesh Mohan, like you said, in 1988.

03:51:37.640 --> 03:51:40.760
[Guest]: There's a decade of work that has gone on that precedes that note.

03:51:40.760 --> 03:51:44.120
[Guest]: Manmohan Singh played a key part in that preceding decade too.

03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:45.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:51:45.400 --> 03:51:48.920
[Amit Varma]: And so what happens now?

03:51:48.920 --> 03:51:54.680
[Amit Varma]: At this point, he sees the note, one, which is something that impressed me a lot is that

03:51:54.680 --> 03:51:59.880
[Amit Varma]: you said he grasped the enormity of the crisis immediately.

03:51:59.880 --> 03:52:05.160
[Amit Varma]: And that by itself is impressive, because, you know, a lot of politicians, when you're

03:52:05.160 --> 03:52:08.040
[Amit Varma]: sort of told something about the economy, and it's an abstract subject, and you don't

03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:12.440
[Amit Varma]: have prior understanding of it, that in any way can be called deep, like he had of so

03:52:12.440 --> 03:52:18.360
[Amit Varma]: many other subjects, you know, for him to just figure out that this is a big deal, and

03:52:18.360 --> 03:52:19.960
[Amit Varma]: I need to do something.

03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And this has to be the sole focus, because it seems to me that after that, from the events

03:52:25.880 --> 03:52:31.320
[Amit Varma]: that you describe, everything that he does politically, seems to go towards solving the

03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:35.000
[Amit Varma]: problem, right down to choosing the finance minister, whereas you said Pranab Mukherjee

03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:39.080
[Amit Varma]: supported his rise to the Congress presidency and the prime ministership.

03:52:39.080 --> 03:52:43.880
[Amit Varma]: And Pranab had been finance minister under Indira as well, would have been a natural

03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:44.880
[Amit Varma]: choice for him.

03:52:44.880 --> 03:52:48.120
[Amit Varma]: But he didn't pick Pranab because he thought that I have to solve this problem.

03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And that is the wrong man for this problem.

03:52:50.200 --> 03:52:55.400
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how things start unfolding now and how he comes to his choice

03:52:55.400 --> 03:52:56.960
[Guest]: of finance minister and so on.

03:52:56.960 --> 03:53:01.560
[Guest]: So Naseem Maharaj understands very clearly that these three pillars of the license permit

03:53:01.560 --> 03:53:05.080
[Guest]: quota raj has to be dismantled full stop, right.

03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:06.080
[Guest]: So what does he do?

03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:10.680
[Guest]: Firstly, he realizes that the key element is the first aspect, right, first and second

03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:16.280
[Guest]: aspects, which is that you have to reduce restrictions on domestic entrepreneurs, what

03:53:16.280 --> 03:53:18.760
[Guest]: we call internal liberalization.

03:53:18.760 --> 03:53:23.040
[Guest]: Step two is external liberalization, which is you have to allow foreign capital and foreign

03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:25.120
[Guest]: services and goods to enter India.

03:53:25.120 --> 03:53:28.400
[Guest]: But the first step is industrial de-licensing.

03:53:28.400 --> 03:53:32.320
[Guest]: So he keeps the industry ministry for himself, people forget this, right, that's a very key

03:53:32.320 --> 03:53:33.960
[Guest]: element, right.

03:53:33.960 --> 03:53:37.660
[Guest]: Second is he appoints a principal secretary who is a key bureaucrat for every prime minister

03:53:37.660 --> 03:53:43.440
[Guest]: who was a former industry secretary, Amarnath Verma, well known liberalizer, right.

03:53:43.440 --> 03:53:47.640
[Guest]: Third is he tells PC Alexander who's helping him at that time that look, I need a finance

03:53:47.640 --> 03:53:52.920
[Guest]: minister who is open to the world, right, who is able to assist with external liberalization

03:53:52.920 --> 03:53:55.280
[Guest]: and there are two names given there.

03:53:55.280 --> 03:53:59.360
[Guest]: The first name IG Patel, who is the head of the London School of Economics at that time

03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:00.480
[Guest]: says no.

03:54:00.480 --> 03:54:01.960
[Guest]: The second name is Manmohan Singh.

03:54:01.960 --> 03:54:05.400
[Guest]: So Manmohan Singh says yes, and he becomes the finance minister.

03:54:05.400 --> 03:54:11.280
[Guest]: And look, Manmohan Singh has many, many skills that Narsimha Rao who already knows him appreciates.

03:54:11.280 --> 03:54:17.000
[Guest]: One is Manmohan Singh is incorruptible, right, with an ethics of a different order from most

03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:18.760
[Guest]: people in politics and bureaucracy.

03:54:18.760 --> 03:54:23.120
[Guest]: And this is important because Narsimha Rao has an instinct even then, that liberalization

03:54:23.120 --> 03:54:25.820
[Guest]: will give rise to allegations of corruption.

03:54:25.820 --> 03:54:29.840
[Guest]: And so as the economy is opening up to the private sector, it's very important for to

03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:34.800
[Guest]: have a finance minister who's insulated from the shenanigans of the private sector, right,

03:54:34.800 --> 03:54:38.920
[Guest]: you don't want to have somebody who's friends with Dhirubhai Ambani, friends with the Tata's,

03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:42.200
[Guest]: friends with the Birla's and Manmohan Singh is that guy, right.

03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:47.720
[Guest]: Second is that while Manmohan Singh has also had multiple views on liberalization over

03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:52.320
[Guest]: the years, he's much more of a conviction liberalizer than Narsimha Rao.

03:54:52.320 --> 03:54:58.080
[Guest]: And third is that Manmohan Singh has held every single position of economic policy in

03:54:58.080 --> 03:54:59.080
[Guest]: the Indian government.

03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:04.160
[Guest]: I mean, there are five positions of economic policy in the Indian government finance secretary,

03:55:04.160 --> 03:55:09.120
[Guest]: finance minister, deputy chairman planning commission, chief economic advisor of India

03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:13.960
[Guest]: and RBI governor, Manmohan Singh has had all of them until he becomes finance minister,

03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:14.960
[Guest]: right.

03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:20.040
[Guest]: So, he knew every inch of the economic levers, he knew how to while the political cover would

03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:25.680
[Guest]: be given by Narsimha Rao, actually implementing it on the ground would be the person, you

03:55:25.680 --> 03:55:28.680
[Guest]: know, would be Manmohan Singh and Manmohan Singh was ripe for the idea.

03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:34.600
[Guest]: So his incorruptibility, you know, and his ability to understand every inch of economic

03:55:34.600 --> 03:55:39.600
[Guest]: policy in India was very important to Narsimha Rao, that's why he was selected, right.

03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:44.920
[Guest]: He also had other liberalizers, for example, he had P Chidambaram as Minister of Commerce,

03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:47.600
[Guest]: he had Montek Singh Ahluwalia playing a key role.

03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:49.760
[Guest]: So he surrounded himself with advisors.

03:55:49.760 --> 03:55:54.160
[Guest]: And what I find noteworthy in this Amit is that Manmohan Singh, I mean, Narsimha Rao

03:55:54.160 --> 03:55:58.240
[Guest]: wasn't insecure that he knew nothing about economics, he understood that a job needed

03:55:58.240 --> 03:55:59.520
[Guest]: to be done.

03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:03.440
[Guest]: And he said, who are the best people for the job, he and Manmohan Singh didn't have a personal

03:56:03.440 --> 03:56:07.060
[Guest]: equation or personal chemistry that was not relevant to Narsimha Rao.

03:56:07.060 --> 03:56:12.040
[Guest]: And this goes back to his childhood that here's a man who's used to being lonely, who's not

03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:16.880
[Guest]: used, you know, who's not looking for chamchas, cronies, you know, who will mouth what the

03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:17.880
[Guest]: master wants.

03:56:17.880 --> 03:56:21.600
[Guest]: He said, I want the best people for the job to be able to do what the job takes.

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:24.680
[Guest]: I think that's a remarkable quality.

03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:28.480
[Amit Varma]: There's an anecdote that also is interesting in this context, like we are recording this

03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:32.880
[Amit Varma]: on the day that episode 281 released, this episode will be 283.

03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And 282, which you haven't heard yet, but is the episode that releases before yours

03:56:37.320 --> 03:56:38.520
[Amit Varma]: is with Naushad Forbes.

03:56:38.520 --> 03:56:39.520
[Amit Varma]: Oh, wow.

03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:44.520
[Amit Varma]: And Naushad told me that in that episode, he speaks about how he was at a meeting that

03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Manmohan Singh had convened of the top industrialists to meet the top industrialists so the finance

03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:50.560
[Amit Varma]: minister can kind of talk to them.

03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:53.760
[Amit Varma]: So he went to that meeting, and I think he was positioned between Ambani and Tata.

03:56:53.760 --> 03:56:57.060
[Amit Varma]: So all the photographs the next day had Naushad Forbes in the middle because he was sitting

03:56:57.060 --> 03:56:58.880
[Amit Varma]: between those two guys.

03:56:58.880 --> 03:57:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And Naushad gave his usual outspoken views on the importance of liberalization and all

03:57:03.680 --> 03:57:05.800
[Amit Varma]: of that at that point.

03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And after the meeting ended, you know, when Manmohan Singh was shaking all the hands individually

03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:14.800
[Amit Varma]: one by one, he told Naushad that, you know, what you said in this meeting, please say

03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:19.600
[Amit Varma]: it outside and please say it again and again, and please say it loud, you know, and just

03:57:19.600 --> 03:57:22.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of indicating again, what you said about the conviction.

03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:27.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, you've laid out the different kind of obstacles that now existed over here.

03:57:27.240 --> 03:57:29.400
[Amit Varma]: One, the Congress has a minority in Parliament.

03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:33.640
[Amit Varma]: Two, there is a Bombay Club, which is basically your existing bunch of big industrialists

03:57:33.640 --> 03:57:37.840
[Amit Varma]: who have benefited from the License Raj and who don't want competition coming from outside.

03:57:37.840 --> 03:57:42.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, underscoring the point I keep making, that what big business wants is not free markets.

03:57:42.840 --> 03:57:43.840
[Amit Varma]: It's never that.

03:57:43.840 --> 03:57:45.400
[Amit Varma]: They want to hold on to their position.

03:57:45.400 --> 03:57:49.400
[Amit Varma]: So market friendly and business friendly are entirely different terms.

03:57:49.400 --> 03:57:50.400
[Guest]: That's right.

03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:53.880
[Amit Varma]: What people like us should aim for is market friendly, because that's where common people

03:57:53.880 --> 03:57:55.320
[Amit Varma]: like you and me benefit.

03:57:55.320 --> 03:57:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And the third was the legacy of the party itself, that this was a party that had built

03:57:59.520 --> 03:58:04.840
[Amit Varma]: this edifice, part of which, you know, Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were now going to start

03:58:04.840 --> 03:58:06.000
[Amit Varma]: tearing down.

03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And there is this lovely sort of passage you have, which I'm going to read out, which describes

03:58:11.760 --> 03:58:16.800
[Amit Varma]: what Rao's strategy was towards dismantling the Congress legacy.

03:58:16.800 --> 03:58:21.600
[Amit Varma]: And before this, one quick note of context that, you know, the Congress manifesto before

03:58:21.600 --> 03:58:23.480
[Amit Varma]: this had nothing about liberalization.

03:58:23.480 --> 03:58:27.840
[Amit Varma]: It was completely protectionist and it was a standard, the same old, same old.

03:58:27.840 --> 03:58:32.720
[Amit Varma]: And your Para reads, quote, that afternoon Rao convened a meeting of CWC at his house.

03:58:32.720 --> 03:58:37.840
[Amit Varma]: He began by saying that all the new policy did was to reverse Indira Gandhi's sharp leftward

03:58:37.840 --> 03:58:43.280
[Amit Varma]: tilt in 1969 and take the country back to the more flexible 1956 policy resolution of

03:58:43.280 --> 03:58:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Nehru.

03:58:44.280 --> 03:58:48.520
[Amit Varma]: The Congress, Rao added, continued to believe in the commanding heights of the public sector.

03:58:48.520 --> 03:58:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Having played one Nehru-Gandhi against another, Rao now let his finance minister speak, learning

03:58:53.240 --> 03:58:58.240
[Amit Varma]: from his political master, Manmohan invoked the 1991 manifesto to show that within it

03:58:58.240 --> 03:59:00.720
[Amit Varma]: lay the seeds of the new industrial policy.

03:59:00.720 --> 03:59:02.160
[Amit Varma]: This was far from the truth.

03:59:02.160 --> 03:59:06.760
[Amit Varma]: But as Manmohan Singh came out of the meeting, Arjun Singh told him, quote, Dr. Singh, you

03:59:06.760 --> 03:59:10.960
[Amit Varma]: have read the manifesto more carefully than we have, stop quote.

03:59:10.960 --> 03:59:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And this just speaks to sort of so much sagacity to realize that what they are proposing is

03:59:17.320 --> 03:59:20.260
[Amit Varma]: so incredibly radical.

03:59:20.260 --> 03:59:24.680
[Amit Varma]: But everything came down to how do you frame it by framing it as a return to Nehru, which

03:59:24.680 --> 03:59:28.920
[Amit Varma]: it wasn't by framing it as a continuation of the promises made in the manifesto, which

03:59:28.920 --> 03:59:29.920
[Amit Varma]: it wasn't.

03:59:29.920 --> 03:59:32.400
[Amit Varma]: They kind of managed to win the game.

03:59:32.400 --> 03:59:37.080
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about these two games, the internal game within the Congress party to win everybody

03:59:37.080 --> 03:59:41.880
[Amit Varma]: over and then the external game because they are still a minority party in parliament.

03:59:41.880 --> 03:59:44.120
[Guest]: So tell me a bit about these.

03:59:44.120 --> 03:59:49.680
[Guest]: So the internal story is quite fascinating because the party of Nehru and the party of

03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:55.040
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi saw liberalization as going against the core DNA of the Congress.

03:59:55.040 --> 03:59:58.960
[Guest]: So that was the core issue here.

03:59:58.960 --> 04:00:03.960
[Guest]: The way he went about it, I mentioned here, which is that every single liberalization

04:00:03.960 --> 04:00:11.840
[Guest]: document was presaged with homilies to Nehru, to Indira Gandhi, to Rajiv especially, because

04:00:11.840 --> 04:00:16.240
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao's crafty approach, especially when it came to Sonia Gandhi was to say that

04:00:16.240 --> 04:00:21.440
[Guest]: all that he's doing is what Rajiv Gandhi would have done had he not been cruelly interrupted.

04:00:21.440 --> 04:00:24.480
[Guest]: That was the kind of the argument, right.

04:00:24.480 --> 04:00:27.720
[Guest]: He also unleashed the Intelligence Bureau on the Congress.

04:00:27.720 --> 04:00:34.840
[Guest]: I have here, I'm quite proud of it, an Intelligence Bureau document showing who are the different

04:00:34.840 --> 04:00:38.880
[Guest]: congressmen and congresswomen and what are their views when it comes to liberalization

04:00:38.880 --> 04:00:41.320
[Guest]: and how you should deal with them.

04:00:41.320 --> 04:00:43.840
[Guest]: You know, so it's an actual Intelligence Bureau report.

04:00:43.840 --> 04:00:48.200
[Guest]: So Narsimha Rao, you know, the agencies that Modi unleashes, he's hardly the first person

04:00:48.200 --> 04:00:49.680
[Guest]: to unleash them, right.

04:00:49.680 --> 04:00:54.720
[Guest]: The Intelligence Bureau was unleashed by Narsimha Rao far, far earlier than that.

04:00:54.720 --> 04:00:58.800
[Guest]: When dealing with the parliament outside, Narsimha Rao survived three no confidence

04:00:58.800 --> 04:01:02.880
[Guest]: motions, one confidence motion, and I think one vote of thanks motion.

04:01:02.880 --> 04:01:09.680
[Guest]: He did it by ruthlessly splitting the, he always needed 20 or 30 votes to win because

04:01:09.680 --> 04:01:15.200
[Guest]: it was a minority in parliament and he did it by, let me put it bluntly by corruption,

04:01:15.200 --> 04:01:19.600
[Guest]: right, and other allurements by splitting smaller parties and independent parties and

04:01:19.600 --> 04:01:21.640
[Guest]: getting them to vote for the Congress.

04:01:21.640 --> 04:01:22.840
[Guest]: But that's not all he did.

04:01:22.840 --> 04:01:28.480
[Guest]: So for example, after the Babri Masjid demolition, when there was a no confidence motion against

04:01:28.480 --> 04:01:32.640
[Guest]: the Congress, Narsimha Rao went and told the left, look, you should stand with me because

04:01:32.640 --> 04:01:34.680
[Guest]: this is a fight about secularism.

04:01:34.680 --> 04:01:38.880
[Guest]: So don't talk about liberalization, let's focus on secularism and, you know, he won

04:01:38.880 --> 04:01:39.880
[Guest]: that handily.

04:01:39.880 --> 04:01:42.440
[Guest]: I think it was 300 to 100 or something like that.

04:01:42.440 --> 04:01:43.960
[Guest]: He won that no confidence motion.

04:01:43.960 --> 04:01:49.120
[Guest]: So that's the second thing he employed in parliament, which is to at key moments to

04:01:49.120 --> 04:01:54.240
[Guest]: basically tell the left that, look, let's not talk about liberalization.

04:01:54.240 --> 04:01:56.600
[Guest]: This is a fight to death against secularism.

04:01:56.600 --> 04:02:00.500
[Guest]: In that battle, we are on the same side against the BJP, right.

04:02:00.500 --> 04:02:07.720
[Guest]: He also reached out to many members, whether it was Jaswant Singh in the BJP, Vajpayee

04:02:07.720 --> 04:02:11.280
[Guest]: who was a good friend of his, Chandrashekhar, VP Singh.

04:02:11.280 --> 04:02:16.600
[Guest]: So he was constantly trying to engage with other politicians in other political parties.

04:02:16.600 --> 04:02:18.600
[Guest]: I think that was another skill he had.

04:02:18.600 --> 04:02:23.960
[Guest]: But you know, it's hard to answer this at a meta level Amit because really the way he

04:02:23.960 --> 04:02:29.360
[Guest]: managed the party and the way he managed Sonia Gandhi and the way he managed parliament is

04:02:29.360 --> 04:02:32.840
[Guest]: day to day kabaddi.

04:02:32.840 --> 04:02:36.960
[Guest]: It's not some meta question, day to day he's maneuvering to get, you know.

04:02:36.960 --> 04:02:42.000
[Guest]: So really, in some sense, Naseem Arao is, you know, they say you're living hand to mouth.

04:02:42.000 --> 04:02:45.160
[Guest]: He's living confidence motion from to no confidence motion.

04:02:45.160 --> 04:02:49.000
[Guest]: Every day he's worried that somebody would bring a no confidence motion and the government

04:02:49.000 --> 04:02:50.000
[Guest]: would fall.

04:02:50.000 --> 04:02:55.540
[Guest]: And look at this, his temporal circumstances, the two governments before him, both minority

04:02:55.540 --> 04:02:58.360
[Guest]: governments collapse within a year, right.

04:02:58.360 --> 04:03:03.720
[Guest]: The three governments after him, also minority governments collapse nearly within a year,

04:03:03.720 --> 04:03:04.720
[Guest]: right.

04:03:04.720 --> 04:03:08.880
[Guest]: So he alone was able to last five years, and I think that is incredible.

04:03:08.880 --> 04:03:15.760
[Guest]: And that's, again and again, I want to emphasize that unless you know that story, liberalization

04:03:15.760 --> 04:03:17.480
[Guest]: doesn't happen, right?

04:03:17.480 --> 04:03:25.880
[Guest]: Unless you know how power is, is accumulated, power is stabilized, and then power is expended

04:03:25.880 --> 04:03:27.920
[Guest]: for liberalization.

04:03:27.920 --> 04:03:30.960
[Guest]: Just understanding the economic policy is neither here nor there.

04:03:30.960 --> 04:03:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, in a sense, this is a very good companion episode and a companion book to the earlier

04:03:34.960 --> 04:03:40.120
[Amit Varma]: episode I done with Shruti and Ajay on the importance of our 91 reforms, what a big deal

04:03:40.120 --> 04:03:42.440
[Amit Varma]: they sort of were for India.

04:03:42.440 --> 04:03:47.120
[Amit Varma]: And you also have a chapter on what you kind of call the middle overs, right?

04:03:47.120 --> 04:03:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, initially, you can say that, okay, there was a crisis, they had to do something, you

04:03:51.120 --> 04:03:53.920
[Amit Varma]: know, the IMF demanded some reforms as well.

04:03:53.920 --> 04:03:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And all of that and okay, so these reforms happen initially.

04:03:57.080 --> 04:04:00.360
[Amit Varma]: But these guys kept the game going further than that.

04:04:00.360 --> 04:04:05.240
[Amit Varma]: They didn't just stop, they continued with, you know, one reform at a time continued kind

04:04:05.240 --> 04:04:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of moving through, though, I feel that as the years went on, the momentum got slower

04:04:08.880 --> 04:04:09.880
[Amit Varma]: and slower.

04:04:09.880 --> 04:04:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And I guess political imperatives play a part in that as well.

04:04:12.600 --> 04:04:17.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about, you know, that period, which may be missed out by many people

04:04:17.360 --> 04:04:18.360
[Amit Varma]: may

04:04:18.360 --> 04:04:22.040
[Guest]: A lot of people miss it out, because they assume that liberalization in India happened

04:04:22.040 --> 04:04:23.880
[Guest]: because of IMF pressure.

04:04:23.880 --> 04:04:28.440
[Guest]: And IMF pressure was when India had a crisis, which is in 91-92, right?

04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:32.360
[Guest]: So the entire focus is on that, for example, Jairam Ramesh has written an excellent book

04:04:32.360 --> 04:04:36.980
[Guest]: called Back from the Brink, which focuses exclusively on this period, right?

04:04:36.980 --> 04:04:42.160
[Guest]: But the reality is that even after the crisis ended, which is in 1992, when India has stable

04:04:42.160 --> 04:04:47.640
[Guest]: foreign currency, foreign exchange, even after that, so many reforms were planned, like to

04:04:47.640 --> 04:04:52.960
[Guest]: give you an example, the single biggest reform that touches us today is telecom reform, right?

04:04:52.960 --> 04:04:58.640
[Guest]: And you know, mobile telephony, that reform happened in 1994-1995, much after the crisis

04:04:58.640 --> 04:05:00.440
[Guest]: has ended.

04:05:00.440 --> 04:05:08.240
[Guest]: Opening licenses for new banks, HDFC, ICICI, a key ingredient in, you know, allowing credit

04:05:08.240 --> 04:05:14.120
[Guest]: to reach entrepreneurs in India today happened much after that crisis ended, right?

04:05:14.120 --> 04:05:22.000
[Guest]: Opening up the airline sector to private airlines, Jet, Damania, East West, some of you may remember

04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:26.000
[Guest]: these names happened after the crisis ended, and I could go on and on.

04:05:26.000 --> 04:05:27.960
[Guest]: So many, you know, reforms happened.

04:05:27.960 --> 04:05:28.960
[Guest]: Look, I'm also a critic.

04:05:28.960 --> 04:05:33.240
[Guest]: I also point out that there were many reforms that Nassim Rao didn't do in agriculture,

04:05:33.240 --> 04:05:39.280
[Guest]: for example, on the labor markets, for example, Nassim Rao didn't touch that at all, right?

04:05:39.280 --> 04:05:43.520
[Guest]: On education and health, you know, while his instincts were right, he didn't go as far

04:05:43.520 --> 04:05:48.600
[Guest]: as the UPA government and the today's Modi government have done, right?

04:05:48.600 --> 04:05:54.560
[Guest]: So you know, the policies were in the right direction, but they weren't as carefully crafted.

04:05:54.560 --> 04:05:57.880
[Guest]: And frankly, they didn't have the use of technology that you have today.

04:05:57.880 --> 04:05:59.840
[Guest]: That was something he simply didn't have.

04:05:59.840 --> 04:06:01.760
[Guest]: But so many reforms happened after that.

04:06:01.760 --> 04:06:06.760
[Guest]: And the point of that chapter, Amit, was to push against this view that it was the IMF

04:06:06.760 --> 04:06:09.600
[Guest]: who did it and India only reforms under crisis.

04:06:09.600 --> 04:06:11.880
[Guest]: There was no crisis in those three years, right?

04:06:11.880 --> 04:06:15.140
[Guest]: And yet so many changes, so many reforms happened.

04:06:15.140 --> 04:06:20.600
[Guest]: It was because both Manmohan Singh and Nassim Rao were conviction reformers.

04:06:20.600 --> 04:06:26.080
[Amit Varma]: I'll leave it to my listeners to actually go read your excellent book and, you know,

04:06:26.080 --> 04:06:27.280
[Amit Varma]: go into the weeds of all of this.

04:06:27.280 --> 04:06:28.320
[Amit Varma]: It's a fascinating story.

04:06:28.320 --> 04:06:32.440
[Amit Varma]: And I can understand why, like, I think Prakash Jha made a very smart choice, this is going

04:06:32.440 --> 04:06:34.160
[Amit Varma]: to be a big hit.

04:06:34.160 --> 04:06:39.800
[Amit Varma]: But so in the 20 minutes or so that we have left before you have to go, some quick questions

04:06:39.800 --> 04:06:42.440
[Amit Varma]: on areas that we can't really leave untouched.

04:06:42.440 --> 04:06:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is the demolition of the Babri Masjid, where it is common today to, you know,

04:06:47.680 --> 04:06:49.000
[Amit Varma]: to blame Nassim Rao for that.

04:06:49.000 --> 04:06:52.240
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it, of course, comes from the Congress desire to disown him and wipe out

04:06:52.240 --> 04:06:53.240
[Amit Varma]: his legacy.

04:06:53.240 --> 04:06:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And we'll talk about that as well.

04:06:55.080 --> 04:06:56.840
[Amit Varma]: Because we can't not talk about that.

04:06:56.840 --> 04:07:03.840
[Amit Varma]: But the sort of common canard spread is that he allowed the Babri Masjid demolition willingly.

04:07:03.840 --> 04:07:08.240
[Amit Varma]: And I think Sonia Gandhi has even said that, I think Rahul Gandhi has said that if Rajiv

04:07:08.240 --> 04:07:09.640
[Guest]: was alive, it would never have happened.

04:07:09.640 --> 04:07:15.000
[Guest]: If a Nehru Gandhi was in power, the Babri Masjid, well, so I've answered this question

04:07:15.000 --> 04:07:16.000
[Guest]: many times.

04:07:16.000 --> 04:07:22.840
[Guest]: So let me put it in this manner, which is, in India, the police come under the state.

04:07:22.840 --> 04:07:29.400
[Guest]: In June 1991, the state government of UP, where Babri Masjid is located, was won by

04:07:29.400 --> 04:07:31.960
[Guest]: Kalyan Singh of the BJP.

04:07:31.960 --> 04:07:36.480
[Guest]: He contested on the plank of demolishing the Babri Masjid and he won the election.

04:07:36.480 --> 04:07:38.240
[Guest]: He is a duly elected chief minister.

04:07:38.240 --> 04:07:43.000
[Guest]: The BJP enjoys a majority government in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

04:07:43.000 --> 04:07:47.000
[Guest]: They are in charge of protecting the Babri Masjid because the police, state police have

04:07:47.000 --> 04:07:48.660
[Guest]: to do it.

04:07:48.660 --> 04:07:50.000
[Guest]: This is a conundrum.

04:07:50.000 --> 04:07:54.280
[Guest]: So anyone who says that the Babri Masjid has to be protected, really you have to go back

04:07:54.280 --> 04:08:01.040
[Guest]: not to December 92, but to June 91 to say that a party has come to power in UP, which

04:08:01.040 --> 04:08:05.960
[Guest]: has the constitutional obligation to protect the Babri Masjid, yet its political obligation

04:08:05.960 --> 04:08:08.140
[Guest]: is to destroy the Babri Masjid.

04:08:08.140 --> 04:08:10.000
[Guest]: Should you dismiss that government?

04:08:10.000 --> 04:08:12.240
[Guest]: I would like your listeners to answer that question.

04:08:12.240 --> 04:08:13.240
[Guest]: Should you dismiss that government?

04:08:13.240 --> 04:08:14.240
[Guest]: Right?

04:08:14.240 --> 04:08:15.360
[Guest]: What do you think, Amit?

04:08:15.360 --> 04:08:16.360
[Guest]: Can you dismiss a government?

04:08:16.360 --> 04:08:17.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't think you can dismiss a government.

04:08:17.800 --> 04:08:18.800
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with you.

04:08:18.800 --> 04:08:19.800
[Guest]: It's a conundrum.

04:08:19.800 --> 04:08:20.800
[Guest]: It's a conundrum.

04:08:20.800 --> 04:08:21.800
[Guest]: You can't.

04:08:21.800 --> 04:08:26.160
[Amit Varma]: Even if you've been voted in to do something unconstitutional, you punish them after the

04:08:26.160 --> 04:08:27.160
[Guest]: act.

04:08:27.160 --> 04:08:29.580
[Guest]: You can't dismiss them preemptively.

04:08:29.580 --> 04:08:33.640
[Guest]: The only way to do that, to protect the mosque under this circumstance is to impose central

04:08:33.640 --> 04:08:38.200
[Guest]: rule, dismiss the Kalyan Singh government, take charge of the Babri Masjid and protect

04:08:38.200 --> 04:08:39.200
[Guest]: it.

04:08:39.200 --> 04:08:40.200
[Guest]: There's nothing else you could have done.

04:08:40.200 --> 04:08:44.560
[Guest]: So, the real question before Nassim Rao was, why did he trust Kalyan Singh?

04:08:44.560 --> 04:08:47.160
[Guest]: Why did he not dismiss the government?

04:08:47.160 --> 04:08:48.160
[Guest]: That's a valid question.

04:08:48.160 --> 04:08:51.360
[Amit Varma]: But that would have, you're saying that would have been like punishing a thought crime because

04:08:51.360 --> 04:08:52.360
[Amit Varma]: it hadn't been done yet.

04:08:52.360 --> 04:08:53.360
[Guest]: That's the first problem.

04:08:53.360 --> 04:08:58.680
[Guest]: As the law secretary to Nassim Rao said that, look, this is a problem because there can't

04:08:58.680 --> 04:09:03.080
[Guest]: be a potential for breakdown in law in order to impose article 356, there has to be an

04:09:03.080 --> 04:09:04.440
[Guest]: actual breakdown.

04:09:04.440 --> 04:09:07.360
[Guest]: You can't dismiss someone for a thought crime.

04:09:07.360 --> 04:09:13.040
[Guest]: Secondly, all those politicians who say that Nassim Rao should have imposed article 356,

04:09:13.040 --> 04:09:16.480
[Guest]: why didn't they say that before the mosque fell?

04:09:16.480 --> 04:09:21.560
[Guest]: Why didn't Mr. Chidambaram say before the mosque fell that Kalyan Singh should be dismissed?

04:09:21.560 --> 04:09:26.680
[Guest]: Why didn't Sonia Gandhi say before the mosque fell that Kalyan Singh should be dismissed?

04:09:26.680 --> 04:09:27.960
[Guest]: Why didn't Sharad Pawar say that?

04:09:27.960 --> 04:09:31.480
[Guest]: Why didn't Arjun Singh of all people say that biggest critic of Nassim Rao?

04:09:31.480 --> 04:09:37.000
[Guest]: The fact is that nobody was willing to give Nassim Rao the political cover to impose president's

04:09:37.000 --> 04:09:38.000
[Guest]: rule.

04:09:38.000 --> 04:09:40.960
[Guest]: And the reason for that was half the game was demolishing the mosque.

04:09:40.960 --> 04:09:43.920
[Guest]: The other half was demolishing Nassim Rao.

04:09:43.920 --> 04:09:49.560
[Guest]: And everybody was hoping that whatever happened on December 6, 1992, Nassim Rao would fall.

04:09:49.560 --> 04:09:54.080
[Guest]: And Nassim Rao was praying and hoping that somebody would give him political cover to

04:09:54.080 --> 04:09:58.000
[Guest]: impose article 356, impose president's rule, dismiss Kalyan Singh.

04:09:58.000 --> 04:09:59.000
[Guest]: Nobody was willing to say that.

04:09:59.000 --> 04:10:02.480
[Guest]: VP Singh didn't say that, Jyoti Basu didn't say that.

04:10:02.480 --> 04:10:06.040
[Guest]: Everyone was hemming and hawing and saying that we are concerned, we stand with the Prime

04:10:06.040 --> 04:10:07.040
[Guest]: Minister.

04:10:07.040 --> 04:10:09.520
[Guest]: But nobody was actually saying that sentence, right?

04:10:09.520 --> 04:10:12.280
[Guest]: Now, Nassim Rao as Prime Minister was not nobody.

04:10:12.280 --> 04:10:14.360
[Guest]: He was somebody who should have done it.

04:10:14.360 --> 04:10:15.360
[Guest]: On hindsight, he didn't.

04:10:15.360 --> 04:10:16.360
[Guest]: It was an error.

04:10:16.360 --> 04:10:19.560
[Guest]: But it was a very, very difficult decision to make.

04:10:19.560 --> 04:10:24.040
[Guest]: Had he imposed president's rule, definitely BJP would have brought about a no confidence

04:10:24.040 --> 04:10:28.240
[Guest]: motion saying murder of federalism, Congress is up to its old tricks.

04:10:28.240 --> 04:10:32.200
[Guest]: And Nassim Rao was not confident that his own cabinet would support him.

04:10:32.200 --> 04:10:37.600
[Guest]: In fact, after the demolition of Babri Masjid, when many of the cabinet ministers like Arjun

04:10:37.600 --> 04:10:41.960
[Guest]: Singh or ML Fortedar were complaining saying Nassim Rao, you know, behave badly, this that

04:10:41.960 --> 04:10:47.360
[Guest]: Pranab Mukherjee says in his memoirs that he told them, don't speak now, all the while

04:10:47.360 --> 04:10:51.480
[Guest]: before Babri Masjid fell, all of you are agreeing with Nassim Rao, none of you are sticking

04:10:51.480 --> 04:10:55.760
[Guest]: your neck out and saying impose president's rule, why are you doing it now, right?

04:10:55.760 --> 04:10:59.720
[Guest]: The real question here is not the demolition of Babri Masjid, Amit.

04:10:59.720 --> 04:11:05.520
[Guest]: I think the mistake we make is that those secularists amongst us see the rise of the

04:11:05.520 --> 04:11:14.160
[Guest]: BJP, right, as ending Indian secularism and the standing of Babri Masjid as the standing

04:11:14.160 --> 04:11:16.500
[Guest]: of Indian secularism, but it isn't.

04:11:16.500 --> 04:11:20.900
[Guest]: The real question is the rise of the BJP and is there any law in India that could have

04:11:20.900 --> 04:11:21.900
[Guest]: prevented it?

04:11:21.900 --> 04:11:25.480
[Guest]: No, because it's a bottom up democratic rise.

04:11:25.480 --> 04:11:31.420
[Guest]: And once that rise was ordained, the demolition of Babri Masjid was preordained.

04:11:31.420 --> 04:11:36.000
[Guest]: Once Kalyan Singh comes to power in UP, it becomes very difficult to protect the Babri

04:11:36.000 --> 04:11:37.000
[Guest]: Masjid.

04:11:37.000 --> 04:11:40.800
[Guest]: If not then, then a few months later, if not a few months later, then a few months later,

04:11:40.800 --> 04:11:42.560
[Guest]: something like this could have happened.

04:11:42.560 --> 04:11:47.160
[Guest]: And the only thing that could have prevented that Nassim Rao didn't do, it's an error he

04:11:47.160 --> 04:11:52.000
[Guest]: didn't do, but he was terrified if he did it, nobody else would back him up.

04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:53.800
[Amit Varma]: And on this, I think I agree with him.

04:11:53.800 --> 04:11:58.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think this is a situation where he truly got bad cards, which he could do

04:11:58.560 --> 04:11:59.840
[Amit Varma]: nothing with.

04:11:59.840 --> 04:12:04.120
[Amit Varma]: Because had he, like you correctly said, you know, had he dismissed the Kalyan Singh government

04:12:04.120 --> 04:12:09.240
[Amit Varma]: immediately anti-federalism and authoritarianism and all of that comes into play and rightly

04:12:09.240 --> 04:12:10.240
[Amit Varma]: so.

04:12:10.240 --> 04:12:12.160
[Amit Varma]: And he didn't dismiss them and he got screwed anyway.

04:12:12.160 --> 04:12:18.520
[Guest]: So keep in mind, Amit, that immediately after the demolition of Babri Masjid, all the non-BJP

04:12:18.520 --> 04:12:20.720
[Guest]: parties rallied behind Nassim Rao.

04:12:20.720 --> 04:12:25.160
[Guest]: So at that time, they were not baying for his blood, this canard that Nassim Rao did

04:12:25.160 --> 04:12:31.480
[Guest]: Babri Masjid was spread by the Congress party after Sonia ji takes control of the Congress

04:12:31.480 --> 04:12:35.280
[Guest]: in 1998 as a way of destroying Nassim Rao's legacy.

04:12:35.280 --> 04:12:40.400
[Guest]: So the story that Nassim Rao did Babri Masjid is not spread by the BJP or the opposition,

04:12:40.400 --> 04:12:42.120
[Guest]: spread by the Congress party.

04:12:42.120 --> 04:12:47.280
[Guest]: And if the Congress party is saying that their own Prime Minister did Babri Masjid, why will

04:12:47.280 --> 04:12:49.000
[Guest]: anyone else stand up for Nassim Rao?

04:12:49.000 --> 04:12:53.480
[Guest]: The catastrophe for Nassim Rao is he's a man without a constituency.

04:12:53.480 --> 04:12:56.200
[Guest]: You can say anything about him and get away.

04:12:56.200 --> 04:12:57.760
[Guest]: And the Babri Masjid is a good example.

04:12:57.760 --> 04:13:01.400
[Guest]: Look, I'm very critical of him in his role in the Sikh riots.

04:13:01.400 --> 04:13:04.280
[Guest]: But in the Babri Masjid case, he's been unfairly maligned.

04:13:04.280 --> 04:13:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

04:13:05.720 --> 04:13:10.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to our sort of second last topic on the subject, which is going nuclear.

04:13:10.760 --> 04:13:15.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, you have a fascinating chapter where you mentioned that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, when

04:13:15.880 --> 04:13:20.560
[Amit Varma]: he took over from Nassim Rao, they met and Nassim Rao apparently told Vajpayee, Samagri

04:13:20.560 --> 04:13:21.560
[Amit Varma]: Tayyar hai.

04:13:21.560 --> 04:13:26.480
[Amit Varma]: So basically saying that I have set everything in place, and now it is in your hands.

04:13:26.480 --> 04:13:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And so tell me a little bit about that, because this is also not very well known, in the sense

04:13:30.960 --> 04:13:35.700
[Amit Varma]: that people give Vajpayee all the credit or the debit, as it were, for India actually

04:13:35.700 --> 04:13:37.240
[Amit Varma]: going nuclear.

04:13:37.240 --> 04:13:41.760
[Amit Varma]: But Nassim Rao put it completely in place and if not for circumstance and the main circumstance

04:13:41.760 --> 04:13:45.200
[Amit Varma]: being losing that election, it would have happened under him.

04:13:45.200 --> 04:13:46.480
[Amit Varma]: As Vajpayee himself recognized.

04:13:46.480 --> 04:13:48.920
[Guest]: Well, it's my favorite chapter in the book.

04:13:48.920 --> 04:13:52.440
[Guest]: So I'm not going to tell you all, there's a mystery there.

04:13:52.440 --> 04:13:55.840
[Guest]: And I hope your listeners buy the book and read the mystery.

04:13:55.840 --> 04:14:00.280
[Guest]: But I'm proudest that I don't think anyone else has had access to the documents and the

04:14:00.280 --> 04:14:04.280
[Guest]: interviews that I have had on India's nuclear program.

04:14:04.280 --> 04:14:06.120
[Guest]: Nobody right has had access.

04:14:06.120 --> 04:14:11.640
[Guest]: I can't unfortunately on the show or on the record say how I got access to it.

04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:15.880
[Guest]: But suffice to say that, you know, it gives you a sense on a on a minute by minute view

04:14:15.880 --> 04:14:21.000
[Guest]: of how India's nuclear program is done, who is in the nuclear committee, I talk about

04:14:21.000 --> 04:14:26.200
[Guest]: how Nassim Rao accelerated the nuclear program in 1991 onwards.

04:14:26.200 --> 04:14:30.520
[Guest]: He didn't just accelerate the nuclear program, he also accelerated the program for delivery

04:14:30.520 --> 04:14:35.440
[Guest]: of the nuclear bomb, which is both in terms of having a missile, that's where APJ Abdul

04:14:35.440 --> 04:14:38.560
[Guest]: Kalam comes in, as well as through planes, right.

04:14:38.560 --> 04:14:42.680
[Guest]: So that both of these are delivery mechanisms for the nuclear program.

04:14:42.680 --> 04:14:46.720
[Guest]: And Nassim Rao had brought the program to fruition by 1995.

04:14:46.720 --> 04:14:50.240
[Guest]: I talk about the cat and mouse game between him and his and the Americans.

04:14:50.240 --> 04:14:54.280
[Guest]: And look, I know this chapter is not footnoted is deliberately not footnoted.

04:14:54.280 --> 04:14:58.680
[Guest]: But it's the most fun chapter I had doing because there's a genuine mystery then there's

04:14:58.680 --> 04:15:03.000
[Guest]: a there's a thrill there in how Nassim Rao outwits the Americans.

04:15:03.000 --> 04:15:09.160
[Guest]: And yet, you know, is sagacious enough to not take credit by exploding the nuclear bomb

04:15:09.160 --> 04:15:10.960
[Guest]: so close to an election.

04:15:10.960 --> 04:15:12.640
[Guest]: If you had done it, you would have won, right.

04:15:12.640 --> 04:15:16.960
[Guest]: But for him, national interest was more important, which is why an opposition leader from the

04:15:16.960 --> 04:15:23.120
[Guest]: BJP Vajpayee, who we credit with testing nuclear weapons in 1998, actually said in his words

04:15:23.120 --> 04:15:26.720
[Guest]: that the true father of India's nuclear program was Nassim Rao.

04:15:26.720 --> 04:15:31.880
[Guest]: And he says this emotionally when Nassim Rao dies in 2004, saying that this is the man

04:15:31.880 --> 04:15:34.920
[Guest]: whom we should thank and we haven't done it.

04:15:34.920 --> 04:15:36.640
[Guest]: And yeah, I don't want to say more.

04:15:36.640 --> 04:15:39.160
[Guest]: I'd like your listeners to actually read that chapter.

04:15:39.160 --> 04:15:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and statesmanship on the part of Vajpayee to give credit or debit as it were, where

04:15:44.880 --> 04:15:48.680
[Amit Varma]: it is due something that the Congress did not do.

04:15:48.680 --> 04:15:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And this is perhaps the most heartbreaking element of this whole story that after doing

04:15:54.160 --> 04:15:58.280
[Amit Varma]: all of this, you think that okay, he gets up, surely they'll give him the Bharat Ratna

04:15:58.280 --> 04:15:59.280
[Amit Varma]: for whatever it's worth.

04:15:59.280 --> 04:16:01.240
[Amit Varma]: Surely he'll be a national hero forever.

04:16:01.240 --> 04:16:03.880
[Amit Varma]: He'll die a much loved man and so on and so forth.

04:16:03.880 --> 04:16:08.240
[Amit Varma]: But instead, what happens is he dies in 2004 in Delhi, and the Congress does not want him

04:16:08.240 --> 04:16:09.520
[Amit Varma]: to be cremated there.

04:16:09.520 --> 04:16:14.240
[Amit Varma]: They insist that the body be taken to Hyderabad because Sonia just doesn't want him to remain

04:16:14.240 --> 04:16:18.240
[Amit Varma]: a major figure to have a Samadhi in Delhi or whatever, all of that.

04:16:18.240 --> 04:16:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually, he is sort of taken to Hyderabad, there's a cremation of sorts there

04:16:23.600 --> 04:16:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and gradually people have paid their respects and they kind of move away.

04:16:27.000 --> 04:16:30.580
[Amit Varma]: And then there is a sentence from your book where you say, that night television channels

04:16:30.580 --> 04:16:35.600
[Amit Varma]: showed visuals of the half burnt body, skull still visible, lying abandoned, stray dogs

04:16:35.600 --> 04:16:39.920
[Amit Varma]: were pulling at the funeral pyre, stop quote, which is an amazing heartbreaking sentence

04:16:39.920 --> 04:16:44.560
[Amit Varma]: that here is a man and his skull is, you know, still visible and stray dogs are pulling at

04:16:44.560 --> 04:16:45.560
[Amit Varma]: his funeral pyre.

04:16:45.560 --> 04:16:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to me to be a metaphor for exactly what happened to him.

04:16:49.240 --> 04:16:50.240
[Guest]: That's right.

04:16:50.240 --> 04:16:52.440
[Guest]: That's why the chapter is called half burnt body.

04:16:52.440 --> 04:16:56.560
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you know, what more can I say?

04:16:56.560 --> 04:17:01.560
[Guest]: I mean, in any religious tradition, the treatment of the body, even the worst human being, the

04:17:01.560 --> 04:17:04.920
[Guest]: body is treated, you know, in Hinduism, this is particularly important that the body is

04:17:04.920 --> 04:17:05.920
[Guest]: treated with respect.

04:17:05.920 --> 04:17:11.840
[Guest]: And the fact that even that didn't happen for the man tells you that how far his legacy

04:17:11.840 --> 04:17:14.200
[Guest]: has been forgotten by us, right?

04:17:14.200 --> 04:17:18.960
[Guest]: And I just hope that the book and this particular conversation we're having helps resurrect

04:17:18.960 --> 04:17:20.640
[Guest]: him.

04:17:20.640 --> 04:17:24.880
[Guest]: It has resurrected him, but I hope it resurrects him even more because, look, there are plenty

04:17:24.880 --> 04:17:28.400
[Guest]: of things about him that are a problem, right?

04:17:28.400 --> 04:17:32.720
[Guest]: But he transformed India and he transformed India mostly for the good.

04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:34.760
[Guest]: It wasn't fated to happen, right?

04:17:34.760 --> 04:17:37.720
[Guest]: It required tremendous skill.

04:17:37.720 --> 04:17:42.600
[Guest]: And it's something that we can learn about not just in politics today, but outside politics

04:17:42.600 --> 04:17:43.600
[Amit Varma]: today.

04:17:43.600 --> 04:17:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:17:44.600 --> 04:17:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:17:45.600 --> 04:17:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And absolutely remarkable leader.

04:17:46.600 --> 04:17:50.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, before I read your book, in fact, I already admired him and giving credit

04:17:50.920 --> 04:17:52.000
[Amit Varma]: for a lot of what happened.

04:17:52.000 --> 04:17:56.960
[Amit Varma]: But reading your book, actually just seeing that entire journey just made me go, wow,

04:17:56.960 --> 04:17:59.200
[Amit Varma]: because we don't have a politician like that.

04:17:59.200 --> 04:18:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's so tragic that, you know, that he should be treated like this by his own party

04:18:04.760 --> 04:18:07.520
[Amit Varma]: for their own image building reasons.

04:18:07.520 --> 04:18:11.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the kind of narrative manipulation that goes on.

04:18:11.520 --> 04:18:15.260
[Amit Varma]: And there's so much else in your book, which I'll, you know, ask readers to go to.

04:18:15.260 --> 04:18:19.400
[Amit Varma]: So let me kind of end with a final question as we just have like five minutes left.

04:18:19.400 --> 04:18:20.880
[Guest]: What are you reading these days?

04:18:20.880 --> 04:18:26.800
[Guest]: Well, I just finished reading my colleague Upinder Singh's book, Ancient India, Culture

04:18:26.800 --> 04:18:27.800
[Guest]: of Contradictions.

04:18:27.800 --> 04:18:31.080
[Guest]: I would recommend it very strongly.

04:18:31.080 --> 04:18:36.240
[Guest]: It's a, you know, it summarizes several of the key issues when it comes to ancient India,

04:18:36.240 --> 04:18:41.040
[Guest]: equality, gender, liberation, freedom, etc, etc.

04:18:41.040 --> 04:18:43.460
[Guest]: She has a way of sticking to facts.

04:18:43.460 --> 04:18:45.440
[Guest]: She has a way of being accessible.

04:18:45.440 --> 04:18:50.080
[Guest]: She's opinionated like, you know, the best scholars are, but it doesn't interfere with

04:18:50.080 --> 04:18:51.400
[Guest]: the way she tells the story.

04:18:51.400 --> 04:18:53.540
[Guest]: So I really like that book.

04:18:53.540 --> 04:18:58.240
[Amit Varma]: And she also happens to be the daughter of one of the protagonists of one of the people

04:18:58.240 --> 04:19:02.560
[Amit Varma]: who comes out looking really good in the story, Manmohan Singh, because even after the Congress

04:19:02.560 --> 04:19:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Party turns their back on him, he shows up every year at Narsimha Rao's, you know, birthday

04:19:07.920 --> 04:19:09.480
[Amit Varma]: celebrations and all of that.

04:19:09.480 --> 04:19:13.600
[Amit Varma]: And he's kind of still sort of maintained that loyalty and that warm feeling.

04:19:13.600 --> 04:19:14.600
[Guest]: Very much.

04:19:14.600 --> 04:19:16.400
[Guest]: But I would say Upinder Singh is very much her own personality.

04:19:16.400 --> 04:19:20.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I didn't mean to, I mean, no one should be known as someone's daughter, especially.

04:19:20.200 --> 04:19:21.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:19:21.200 --> 04:19:26.840
[Guest]: And she's like, you know, she's one of the top, absolutely top scholars on Indian history.

04:19:26.840 --> 04:19:31.280
[Guest]: So it's, you know, been quite, you know, definitely been quite enlightening.

04:19:31.280 --> 04:19:36.360
[Guest]: So it's an amateur, I mean, mine is an amateur interest in history.

04:19:36.360 --> 04:19:41.260
[Guest]: So it's nice to, you know, to engage with the works of such a professional historian.

04:19:41.260 --> 04:19:45.640
[Guest]: Maybe you're the Narsimha Rao of political scientists where you're interested in so much

04:19:45.640 --> 04:19:46.640
[Guest]: stuff.

04:19:46.640 --> 04:19:47.640
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

04:19:47.640 --> 04:19:50.480
[Guest]: Well, I think I take that as a compliment.

04:19:50.480 --> 04:19:53.600
[Amit Varma]: It was meant as a compliment.

04:19:53.600 --> 04:19:58.200
[Amit Varma]: What else, anything you'd like to recommend to listeners in terms of books, films, music?

04:19:58.200 --> 04:20:04.800
[Guest]: Well, you know, I recently read this book called Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh.

04:20:04.800 --> 04:20:08.600
[Guest]: It's a phenomenal book, phenomenal.

04:20:08.600 --> 04:20:13.080
[Guest]: It's been made into a film recently, but I would suggest you avoid that.

04:20:13.080 --> 04:20:19.280
[Guest]: I think it was ITV, there's a basically a six part or six or seven part series, you

04:20:19.280 --> 04:20:26.920
[Guest]: know, that came out in the mid 1990s, widely seen as the best TV series ever made, right?

04:20:26.920 --> 04:20:31.280
[Guest]: At least at that time before the OTT explosion, it was seen as, you know, it was very expensive

04:20:31.280 --> 04:20:36.200
[Guest]: series to be made around the same time Pride and Prejudice was made by BBC.

04:20:36.200 --> 04:20:37.640
[Guest]: So I would recommend that strongly.

04:20:37.640 --> 04:20:43.580
[Guest]: It's a bit slow by today's OTT standards, but Brideshead Revisited, the six or seven

04:20:43.580 --> 04:20:47.960
[Guest]: part series, I would recommend if you don't want to read the book.

04:20:47.960 --> 04:20:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous.

04:20:48.960 --> 04:20:51.400
[Amit Varma]: So Vinay, thank you so much for coming on the show.

04:20:51.400 --> 04:20:55.840
[Amit Varma]: May Vinay Ram or Vinay Sitapati, as it were, continue to flourish and write many books.

04:20:55.840 --> 04:20:56.840
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

04:20:56.840 --> 04:20:57.840
[Guest]: This is a pleasure.

04:20:57.840 --> 04:21:01.360
[Guest]: It's the first time we're doing this in person.

04:21:01.360 --> 04:21:06.440
[Guest]: It just tells me that how inadequate Zoom is when it comes to building chemistry in

04:21:06.440 --> 04:21:07.480
[Guest]: such a conversation.

04:21:07.480 --> 04:21:09.000
[Guest]: So thank you very much, Amit.

04:21:09.000 --> 04:21:10.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

04:21:10.000 --> 04:21:11.000
[Guest]: Thank you for being here.

04:21:11.000 --> 04:21:14.160

[Amit Varma]: Buy both his books.

04:21:23.960 --> 04:21:26.680

04:21:26.680 --> 04:21:27.680
