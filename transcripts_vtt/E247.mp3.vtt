00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
[Amit Varma]: How do we judge a political party? One way of doing so would be to see how well it governs

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.520
[Amit Varma]: when it is in power. By this yardstick, all our parties have failed. India has been misgoverned

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.520
[Amit Varma]: throughout the last 74 years, barring brief happy accidents like the liberalisation of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.680
[Amit Varma]: 1991. Bad economic policies have kept millions of people in poverty for decades longer than

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.920
[Amit Varma]: should have been the case. Our social ruptures have not been healed. If anything, they've

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: become worse and new fault lines have sprung up. But perhaps judging a party on governance

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.840
[Amit Varma]: is not fair. It ignores their incentives. A party's incentives are simply to win elections.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.200
[Amit Varma]: People don't vote on the basis of governance, but on the basis of narratives. Our parties

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.960
[Amit Varma]: have been brilliant at creating narratives, building vote banks, constructing election

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.560
[Amit Varma]: machines of staggering complexity and equally staggering efficiency. And it's so fascinating

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.040
[Amit Varma]: to take a look inside these machines at the nuts and bolts of our great democracy.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.520
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen. My guest today is Shivam Shankar Singh, author of two

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.360
[Amit Varma]: books, How to Win an Indian Election, which came out in 2019 and just released The Art

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.680
[Amit Varma]: of Conjuring Alternate Realities, co-written with Anand Venkat Narayan. Shivam's career

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.660
[Amit Varma]: graph is fascinating. He was studying economics in the US a decade ago when he got interested

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.400
[Amit Varma]: in Indian politics. The India Against Corruption movement filled him with hope and given how

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.560
[Amit Varma]: bad the government of the day was, he saw Narendra Modi as a way out. He joined the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.240
[Amit Varma]: BJP in 2013 and went to see Modi's parliamentary campaign in Varanasi in 2014 from up close.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.320
[Amit Varma]: He then did a LAMP fellowship, getting deeper insights into how parliament works, or often

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.120
[Amit Varma]: doesn't work. He then took his data analytics skill to be a backroom boy for the political

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.960
[Amit Varma]: consultant Prashant Kishore. He did a ton of work at the grassroots, getting Amrindar

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.840
[Amit Varma]: Singh elected in Punjab in 2017, rebranding him from Maharaj to Captain. He then realised

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: that political consultants were just glorified event managers and decided he would learn

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.840
[Amit Varma]: more by working within a political party. He helped run the BJP's campaign in Manipur

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: and Tripura, harnessing new media to do micro-targeting of voters. Then he realised that the BJP didn't

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.040
[Amit Varma]: really care about development, all that was rhetoric and he saw the extent of their divisive

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: politics. He quit the party. He even wrote a post about why he quit the party which then

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.520
[Amit Varma]: went viral. Most importantly for us, he wrote his excellent book, How to Win an Indian Election,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.980
[Amit Varma]: which is so full of deep insights about the nitty-gritties of how our parties run elections.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.960
[Amit Varma]: His new book, The Art of Conjuring Alternate Realities, is full of the nitty-gritties of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.520
[Amit Varma]: how narratives are constructed and why we believe them. I'm sure you'll find this conversation

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.440
[Amit Varma]: as fascinating as I did. But before we begin, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.880
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.920
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.760
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.440
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.080
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up-level themselves

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.520
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read. The subjects

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720
[Amit Varma]: covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.720
[Amit Varma]: me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.600
[Amit Varma]: better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.880
[Amit Varma]: CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Shivam, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.080
[Amit Varma]: Thank you. Absolutely amazing to be here.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Reading both your wonderful books, both of which I learned so much from, one of the things

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.240
[Amit Varma]: that struck me is that your career trajectory would have been impossible a decade ago, like

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.240
[Amit Varma]: a decade before you came into this, you know, Indian politics is just kind of evolved to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.280
[Amit Varma]: the state where if one may say that a well educated person like you can come back from

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.320
[Amit Varma]: the US and dive headlong into it and actually be part of a lot of what is changing. But

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.080
[Amit Varma]: before we get there, tell me a little bit about your life before politics, like you

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.560
[Amit Varma]: did a Bachelor of Science and Economics from Michigan Ann Arbor. What was your, you know,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.120
[Amit Varma]: notion of yourself like when you were growing up? What did you want to do? What did you

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120
[Guest]: want to be?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.680
[Guest]: So I was actually born and grew up in Delhi itself, went to DPS RK Param. For 11th and

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.240
[Guest]: 12th, I actually went to a very interesting school called Mahindra United World College

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.400
[Guest]: of India. And UWCs are a global chain of like schools across the world. There were 14 when

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.520
[Guest]: I was there, I believe there are 18 now. And when you go there, they almost guarantee you

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.440
[Guest]: a scholarship to 97 US universities, if you get admitted to any of them. So I found out

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.360
[Guest]: that something like this existed, always really wanted to study the US and realize that this

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: is an excellent opportunity. So did that. While I was in the US, I've always been interested

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.760
[Guest]: in politics. But while I was in the US was when the India against corruption movement

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.280
[Guest]: started, when the 2g scam happened, the Colgate scam came into the news, all of these political

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.040
[Guest]: developments that were happening and the momentum that was getting built. For the first time

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.280
[Guest]: in my life, I saw absolutely non political people give up everything and enter the political

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.440
[Guest]: frame, not in direct electoral politics, but a lot of people who are friends of mine, even

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.280
[Guest]: relatives of mine went to India gate with Indian flags sang the national anthem there

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.920
[Guest]: with the entire India against corruption movement. They were looking for a change. In this political

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.280
[Guest]: climate, I believe a major transformation was taking place in the country. What also

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.200
[Guest]: happened and you correctly pointed it out, the space for a young person to contribute

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: in politics wasn't there a decade ago. But that space opened up with the onslaught of

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.400
[Guest]: digital technologies, data analytics coming into the fray, and becoming extremely important

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.720
[Guest]: for elections. So I knew a lot of young people who were working for major consultancy firms,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.040
[Guest]: KPMG, Bain McKinsey, major banks, who actually quit their jobs and came to support BJP's

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.920
[Guest]: campaign at that point of time, just because of the political climate then. And the climate

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.200
[Guest]: was essentially that the current incumbent government of UPA needed to go because of

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.200
[Guest]: all of the scams that had happened because of the policy paralysis talk. And because

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.280
[Guest]: Narendra Modi came with a very successful Gujarat model on how business would transform

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.020
[Guest]: India how the country would transform and benefit young people in the future going forward.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.760
[Guest]: So all of these people essentially came to the BJP and talk to different leaders talk

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.400
[Guest]: to whoever they could get a hold of, and basically asked that, okay, we want to contribute to

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.060
[Guest]: the election campaign, how do we go about it? Interestingly, the place to do this did

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.640
[Guest]: not exist. A lot of politicians first took on these young educated people with themselves.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.440
[Guest]: And then they realized that it's entirely useless to keep these people in their cars

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.440
[Guest]: and take them from one rally to the next. And that is how Prashant Kishore came into

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.920
[Guest]: the scene, because he was already working with Narendra Modi in Gujarat. And he was

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.320
[Guest]: given the responsibility to create an entity which could house all of these young people,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.680
[Guest]: not entirely headed, but at least structured. And that was how CAG, Citizens for Accountable

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.720
[Guest]: Governance came to be as a nonprofit. And all of these young people, everyone got paid

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.880
[Guest]: like small amounts, but it was insignificant. People came there because they really wanted

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.280
[Guest]: to contribute. In this political climate while I was in the US, I also started working on

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.040
[Guest]: the social media initiatives of the BJP, supporting their campaign online, did a little bit of

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.520
[Guest]: work with overseas friends of BJP. All of this while it was happening, I realized that

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.440
[Guest]: okay, India really is opening up. And a lot of people around me were extremely hopeful,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.720
[Guest]: especially when the 2014 change of government happened. People believe the nation is going

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.000
[Guest]: to transform. And just being a part of it seems like a very important thing to do. So

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.680
[Guest]: I started exploring opportunities. What is it that I can do after college that gets me

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.880
[Guest]: engaged in direct politics, but more than that, to get me to understand the political

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.360
[Guest]: system of the country, understand how laws are made, understand how institutions are

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.560
[Guest]: structured. And that is when I came about and found the LAMP fellowship, which is Legislative

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.400
[Guest]: Assistant to Member of Parliament, a very interesting fellowship run by an entity called

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.200
[Guest]: PRS Legislative Research. They select 50 to 55 people every year and then place them with

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.960
[Guest]: a Member of Parliament for 11 months. So you get to work in the Indian Parliament with

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.560
[Guest]: an MP who has seen the entire political process for the last decade, two decades, and has

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440
[Guest]: actually contested elections, won elections, and is now working on framing the country's

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.880
[Guest]: laws. So that just seemed like an opportunity that really interested me. So I came back

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.200
[Guest]: from the US right after graduation. Thankfully, I'd applied to the LAMP fellowship and gotten

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.280
[Guest]: in by then. So that decision became slightly easier, came back, joined it for 11 months.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.920
[Guest]: During this process, a couple of very interesting things happened that pushed me into direct

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.880
[Guest]: electoral politics. That wasn't actually the plan. My plan, very similar to a lot of people's

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.200
[Guest]: plan in CAG, was to actually work on governance and to work on strengthening institutions.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.120
[Guest]: But what CAG and everyone who worked there realized right after 2014 elections, I realized

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.960
[Guest]: after the LAMP fellowship. The space to get engaged in policy is a lot more limited than

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.800
[Guest]: the space to get engaged in politics. And when you work in direct electoral politics,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:41.280
[Guest]: especially on things like marketing, digital media, social media campaigning, data analytics,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.200
[Guest]: constituency profiling surveys, if you create good content, if you create solid research,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.480
[Guest]: which is backed by data and facts, it is more highly regarded in the political domain than

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.160
[Guest]: it is in the policy domain. Because policy more or less still runs on gut feeling, which

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.680
[Guest]: was very surprising to me, but it's like someone in some layer of the hierarchy thought this

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.440
[Guest]: is a good idea, so they will do it. They don't really count on collecting data and information,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.440
[Guest]: but the exact same politicians who will make policy decisions on gut feeling want data

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:20.040
[Guest]: and specifics and research backed facts when it comes to elections. And during the LAMP

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.600
[Guest]: fellowship, we did a lot of data work on parliamentary data. And a lot of people don't know this,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.280
[Guest]: but the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha website are a goldmine of data. You can access every

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.120
[Guest]: debate that has taken place in the Indian Parliament. You can access every question

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.240
[Guest]: that has been asked in the Indian Parliament. And we realised there was something wrong

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.400
[Guest]: in the process of parliamentary questions that were being asked. So we basically pulled

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.400
[Guest]: out the data for the 16th Lok Sabha, about 1000-1500 questions that were asked by different

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.520
[Guest]: MPs. And then we ran some analysis on it. And we statistically proved that the question

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.360
[Guest]: selection system was not fair. Some MPs were getting way more questions selected than other

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.800
[Guest]: MPs. And it was happening because they were cartelising together and asking the same questions.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.880
[Guest]: We researched and found out how the process was working. But we did not put that in the

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.480
[Guest]: article. We just wrote on the statistics of it all. When that happened, a lot of politicians

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.200
[Guest]: tweeted it out. Dr. Sashi Tharoor was one of the first ones who picked up the article

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.520
[Guest]: and tweeted it out and it went kind of viral. And that's how I got my start in politics.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.080
[Guest]: Because people realised that, okay, there is this young person who is doing something

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.040
[Guest]: related to data in politics and policy. And that's how I got into IPAC, Indian Political

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.320
[Guest]: Action Committee. That's the company that Prashant Kishore runs. Stayed there for a

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.560
[Guest]: while. But what I realised was Prashant Kishore's strength is branding and building the image

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:49.080
[Guest]: of a leader. He does excellent events. He is a genius at branding a politician. But

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.560
[Guest]: the data work that was happening at BJP was far superior to what any other entity in the

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.640
[Guest]: country was doing. And which is something that is still true. So people in BJP got in

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.000
[Guest]: touch with me and I got in touch with them. We discussed what could be done. And at that

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.440
[Guest]: point of time, BJP did not really exist in the North East and they were just expanding.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.120
[Guest]: And they asked me to come on board, help with the North East campaigns, especially because

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.480
[Guest]: no one had expertise or domain knowledge in the North East within the BJP itself. No one

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.120
[Guest]: understood the tribes there. No one understood the culture there. No one had prior prepared

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.640
[Guest]: data on that region of the country. People didn't even have digitised electoral rolls

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.120
[Guest]: for that part. So it was entirely a fresh operation. So they were willing to get new

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.840
[Guest]: people on board who would start and build this up. So I joined BJP. Did that till mid

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:45.200
[Guest]: 2018. That is when things started changing for me personally. During 2017-18, it started

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.960
[Guest]: becoming clear that the development narrative was slipping away. If you look at the political

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.760
[Guest]: slogans, then BJP started with achche din aane wale hain. It started with bahut hui

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.560
[Guest]: mengai ki baar, ab ki baar Modi Sarkar. It started with Gujarat model, which was a very

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.960
[Guest]: development centric model. But in 2018, it became entirely clear to at least me within

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.640
[Guest]: the party and a lot of people with me, that 2019 is not going to be a campaign centred

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:17.040
[Guest]: around development. And a couple of leaders explicitly told us so too, that if you contest

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.120
[Guest]: one election on development, and you contest the next one on development, you have to justify

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.200
[Guest]: your development track record. But if you shift it to an emotional issue, then whatever

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.440
[Guest]: your development track record might be, you don't need to justify it. You've completely

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.600
[Guest]: shifted people's attention to a new agenda and a new issue. And that was the plan for

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:42.040
[Guest]: 2019. So I heard that plan and was kind of surprised and depressed at the same time.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.640
[Guest]: And I realised that I couldn't be a part of it. So I told everyone quite politely that

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.300
[Guest]: okay, I am for everything that happens on the side of development. I've loved working

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.840
[Guest]: for the party because it's doing exceptional work in the data realm. But if the campaign

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.480
[Guest]: is going to be entirely around caste and religion and India and Pakistan and Hindu and Muslim,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.240
[Guest]: then this is something that I don't feel comfortable doing. Surprisingly, a lot of people called

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.920
[Guest]: me up to ask, what happened? Why are you upset with the party? And it became such a frequent

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.480
[Guest]: occurrence that I ended up writing a blog post so that I could send people the link.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.560
[Guest]: And then that blog post got picked up by pretty much like all the online media outlets, a

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.920
[Guest]: lot of different people and went viral. And that's how Penguin got in touch because no

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.200
[Guest]: one had written anything on what political consultants actually do in the country. Who

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.000
[Guest]: are these young people who suddenly come in and are doing some data stuff? They're doing

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.680
[Guest]: targeted messaging to people. And no one really understood this field. So an editor from Penguin

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.240
[Guest]: reached out to ask me to write on it. I thought it was a very interesting opportunity. And

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: I was also jobless then because I had just resigned from the VJP. So I had the time to

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.400
[Guest]: write it. Thankfully, the first book became a huge bestseller. And like a lot of people

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.280
[Guest]: knew who I was after that. So then I started my own company that works in political data

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.880
[Guest]: analytics and haven't had a dearth of work, mostly thanks to the book. I realized a lot

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.000
[Guest]: of the people who reached out to me to work on the elections because their son had read

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.720
[Guest]: the book, their brother had read the book and recommended me. So that's what I am doing

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.480
[Guest]: right now. There's another transition that's happened. I'm actually enrolled at a master's

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.440
[Guest]: program right now called Schwarzman Scholars. And it's based out of Tsinghua University

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.760
[Guest]: in Beijing, which is the university that the Chinese premier Xi Jinping studied at, Hu

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest]: Jintao studied at. And the program is run by the Blackstone Group based in the US. It's

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.080
[Guest]: 40 percent US scholars, 20 percent Chinese and 40 percent from across the globe. And

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.600
[Guest]: the idea is to get people together. It's a fully funded master's program for people to

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:48.400
[Guest]: understand China. The reason that I decided to do this was China became a more politically

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.360
[Guest]: relevant issue in India over the last one year. And I realized that the understanding

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.360
[Guest]: of China and India is actually very limited. We have some experts on the border. We have

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.400
[Guest]: some experts on the military and the PLA. But very few people understand Chinese culture,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.760
[Guest]: the Chinese economy, the Chinese regions within themselves, the structure of the Chinese Communist

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.800
[Guest]: Party, just the way that the Chinese thought process within the population works, the Chinese

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.660
[Guest]: social media and the Internet, because it's completely different from the normal Internet.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.280
[Guest]: So doing this program right now, because it's a politically relevant subject and also like

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.640
[Guest]: a really interesting subject to study China. That's wonderful. And in fact, I've done a

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.400
[Amit Varma]: bunch of episodes on China. And now that you've mentioned this, I'll save some questions for

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.440
[Amit Varma]: China for you as well at the end of it, because your perspectives in many ways seem to be

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.760
[Amit Varma]: different from what one otherwise hears. Now, what you've done in the last 10 minutes is

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.040
[Amit Varma]: you've given us this sort of pressy of a career that's much more interesting than these 10

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.800
[Amit Varma]: minutes indicate. So it's like a long passage with lots of hyperlinks. And what I'm going

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.360
[Amit Varma]: to do for the rest of this conversation is do a lot of double clicking on some of those

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.120
[Amit Varma]: hyperlinks and go in. I was struck by, you know, while reading your excellent first book,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.040
[Amit Varma]: How to Win an Indian Election, when I take notes from a book, I have all these sort of

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.560
[Amit Varma]: different headings. And one of my headings was insights, because it was just so full

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.000
[Amit Varma]: of really interesting things, which, you know, were thought provoking for me, and I'm sure

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.920
[Amit Varma]: for my readers, and a couple of them, in fact, came up while you were speaking just now.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.760
[Amit Varma]: And one, of course, is about how people within government do policy by gut feel and politics

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.760
[Amit Varma]: by data, which, you know, I'm sure the common perception of it is just the other way around

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.120
[Amit Varma]: that politics is gut feel and you're street smart, and you kind of know what works and

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.640
[Amit Varma]: policy will be data. But you're mentioning that as the other way around, especially saying

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.440
[Amit Varma]: that policy is gut feel is kind of startling to me. And that's also a fascinating rationale

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.520
[Amit Varma]: that you, you know, you mentioned that the leader from the BJP gave you that if you fight

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.160
[Amit Varma]: one election on development, to fight the next one also on development, you have to

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.800
[Amit Varma]: show the development. So we can't do that, which is excellent. I want to double click

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.300
[Amit Varma]: right at the start and talk about the young Shivam before politics. One of the fascinating

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:59.600
[Amit Varma]: things that I found that you wrote about your years in the US is how there was a hunger

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.600
[Amit Varma]: for Hindi content, that while you were there, you were constantly looking for news in Hindi

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.480
[Amit Varma]: things to read in Hindi, so on and so forth. Now, one trope that I have examined over the

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.920
[Amit Varma]: last 250 episodes, one thing I sometimes come back to is how different Indians understand

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.560
[Amit Varma]: this country differently, because of the language that they grow up reading in, like, I unfortunately

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.680
[Amit Varma]: am an English speaking elite. So I, you know, I can read and speak in Hindi, but as a habit,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm consuming everything in English, that definitely restricts the view I have of the

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.440
[Amit Varma]: country. And this first came to me when I was chatting with a couple of earlier guests.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the contexts for that was this controversial old piece Ramchandra Guha wrote,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.120
[Amit Varma]: and he's also been on the show many times, where Ram's thesis was that there are no right

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.080
[Amit Varma]: wing intellectuals you can respect in India. And that was something I tended to believe

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.680
[Amit Varma]: at one point in time, where I assumed that, you know, that what the right calls conservatism

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.280
[Amit Varma]: or whatever cloak they put on their philosophy is just a cover for innate bigotry, and there's

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.400
[Amit Varma]: nothing more there. And I found I was wrong. And I found I was wrong while speaking to

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.760
[Amit Varma]: people like Akshay Mukul, like Rahul Verma, the scholar based in Delhi, who will also

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.240
[Amit Varma]: be on my show soon, again. And, and I realised that they were people who grew up reading

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.440
[Amit Varma]: in Hindi. So they were aware of streams of thought, which English speaking elites like

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:34.120
[Amit Varma]: me weren't. So, you know, my broad question is that, do you feel that your consumption

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.880
[Amit Varma]: of material in Hindi, gave you a sense of what politics was in India, what society was

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.900
[Amit Varma]: in India, which your English speaking peers or those peers who grew up just reading in

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:50.240
[Amit Varma]: English may not necessarily have had, you know, are there differences in perspectives

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.080
[Amit Varma]: that came from that per se?

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.720
[Guest]: Oh, definitely. So I think language and the medium that you consume content in has a major

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.240
[Guest]: impact on your thought process. This also in a lot of ways connects to the second book

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.200
[Guest]: because it is on the reality that you live in, because all of us live in separate realities

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.960
[Guest]: based on the information that we get. If you're consuming just English information, your worldview

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.600
[Guest]: is very different from someone who's consuming just Hindi information. I am also an English

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.320
[Guest]: speaking elite in the sense that while I was in India, I mostly consumed English content.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.080
[Guest]: When I was in the US, I realised that I'm losing touch with the language, because across

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.880
[Guest]: classes across your friends group, you're just speaking in English, all of the study

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.160
[Guest]: that you do is in English. So at that point, I made a concerted effort to consume Hindi

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.200
[Guest]: news, and at least read news in Hindi so that I could at least be connected to the language

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.280
[Guest]: and retain my reading and writing abilities. Because I also realised Hindi deteriorates

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.840
[Guest]: extremely fast, your reading speed in Hindi, if you don't read it for two years, three

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.040
[Guest]: years, just starts declining like exponentially. So to keep that alive, I started consuming

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.120
[Guest]: Hindi content. What I realised there, first of all, was that yes, there is an alternate

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.840
[Guest]: set of thoughts that exists. But there is also an alternate set of facts that exist.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.580
[Guest]: If you look at reporting in Hindi and English, then the facts being presented to the audience

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.880
[Guest]: is very different from each other. So you would have different worldviews. Also an interesting

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.160
[Guest]: component of it is that even between these two languages, if you start going to the other

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:27.880
[Guest]: regional languages of India, the content gets even more specific. And that is why we have

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.160
[Guest]: states created on linguistic grounds, because the thought and culture of language is a part

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.740
[Guest]: of people's identity and thought process. So people who speak the same language and

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.640
[Guest]: consume the same content feel closer together in thought than other people who speak a different

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.160
[Guest]: language. And this, I believe, would continue to exist. And it's actually also increasing

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.880
[Guest]: now, because as we have a movement towards, say, nationalism and the English intellectuals

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.040
[Guest]: don't respect India, they are anti-India. As this narrative strengthens, people who

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.640
[Guest]: consume content in Hindi get more basically solidified in their own silos. And people

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.520
[Guest]: who consume content in English get solidified in their own silos. And politicians, especially

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.960
[Guest]: in the ruling party right now, absolutely love this. As little engagement as there is

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.320
[Guest]: between the two groups, the more solidified the content and the narrative and the silo

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:28.920
[Guest]: becomes. So it just serves their purpose. And somehow language in India hasn't presented

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.720
[Guest]: to be a barrier yet. We've always believed in unity and diversity. We've always believed

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.760
[Guest]: that multiple languages, multiple cultures, multiple thought process is a good thing.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.280
[Guest]: But that seems to be transforming over the last few years. These things which India considered

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.680
[Guest]: to be a strength are now being exploited by political entities, by even other non-political

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.840
[Guest]: entities for their own purpose and their own gain. If you look at nationalism and Indic

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.760
[Guest]: pride right now, there are a lot of companies coming up who sell products based on that.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.400
[Guest]: So it's not even just the politicians. There are social media companies that have been

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.480
[Guest]: created based on a spirit of nationalism that is essentially, OK, these foreign companies

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.960
[Guest]: where English is the main language is dominated by left liberal intellectuals. So you should

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.400
[Guest]: use us. So this language barrier is now also a political barrier. And it's also becoming

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.080
[Guest]: a cultural barrier. And it's becoming a divide where people with one linguistic consumption

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.680
[Guest]: habit actually dislike and distrust people with another linguistic habit. So this interesting

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.640
[Guest]: transformation will play out over the next few years. But it is something that's getting

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.160
[Guest]: more embedded and becoming scarier over time.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.360
[Amit Varma]: And is this something that has changed and become more recent? Like I did an episode

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.240
[Amit Varma]: with Snigdha Poonam who wrote this excellent book called Dreamers about young India and

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.480
[Amit Varma]: young Indians. And one of the threads in that was that one thing she would find in small

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.360
[Amit Varma]: towns everywhere was this aspiration to learn English. So it was Hindi speakers who are

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.120
[Amit Varma]: not necessarily resenting those who know English and are part of the elite, but they want to

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.880
[Amit Varma]: join that elite and they want to learn English. And that's the whole game, you know, where

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.040
[Amit Varma]: English becomes a sort of a tool for signaling that you are on the move, that you're going

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.960
[Amit Varma]: from here to there, as it were, rather than just a sort of a medium of communication.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.960
[Amit Varma]: Is that somewhat at odds with the sort of the resentment and the feeling of otherness

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.320
[Amit Varma]: that you're talking about now? Is this sort of this negative, more darker shade something

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that's come about maybe over the last decade?

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.540
[Guest]: So English has always been a tool for social mobility, and it's been a very easy means

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: to rise up the economic ladder. And this is true for most nations around the world. If

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.400
[Guest]: you move from the native language to English, you will do economically better, and your

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.080
[Guest]: future generations will do better because they will start learning the language from

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.560
[Guest]: a young age. So it has been a part of Indian aspiration. Higher education has been a part

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.520
[Guest]: of Indian aspiration. The value of secularism and liberality and a culture that adapts to

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.840
[Guest]: other cultures has been something that India's largely been proud of through much of its

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.920
[Guest]: history. All of these things, though, are being transformed into something of a weakness.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.980
[Guest]: So when you look at the current politics, the goal is to make you feel bad about it.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.560
[Guest]: It's about why do you want to learn English? These people who want to learn English want

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.320
[Guest]: to change your culture, want to take something away from you. And a large set of people are

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:28.480
[Guest]: now holding on to a value system where they would rather go to Hindi medium schools, rather

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.560
[Guest]: send their kids to Hindi medium schools, even though it's economically worse for them, because

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:39.160
[Guest]: it is a political statement. And they have come to believe that learning English and

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.560
[Guest]: transforming towards English is somehow selling out. And it is a message that our politicians

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:49.520
[Guest]: have tried to send to a large part of society. If you look at even people who went to foreign

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.720
[Guest]: universities, people who got great educations, it was a thing that generated respect across

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:01.080
[Guest]: society. But now there is a movement to deride and belittle it in the sense of statements

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.280
[Guest]: like hard work versus Howard, coming from top politicians of the nation, in the sense

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.840
[Guest]: of people stressing how anyone who goes to a good institution, even within the country,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.200
[Guest]: if you look at something like JNU, Jawaharlal Nehru University has been one of the top educational

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.040
[Guest]: institutions in the country. If you look at Ashoka University, one of the better private

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.400
[Guest]: universities, all of these spaces of intellectuality and learning have been branded into something

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.320
[Guest]: negative, something that is against the nation, something that is anti-national, something

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.520
[Guest]: that will work against the interests of India. So there is a concerted attempt to make anything

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:43.160
[Guest]: progressive into a bad thing. And that also includes the English language.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.720
[Amit Varma]: So what we see increasingly around us these days is a lot of regressive messaging from

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.360
[Amit Varma]: politicians of all hues, actually. For example, just recently there was that, I think, that

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.360
[Amit Varma]: politician whose clip went viral on YouTube, where he's saying that, you know, what is

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.000
[Amit Varma]: wrong with modern women? Why are they working? Why are they not getting married to us? Why

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.760
[Amit Varma]: are they not having kids and all of that? Leave alone the fact that our Prime Minister

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.800
[Amit Varma]: himself hasn't got married or had kids. But one can at least understand where that sentiment

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.200
[Amit Varma]: is coming from, because our society is misogynist and sexist, and they want to keep it that

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.280
[Amit Varma]: way. And obviously every Indian male who thinks like that is terrified of the empowered woman.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.160
[Amit Varma]: So I get where that is coming from, reprehensible as it is. But, you know, this whole thing

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.480
[Amit Varma]: that I won't send my kid to an English school seems a little sort of bizarre to me. I mean,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.760
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Sujata Anandan about Maharashtra politics, where she spoke at length

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.840
[Amit Varma]: about the Thakures. And the interesting thing about Bal Thakure was that he was a true believer.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.120
[Amit Varma]: He wasn't just posturing. When he spoke out against English schools, he actually sent

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.880
[Amit Varma]: Uddhav to a Marathi medium school, for example, which could have, you know, turned Uddhav

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.160
[Amit Varma]: one way or the other. But it seems that he remained fairly sensible and didn't go down

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.120
[Amit Varma]: those extreme paths. So do you have any theories about why this is so? Because it seems to

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:01.080
[Amit Varma]: me like a clash between the individual self-interest and community pride, that your individual

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.880
[Amit Varma]: self-interest would dictate that you send your kids to an English medium school because

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.560
[Amit Varma]: they'll do better in life. And then one day, hopefully, they'll look after you better because

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.240
[Amit Varma]: they'll have more money. But instead, it's like, you know, apne hi pair pe kulhari kind

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.680
[Amit Varma]: of thing for this whole, you know, notion of community. And this keeps coming back to

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.720
[Amit Varma]: me again and again, because, like, I am someone who values individual rights above all, you

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.000
[Amit Varma]: know, to me, if you think in terms of groups, that's toxic, that's dangerous, that completely

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.480
[Amit Varma]: goes against individual freedom as well. But there are many people who, you know, obviously

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.280
[Amit Varma]: take the contrary view, not just in an abstract sense when it comes to other people, but even

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.840
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to themselves. So I can't understand this. But what are your thoughts?

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.320
[Guest]: So let me start out by saying that most people, the vast majority still work based on self-interest.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.120
[Guest]: If they have the opportunity and the funds, they will still send their kids to the best

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.080
[Guest]: school that they can. It will most likely be an English medium school, likely CBSE or

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.080
[Guest]: ICSE and not the state boards. Those hierarchies still remain very much so. And that encompasses

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.360
[Guest]: the vast majority of the nation. But what is happening is that a vocal fringe is coming

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:16.160
[Guest]: about. And if you look at it in terms of other nations or other ethnic groups, then we've

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.360
[Guest]: seen this within Islam, say, for a very long time, where there is a push to send the young

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.360
[Guest]: kids to madarsas instead of sending them to private schools. If you look at a nation like

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.200
[Guest]: Afghanistan that has just fallen to the Taliban now, they would much rather have the entire

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.840
[Guest]: population study religious scriptures than study science and mathematics and humanities

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.320
[Guest]: and arts. So this is a thing that exists in most tribalistic societies, in most tribalistic

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.800
[Guest]: cultures, where the fringe, when it comes to power, does not want people going to institutions

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.640
[Guest]: of learning, which will expand your thought process. It wants you and your kids to be

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.160
[Guest]: in a place which restricts your thought process, which takes you back to something thousands

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:04.120
[Guest]: of years ago. And you start seeing something that is old and ancient as a great and glorious

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.920
[Guest]: time period and the current as something that is bad that has come about because of the

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:14.040
[Guest]: other side who is trying to liberalise, who is trying to bring in Western values, trying

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.600
[Guest]: to bring in external things into your life. You start hankering for a past that you haven't

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:25.880
[Guest]: lived in because it existed thousands of years ago. This group has started emerging within

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:32.440
[Guest]: Hindu India. It did not for a very long time and the aspirations of all of India were basically

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.800
[Guest]: concentrated around economic development and prosperity and growth. But this recentering

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.640
[Guest]: that has happened, there are a couple of reasons for it. The politics of Indic nationalism

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:50.880
[Guest]: and Hindu pride and Hindutva is definitely one reason. The other reason is that economic

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.200
[Guest]: possibilities and just people's capabilities to transcend the economic ladder and go up

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.520
[Guest]: has declined. And in India, if you look at the growth trajectory of the country, we used

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.680
[Guest]: to have something called the Hindu rate of growth, an extremely slow two to three percent

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:14.400
[Guest]: growth rate. After liberalisation in 1991, we started growing extremely fast by 1995-1996.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.560
[Guest]: That growth rate survived till about 2012. And after 2012, we basically started stagnating

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.480
[Guest]: back to the three to four percent rate of growth. This interesting thing that has happened

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.320
[Guest]: has happened for a couple of reasons. One, technology is transforming. So India's huge

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.240
[Guest]: advantage because of which we became a powerhouse for BPO and call centres and business outsourcing

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.760
[Guest]: from the West is we spoke better English. What's happening now is South Asia, Southeast

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:50.720
[Guest]: Asia, the other nations, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, all of them are learning

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.800
[Guest]: English. Even China, for that matter, who focused on manufacturing largely is entering

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.160
[Guest]: the service domain because people there are learning English. So this competitive advantage

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest]: is slowly declining in the country. This basically removes a huge chunk of economic mobility

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.280
[Guest]: because this is what people were entering from 1996 to 2012. When this happens, the

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.600
[Guest]: value of, say, going to an English medium school also starts declining for some people.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.840
[Guest]: They don't see the same amount of reciprocal returns coming in. So it becomes slightly

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.880
[Guest]: easier to go into the Hindutva camp and be like, oh, we want our old traditional culture.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.280
[Guest]: We want our pride. Because when you don't have economic growth, the only thing that

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.200
[Guest]: you have to hold on to is pride. This is a very interesting thing that I saw during my

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:50.240
[Guest]: time at BJP and after a lot of karakartas that you see in politics in general, most

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.480
[Guest]: people think, why is he doing gunda gardi? Why is he wearing an orange muffler? Most

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.520
[Guest]: people think that that guy believes in Hindutva. That guy believes in protecting the cow and

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:06.600
[Guest]: cow raksha and lynching people who are transporting cattle. This largely is not the case. The

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.480
[Guest]: interesting component that I started noticing really early on is most people are in it for

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.960
[Guest]: pride. If you look at a political karakarta, who is a political karakarta who's planting

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.240
[Guest]: your flags on the ground, who is calling people and filling them up in tempos and rickshaws

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.920
[Guest]: and taking them to political rallies? Who are these people? These people are some of

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.720
[Guest]: the lowest people in society historically, who have not been to good educational institutions,

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.120
[Guest]: who've not had good opportunities in life, who've not worked at high salaries. The people

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.920
[Guest]: who have run like some businesses here and there, done some tiny consultancy work here

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:45.080
[Guest]: and there, part time jobs, but they've spent most of their life at the local paan ka dukaan

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.320
[Guest]: discussing politics. Waha pe bidi peena, cigarette peena and the conversation is largely centered

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.800
[Guest]: around politics. They have not ever had respect in society. Within their families, within

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.600
[Guest]: their areas, within their entire society and their entire caste networks, they've been

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.120
[Guest]: seen as someone who doesn't do anything. Ki lokal netagiri karta hai, chota mutha gundagardhi

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.400
[Guest]: karta hai, ki this person is not someone that you should associate with, has been the image.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.960
[Guest]: BJP has transformed this. Now that same person at the same paan ka dukaan, if he wears an

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.920
[Guest]: orange gamcha and he starts talking about Hindutva, he becomes someone who is slightly

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.160
[Guest]: more respected in society. If he talks about gauraksha, if he talks about ancient Indian

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:35.640
[Guest]: culture and wisdom, his respect in society grows. And because the economic aspect of

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.240
[Guest]: gaining respect is not there anymore, it is a much more difficult path. Earlier you could

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.040
[Guest]: get a good job and gain respect in society, that good job is not there anymore. So the

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.840
[Guest]: way to gain respect is becoming, you enter the fringe, you start saying more fringe things,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.440
[Guest]: you start defending Hindutva, you start becoming a spokesperson on your WhatsApp groups and

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.320
[Guest]: that becomes something that gives you some amount of authority and respect in society.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.120
[Guest]: And this is how most political karakartas stay engaged with the process and support

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:12.120
[Guest]: something that they did not say even under BJP during the Vajpayee years. When LK Advani

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:19.400
[Guest]: was leading the BJP after Atal Bihari Vajpayee retired, the same amount of fringe thought

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:26.200
[Guest]: was not there because you did not gain pride by it. Now the fringe thought keeps escalating,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.560
[Guest]: keeps increasing and it's been especially true since 2017-18. If you look at the political

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.640
[Guest]: climate, a lot of leaders were not willing to give hate speech. The hate speeches were

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: largely WhatsApp forwards, they weren't on national television, they weren't in the television

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.120
[Guest]: studios, but they came into the television studios, they came into mainstream political

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.640
[Guest]: discourse and in the rallies and speeches of politicians after 2019-2020. And this process,

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.240
[Guest]: I believe, will keep accelerating because it's become more acceptable. And honestly,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.680
[Guest]: it's become something that gives you respect and pride in society.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.320
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. And for those of my listeners who would like to sort of learn more about

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.120
[Amit Varma]: the economic trajectory you described, which is absolutely correct. I did an episode with

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Pooja Mehra on her excellent book, The Lost Decade about, you know, about how essentially

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.640
[Amit Varma]: the last 10 years, the economy has really gone down and it's not to be blamed on any

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.240
[Amit Varma]: one party. It's just a confluence of circumstances which she goes into. And I also did a recent

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.560
[Amit Varma]: episode on liberalisation, which was really popular with Ajay Shah and Shruti Rajagopalan,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.480
[Amit Varma]: by which I don't mean to say it was popular with Ajay Shah and Shruti Rajagopalan, they

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.040
[Amit Varma]: were the guests. It was popular with everyone else. And I love the irony there that, you

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.520
[Amit Varma]: know, the BJP moving away from a narrative of development to Hindutva, when actually

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.600
[Amit Varma]: it's it is a very lack of development, which is pushing people more and more towards Hindutva.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned the term Indic, that reminded me of a tweet that my good friend Hamsini

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Hariharan, who hosts the podcast States of Anarchy recently put out, where she said,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.240
[Amit Varma]: quote, I'm meeting a new set of people who use Indic to substantiate every bigoted belief

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:02.880
[Amit Varma]: they have, stop quote. Now, one thesis, of course, is that look, there's no development,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.480
[Amit Varma]: but so there's no getting ahead per se, but there needs to be pride. So what do you do?

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.360
[Amit Varma]: You find pride in the civilizational identity and blah, blah, blah. Another, an additional

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.280
[Amit Varma]: narrative, I won't say a counter narrative, because these things are multifactorial. But

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.560
[Amit Varma]: an additional hypothesis that I have written about, and I'll present to you now and tell

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.520
[Amit Varma]: me what you think about it, is, comes from this phrase used by the sociologist Timur

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Kuran in his 1999 book, Public Lies, Private Truths, which is preference falsification

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.400
[Amit Varma]: and preference cascades. These are the two terms he came up with. And his thesis was

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.160
[Amit Varma]: that, look, in a time where information doesn't spread too well, if people have beliefs that

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.000
[Amit Varma]: they think don't conform to widespread popular beliefs, they'll keep it to themselves. The

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.520
[Amit Varma]: example he gave was look in the Soviet Union, you know, nobody knew that everybody hated

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.240
[Amit Varma]: the state, because nobody expressed it. So everybody thought they are alone, and they

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.280
[Amit Varma]: didn't want to take a chance. But once that started getting out, once it reached a tipping

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.080
[Amit Varma]: point, you had what is a preference cascade. And suddenly, it seemed like the Soviet Union

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.000
[Amit Varma]: fell overnight, and everybody had hated it all along. Similarly, my sense is that what

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.880
[Amit Varma]: happened in India, and something that contributed to the burgeoning of Hindutva and the kind

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.280
[Amit Varma]: of polarizing discourse that we have around us, is really social media, that social media

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.520
[Amit Varma]: created preference cascades. Because let's say, you know, you hate Muslims, and you think

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.080
[Amit Varma]: women are women's places in the kitchen, but you keep it to yourself, because these are

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.600
[Amit Varma]: not things that you feel it is safe to express, because other people might disapprove. And

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.520
[Amit Varma]: then social media happens, and you realize that many, many, many people feel the way

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.920
[Amit Varma]: that you do. So you can enter different kinds of silos with them, as you've described so

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.440
[Amit Varma]: well in your book. And you are now you know, emboldened to express yourself. And every

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.080
[Amit Varma]: time you express yourself, your belief is strengthened, and you go more and more to

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.960
[Amit Varma]: the extreme. In fact, when you are in a silo with other people like yourself, the only

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.120
[Amit Varma]: way to stand out is to become more extreme than they are to, you know, enforce different

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.640
[Amit Varma]: kinds of purity tests on them. And of course, these silos and purity tests, you also find

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.480
[Amit Varma]: on the left as well as the right. But right now, we are talking about Hindutva. So what

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.200
[Amit Varma]: is your sense of this? Like, much as in a sense, you're making a living depends a little

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.560
[Amit Varma]: bit on social media and all the data gathering that this great technology enables. But at

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.280
[Amit Varma]: the same time, while I'm sure both of us would agree that technology is obviously a huge

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.980
[Amit Varma]: net positive, you have probably seen the negative aspects of it much more closely than many

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.320
[Amit Varma]: people have. So what are your thoughts?

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.880
[Guest]: Oh, so this is definitely a major factor. Social media allows groups to basically you

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: get to consolidate people on any fringe thought, because you will find a group of people which

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.880
[Guest]: will be a very small group who believes anything, no matter how fringe it is. So conspiracy

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.560
[Guest]: theory groups that came about in the US even after the elections, like people who believe

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.140
[Guest]: that the election was stolen by the current President Joe Biden, or people who believe

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.960
[Guest]: in the QAnon conspiracy theories, or even in India, people who believe that Shashank

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.880
[Guest]: Singh Rajput's death has a major nefarious plot around it. So these groups are something

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.600
[Guest]: that are created because of social media, because without it, it would be very difficult

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.880
[Guest]: for these people to come together. When we wrote the second book, we actually studied

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.600
[Guest]: Russia very deeply because we are studying information warfare and figuring out how is

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:30.960
[Guest]: it that people gain power by creating an information environment around you. What we realized that

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:36.900
[Guest]: in an autocratic regime, the ruler never wants anyone to find out how unpopular they are.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.560
[Guest]: Because once they do find out that there are a large number of people who find them unpopular,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.520
[Guest]: these people start consolidating into groups. But if they think that they do not like the

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.120
[Guest]: ruler personally, but everyone else around them is a loyal follower of that person, they'll

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.560
[Guest]: keep their thoughts to themselves. And no one will ever know how popular or unpopular

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.280
[Guest]: the ruler is. So this is an important aspect. This definitely applies to thoughts that would

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.800
[Guest]: be considered bigoted, thoughts that would be considered illiberal, thoughts that would

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.880
[Guest]: be considered bad by society at large. You do find enough people on social media who

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.720
[Guest]: start supporting your view, and you keep getting deeper into the silo. It's also definitely

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.800
[Guest]: true that once you are in the group, to rise within the group hierarchy, the main thing

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.880
[Guest]: that you can do is to become more and more fringe and more and more extreme. So these

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:35.040
[Guest]: things definitely do happen. Social media itself is a very complicated subject. When

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.400
[Guest]: it did start out, and even right now, it allows you to form groups around anything. So a lot

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.440
[Guest]: of groups that have formed are around good things. People on Twitter are learning every

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.920
[Guest]: day. People who are watching YouTube videos are learning something new every day. But

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.920
[Guest]: it also allows very bad thoughts to get exponential distribution. The algorithms are structured

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:00.240
[Guest]: in such a way that once you start viewing one kind of videos, start liking and supporting

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.560
[Guest]: one kind of tweets, your entire feed will get filled with that because the platform's

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.400
[Guest]: major goal is to keep you on the platform as long as possible. So it will show you any

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.400
[Guest]: content that plays to your biases, which will just keep you clicking and engaging. So this

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.560
[Guest]: does mean if you believe in something fringe, if you believe in something absolutely false,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.400
[Guest]: your life will get saturated by the false content. And on every social media platform,

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.520
[Guest]: you will start seeing things and information and messages that basically solidify your

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:36.880
[Guest]: notion. So social media is doing that. What is tricky right now is that because of this

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.520
[Guest]: entire problem of misinformation and silos, governments around the world are working to

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:49.200
[Guest]: take power back from social media giants. And so the second book's theme is also this,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.240
[Guest]: that power in the ancient world was largely based on how much military might you have.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.080
[Guest]: Then it transformed to how much economic might you had. And that was the history of colonialism

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.040
[Guest]: where powers, which were economically stronger, took over much larger countries. Now power

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.600
[Guest]: within domestic politics and in the international arena is dependent upon who has the means to

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.680
[Guest]: create an information environment around people and shape their beliefs, shape their reality

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.880
[Guest]: in essence. So this power has now gone to Facebook and WhatsApp and Twitter and these

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:25.320
[Guest]: private companies. National governments absolutely dislike it. So almost every country that is

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.960
[Guest]: basically big enough and democratic or even authoritarian governments, they're all trying

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:34.280
[Guest]: to take this power back from social media giants and give it to the governmental entity

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.160
[Guest]: to shape people's reality. India is doing it in its own way by asking social media giants

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.920
[Guest]: to appoint an officer who can be arrested if posts are not taken down so that government

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.880
[Guest]: can take down any post that it does not like. Right now, that power rests with Twitter.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.640
[Guest]: Which one is better is a very tricky debate. What I believe is that none of them are better

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.920
[Guest]: because social media giants will want you thrown into silos that keep you engaged forever,

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.000
[Guest]: no matter how bad the thought. Governments will try to censor any information that's

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.360
[Guest]: against their reality and whatever version of truth they're telling. So both of these

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.960
[Guest]: are horrible entities to regulate it. But this is the fight we have. The only one who's

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.120
[Guest]: doing something very different is actually China. They can do something very different

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.920
[Guest]: because for one, they don't have the traditional internet. They have their own internet and

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.760
[Guest]: they control all of the social media platforms on that. But their method is not to specify

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.680
[Guest]: what content can come about and can't. They are now working on this algorithm level itself.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.520
[Guest]: They're trying to specify what content can go viral and what can't go viral. So they're

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:42.840
[Guest]: not censoring. But the algorithms will be designed in such a manner that content that

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.080
[Guest]: the state disapproves of will stay there, but it can't have widespread distribution.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.320
[Guest]: It can't reach millions of people. So it's just a very interesting middle ground of handling

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320
[Guest]: it.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.760
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if one can call it a middle ground. I'd say it's pretty much the state controlling

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.160
[Amit Varma]: it anyway, but in a subtle way in which it isn't obvious. And you're right that this

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.920
[Amit Varma]: is something that kind of conflicts me. Like number one, of course, for any of these platforms,

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.080
[Amit Varma]: it is natural. And prima facie, one would say, if you know, in 2010, if you say, what's

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.800
[Amit Varma]: a perfect algorithm, I would say an algorithm that knows what I want to read and what I

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.160
[Amit Varma]: want to watch and what I'm likely to like, right? But then you see all these effects

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.800
[Amit Varma]: of these echo chambers and these silos coming up and the extreme polarization that happens

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.080
[Amit Varma]: and you wonder, is that a good thing? I think but completely the wrong approach to it is

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.080
[Amit Varma]: a state sort of, you know, using its iron hand to clamp it down because state power

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.960
[Amit Varma]: is something that I'm always suspicious of, you know, you know, whenever we compare something

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.640
[Amit Varma]: that's wrong with the market, and we recommend a state action, we look at the faults of the

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.580
[Amit Varma]: market, but we assume the state action will be perfect, while it is absolutely the other

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:52.000
[Amit Varma]: way around. State failure is ubiquitous, while market failure is rare. So in this case, while

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.320
[Amit Varma]: I accept that there's a problem with, you know, social media and these algorithms and

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.440
[Amit Varma]: what is happening to our society, because of them, which go far beyond politics, even

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.440
[Amit Varma]: which affect mental health, and there are various dimensions to it. I think it's a social

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.680
[Amit Varma]: problem which should be solved by society. If the state steps in, then we could be in

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.680
[Amit Varma]: a spot of bother. Now, I want to sort of digress here and raise a question about a phenomenon

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.920
[Amit Varma]: that you've described in your books. But I want to kind of explore the why of it, because

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't understand the why of it, which is that, you know, one, of course, we all know

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.160
[Amit Varma]: why narratives are so appealing, the world is incredibly complex, we explain it to ourselves

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.600
[Amit Varma]: using simple narratives, that's important and necessary. And our brain is wired to do

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.040
[Amit Varma]: that. That's cool. I get that that explains the attraction towards narratives. But a lot

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.760
[Amit Varma]: of the narratives that have gained traction over the last few years, are these crazy narratives

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.920
[Amit Varma]: like the QAnon narratives you mentioned, then the Sushant Singh Rajput narratives, like

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.800
[Amit Varma]: people are only familiar with a couple of the common narratives, I have gone into SSR

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:59.000
[Amit Varma]: rabbit holes, and come across some really extreme stuff, you know, like he is a creator

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.280
[Amit Varma]: of Covaxin, and that's why they killed him. And there's another popular theory where there

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.080
[Amit Varma]: is something in quantum mechanics by which an atom can be split into two. So the theory

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.640
[Amit Varma]: is that Sushant Singh Rajput once posted about this, said he wanted to learn it. So the theory,

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.800
[Amit Varma]: this particular conspiracy theory is that he split himself into two. And the SSR who

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.300
[Amit Varma]: got killed is a duplicate. And the original SSR was a guy who created Covaxin. And he

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:28.640
[Amit Varma]: is now in hiding, because Yogi Adityanath is looking for him. And this is something

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.440
[Amit Varma]: of that sort. I'll post a link in the show notes. It's completely bizarre. Again, disturbingly,

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, in your first book, you also spoke about the child kidnapping rumours that spread

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.920
[Amit Varma]: through WhatsApp. And I had an episode with Pratik Sinha of Alt News, where we spoke about

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:46.720
[Amit Varma]: this as well. And the nuance that he revealed was that it wasn't just one child kidnapping

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.200
[Amit Varma]: message that went out on WhatsApp groups, and then everybody forwarded it. It was constantly

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.760
[Amit Varma]: being edited with the name of the, you know, the local place, the district, the village

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.280
[Amit Varma]: being changed, you know, as it kind of kept on moving. And that's completely bizarre,

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.660
[Amit Varma]: because as you've said in your book, and as is perfectly obvious, this is not something

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.400
[Amit Varma]: any political party will do because they have nothing to benefit from this. And they won't

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.160
[Amit Varma]: even think of this. This is just bizarre. These are private individuals. But the point

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.680
[Amit Varma]: is these messages work, because people are keen to believe this narrative that kids are

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.440
[Amit Varma]: getting kidnapped and their kidneys are being taken away. People are keen to believe that

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Sushant Singh Rajput is still alive and his duplicate died and he invented Covaxin and

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.900
[Amit Varma]: shit like that. So what I'm interested in is the why I understand the human attraction

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:35.680
[Amit Varma]: to narratives. But why these kinds of crazy narratives, like are we just bored with the

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.040
[Guest]: world?

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.680
[Guest]: So this is actually a very interesting idea. Human desire to understand things is definitely

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:51.960
[Guest]: part of why people buy into stories and narratives. But why crazy thought processes work is in

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:58.200
[Guest]: general linked to people's desires to be part of groups. What happens is that in the modern

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.200
[Guest]: world, people aren't really part of too many communities in real life. Everyone has their

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.060
[Guest]: own life. Everyone's chasing whatever they're chasing in their own entire lives. What this

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: does is that it increases your desire to have human relationships. If it's not working out

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.200
[Guest]: in the real world, you seek it in the virtual domain. And in the virtual domain, the kind

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.960
[Guest]: of group that you fall into isn't really something that you choose. What happens is this is actually

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.840
[Guest]: very close to the formation of cults. And we've explored some religious cults getting

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.720
[Guest]: formed. And what we realized was most cults, like the message itself and what the cult

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.720
[Guest]: leader is saying doesn't matter. What matters is how distant you can be made from people

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.200
[Guest]: in the real world and how you can be made to feel like a part of a community within

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.440
[Guest]: the cult. As long as that is there, you will support any belief system no matter how absurd

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.960
[Guest]: it keeps becoming, because then you feel like you belong to a community. You belong to a

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.960
[Guest]: certain group of people. Those people will stand with you. And anyone who does not support

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.960
[Guest]: it is someone who is against you and against the group and is trying to harm you. This

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:12.040
[Guest]: entire sentiment is what major conspiracy theories and cults are centered around.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:18.320
[Guest]: This group thing getting built is very, it's a very weird phenomenon because what we realized

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.160
[Guest]: in the data itself, we analyzed data about cyber scammers and how cyber scammers got

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.480
[Guest]: people to give them OTPs because we were trying to explore what kind of a person falls for

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.880
[Guest]: a scam like this. We found absolutely no correlation. It was not linked to your education level.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:38.320
[Guest]: It was not linked to your language ability. It was not linked to your socioeconomic status.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.920
[Guest]: So someone very poor who's not been to school is exactly as likely to fall for a scam statistically

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.840
[Guest]: as someone who is very educated and very rich. This told us something very interesting that

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:56.240
[Guest]: this is something within the human mind and within the human being that leads you to fall

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.840
[Guest]: for these stories, these narratives, and the story and narrative will be different for

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.880
[Guest]: each individual. Not the same thing is going to work for every person. Like if you bring

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.960
[Guest]: a concept from the US, like if you look at the US, there are people who are so committed

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:16.960
[Guest]: to the right to life that they want to outlaw abortion. That particular messaging does not

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.520
[Guest]: exist in India. It will probably be a very hard sell to try and build it up and it would

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.520
[Guest]: take a couple of years. But if you have something like the caste system that is so prevalent

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.720
[Guest]: in India and there is one caste group who thinks another caste group is against us,

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.240
[Guest]: you can't take that out of India and try to implant that messaging within a different

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.200
[Guest]: society. So different messaging works. Who falls for Sushant Singh Rajput versus QAnon

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.840
[Guest]: versus who falls for child kidnapping rumours is a very interesting area of study that we

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.600
[Guest]: are still studying and still working on, especially related to geopolitics. So we are doing it

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:58.560
[Guest]: at a nation state level, not at an individual level per se, but very interesting area and

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.840
[Guest]: I don't think anyone knows the answer. Beyond people's desire to be a part of a community

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.280
[Guest]: is much stronger than people's desire to look at what's real and what's not real.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.000
[Amit Varma]: I totally buy that. The desire to be part of a community is both ever-present and poignant

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.760
[Amit Varma]: in a sense. It kind of tells you about how even in these modern times with 7 billion

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.000
[Amit Varma]: people and all of that, one can, you know, everybody's essentially in a minority of one

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.080
[Amit Varma]: and looking for ways to kind of get past that. But as you pointed out, in some of those cases

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.360
[Amit Varma]: that doesn't apply like the OTP scams or the KYC scams or whatever, where they're believing

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.560
[Amit Varma]: a narrative, but obviously there's no community involved. You know, the kind of scam I expected

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.240
[Amit Varma]: you would write about, but you chose these local Indian scams, but the Nigerian prince

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of scam, right? A Nigerian prince wants to give you his money and blah, blah, blah,

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:50.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, which is again, a crazy story that you believe and there's no community

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.480
[Amit Varma]: at the end of it. So clearly we are wired to believe this kind of shit or maybe we are

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.640
[Amit Varma]: just bored. So, you know, it's like, who knows, maybe we are addicted to narratives and you

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.040
[Guest]: want every hit to be greater than the last. So there actually is a community angle there

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:08.400
[Guest]: because most of these scammers are trying to recruit people to be their friends. Like

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.760
[Guest]: there are two ways to do it. One is to scare people into it, tell them that accounts are

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.360
[Guest]: going to get blocked, something very bad is going to happen. And they are their friend

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.080
[Guest]: trying to save them from such a bleak and dark place through which it will be very difficult

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.880
[Guest]: for them to navigate. The other one is them telling that how you would be rewarded if

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.460
[Guest]: you tell them the OTP because you won the special prize, you won the special thing.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:34.240
[Guest]: If you look at the Nigerian print scams, those scams take months. It's not one email and

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.560
[Guest]: send someone sending you money. It's literally someone cultivating a relationship with you

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.160
[Guest]: over the course of three to six months. Or even we've actually seen instances where people

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:48.000
[Guest]: have done this for two years and then got someone to give them money. So it's a long

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.840
[Guest]: term investment in forming a relationship. The other part that I wanted to mention is

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:57.920
[Guest]: with any conspiracy theory, it never starts at the fringe. With something like Sushant

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.560
[Guest]: Singh Rajput, it never starts at Sushant Singh Rajput splitting into two or him inventing

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.040
[Guest]: a COVID vaccine. It always starts with very reasonable things. It always starts with something

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.400
[Guest]: which people are likely to believe because there is also tangential evidence linking

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:17.240
[Guest]: to it. That evidence is taken out of context, that evidence is placed in a completely different

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:23.360
[Guest]: perspective. But it exists. And that's how reasonable people come into it. After that

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.640
[Guest]: is when it starts spiraling into something completely insane.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a really great point. Because I think the first conspiracy theory was, oh,

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:37.160
[Amit Varma]: look, his, you know, his agent Disha Salian died a week or a couple of weeks before that.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.240
[Amit Varma]: And there's a crooked politician involved. And all of us know politicians are crooked.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.880
[Amit Varma]: So all those are plausible bits of information which are verifiable, because it is a fact

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.440
[Amit Varma]: that she did die a couple of weeks before that. But then you build them together and

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:55.660
[Amit Varma]: make this kind of crazy story out of it. Having digressed so much, let's go back to your personal

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.560
[Amit Varma]: history. And let me now kind of, so I've hit the back button on the browser, and now I'm

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.640
[Amit Varma]: double clicking on another of the links. So an interesting thing that you kind of mentioned

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.120
[Amit Varma]: again, while talking about the Bachelor of Economics that you did there, is that just

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.840
[Amit Varma]: because everyone else was kind of doing it, you said, let me also do computer science.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.820
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, there was this recent video which went viral on Twitter, which you must

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.520
[Amit Varma]: have seen, where people were mocking this kid. This is poor kid who got into one of

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:26.160
[Amit Varma]: these IITs. And he had studied very hard for it. He didn't go to parties, just, you know,

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.120
[Amit Varma]: that kind of work ethic. And he said, I want to do computer science. And the person asked

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:33.040
[Amit Varma]: him why. And he said, because everyone else is doing it. And the snobs on Twitter were

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.760
[Amit Varma]: mocking him for it. Because why is he, you know, doing it if he doesn't want to do it?

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.520
[Amit Varma]: I thought his reason was perfectly good. And it turns out that he actually did finish his

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.960
[Amit Varma]: course and he's now got a plus job in Korea and all of that. And he's really good at computer

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.400
[Amit Varma]: science as well. So more power to him. And so while reading your book, it struck me that

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.320
[Amit Varma]: hey, Shivam also in that category. But that turned out to be really fortuitous for you,

00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:00.320
[Amit Varma]: because that was practically the base of whatever you went on to do. So tell me about your sort

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:06.320
[Amit Varma]: of entry into data analytics and computer science. And did it in some fundamental way,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.200
[Amit Varma]: change the way that you looked at the world around you? Like I didn't study data analytics,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.120
[Amit Varma]: but I was a professional poker player for a few years. And you know, got deep into math

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.420
[Amit Varma]: and probabilities and game theory and all of that. And I just found that probabilistic

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:25.120
[Amit Varma]: theory just completely changed the way I look at every single thing around me. So was this

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.800
[Amit Varma]: something, you know, analytics, data science played that kind of role for you as well?

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:35.920
[Guest]: Oh, definitely. So I yes, I did the computer science courses because a lot of my Indian

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.000
[Guest]: friends were doing computer science. So just because I wanted to be in the group while

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.200
[Guest]: they talked computer science stuff. And I wanted to understand like what they were talking

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.120
[Guest]: about. I did a lot of computer science courses, definitely one of the most valuable courses

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:56.720
[Guest]: I've done, at least in my worldview at this point of time. At least understanding how

00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:02.040
[Guest]: code works helps you in pretty much every domain. Because even if you don't code yourself,

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.720
[Guest]: at some point of time, you will need to explain to another coder, because everything is moving

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.620
[Guest]: online in one way or the other. Every space that we see around us, there is some amount

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:16.480
[Guest]: of automation coming in, there is some amount of technology coming in to transform those

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:23.740
[Guest]: spaces. So that way, I think it's extremely valuable. It does transform your way of thinking

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:31.760
[Guest]: in econometrics and statistics. It does tell you how biased your thinking is. In a way,

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.900
[Guest]: what happens is on one side, while studying econometrics, you're being told how human

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:42.000
[Guest]: biases play in. Because a lot of the questions that we answered in class, the guess that

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.520
[Guest]: you would have, the gut instinct that you would have is far off from what the statistics

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.760
[Guest]: tells you. And then on the other hand, while learning computer science, you realize that

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:57.760
[Guest]: the computer is a very efficient thing, but it's also a very dumb thing. People think

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:03.400
[Guest]: computers are smart, but code needs to be written in a way where every step is extremely

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:08.040
[Guest]: clear. There is no space for ambiguity. It's not like a human being that you tell them,

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.600
[Guest]: okay, go to the market, and then get me this. You have to specify every step, you have to

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.200
[Guest]: specify every action that the computer needs to take for it to work. It's changing now

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.840
[Guest]: with machine learning and AI coming in where computers can also teach some things to themselves.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:28.360
[Guest]: But traditional computer science, it does tell you that the thought process must be

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:34.920
[Guest]: so systematic, where you need to specify every step of the way. Once I started doing this

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:41.040
[Guest]: in life, and after the entire political journey, after writing two books, I realized something

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:47.040
[Guest]: special about the stories that people tell themselves. What happens is that you try 10

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.400
[Guest]: different things. Political parties try 10 different things. And three of those work

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.280
[Guest]: wonderfully well. And then someone comes to the TV studios. I have also been to the TV

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.240
[Guest]: studios and done this. Then you tell a story that, oh, this happened. And then we saw this

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.640
[Guest]: data and then we saw this. That's why we built this campaign. And then we did this campaign

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.440
[Guest]: next. And then we did this. And this is how we got the votes. And it's an excellent story.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.200
[Guest]: Everyone's like, oh my God, that is so smart. That is genius. Except in life, everyone is

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.200
[Guest]: trying 10 separate things at the same time. Two or three of them work, seven or eight

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.440
[Guest]: of them don't. You disregard the seven or eight entirely and you form a story around

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.280
[Guest]: those two or three. And that's how my life has been too. Now I'm clear what I'm doing.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.440
[Guest]: So I have a story around how I was always interested in politics. Might not have been

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.760
[Guest]: the case if I was not so successful within my journey in politics and like political

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:44.080
[Guest]: consultancy in general, might have been an entirely different story. So computer science

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.760
[Guest]: does get you to think this way in steps and stages.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.120
[Amit Varma]: That's wonderful. So what we'll do now is that we have pretty much done with your pre-political

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.400
[Amit Varma]: years. We might come back to it later. So let's take a quick commercial break. And when

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.120
[Amit Varma]: we come back, we'll take you to Varanasi.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.760
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.400
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me and I feel I

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.040
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.520
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.680
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:40.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.320
[Amit Varma]: where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:52.400
[Amit Varma]: the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to IndiaUncut.substack.com

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.720
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Seen and The Unseen. I'm chatting with Shivam Shankar Singh about the

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.400
[Amit Varma]: two wonderful books he's written, How to Win an Indian Election and The Art of Conjuring

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.420
[Amit Varma]: Alternate Realities. And of course, they're related. But you know, before we even sort

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: of get to those books, and before your Lamb Fellowship even, you've described in your

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:36.060
[Amit Varma]: first book about how you landed up in Varanasi in 2013, because you were kind of disgusted

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: at what was happening to governance in India, you realized it was time for a change, you

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.280
[Amit Varma]: bought into some of Modi's campaign rhetoric about, you know, development and so on. And

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.240
[Amit Varma]: you came out here and you went and volunteered in Varanasi. Tell me a little bit about that

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:57.400
[Amit Varma]: experience. Because like number one, did you ever think that you also want to be in politics

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.680
[Amit Varma]: per se? And were you exploring that when you went along? What was your immediate motivation

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.920
[Amit Varma]: per se? Or did you just find it an interesting field at an intellectual level? And you were

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.000
[Amit Varma]: like, hey, I want to understand this? Or was it this vague notion that, you know, I want

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.360
[Amit Varma]: to help take my country forward and let me dive into this and see if there is something

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.480
[Amit Varma]: here. And of course, in hindsight, like you mentioned before the break, this clarity,

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.320
[Amit Varma]: you can you can construct an exact story and how you got here from there, as it were the

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.680
[Amit Varma]: code of our lives is often written in hindsight after it's after the program has already played

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:34.960
[Amit Varma]: out as it were. But at that time, you know, what were your motivations? What were you

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.360
[Amit Varma]: looking for? What were you thinking? Take me through some of that.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:44.960
[Guest]: So this was 2014, right before the general elections. Primary motivation was that I had

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.440
[Guest]: never actually seen an election in real life. And I was interested in politics. I already

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.680
[Guest]: knew at that time that I would be joining the Lamb Fellowship and working in the Indian

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:01.200
[Guest]: Parliament. I really wanted to see an election. And what I realized was that you can actually

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.920
[Guest]: just go and see an election. India is an amazing country. That way you reach out to a politician.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.800
[Guest]: Most of them are extremely welcoming. You tell them I want to see your election campaign.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.160
[Guest]: They will invite you to their constituency. They will get you to sit in some random karakartas

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.240
[Guest]: car and they will be like go to this rally here and they will be very excited to do it.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.240
[Guest]: So that was my level of engagement in Varanasi. I was largely an observer. I wasn't helping

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.880
[Guest]: out with the campaign in any way. Also wasn't in a position to help the prime minister of

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:35.320
[Guest]: the country in his election campaign in his constituency. But it was an extremely interesting

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.480
[Guest]: journey. Went to a lot of different places, talked to a lot of different people. The first

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.320
[Guest]: thing that I started noticing was that the Modi wave in 2014 was so strong that you had

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.240
[Guest]: random kids shouting BJP slogans, wearing BJP hats. So I even have pictures posted to

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:59.760
[Guest]: Facebook where random kids are hanging on to me wearing BJP hats. And that entire situation

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.200
[Guest]: that was there at that point of time, the entire euphoria that was there in the entire

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.320
[Guest]: population made me really excited about elections in general.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.800
[Guest]: So some of the most exciting days in my life have been like one, one and a half months

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.720
[Guest]: before elections. And it doesn't even matter who I'm supporting. It's just the atmosphere

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:23.360
[Guest]: there. Indian elections for most people in urban India are these things where like people

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:30.200
[Guest]: are debating on TV, angry at each other, shouting at each other. In most of India outside the

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:36.080
[Guest]: urban metros, elections are festivals. It's huge rallies happening. It's crowds coming

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.080
[Guest]: to cities from different villages with politicians arranging free transport for them. It's an

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.880
[Guest]: entire holiday outing. They come to the main metro city to listen to the speech, but then

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.360
[Guest]: after the speech, they shop there, they go around there. The buses take like the next

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.200
[Guest]: five or six hours just standing there while people explore the towns and the cities of

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:01.440
[Guest]: this country. A lot of times political parties also pay people to come to rallies, which

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:07.880
[Guest]: is obviously a horrible thing for democracy, but is also a form of economic redistribution.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.840
[Guest]: Political parties and politicians made money. When the election is happening, that money

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.400
[Guest]: is going to come out and that is going to go to citizens, that is going to go to tent

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.600
[Guest]: dwellers, that is going to go to rickshaw drivers, that is going to go to bus drivers.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.720
[Guest]: This entire process, extremely illegal, extremely horrible for democracy. But when you see it

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.840
[Guest]: on the ground, it feels like a really cheerful thing. It seems like a festival with gifts

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:38.580
[Guest]: being distributed by the politicians to the voters. So this experience of one election

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.960
[Guest]: in Varanasi got me excited about elections for one, gave me an understanding of what

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.960
[Guest]: democracy and elections mean to people in this country, what the value is. We value

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.880
[Guest]: elections a lot less than this country's rural population and this country's poor population

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.800
[Guest]: because the results of elections don't affect our lives in the same way.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:08.200
[Guest]: If say someone else wins today, my life would largely remain the same. I don't depend on

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.420
[Guest]: government benefits. I have not been to a government school. My kids are very unlikely

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:16.720
[Guest]: to go to a government school. The roads that we go to end up paying tolls on all of them.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.360
[Guest]: We don't avail of any of the different government schemes. We are not getting housing under

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.280
[Guest]: Indira Awas. We are not working for NREGA. We are not taking ration from the PDS system.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.960
[Guest]: We are extremely distant from the government. But this country's poor population and this

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.600
[Guest]: country's rural population, almost every person is getting the benefit of some or the

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.880
[Guest]: other government scheme. They're getting rations, they're getting houses, they're getting toilets

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:46.160
[Guest]: built, getting gas cylinders. The impact of a government change on them, and then there

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:51.960
[Guest]: is another aspect to it that is slightly more negative. The parties are based around religion

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:57.680
[Guest]: and the parties are based around caste. So in urban India, these things matter, but they

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.640
[Guest]: still matter less. In rural areas, one party comes to power that is based around a certain

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:09.440
[Guest]: caste group, that caste group feels emboldened and empowered enough to suppress other caste

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:15.440
[Guest]: groups within the rural area. They feel emboldened enough to do illegal things, like with BJP

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:21.080
[Guest]: in power. The consequence on a rural Muslim household on a daily basis is going to be

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.080
[Guest]: much worse than say housing discrimination in Mumbai, which exists, which is a major

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.840
[Guest]: problem, but it is not a daily problem. In the other parts of India, it's a daily problem.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:35.920
[Guest]: So who comes to power, who wins an election will influence the course of your life much

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.240
[Guest]: more than it would for you or me. And this is something that you can only realize once

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.960
[Guest]: you go to an election campaign and talk to the people there. Why are they there? What

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.880
[Guest]: are they doing there? Then going to Banaras, Varanasi also had another sense. I understood

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:58.520
[Guest]: the election economy slightly better. I went to Kashi Vishwanath, I went to a couple of

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.800
[Guest]: other temples, I went to the Hanuman Mandir. Kashi Vishwanath is also a very big political

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:10.320
[Guest]: entity in Varanasi. So I talked to the Pandit there for a really long time. And I'd also

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.320
[Guest]: like gone with some political people. So they assumed I was important enough to like engage

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.320
[Guest]: and talk to. So we talked for a really long time. And he told me about like Arvind Kejriwal

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.080
[Guest]: coming to Varanasi and his discussions with Arvind Kejriwal. He told me about his discussions

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.920
[Guest]: with other people and how he was supporting Narendra Modi and what his motivation was.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:34.320
[Guest]: And then you start to realize how important these different people are in elections. It

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.840
[Guest]: turned out to be incredibly helpful while I was working on election campaigns in the

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:45.040
[Guest]: Northeast, because we are dismissive of people who try to say that I have 500 votes, I have

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.800
[Guest]: 1000 votes, I have 400 votes. But once you meet a couple of them, you start to learn

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.120
[Guest]: how to analyze if they actually have these votes before you even engage with them. So

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.400
[Guest]: while I was in the Northeast, there are a lot of tribal chiefs, there are a lot of village

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.160
[Guest]: heads, village tribesmen, elders in the village who have the capacity to shift votes in their

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.200
[Guest]: local village, in their local area, because the community respects them. So they have

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.800
[Guest]: demands from you. Some of them are political demands. Some of them are demands for the

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.480
[Guest]: local area. Some of them are like social demands. Some of them are like personal demands for

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.280
[Guest]: their own personal benefits. All of that happens together. But you realize that, okay, these

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.720
[Guest]: people exist in the country who are respected enough or feared enough in the community to

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.960
[Guest]: transfer votes. And this value of these people in democracy, I saw in Banaras for the first

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.400
[Guest]: time.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of fascinating things are and you know, one of the insights I noted down while

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.240
[Amit Varma]: reading your book was when you talk about whatever other data or whatever other metrics

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:48.600
[Amit Varma]: you look at, one metric that you feel is reliable for identifying if there is a wave or not

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.280
[Amit Varma]: is how excited the children are. And you said that's when you know, you were in Varanasi

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.200
[Amit Varma]: and you saw all these kids who are enthusiastic about Modi that you realize that there was

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.000
[Amit Varma]: something there that was pretty big, much as you know, people say that if an earthquake

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.280
[Amit Varma]: is coming, your dog will know. But you know, my question there is that, you know, if your

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.160
[Amit Varma]: dog is acting weirdly, how do you know whether it's hungry or there's an earthquake coming?

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.160
[Amit Varma]: You can't assume there's an earthquake coming every time. But I have a dog, so I don't know

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.560
[Amit Varma]: that very well. So I have two or three questions that arise out of what you just said. And

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.440
[Amit Varma]: one of the things that really intrigues me and which you would know intimately, but I

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.640
[Amit Varma]: don't and most of my listeners certainly don't. So we are hoping for some enlightenment there

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.680
[Amit Varma]: is what is the ecosystem of party workers like across parties? Like, it's a question

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.520
[Amit Varma]: that often comes to me that what motivates a party worker, a lot of party workers, for

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:46.120
[Amit Varma]: example, don't even really get paid, you know, most of them can't really aspire to realistic

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.680
[Amit Varma]: power. Of course, they might have little driblets of power by virtue of being somewhere in the

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.080
[Amit Varma]: party hierarchy. And that can be intoxicating on its own. And once you have it, you don't

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.360
[Amit Varma]: want to let it go, I get that. But by and large, most party workers, you know, what

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.320
[Amit Varma]: are they motivated by what are their incentives, you know, at the level of the BJP, to some

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.880
[Amit Varma]: extent, I know a lot of the foot soldiers were of course provided by the RSS and all

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.120
[Amit Varma]: that. And there's a deeper connection to community and to ideology that goes on there. And I

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:19.720
[Amit Varma]: get that. But I look at all the other parties and all of that. What's the scene out there?

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Like in your case, you're a professional, you're coming with data analytics, part of

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.000
[Amit Varma]: what is driving you is also a hunger to learn. Like you talk about how you know, during the

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.880
[Amit Varma]: Amarinder Singh campaign in Punjab, which of course, we'll come to a little later, because

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.880
[Amit Varma]: I have questions on that as well. But during that campaign, you landed up and you realized

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.440
[Amit Varma]: that there was no data analytics, it was just boring data collection, and you didn't want

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.240
[Amit Varma]: to do that. So you focused on another domain. So you're driven at that point by curiosity

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.240
[Amit Varma]: and the hunger to learn. But what about what about actual party workers? What about karyakartas?

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.040
[Amit Varma]: How is this ecosystem kind of held together? Give me a sense of that.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:03.560
[Guest]: So one sad reality is that most party karyakartas are people with very low opportunity costs.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.760
[Guest]: This is true, largely because someone who has a good job has a stable family and has

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.400
[Guest]: to go to office nine to five, and gets a good salary is very unlikely to resign from that

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.400
[Guest]: job and become a party karyakarta because there is no real future to it. So it's largely

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.960
[Guest]: people who were just surviving. And they have a couple of reasons to get into the party

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.360
[Guest]: structure and get into a party hierarchy. One is obviously a sense of belonging and

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.360
[Guest]: purpose, which is something that everyone is looking for in life. A lot of people find

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.960
[Guest]: it in their careers, a lot of people find it in providing for their family, a lot of

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.880
[Guest]: people find it in politics when they're contributing to a party coming to power. So that is the

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.080
[Guest]: first part. This also includes the RSS karyakartas who support the BJP. They're there for the

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.440
[Guest]: purposes of supporting an identity, supporting a belief system, because it gives them a sense

01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:00.040
[Guest]: of purpose. There is nothing real and tangible that they're gaining out of it, other than

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:06.720
[Guest]: a friend circle, a community and a purpose and something to do in life. The second kind

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.520
[Guest]: of karyakarta that's there, which is a much bigger proportion, actually, is people who

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:17.480
[Guest]: are there because they see it as something that can provide some amount of social mobility.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.920
[Guest]: And the social mobility includes economic mobility, because sometimes they will reach

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.040
[Guest]: out to someone higher up in the party hierarchy and be able to deliver on a couple of projects.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.840
[Guest]: They might be able to get someone like a college admission, a school admission, they might

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.360
[Guest]: be able to get someone a really tiny tender for a road repair work, things like that.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.240
[Guest]: They might be able to go to the local police station, call their superior in the party

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.440
[Guest]: hierarchy or the MP or the MLA, and the MP and MLA would recognize that this is my karyakarta.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.200
[Guest]: So they will talk to the police station for you and help you with a couple of cases here

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.380
[Guest]: and there. So that is a very big set of people. There is a local economy built around it.

01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:00.360
[Guest]: So if you see a village, and if you see someone who's having a problem, say someone goes to

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.760
[Guest]: get pension, but the official there, the government official refuses to listen, does not give

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.440
[Guest]: them the form even, and throws them out. Who do they go to? Do they directly go to, say,

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.680
[Guest]: the nation's capital and talk to the prime minister? They can't, they can't go to the

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.960
[Guest]: chief minister, they can't even reach the MLA or the MP, because these are busy people

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.520
[Guest]: who live very far away from them. They live in the district capital. What they do is that

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.960
[Guest]: they know which party is in power, they know who is the local karyakarta for this party

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.280
[Guest]: within my village, within my area, they reach out to that guy. And then they tell them ki

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.400
[Guest]: bhai, maine vote diya hai, yeh mera kaam atka hua hai, tum karwa. Then this karyakarta goes

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.560
[Guest]: with them to the official, talks on their behalf. He is somewhere in the party hierarchy

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.800
[Guest]: so he is also more confident. He tells them with confidence that okay, I am this, please

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.960
[Guest]: do this work. Sometimes money exchanges hands at this level, sometimes it doesn't. But at

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.200
[Guest]: the end of it, local work gets delivered. So these people are someone in society, and

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.320
[Guest]: some people are running the households off of it, some aren't, but it provides value

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.640
[Guest]: to them directly. Then there is a third kind of karyakarta, the third one is someone who

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.280
[Guest]: is actually an aspirant. They believe that at some point in the future, they could contest

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.240
[Guest]: say a ward councillor election, the local panchayat election. They could contest, even

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.820
[Guest]: if they don't contest, they could become part of the village monitoring committee.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.960
[Guest]: They could become part of different committees like there are railway committees, there are

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.200
[Guest]: committees on women and child development, there are committees for everything in India.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.240
[Guest]: And a lot of these people who are nominated to these committees are actually political

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.840
[Guest]: workers. And that's how it's been across the history of India. And that's been the means

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:48.280
[Guest]: of rewarding karyakartas who are slightly above the bilkul ground ka karyakarta. So

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.960
[Guest]: distantly these three types.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's a fascinating ecosystem. And when you sort of said at the start that, you know,

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.400
[Amit Varma]: party workers are those with the lowest opportunity cost, the first thought that came to my mind

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.640
[Amit Varma]: is, oh, then the all the losers become party karyakartas. But by which of course, you know,

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.240
[Amit Varma]: it is true that many people don't have opportunity cost for anything simply because they're not

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.120
[Amit Varma]: born into privilege. They haven't been able to get an education, they're poor. But even

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:15.440
[Amit Varma]: within that strata, those who are likely to have the least opportunity cost are the sort

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.880
[Amit Varma]: of the losers in that bunch.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.840
[Guest]: So it is not a completely terrible situation once, it's also not someone dying of hunger,

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.320
[Guest]: you have to realize that it is someone who has enough land, say, in the village to support

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.760
[Guest]: his family, or who has a parent who has, say, a permanent government job, who is a school

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.120
[Amit Varma]: teacher who is a postmaster, and this guy is surviving off of the family.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.640
[Amit Varma]: So lack of opportunity cost in that sense, also that he can feed himself, and he's got

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.360
[Amit Varma]: that kind of security and all of that. And, you know, for my listeners, another concept

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll kind of talk about here is that coined by an economist called Mankar Olson called

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.720
[Amit Varma]: stationary bandits and roving bandits. And where Olson comes at is that imagine that

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.520
[Amit Varma]: there's just a village in the middle of nowhere, and you have bandits coming and going. Now

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.040
[Amit Varma]: a group of roving bandits are, you know, it'll come, and it'll just take everything, it doesn't

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.140
[Amit Varma]: give a shit about what you're left with, it'll come take everything, go away, and it's done.

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:12.000
[Amit Varma]: But then a group of bandits will come, which will decide that they want to stay there.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And they're what is called the stationary bandits. And for them, it doesn't make sense

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.160
[Amit Varma]: to rob the people of everything, because hey, they're going to stay there and they need

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.400
[Amit Varma]: the people on their side, and they need to, you know, not kill the golden goose, as it

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.280
[Amit Varma]: were. So they start sort of governing these people, as it were, whom they've kind of whose

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.340
[Amit Varma]: lives they've taken over, and, you know, helping them in small ways, but continuing to kind

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:37.400
[Amit Varma]: of rob them. And the state is basically a stationary bandit. And, you know, I remember

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.520
[Amit Varma]: I'd once written an essay in the context of Naxalism, in those areas where Naxalism does

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.040
[Amit Varma]: take place, where my point was that the state hasn't taken that role of stationary bandit,

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.680
[Amit Varma]: the rule of law is absent. So sometimes the Naxals will come, and they'll be roving bandits,

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.680
[Amit Varma]: sometimes, you know, the state will do exactly that. And sometimes the Naxals will actually

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.160
[Amit Varma]: try to build an ecosystem so that they can be stationary bandits for a while. And it

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.080
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that what you describe as ki mera yeh kaam nahi hua, you go to the party karyakarta,

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.300
[Amit Varma]: it's almost as if with the state being really weak and rickety and absent in some ways,

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:16.220
[Amit Varma]: you have, you know, the party machinery or whichever party is in power, taking over some

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:21.280
[Amit Varma]: of those roles and saying, fine, you know, you voted for us. So we'll look after you

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.320
[Amit Varma]: in that very bandit-y quid pro quo. Now, I did an episode with Milan Vashnavan, his excellent

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.560
[Amit Varma]: book on crime in Indian politics, which you also cite. And one of the points Milan made

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.080
[Amit Varma]: was that look, elections take a lot of money. And you've detailed that, in fact, in your

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:39.920
[Amit Varma]: book with a lot of fantastic figures, elections need a lot of money. So initially, in independent

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.040
[Amit Varma]: India, there was that thing that okay, who has money, the local ganglord has money, you

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.360
[Amit Varma]: take money from him, you do your quid pro quo. And later on, at a later point in time,

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.760
[Amit Varma]: the ganglord himself kind of gets into politics, because he's like, I have the money, you know,

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.120
[Amit Varma]: why should I give it to someone else, I'll become the MP, which is what you find throughout

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.440
[Amit Varma]: central India. And there, I guess, incentives of the party workers may be a little different,

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.240
[Amit Varma]: because the party workers are actually part of the gang. Like, you know, the way our democracy

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:12.200
[Amit Varma]: is, I often talk about our political parties as competing mafias, which, you know, rival

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.640
[Amit Varma]: mafias, which compete every five years to take a monopoly on power that the state kind

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:23.600
[Amit Varma]: of gives you. But anyway, all of that is kind of a digression. Tell me about sort of the

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:30.760
[Amit Varma]: role that money plays in all of this. Because one of the things that we all know is that

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:36.440
[Amit Varma]: it takes an enormous amount of money to just contest an election, leave alone win it. And

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.880
[Amit Varma]: power and money, of course, have a circular relationship. The point is, if you invest,

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:44.360
[Amit Varma]: if one, you need money from somewhere to invest, and when you invest, you need a return on

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:49.080
[Amit Varma]: investment. So you're giving contracts to people, road banao, ye banao, wo banao, all

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.880
[Amit Varma]: kinds of corruption comes in, which is taken as power for the cause, which people even

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.120
[Amit Varma]: understand and expect of all the parties. And there is this sort of circular relationship,

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.160
[Amit Varma]: therefore, going on. At a time when I was professionally writing limericks for the Times

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of India, I'd come up with one called politics. So I'll just read that out. A Neta who loves

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.680
[Amit Varma]: currency notes, told me what his line of work denotes. It is kind of funny, we steal people's

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.920
[Amit Varma]: money and use some of it to buy their votes, stop quote, which kind of is, you know, an

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.400
[Amit Varma]: ironic truth about the predatory state, which most of us have just completely normalized.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.040
[Amit Varma]: All this time where you were in these different machineries in Punjab, in the Northeast, and

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.600
[Amit Varma]: all of that, you know, working with the party machinery, how did that kind of function?

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.600
[Amit Varma]: Like number one, I assume that as a political consultant, you were paid. And regardless

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.680
[Amit Varma]: of your individual case, were there a lot of paid workers as well, professionals who

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.120
[Amit Varma]: were actually getting money for what they were doing? Or were they more like true believers

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.880
[Amit Varma]: or who just wanted to be part of the process? And how does that funneling of money happen?

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.560
[Amit Varma]: You've also spoken about how, despite demonetization, you know, parties still figured it out, they

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.120
[Amit Varma]: had money to spend and all of that. So tell me a little bit about the financial ecosystem,

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.960
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know, sort of fueling all of this. Is that something that you were acquainted

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:15.480
[Amit Varma]: with and had special insights on? Or, you know, were you just an executive and it wasn't

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.520
[Amit Varma]: your job to think about where the money is coming from?

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.480
[Guest]: So as a consultant, almost everybody is getting paid. But the interesting part is that during

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:32.640
[Guest]: elections, every worker is getting paid. They're not getting paid year round, most of the times

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:39.120
[Guest]: they're just working for the party. But when it comes time for elections, literally everyone

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.720
[Guest]: who has anything to do with politics is getting paid at some level or the other. Some people

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.920
[Guest]: are getting paid because the party thinks they can transfer votes. Some people are getting

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.040
[Guest]: paid in the name of bringing people to rallies. So they're getting paid for arranging the

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:58.720
[Guest]: buses, arranging the food, but it's always like a surplus amount attached to it that

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:04.480
[Guest]: they pocket, which is a very well understood phenomenon. If you look at polling agents,

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.920
[Guest]: so every party needs people at the booth during polling day who basically write the parchi,

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:15.000
[Guest]: hand it over to the people, then they go inside and vote. These agents basically get paid

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.840
[Guest]: from 1000 to 2000 in North India. If you look at South India and the Northeast, then it

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:25.480
[Guest]: starts at 5000, below that, no one's really willing to engage with you. So every booth

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:33.120
[Guest]: that you look at and even if you look at an assembly constituency, it's 200 to 250 booths

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.480
[Guest]: and it's five times this in a parliamentary constituency. So 2000 into this is just your

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.600
[Guest]: expenditure on election day to have one person at each of the booths. So it's obviously a

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:50.400
[Guest]: very expensive exercise. Where it is becoming more expensive is that it's very difficult

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:56.160
[Guest]: to get your name out to the voting public. For people to even know that you exist. You

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:01.200
[Guest]: now need to spend on social media, you need to spend on Facebook, you need to create these

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.000
[Guest]: groups which can create graphics for you create videos for you. You need people around you

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.800
[Guest]: are clicking your pictures and posting it continuously. Then you need paid advertising

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:17.240
[Guest]: in newspapers, you need these radio jingles made for you. You need video vans going around

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.080
[Guest]: in constituencies that play the party's movie that play your songs all over the place. So

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:28.280
[Guest]: the costs are increasing for two major reasons. One, the means of information dissemination

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:34.760
[Guest]: have increased. Like earlier India decided that okay, we will give you free airtime on

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:42.000
[Guest]: the national DD network. And we will give you free airtime on all India radio. All candidates

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.240
[Guest]: still get that free airtime. There is a lottery on when you will get to speak how long you'll

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:51.400
[Guest]: get to speak and stuff. It's a very interesting process, but no candidate cares. So from the

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:57.080
[Guest]: party, I was deputed to go collect that slip, because no one wanted to do it. The reality

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.400
[Guest]: is now there are so many private channels, there are so many newspapers, there are so

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:05.600
[Guest]: many radio stations, that the government providing you free airtime on the national one doesn't

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:12.680
[Guest]: mean anything. Social media becoming this new thing that is a major drain on resources.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.600
[Guest]: Somehow people think that social media is cheap. It is not. An entity like Facebook

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.320
[Guest]: is a very like money hungry entity in the sense that organic reach has essentially become

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:31.280
[Guest]: zero. If you want your message and posts seen, you need to pay them. Other than this, when

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:37.360
[Guest]: you are organizing an election campaign, you need to get people to the booth. In my experience,

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.740
[Guest]: you can change the election day result by four to 6% just based on booth management

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:50.000
[Guest]: on like one day before election and the election day. So in two days, if you are so much better

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.640
[Guest]: than the other side, you can shift the results by four to 6%. So something like this also

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.560
[Guest]: requires money because you need people to go out, you need people to fill other people

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.800
[Guest]: in autos and rickshaws and get them to the polling station. It's called a get out the

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.320
[Guest]: vote campaign like it is in the US, except it works very differently in India. So these

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:15.280
[Guest]: things matter. Money matters. How the money comes in is undergoing a massive transformation

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.800
[Guest]: in this country. If you look at what happened after independence, you're right that industrialists

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.420
[Guest]: and local mafias funded the politicians. Then they decided to become politicians themselves

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:34.080
[Guest]: in a lot of areas. A lot of contractors and builders who used to fund the local politicians

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.720
[Guest]: also decided to become politicians themselves because all their work and contracts is anyways

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.600
[Guest]: dependent on paying someone. So they realized why not cut out the middlemen and do this

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.680
[Guest]: myself. So that has happened. What is transforming under the current government though is that

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:56.040
[Guest]: resources are getting centralized. Most political parties in India depended on a mix of candidates.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:00.200
[Guest]: Some candidates used to be people who can fund elections for themselves and other people.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.640
[Guest]: So those constituencies, the ticket used to be sold. And then that money used to cross

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.900
[Guest]: subsidize candidates who were good, who could will, but did not have the money to contest.

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:14.400
[Guest]: This was the regular system that was at play. Local candidates were expected to raise their

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.960
[Guest]: own local resources from their friends, family, businesses, any interest that they could find.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:26.200
[Guest]: Now it's becoming more and more centralized. BJP as a political party doesn't really depend

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:31.400
[Guest]: on the candidates. To a large extent, they understand that the voter is voting for Narendra

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.520
[Guest]: Modi. The campaign is being done around the prime minister. The campaign is being done

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.280
[Guest]: by BJP. The local candidate doesn't have much to do with it at all. Local candidate can

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.000
[Guest]: raise and spend whatever they want or not want. The party will spend the huge amounts.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.600
[Guest]: The party will do all of the advertising around a central image, which is right now the prime

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.480
[Guest]: minister. And then build an entire election campaign where the voter knows that they have

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.920
[Guest]: to press the camel because they want to vote for PM Narendra Modi. And this is true everywhere

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.800
[Guest]: from say a municipal election to the state level elections to obviously the national

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.600
[Guest]: election. So the MPs and MLAs and their spending is a very like a thing that doesn't matter

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:20.280
[Guest]: to BJP as much. But what does this mean? This means that the central collection of resources

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.120
[Guest]: has to be much stronger. And what this also means is that you cannot take money from small

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:29.800
[Guest]: builders and contractors and expect it to reach the party level. That would never work.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.440
[Guest]: So now the politics of this nation is headed towards where the US politics is, where political

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.560
[Guest]: parties become very dependent on very few business interests. There are going to be

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:45.720
[Guest]: 10, 20, 30 business people who are accounting for the bulk of the money that a political

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:52.120
[Guest]: party raises. So you become beholden to those 20 people. Whereas in the previous model,

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:56.640
[Guest]: yes, small contracts, small local thekas used to go to these people who funded elections.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.160
[Guest]: But at the larger national level, there were no like 10 businessmen who were like absolutely

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.800
[Guest]: dominant and absolutely controlling everything. This transformation could seem like a positive

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.000
[Guest]: to some who don't have to spend as much in the local elections, who don't have to give

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.280
[Guest]: as much money to the politicians. But it is also detrimental to the country in a way because

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:22.200
[Guest]: now what the people expect is not contracts. What they expect is entire changes in law

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.000
[Guest]: that eliminate all competition. We expect entire changes in policy which give them access

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.040
[Guest]: to say an area that was preserved, saved from mining because of environmental considerations,

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.200
[Guest]: because of the local tribes there. So these kinds of interests also want major things.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.920
[Guest]: There have been a couple of very interesting instances that we've heard of in the rumor

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.920
[Guest]: mill, where people have gotten import duties changed on products so that they could just

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:50.480
[Guest]: like benefit from the difference on it. If you increase the import duty of an imported

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:56.520
[Guest]: product, say the glass that goes on top of solar panels, very few entities, if you look

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:01.680
[Guest]: it up, you'll know which entity it is, a very specific entity that makes it in India. They

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.520
[Guest]: are so tiny that they can't fulfill domestic demand, but they still lobbied for getting

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.400
[Guest]: that duty increased so that the profit margin essentially just like ballooned up by the

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:17.000
[Guest]: amount of duty increase. So things like this happen when you take money from big people,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:24.460
[Guest]: they want big policy level changes from you. Another thing that is happening is that these

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:30.920
[Guest]: companies that are being created, might it be IPAC, ABM that works for BJP, all of these

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.720
[Guest]: entities employ a lot of young people who are like highly educated, so they also need

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:39.760
[Guest]: higher salaries than your Karakartas and party workers do. They account for a small amount

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.960
[Guest]: per se, because there are very few people like this in the political setup. The largest

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.880
[Guest]: political consultancy and the largest set of professionals that there is, it's going

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:55.240
[Guest]: to be about 400 people for a state election. So no matter how highly paid they are, the

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.720
[Guest]: compensation is not much compared to what's spent in an election. But there is a difference.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:05.480
[Guest]: The difference is that these people need to be paid entirely in white money. Like if someone

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.560
[Guest]: told me, okay, I am going to pay you in a contract, I will not know what to do with

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.640
[Guest]: it. And I'll tell them, no boss, like pay me in my bank account. So that system of like

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:20.800
[Guest]: doling out favors, paying in cash does not work with these set of people. Interestingly,

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:24.840
[Guest]: what has happened is that in a couple of cases, at least the political party is not the one

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:31.280
[Guest]: paying these entities. They've given it out to a corporate. So a corporate is now directly

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.240
[Guest]: paying a political consultancy firm, which is working for a political party. So this

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:41.040
[Guest]: money and this entire transaction never comes on the books of the political party. Even

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.200
[Guest]: in the books of the corporate, it is actually built as a consultancy expense and not a political

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:50.400
[Guest]: donation because he has paid a private entity to do consultancy work. The consultancy work

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:56.400
[Guest]: is for a political party is a different story altogether. So these new ways are evolving.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.400
[Guest]: Electoral bonds confiscate, like basically obfuscate everything because now you can't

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:06.640
[Guest]: prove in a court of law who paid a political party. What this does is I want a policy change.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.120
[Guest]: I take an electoral bond to you. I tell you, do this policy change and I'm going to pay

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:16.480
[Guest]: you a thousand crores. You do the policy change in my favor. All the competitors die out.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.080
[Guest]: I pay you the thousand crores. This entire transaction can happen on paper and you can

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.480
[Guest]: never prove it in the court of law because you can't prove who that thousand crores came

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:30.560
[Guest]: from because electoral bonds are anonymous. So in essence, we have just legalized corruption

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:37.760
[Guest]: in the nation. And because it's from a bank account, people think that it's not corruption.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:42.000
[Guest]: That's not the case. If there is a quid pro quo involved, it's very much illegal and very

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.840
[Guest]: harmful for the nation. But this seems to be the new dominant model of political funding.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, fascinating there. And I want to read out a passage from your book, which kind of

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:57.780
[Amit Varma]: talks about this whole circular motion of money, where money goes into winning elections

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:03.200
[Amit Varma]: and then that in turn makes more money. And you write, quote, through my discussions on

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.160
[Amit Varma]: political strategy, I came to know of a particular politician who seems to have built one of

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:12.080
[Amit Varma]: the finest systems of keeping his voters dependent on him. The MLA in question has taken the

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.680
[Amit Varma]: nexus of business politics and bribery of voters to a different level. He won the elections

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.680
[Amit Varma]: as an independent candidate a few years ago and is reported to distribute a monthly amount

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:27.560
[Amit Varma]: of 1000 to 2000 rupees to about half the people in his constituency. In this extremely impoverished

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.960
[Amit Varma]: region, this means that most of the voters in the constituency are dependent on him for

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:37.040
[Amit Varma]: sustenance. Creating this level of dependence in the local population ensures that he will

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.440
[Amit Varma]: remain a political force to reckon with in the region, and so on and so forth. And then

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.800
[Amit Varma]: you continue, he reportedly funds this entire operation by supporting mining companies in

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.760
[Amit Varma]: the district where his constituency is located, and is backed by a contract miner whose company

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.400
[Amit Varma]: has become the largest in the region with an increase in turnover from 90 crore to over

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:02.780
[Amit Varma]: 1300 crores in 15 years, stop quote. And what do you say about sort of the centralization

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:08.040
[Amit Varma]: of power leading to a centralization of funding is something that I would actually have expected

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:13.960
[Amit Varma]: to happen earlier, because money always kind of follows power. And of course, in the US

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.120
[Amit Varma]: is very explicit. There's a great book by Jonathan Rauch called Government's End, which

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.520
[Amit Varma]: kind of describes the power of interest groups over there, engaging in what is essentially

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:29.040
[Amit Varma]: bribery. And the circular motion between money and politics is, you know, is actually easy

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.920
[Amit Varma]: to perceive once you start looking for it, you know, so a big company funds, say, a party

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and the party comes to power, and the party will then pass a law that helps his big company,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.200
[Amit Varma]: for example, they could have import tariffs so that, you know, their turf is protected

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.880
[Amit Varma]: and cheap exports don't flood in and take them away, and so on and so forth. And I think

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.120
[Amit Varma]: there are so many policies that you can immediately figure out by looking at them that hey, they

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.240
[Amit Varma]: actually harm the people, even though they are, you know, they've got good intentions

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.760
[Amit Varma]: behind them. But you can figure out exactly why this policy is there. For example, at

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:08.160
[Amit Varma]: one point, I used to point out how the both the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party opposed, you

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.060
[Amit Varma]: know, FDI in retail, and the BJP I think later changed his mind. But of course, the reason

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:18.360
[Amit Varma]: for that is that small retailers are a big vote bank. In the case of AAP, they are also

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: big funders for them. So it is natural that they'll want to protect them. And all of this

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.080
[Amit Varma]: is under the lofty rhetoric of look, we will protect local manufacturers and all of that.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:32.080
[Amit Varma]: But the unseen effect of all of this is that is the consumers who suffer, that instead

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.480
[Amit Varma]: of getting something for 10 rupees, you are you're paying 15 rupees for it. And what you

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.360
[Amit Varma]: don't see is what you would have done with the extra 5 rupees had it remained with you.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.320
[Amit Varma]: And of course, there are many knock on effects like local manufacturers would have had to

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:50.480
[Amit Varma]: up their game to compete, and it would just have helped the entire ecosystem. But that

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of doesn't happen. So whenever you look at a public policy, I'd urge all my listeners

01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:00.440
[Amit Varma]: just kind of look at who stands to benefit from it. And it is quite often not the people

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:06.760
[Amit Varma]: of India, but some random cronies. But with that rant over, we now get to sort of your

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.440
[Amit Varma]: LAMP fellowship, because one of the intriguing things you said just now in this answer was,

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.520
[Amit Varma]: and you said this in the context of the money and fundraising, is that the local MP doesn't

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:22.800
[Amit Varma]: really matter. You know, everything is centralized on top. And as a LAMP fellow, one of the things

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.100
[Amit Varma]: that you've described while working with an MP is that Parliament doesn't really matter.

01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:32.400
[Amit Varma]: And part of it is because of the anti-defection law of 1985, which basically means that you

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.760
[Amit Varma]: can run Parliament from an Excel sheet. And I've done an episode on this a short episode

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.560
[Amit Varma]: ages ago with Varun Mitra. But I'd like you to elaborate on this, because you've actually

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:45.600
[Amit Varma]: seen this from the inside, like, did you know, did you go in thinking that, oh, I'll be working

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.160
[Amit Varma]: with an MP, I'll be, you know, helping him in the parliamentary debates, we will take

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.800
[Amit Varma]: this great nation forward? What was that process like? And how does it really work?

01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.960
[Guest]: Oh, definitely. So the first time I entered Parliament, I was extremely excited. The building

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.940
[Guest]: feels like such an important place. When you enter through multiple layers of security

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:11.360
[Guest]: in Parliament, you get a sense of real purpose and pride and you think, okay, you are at

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.880
[Guest]: the center of the country right now where laws are going to get made, where policies

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.080
[Guest]: to better the constituency, better the lives of people are going to get made. And when

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.560
[Guest]: you spend three months there, you actually don't even want to enter the building anymore.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.120
[Guest]: Because when you realize, okay, like MPs just get to go in and you get to go in through

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:34.720
[Guest]: so many security checks, and you don't see the purpose of it, you actually start feeling

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.280
[Guest]: okay, I'll see the Parliament from outside on television. So much easier to do it that

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:46.200
[Guest]: way. What you realize very early on is that anti-defection is a major component of it

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.440
[Guest]: because it was brought in so that politicians couldn't jump one party to the other and basically

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.280
[Guest]: dismantle one government and bring upon a new government. But the law is framed in such

01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:02.880
[Guest]: a way that they can't vote against their own party in any bill, on any legislation, on

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.680
[Guest]: anything debated in Parliament, if a whip is issued. And for most legislations that

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.080
[Guest]: come about, because most legislations have someone's huge interest tied into it, and

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:17.520
[Guest]: that's why it was written, there is a whip issued for most legislations. So the MPs could

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.320
[Guest]: absolutely disagree with it, they still have to vote for whatever the party tells them

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:28.320
[Guest]: to vote for. So their opinion doesn't matter. This was the first realization. With this

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.760
[Guest]: comes the fact that they go to Parliament or they don't, it doesn't matter on what laws

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.320
[Guest]: are made in the country. If the party in power has the majority and they decide this is the

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:44.000
[Guest]: law, then it is the law. The debates that happen and the speeches that happen there

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.560
[Guest]: are in general a show put on for the public. Sometimes the politicians who have spoken

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.440
[Guest]: against it will take clips and circulate it on their YouTube pages and Facebook pages

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.920
[Guest]: and they'd be telling their constituents, okay, I tried to stand up against this, but

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.360
[Guest]: I couldn't do anything, even though they voted for it in the actual motions. The second thing

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.440
[Guest]: that you start realizing is that most of the times you don't even know where an MP voted.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:17.160
[Guest]: Most democracies, you can tell an MP's voting track record. In India, a majority of the

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.760
[Guest]: legislation gets passed by voice vote, which is people just saying aye or nay, and the

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.760
[Guest]: speaker deciding, okay, I think I hear more ayes, so it's passed now. And this is one

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.320
[Guest]: of the major things that was debated in multiple legislations right now, including the farm

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.600
[Guest]: bills. And before that, the Aadhaar bill that was passed, it was passed as a money bill,

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.720
[Guest]: so it never went to the Rajya Sabha at all. But even in Lok Sabha, a lot of people called

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:48.240
[Guest]: for division, especially on the farm bills. You can hear people on TV saying we want division.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.600
[Guest]: That means they want everyone to go back to their seats and press a button so that it

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:58.060
[Guest]: is known exactly how many people and who voted in what way. But the speaker decided this

01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:03.600
[Guest]: wasn't essential. He heard more ayes in the shouting of the parliament and the bill was

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:10.280
[Guest]: passed. So this is how legislation is passed. The parliamentary debates that happen are

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.120
[Guest]: valuable in the sense that sometimes data and information comes out, but most times

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:23.000
[Guest]: it's as good as a television debate in a TV studio. The valuable component that I found

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.920
[Guest]: there is actually motions and parliamentary questions. Because in parliamentary questions,

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.320
[Guest]: it's like an RTI that an MP files, except in RTI, they can write, oh, it will take too

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.520
[Guest]: long to compile this information, so we won't. Or we won't give you this information because

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.720
[Guest]: it's privileged in this and this way. In parliamentary questions, they have to reply. Even if it

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.000
[Guest]: takes them compiling data, creating new tables for it, they will have to spend time and do

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.480
[Guest]: it. And because of that, it is the richest source of information and data that exists

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.160
[Guest]: in this country. If you want information on any subject, if you want numbers on what was

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.840
[Guest]: imported, what was exported, very likely that an MP has asked that question before and it

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.800
[Guest]: is listed on the Lok Sabha website. So that as a tool I found to be extremely useful.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.880
[Guest]: But essentially that is useful because that is the only disclosure that the government

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:17.400
[Guest]: does at large. When BJP came to power in 2014, there was a national open data platform to

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.160
[Guest]: be created, which would have all data from all government schemes and all data from all

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:29.520
[Guest]: the budgets of all departments. That website exists, but it's not been updated since, say,

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.960
[Guest]: 2016-17, no new data is uploaded onto it. So we are still where we were once, where

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.400
[Guest]: what the government does with our tax money, what the government does in government schemes

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.080
[Guest]: is still a closely guarded secret. The government holds the data, but it's not public, it's

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:52.120
[Guest]: not accessible. The only means to get it is parliamentary questions. But yeah, that was

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.320
[Guest]: one component. The other component, sadly, is that MPs have something called the MP-LAD

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:04.200
[Guest]: fund in their constituency. They get to spend five crores every year on local area development.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:10.520
[Guest]: Five crores for an MP constituency is a very small sum. What it does do is that it provides

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.040
[Guest]: the MP some sense of having some power. They don't have the money. They actually have to

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:21.080
[Guest]: write to the district magistrate and request that the money be spent on this project. The

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.120
[Guest]: DM decides who the contract will go to, the DM decides implementation. Only what the project

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.360
[Guest]: would be is decided by the MP and then he writes a letter. So this entire thing gives

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:37.520
[Guest]: them some semblance of power. In the local area, a politician has no authority whatsoever

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.800
[Guest]: on the district administration. In our legal framework, MPs and MLAs are supposed to make

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:50.680
[Guest]: laws within Vidhan Sabha and the parliament. Their power ends there. Within the constituency,

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.800
[Guest]: when they tell a district magistrate to do something, a superintendent of police to do

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.800
[Guest]: something, some department, rural development, panchayati raj, urban development, any department

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:05.160
[Guest]: to do something, the government officials do it for two reasons. One is because the

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.000
[Guest]: politician is powerful enough to talk to the minister, the chief minister, and then the

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.200
[Guest]: real administrative authority kicks in. Or in the local area, they want to maintain some

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:19.040
[Guest]: amount of peace. So it's only the nuisance value within a constituency that gives the

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.280
[Guest]: politician any value. Other than that, an MP and MLA would not be able to implement

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:29.200
[Guest]: anything. So when we talked about how these Bahubalis and these criminal nexuses came

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:35.440
[Guest]: into power, an important part to understand is also for a local person, these people probably

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.240
[Guest]: deliver more value than someone who is highly educated and very calm and is very good at

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:45.080
[Guest]: studying bills and then talking about them in the parliament. Because that is just not

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:50.920
[Guest]: affecting the local person's life. Another important aspect, like we discussed how local

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.000
[Guest]: karakartas exchange money sometimes in return for delivering services. I believe that a

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.960
[Guest]: strong central authority would decrease corruption. My belief was that local politicians would

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.840
[Guest]: be cut out and then corruption will go down. I am sorry to admit that I was extremely wrong

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:16.320
[Guest]: on this. Very surprising fact of this nation, but local politicians are a check and balance

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.880
[Guest]: on local bureaucracy. So if you look at something like pensions or PDS, the PDS shop owner and

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.920
[Guest]: the official who has to issue your pension and enroll you for the scheme or any government

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.240
[Guest]: scheme for that matter, a lot of times the local politician pressurizes him to do some

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.280
[Guest]: people without taking money or to not take absurd amounts. There are competing interests.

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.520
[Guest]: When the local politician becomes powerless, the official in charge becomes so empowered

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:48.080
[Guest]: that there is no way to circumvent that corruption at all. There is no one to reach out and this

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.600
[Guest]: in India has happened in a lot of places. So in a lot of areas where we hear that this

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.960
[Guest]: politician is very honest and you hear that corruption has gone up in the state and I

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.120
[Guest]: was very surprised. Why would this be the case? If the chief minister is honest, if

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.520
[Guest]: these officials are honest at the centre, within the district capital, how can corruption

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.160
[Guest]: go up? Then you go to the local constituency and you realize that Tahsildar is not honest

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:16.040
[Guest]: and then you realize the person handling the PDS shops is not honest. And that is where

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:20.480
[Guest]: the corruption arises and there is no system to counter that other than a local Bahubali

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.480
[Guest]: politician who earlier used to pressurize him.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Extremely fascinating and at the start of your answer, you pointed out how politicians,

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.840
[Amit Varma]: whatever they do in Parliament, they are really just posturing and you have mentioned in your

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:39.120
[Amit Varma]: book that it's the same in TV studios and this is something Barkha Dutt also told me

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.520
[Amit Varma]: in the episode I did recently with her that, you know, politicians may believe whatever

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.720
[Amit Varma]: and they may be quite reasonable person outside the studio, but they become defenders of the

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.280
[Amit Varma]: faith and shouting maniacs, my words not hers, when they are actually in the studio. So it's

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.840
[Amit Varma]: all just theatre, it's all political theatre that's playing out and people are watching

01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.520
[Amit Varma]: news television or, you know, even when it isn't fake news, it is still theatre, which

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.080
[Amit Varma]: is really kind of interesting. One of the things that struck me, and I shouldn't say

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.960
[Amit Varma]: it's poignant because why would I feel sorry for an MP, that's never going to happen, is

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.200
[Amit Varma]: what one could call the legislator paradox, which is you write at one point quote, in

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.880
[Amit Varma]: India, almost no one votes for an MP or MLA because of their voting record in legislatures

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.880
[Amit Varma]: or because of the kind of bills they have supported. People vote for an MP or MLA with

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.760
[Amit Varma]: the expectation that the politician will help solve their everyday issues, stop quote, which

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.360
[Amit Varma]: it seems is sensible on the part of people because they've kind of figured out Parliament

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.320
[Amit Varma]: doesn't make a difference. Except for what you just said that even at the local level,

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:41.240
[Amit Varma]: they don't have too much power. Like, I don't know how different it is in rural India necessarily.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:44.400
[Amit Varma]: But in urban India, and I've done an episode ages back on urban governance with Shruti

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Rajagopalan, where she lucidly explained the disconnect between power and accountability,

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.360
[Amit Varma]: that the local legislator that you're the MP that you're voting for, actually has no

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:59.440
[Amit Varma]: power, you know, if there's, you know, water shortage, or if there are potholes in the

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.520
[Amit Varma]: road outside your house, he can't do anything. And the person who can do something, the humble

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.800
[Amit Varma]: corporator or whatever, their incentives are different, and they're not actually accountable

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.360
[Amit Varma]: to you. This is why government needs to be really as local as possible. So you feel that

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.700
[Amit Varma]: there is a point to your vote. Today, someone like me knows that, you know, it doesn't make

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:21.840
[Amit Varma]: a difference. My vote won't solve any of the micro problems around me, like in garbage

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:27.520
[Amit Varma]: collection or whatever. And the macro problems, of course, are not kind of going to be solved

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:35.040
[Amit Varma]: either. So during this LAMP fellowship, you've written about one, your disillusionment with

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.680
[Amit Varma]: the way it was, but the MP you were working with, Premdas Rai of Sikkim Democratic Front,

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:45.640
[Amit Varma]: seems a fascinating man. He was IIT, IIM, and he got this also. So as you went through

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:51.260
[Amit Varma]: your LAMP fellowship, you clearly decided that even though, you know, this parliament

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:56.080
[Amit Varma]: thing was a sham, that politics was worthwhile. So what were the kind of lessons you were

01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.840
[Amit Varma]: learning? And what was the next move that you made? What was kind of driving you forward

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.480
[Amit Varma]: at this point? What was your vision of yourself? Like, one of the things I'm really interested

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.800
[Amit Varma]: in, and I can't ask you to elaborate at every different part of your life, obviously, but

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm also interested in how the conception of yourself was changing, you know, from I

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.880
[Amit Varma]: want to do this, this is what I want to be. And I am certain that that must have been

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.320
[Amit Varma]: kind of changing in either subtle or perhaps very big ways through this entire journey.

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about it at this point in time. And what did you do next?

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:34.320
[Guest]: So I learned a very important lesson from Mr. P.D. Rai, an excellent MP who understood

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.040
[Guest]: that you could deliver even without parliament. So what he chose to do instead was engage

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.000
[Guest]: a lot of civil society organisations, create a lot of entities and groups of MPs. So he

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.560
[Guest]: created a North-East MPs forum where all the North-East MPs discussed North-East specific

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.840
[Guest]: issues. He worked on something called the Sustainable Mountain Development Summit that

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.400
[Guest]: brought together all legislators from the 11 mountain states of India to discuss sustainable

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.880
[Guest]: development issues. He worked on the drug problem in Sikkim, worked on organic agriculture,

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:07.880
[Guest]: worked with the Population Foundation of India on population control. So things like this

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:14.320
[Guest]: with entities outside parliament, he was able to do it because he had the tag of being a

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:20.040
[Guest]: member of parliament. So that tag and that branding helps. Even when you are talking

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:26.640
[Guest]: to a local, say, official to get a road built, because you are an MP, they are likely to

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.500
[Guest]: listen to you out of a sense of respect and the aura of power that you create around you.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:37.920
[Guest]: This again was an electoral lesson in a way because I realised a lot of famous names,

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.680
[Guest]: a lot of politicians that are famous who are known to not do anything in their constituency

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.120
[Guest]: still continue to win. The reason they win is that constituents realise that famous name

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:52.920
[Guest]: for an MP matters. If your MP is a known name, your official would listen to your MP. If

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.120
[Guest]: your MP is an unknown entity and a non-political heavyweight, no one's going to listen to him.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.520
[Guest]: And there is no actual authority. It is all based on the aura and the image. So it made

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:09.320
[Guest]: sense. Politics, I realised, is something that affects the country disproportionately

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.400
[Guest]: and disproportionately because it's not the most important thing in the country at all.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.980
[Guest]: My personal belief system working in politics and in the parliament is that the country

01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:24.800
[Guest]: that does the best on the whole, economically, socially, on human development, are countries

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:30.640
[Guest]: where politics matters less and less. The more valuable a nation's political posts are,

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.800
[Guest]: the worse off it is in all indicators of human development and all indicators of economic

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:41.040
[Guest]: development. In India, politics is disproportionately important and it occupies a central theme

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.600
[Guest]: in people's conversation. It's essentially like cricket, Bollywood and politics. And

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:49.760
[Guest]: politics is more universal than the other two. Because of this, I felt it's an important

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.760
[Guest]: area to be involved in. What I realised was being in policy, I would always be someone

01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:03.000
[Guest]: who's like creating research, creating reports, and then anyone above me would not do much

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:09.640
[Guest]: with it. So it's a very low impact field and low impact things are in general, quite frustrating

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:15.420
[Guest]: in life for everyone. I realised that the highest impact space was actually working

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:20.600
[Guest]: in direct politics, where one, it's a short turnaround time. So whatever you do shows

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:25.920
[Guest]: its results in eight months, nine months. You're not waiting for, say, a five-year thing

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.360
[Guest]: because you're working on different states, different elections. So whatever you've done

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:34.320
[Guest]: now, you'll know if it's been a success or not within nine months. That was the first

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:39.560
[Guest]: incentive. The second incentive was that I believed, so did a lot of people who joined

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:44.200
[Guest]: CAG before me and a lot of people who were in IPAC, is that once you help a politician

01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:49.520
[Guest]: win an election, you will have some say in governance and policy, and you will be able

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:55.120
[Guest]: to shape at least some of the things in the right direction. It's not been the case largely

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:59.760
[Guest]: for any entity in India. I think the person who's come the closest is actually Prashant

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:04.000
[Guest]: Kishore. He tried a couple of times in a couple of different states, also got Bihar Vikas

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.600
[Guest]: Mission made in Bihar, which was supposed to be a developmental entity, created a company

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:13.760
[Guest]: called Citizens Alliance to do this entire work, tried to get people embedded in Mamta

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:19.480
[Guest]: Banerjee's cabinet offices, like young consultants within the political setup, tried earlier

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:25.400
[Guest]: with the BJP after the 2014 elections, because of which he largely exited out of the BJP.

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:31.600
[Guest]: So it's been a theme. He came the closest and did not succeed. I also believe that I

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:39.680
[Guest]: would have at least some say in policymaking. Largely not the case. Winning elections is

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:45.260
[Guest]: very different from governance. As soon as an election is won, people realize the utility

01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:49.760
[Guest]: of all of the work that you did, but it will not translate into anything like happening

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.920
[Guest]: towards development. The prime example that I have of this, we do electoral surveys, and

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.720
[Guest]: we do really granular surveys at the village level and the district level. We know what

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:05.840
[Guest]: the biggest demand is in, say, a panchayat. So we will know that this bridge is not being

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.560
[Guest]: built, it's impacting 1,800 people of this region, and 43% of the people want this done.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:16.120
[Guest]: So really granular data like that. And we compile it into an app, which is essentially

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:20.960
[Guest]: listing literally panchayat-wise what the biggest three issues are. And this happens

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:26.880
[Guest]: for an entire constituency and an entire state. My expectation after a lot of the elections

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:31.720
[Guest]: was that the political party and the CM will go through this. And my belief was, if he

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:38.560
[Guest]: fixes even one of these top three problems, everyone's going to support him. No one goes

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:42.520
[Guest]: back to that data. We realized very early on that no one's looked at the app again.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:47.240
[Guest]: Once the elections won, the attention shifted to a completely different part. The same exercise

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:51.080
[Guest]: and the same data collection will happen again before the next election, where they'll promise

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:56.960
[Guest]: when they go there, they will tell you exactly, I am the chief minister or I am the prime

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:02.600
[Guest]: minister, and I still know about this nala in this tiny little hamlet of 300 people.

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.520
[Guest]: And people will be really impressed that this man pays so much attention that he knows about

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:13.200
[Guest]: a nala in this tiny hamlet. Except it's all data that's collected for that election. After

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.520
[Guest]: the election, no one opens it again. So very sad, but also helped me shape the decision

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:25.200
[Guest]: that I don't want to be in the policy content creation space, which is also like a space

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.880
[Guest]: in general where you can write about policies. I decided to be in direct electoral politics.

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.800
[Guest]: Still do the political campaigning work, which allows you to create some amount of impact

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.480
[Guest]: in who comes to power. What this translates into, I'm still uncertain. So like you asked

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:46.440
[Guest]: about what the trajectory is in life. It would be direct electoral politics, but it would

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:51.280
[Guest]: only be direct electoral politics like 15, 20 years down the line. The reason for that

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.240
[Guest]: is that I personally know how difficult politics is one and I know how expensive politics is.

01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.900
[Guest]: And third of all, I also understand that once you are in it, you can't exit out. Like if

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.440
[Guest]: you go into politics and then you come out, take a break for like three years, then you

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:08.440
[Guest]: go back into politics. That's not going to work. It's not like a regular career where

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:13.640
[Guest]: you can try out a startup and then apply it to your next job. If you do this in and out

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:18.440
[Guest]: even once, you are done for. It's very easy to get branded as a non-serious politician.

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.000
[Guest]: So win or lose, you stay in the constituency, you keep fighting it out, and you present

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.240
[Guest]: yourself as the next in line. So you have to be the alternate. And whenever the people

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:33.480
[Guest]: get frustrated with the incumbent, you're going to come into power. Every decent political

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:38.880
[Guest]: party and every politician who's come into power has stayed as the opposition for a decently

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.600
[Amit Varma]: long period of time.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.600
[Amit Varma]: You're describing it like Hotel California, you can check out, but you can never leave.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.220
[Amit Varma]: And the correlation you drew earlier is interesting, where you said that where there is too much

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:52.680
[Amit Varma]: politics, those countries tend to be the least developed. And I would say that both of those,

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.740
[Amit Varma]: both too much politics and too little development actually comes from the same cause, which

01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.760
[Amit Varma]: is the state being too powerful. Because if the state is too powerful, then obviously

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.880
[Amit Varma]: the incentive for people to join politics is to become part of that gravy chain, they're

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:13.040
[Amit Varma]: attracted to power and money and not to service as it were, or, you know, whatever else. And

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.360
[Amit Varma]: equally, you know, it's underdeveloped because the state is just not letting, you know, people

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:22.820
[Amit Varma]: flourish. It's got its finger in every pie. It leads to a rent-seeking mentality rather

01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:29.320
[Amit Varma]: than a profit-seeking mentality. And it's a mess all around. So now at this point, you

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:33.160
[Amit Varma]: kind of decide that, okay, I'm going to, you know, get into the thick of things, you join

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Prashant Kishore's political consultancy, and you go to Punjab for the Punjab elections

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:45.120
[Amit Varma]: to help Amrindar Singh. And it's really interesting because I have thought of Amrindar Singh over

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.020
[Amit Varma]: the last three or four years as everyone has as captain. But you point out that that was

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:53.780
[Amit Varma]: actually a brand makeover, which to some extent you guys were responsible for that because

01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:58.760
[Amit Varma]: he was earlier like a Maharaja, he was an elite out of touch with the people. And you

01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:04.040
[Amit Varma]: guys did a complete brand makeover, which is essentially also what politics is entirely

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:09.000
[Amit Varma]: about. So tell me a little bit about that you dive into it, you go to Chandigarh, there

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.520
[Amit Varma]: is this bungalow which has been given by a supporter. And that's where you have to work.

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:19.360
[Amit Varma]: What is that sort of experience like? And what are the interesting things that you learn,

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, over your first few days there and then just over the whole process?

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:30.280
[Guest]: So once we are there, we actually do some surveys on the ground, we assess what Amrindar

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:35.240
[Guest]: Singh's image is. And at that point of time, he is actually known as Maharaj. And that

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:43.400
[Guest]: is what people call him. This captain phenomenon is entirely something that got built in 2016-17.

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:49.600
[Guest]: And it stuck so well, because all the branding was centered around it. So once there were

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:54.480
[Guest]: a couple of problems that came out in surveys and focus group discussions. So how this works

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:58.760
[Guest]: is that you do on ground surveys where there are like quantitative questions, but you also

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:04.840
[Guest]: do focus groups, where you call say, youth between the age group of 18 and 25 of different

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:10.440
[Guest]: caste groups, you take their feedback on a lot of issues, then you call say women take

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:14.240
[Guest]: their feedback. And you see how different demographic groups, different caste groups

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.600
[Guest]: are reacting to the same questions. You assess what groups you are strong in what groups

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.280
[Guest]: you are weak in, you do an analysis like that. So we realized there were three universal

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:27.560
[Guest]: problems. The first universal problem was obviously the image that lazy Maharaja doesn't

01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:32.960
[Guest]: do anything. That was the first part of it. The second one was that he doesn't visit constituencies

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:39.840
[Guest]: at all. And anytime that he's won, he's become inaccessible to the people entirely. And the

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:47.520
[Guest]: third one was basically around his like Maharaja's properties, which had been like taken over

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.320
[Guest]: in general. Now he was trying to get it back, he had loans, then he tried to pay loans,

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:56.680
[Guest]: and he was going to be extremely corrupt to get his properties out. So these three themes

01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:01.640
[Guest]: kind of interrelated, but a lot of people in Punjab knew about these. What weren't issues

01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:06.600
[Guest]: was also very surprising to me, a lot of personal issues Punjab politicians did not care about

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:12.800
[Guest]: at all. Like, you can have affairs, no one cares about that in Punjab politics. A politician

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:16.520
[Guest]: could do drugs as much as he wanted. No one cared about that in Punjab politics. You could

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:20.520
[Guest]: be a public drunk, no one cared about that, which was very different from like UP and

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:28.600
[Guest]: Bihar politics for me, because like the overt display of morality is a very UP-Bihar thing.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:34.040
[Guest]: So yeah, after realizing these things, the team got together, decided on, okay, how do

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.000
[Guest]: we fix all of this? The first one, it was decided that, okay, like he was a captain

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.880
[Guest]: in the Indian Army, there is a lot of respect for the Indian Army, you brand him into Captain

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:46.160
[Guest]: Amrindar Singh from Maharaj Amrindar Singh. Multiple things happened for that. The second

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.880
[Guest]: one, a campaign was started called Halkevich Captain. It was announced that Halka is an

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:56.280
[Guest]: assembly constituency in Punjab. It was announced that he would visit all 117 assembly constituencies

01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:02.120
[Guest]: of Punjab and collect people's problems. So people would give him problems in writing.

02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:06.920
[Guest]: And then within 100 days of forming the government, he'll create a task force that will go through

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:12.760
[Guest]: all of these problems and find a solution for them. And the third one, when it came

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:17.720
[Guest]: to like corruption in cases and this and that, an aggressive captain was something that we

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:22.480
[Guest]: realized would be a positive image, where he speaks up against social issues, against

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:27.920
[Guest]: fake FIRs filed against corruption. So a campaign was launched for that. But the first one,

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.960
[Guest]: the Captain Amrindar Singh, the rebranding was by far the most successful thing that

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:39.240
[Guest]: was done in Punjab. And the campaign itself was essentially Captain Di Sarkar. Ki Chanda

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:45.800
[Guest]: Hai Punjab, Captain Di Sarkar. It wasn't even Amrindar Singh anywhere. So music, the movies

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:50.160
[Guest]: that were made, all of the advertisement that came in newspapers and TVs, all of that focused

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.700
[Guest]: upon that. So I definitely realized the value of branding, but it also reinforced my belief

02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:01.320
[Guest]: in collecting data and information. Because once you have data and ground feedback, and

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:05.840
[Guest]: once you know how each demographic is voting and you know which demographic group is where

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:12.600
[Guest]: in a constituency, you can create campaigns to address issues. Most politicians in the

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:18.040
[Guest]: country actually fail at the first level. And that was my takeaway even in 2019. Like

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:24.080
[Guest]: looking at the elections, the Congress Party lost, largely because they did not even recognize

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.280
[Guest]: what issue the election was being fought. Like they talked about Nyaya, but they never

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.760
[Guest]: assessed who was hearing it. So the CSDS has also collected data on it. More rich taxpayers

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.920
[Guest]: who would be paying for Nyaya heard about it than people who would be beneficiaries.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:44.840
[Guest]: If you look at something like Rafale, they did not accept that it wasn't working. Multiple

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.600
[Guest]: reasons that it wasn't. It wasn't actually Rahul Gandhi's fault. It was also local politicians

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:53.120
[Guest]: within the Congress did not believe in these campaigns. So they weren't popularizing them.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:58.440
[Guest]: Congress MP candidates, MLA candidates have never popularized these schemes. It has largely

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:03.920
[Guest]: just been the Gandhi family who's talked about it. Election itself, though, was being fought

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:10.680
[Guest]: on Modi's image. It was being fought on the Hindu pride theme, on the developmental model

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:16.400
[Guest]: of Narendra Modi and on the Balakota strikes and like the strength that the nation showed.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.680
[Guest]: So without dismantling these key pillars on which the election was being fought, or creating

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:28.080
[Guest]: new pillars entirely, you couldn't counter the campaign. Whatever you did was just on

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.160
[Guest]: a tangent, which did not affect the election results at all. So yeah, in Punjab, the branding

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:40.880
[Guest]: was so overpowering, that whatever else anyone else did was not impacting the votes at all.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.040
[Amit Varma]: What you also described really well, when you write about your Punjab experience is

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.920
[Amit Varma]: how much of it has to do with event management. Like number one, you write that developmental

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.840
[Amit Varma]: activity interactions with constituents, politicians look at them as a way to build their brand.

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:58.960
[Amit Varma]: So the event per se, whatever it's for the proximate reason doesn't really matter. You're

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.560
[Amit Varma]: building your brand, everything has to be focused on that. You also had another great

02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:08.600
[Amit Varma]: slogan coffee with captain, which is a bit like chai pe charcha. I saw that and I immediately

02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.120
[Amit Varma]: thought okay talk show man, he should now that he's out of politics, he should just

02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.480
[Amit Varma]: do a podcast coffee with captain. You know, Navjot Siddhu can be his first guest and he

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: can poison his coffee or something. And also your own sort of excellence in this this department

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.800
[Amit Varma]: like you're overseeing an operation where you know, there are autos with sound systems

02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.360
[Amit Varma]: and banners going from village to village. And of course, your particular speciality,

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.940
[Amit Varma]: I don't know why they don't call you poster boy of just, you know, getting posters plastered

02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:42.740
[Amit Varma]: all over the villages and towns and constituencies of Punjab. You were apparently an expert in

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:48.240
[Amit Varma]: preparing Lai or Leti, which apparently is that thing you prepare with which, you know,

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.360
[Amit Varma]: once you stick it, you can't take the poster off, you know, half the wall only will scrape

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:57.080
[Amit Varma]: off if you try to take the poster off. So how did you kind of discover that and also

02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.760
[Amit Varma]: what happens is that foreign educated kids come back to India, they don't want to do

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.640
[Amit Varma]: this kind of, you know, manual shit, of course, they want to go to the grassroots, but they

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:12.760
[Amit Varma]: want to collect data and, you know, may draw intellectual conclusions, but you were out

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.880
[Amit Varma]: there getting your hands dirty. So tell me a little bit about that. Was it an enjoyable

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:25.160
[Amit Varma]: process? You know, and also, is there a similar enthusiasm in that across party ranks? Like,

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.200
[Amit Varma]: do party workers go through the motions or are there innovative things being tried out

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.000
[Amit Varma]: all the time? And once you have one vision, that listen, this is our brand, we are talking

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.360
[Amit Varma]: about issue X and not issue, you know, ABC, and that we got to stay on message and all

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:44.960
[Amit Varma]: of that. How easy is it to kind of then bring that kind of discipline within the party,

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:48.480
[Amit Varma]: especially as an outsider?

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:54.240
[Guest]: So the extremely interesting experience of had never prepared lie in my life before,

02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:59.360
[Guest]: but this was the first Hulkevich. What is the formula? What is the formula? So it's

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:05.240
[Guest]: actually made out of aata. So what you do is that you heat up water essentially, and

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:10.360
[Guest]: then you make a paste out of aata. What this does is that once you pasted it on, if you

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:13.640
[Guest]: pull it off, it's just going to pull off like one tiny layer, it's not going to pull off

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:17.600
[Guest]: the entire poster. So like, it's going to literally involve scraping up the entire wall

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.840
[Guest]: if you want it off. Very old preparation in politics. But obviously, we were political

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:28.640
[Guest]: consultants, we weren't political karekarta, so we hadn't done it. So we decided that okay,

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.000
[Guest]: posters need to be planted because the entire town was looking very bland. And this was

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.200
[Guest]: the first Hulkevich captain. So it had to look extremely grand. And it had to look that

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.360
[Guest]: like captain had come here, because he's going to meet like what 5000 6000 people in an assembly

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:47.880
[Guest]: constituency. How do the rest of the people know that he came to this constituency? The

02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:53.560
[Guest]: right way to do it was one autos with speakers across the constituency blasting that he's

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.840
[Guest]: going to come here on this date that happened. But once the autos leave, how do people remember?

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:03.440
[Guest]: And that's where these small posters come in. Big hoardings are there on like main highways,

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:06.920
[Guest]: but like most people don't see it every day. The only thing that reaches like internal

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:11.840
[Guest]: villages are these like stickers and posters. So obviously had to happen. We called up Chandigarh

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:17.240
[Guest]: and ordered these posters, the graphic design part and like the data part is actually easy.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:22.400
[Guest]: It is the logistics of elections that is actually the complicated part. So the posters came

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:27.800
[Guest]: very late. The people that we'd actually gotten together to paste the posters, they were willing

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.600
[Guest]: to like just run away by then. Very interesting story on how we kept them there. They were

02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:36.240
[Guest]: like, essentially like auto drivers and truck drivers to take us around some youth congress

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.840
[Guest]: karakartas. So the youth congress karakartas were obviously there because they saw it as

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:44.640
[Guest]: a job. And also like Punjab is one of those states where like the BJYM and youth congress

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:50.520
[Guest]: karakartas all come from extremely rich families. So to post posters at night, they would bring

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:55.560
[Guest]: an Audi and a BMW. So they are chilling in their Audi's waiting there for like the posters

02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:00.480
[Guest]: to arrive. But the labour at that point of time was just willing to run away. They were

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:04.880
[Guest]: like, we don't even want money. Forget this. We waited here for three hours. We are not

02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:10.680
[Guest]: doing it. And in a situation like this, you realise that you have to do something. So

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:15.840
[Guest]: we had this guy who went and talked to them and basically told them, what do you want?

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:20.040
[Guest]: So they realised that the good way to keep them there was to actually buy them like really

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.120
[Guest]: cheap alcohol so that all of them like sat there and got drunk by the time that posters

02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:30.880
[Guest]: came and they'd happily sit there. So he brings it and sits there. By that time, we've been

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:37.120
[Guest]: making Lahi as much as we can make in watts. And for that, like we hire a dhaba persons

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:42.280
[Guest]: cooking utensils. Someone from youth congress gets like the aata and all itself from his

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:48.440
[Guest]: house. So very funny situation. And they realise that we don't know what we are doing. So this

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:54.200
[Guest]: like dhaba person is like, bhai, kiya viya toh hai, tumne dikh raha hai. I'll help you.

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:58.560
[Guest]: And suddenly like this is the great thing about India in general. When you're completely

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.840
[Guest]: messing up and making a fool of yourself, random people come out from here and there

02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:06.720
[Guest]: and start helping you. So we had a lot of villagers come who are helping us make this

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:13.120
[Guest]: thing standing there at 8.30, 9 at night. Posters came by 12.30. We started pasting

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.040
[Guest]: them. And this entire process happens. And the event is a huge success. Everyone is very

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:24.280
[Guest]: happy. Prashant Kishore is very happy. What happens next really surprised me though. They

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:28.160
[Guest]: go to the next town for the next Thalkevich Captain event. I am not in charge of that

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:33.280
[Guest]: event at all. But suddenly, like the next town, people realise they have no idea how

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.280
[Guest]: to paste these posters. And they have no idea of how lie gets prepared. So they start calling

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.480
[Guest]: me up and I become the guy to ask for like the recipe of making this thing. So yeah,

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.880
[Guest]: obviously, like very different experience from like studying economics at the University

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:52.000
[Guest]: of Michigan. But again, very interesting experience. And this is essentially what the nation's

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.800
[Guest]: politics is. Data matters, information matters. The analysis that you can do matters, survey

02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:02.960
[Guest]: matters, everything matters. But if you are not able to go out to the ground, you're going

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:08.640
[Guest]: to fail. Whatever you might do at the narrative creation level will not translate till you

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.680
[Guest]: have this structure in place. So we all know that BJP has a very strong card. We also know

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:19.160
[Guest]: it has a huge social media presence, a huge data analytics team. It's very strong in controlling

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.800
[Guest]: the media and managing the larger narrative. But you see where the BJP is losing. If you

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.440
[Guest]: look at state elections since say 2018, then wherever there is a strong regional party,

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.720
[Guest]: the BJP has actually lost. So Maharashtra, it lost essentially because of an alliance.

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:41.240
[Guest]: But it also lost Madhya Pradesh. It also lost Rajasthan. It also lost Karnataka. It lost

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:46.920
[Guest]: West Bengal. So all of these states that it's been losing, it's happened because there is

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:52.960
[Guest]: a strong regional force over there, who's overpowered the card. So an election like

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:58.240
[Guest]: West Bengal, essentially Mamata Banerjee has so much larger of a carder within the state

02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:03.400
[Guest]: of West Bengal that the BJP carder cannot function to the same efficiency at all. So

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:06.520
[Guest]: even when they have the narrative control, if you looked at Delhi media, then everyone

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.200
[Guest]: was sure that BJP is going to sweep West Bengal. And I've written multiple Twitter threads

02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.840
[Guest]: telling people that this is not the reality on the ground. This is not the reality on

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:19.060
[Guest]: the ground. And it's just the media saying that the BJP is sweeping West Bengal. But

02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:23.720
[Guest]: that became the dominant narrative. Whoever you spoke to told you, oh, BJP is winning

02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:31.400
[Guest]: West Bengal. In some cases, these things become self-fulfilling prophecies. In this case,

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.840
[Guest]: though, it was very certain that it wouldn't become one just because TMC had such a strong

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.720
[Guest]: card on the ground. So their messaging and right now during the farmer protest, this

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:46.160
[Guest]: ties in very well with this, because I was talking to someone from Western UP. He's a

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:52.440
[Guest]: local leader type person in his village. And I was like, OK, BJP is circulating these WhatsApp

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.560
[Guest]: forwards. And they'd all seen these WhatsApp forwards. And he literally told me that whatever

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.360
[Guest]: you want to circulate, do it on WhatsApp. Here, at every corner, Tauji is spitting hookah

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:05.600
[Guest]: and explaining why the law is wrong. No amount of WhatsApp forwards can tackle Tauji with

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.640
[Guest]: a hookah. And I was completely sure that, OK, this makes absolute sense. And then I

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:15.240
[Guest]: went and talked to more people on the ground. Their understanding of why they are protesting

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:20.640
[Guest]: against the farm bill is much stronger than what's presented in, say, Delhi media or within

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:24.920
[Guest]: the community that's not an agricultural community or within other farmers who've never gotten

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:32.480
[Guest]: MSP. So yeah, on ground, Gada matters. So politics essentially is narrative, is data,

02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.120
[Guest]: is everything. But it is event management and building an organization. And that is

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:41.760
[Guest]: the tougher job, because you can hire people to do the data. You can hire people to do

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:47.320
[Guest]: the branding. You can hire big companies who create huge slogans for you, big branding

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:52.160
[Guest]: exercises. You can do all of that. But the Gada building is something that takes years

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:56.440
[Guest]: and years and years of effort. It is something that takes constant resources being pooled

02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:02.240
[Guest]: in. If you look at a political party, then the party has offices at every district, at

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:09.800
[Guest]: least. Some have committees at the booth level. To sustain a structure like that in a state

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:17.560
[Guest]: like, say, Uttar Pradesh, 80 MP constituencies, 404 assembly constituencies, 56,000 panchayats,

02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.120
[Guest]: the number of people it involves, the amount of resources it involves is just beyond comprehension

02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.200
[Guest]: for most people till they go and see it. Once they do go and see it, they realize, OK, running

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:34.440
[Guest]: a political party is such a difficult job that no one who wants anything for themselves

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.240
[Guest]: and knows any kind of skill would want to do it for personal success. So ultimately,

02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:43.360
[Guest]: it's going to be people who realize this is their best shot.

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. And that image of Tauji with a hookah is like so incredibly powerful. In

02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.280
[Amit Varma]: your next book, you should have Tauji with a hookah on the cover, please. And I'm also

02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:57.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of struck by just what a great metaphor Lai is. Like atta, which should be used for

02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.420
[Amit Varma]: feeding people, is instead used for sticking up posters to sell a narrative, which seems

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:08.120
[Amit Varma]: like an apt narrative to me. Another sort of interesting insight in this chapter, in

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.080
[Amit Varma]: your chapter on working with Amrindar Singh in Punjab on that particular campaign, was

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:17.400
[Amit Varma]: about brand building, which you've written a lot about. And at one point, you point out

02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.000
[Amit Varma]: very pithily that if you don't build your own brand, someone else will. And the example

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.940
[Amit Varma]: of that, of course, is Rahul Gandhi, who, you know, didn't build a strong enough brand

02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:31.440
[Amit Varma]: for himself. So the BJP built one for him, you know, with Pappu and this and that, and

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.520
[Amit Varma]: it kind of stuck, because he didn't do enough on that. And when, you know, he tried to return

02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.160
[Amit Varma]: the favour and talk about Modi being sootboot ki sarkar and all that, that didn't really

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:45.960
[Amit Varma]: stick so much, because the BJP was far better at narrative management. Now, at this point,

02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:51.320
[Amit Varma]: I have a broader question for you, which is that you start off getting interested in politics,

02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.440
[Amit Varma]: because you look at what's happening in the early 2010s, when India against corruption

02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.200
[Amit Varma]: comes and you see how messed up the system is. And you realise that there needs to be

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:05.480
[Amit Varma]: a change. Modi seems to represent that change. So you join the BJP in 2013. Then you do

02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.200
[Amit Varma]: the lamp fellowship where you are assigned to this other party that of course is not

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:13.040
[Amit Varma]: in your control. But then you join Prashant Kishore and now you're with the Congress.

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And then after this, of course, you go to the BJP and you work with Ram Madhav in the

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:22.620
[Amit Varma]: Northeast. And after that, you choose to leave the BJP for extremely well articulated reasons.

02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But during this period of time, when you're working as a political consultant, one day

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.880
[Amit Varma]: it's for BJP, one day it's for Congress, then it's back to BJP. Is there a sense of kind

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of cognitive dissonance in the sense that where you're looking at it is that I want

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:41.600
[Amit Varma]: to learn how politics works. So I will just focus on the process. And I won't overthink

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.280
[Amit Varma]: other issues. And let there be an implicit assumption that they're all the same. Anyway,

02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm here to do a job and to learn a skill. Or is there a point in time where you know,

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.720
[Amit Varma]: and that's exactly what seems to have happened in the case of your getting disillusioned

02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.200
[Amit Varma]: with the BJP, where you think that no, these principles matter, what these people stand

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:07.120
[Amit Varma]: for matter, what they deliver matters. And of course, we know that what you take to win

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.480
[Amit Varma]: elections, the narratives you build have nothing at all to do with governance. So completely

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:15.680
[Amit Varma]: different skills, which is why a party that is incredibly good at winning elections can

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.720
[Amit Varma]: be terrible at governance, which you know, we see all around us in practically every

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:24.920
[Amit Varma]: government that there is. So tell me a little bit about that internal process for you that

02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.680
[Amit Varma]: do you have misgivings? Do you ever sit back and think what are these kind of people that

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.740
[Amit Varma]: I'm working with? Do you feel that that kind of disengagement between the immediate proximate

02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:38.760
[Amit Varma]: project and the larger thing that's going on is sort of an issue for you?

02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:45.080
[Guest]: So there are two parts to it. The first part is that I believe as a citizen of a democracy,

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.520
[Guest]: you are not supposed to have a party that you belong to. As in as a voter, your job

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:56.460
[Guest]: is not to be like a loyal subject of a political party. Your job is to look at the choices

02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:01.760
[Guest]: and see who is going to be the best for the nation and for you at that point in time.

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:08.880
[Guest]: So these things transform pretty fast in general, like the Vajpayee Bharatiya Janata Party is

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:13.800
[Guest]: not the Bharatiya Janata Party under Narendra Modi. Like the Congress under Indira Gandhi

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:20.480
[Guest]: is not the Congress of today. So these things transform, the parties transform. A lot of

02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:25.320
[Guest]: people buy into this entire narrative of, okay, I belong to this political party. I

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:29.680
[Guest]: have always believed that I'm not supposed to belong to a political party. I'm supposed

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.680
[Guest]: to choose what is the best at that point of time. Whose leadership is the best? What does

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.600
[Guest]: the country require? Is the structure of the political party good enough to deliver on

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:46.800
[Guest]: what they say they are going to deliver? The second part of it is that working as a professional

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.280
[Guest]: in politics, you do tend to disengage from the politics of the political party itself.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.840
[Guest]: Important part in these campaigns for me was that I actually did really believe that the

02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:03.520
[Guest]: country required a change in 2014. A major part of that was also just the narrative that

02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:08.480
[Guest]: was built around all of us, and especially around me, that I did not realise how the

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:12.760
[Guest]: narrative was getting built. At that time, I had no experience in realising how these

02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.520
[Guest]: things happened. Now looking back at it, I can tell how a lot of things were structured,

02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:22.120
[Guest]: why a lot of different events happened, but at that point of time, like absolutely got

02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:28.400
[Guest]: taken in by that. Very similar thing in Punjab that I did support Captain Amrindar Singh

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:34.320
[Guest]: and Congress over the Akali Dal. A large part of it is the drug allegations, a part of it

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:40.600
[Guest]: is also the crony capitalism that happened in Punjab. So thankfully, I always was supporting

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:47.720
[Guest]: the side I've worked with. And that's been true till date. But very honestly, even if

02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:52.560
[Guest]: there is a side that I did not completely like buy into politically, I would probably

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:57.100
[Guest]: still do my best to provide like whatever data they needed, whatever support they needed,

02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:03.480
[Guest]: if they were a client. So that amount of disconnect does exist there, even though it's not like

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:11.860
[Guest]: come into play as of right now. Very interesting part between being a professional in politics

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:18.120
[Guest]: and actually being in politics is that you get to make this distinction. You are helping

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:22.200
[Guest]: someone when you are helping someone come to power, but you are someone who's providing

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:26.640
[Guest]: like one particular set of service. A lot of political consultants go out and claim

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:31.160
[Guest]: that they helped this party win and like the party won because of them. I have never found

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:36.600
[Guest]: this to be the case for anyone. A lot of people contribute into a political process coming

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.000
[Guest]: together and a party winning. And you are like as anyone, no matter how big you are,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.720
[Guest]: you are a part of the process and a cog in the wheel. You'd only be able to do it very

02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:53.280
[Guest]: well if you truly believe in that moment that you're doing the right thing. I've found in

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:57.400
[Guest]: my life, at least there are very few people, even in politics, who can do the wrong thing

02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.240
[Guest]: while believing it's the wrong thing. Most of them do the wrong things, but they believe

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:05.800
[Guest]: they're doing the right thing or doing it for the right reason. So that self-justification

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:11.720
[Guest]: exists within all of us, including me for every project that I've worked on. But yes,

02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:16.360
[Guest]: overarching belief still remains that you're not supposed to be the supporter of any political

02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:19.880
[Guest]: party. You're supposed to decide who's best at that moment.

02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:23.840
[Amit Varma]: So that's, you know, I love the part of your answer about how in a democracy, you should

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:29.360
[Amit Varma]: never be a bhakta of one party, as it were. Like, you know, I always keep saying that,

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, my loyalties lie to my principles. And from those principles will flow support

02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:38.680
[Amit Varma]: for particular policies or whatever. And I'm not tribal in that sense. So it might seem

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:42.680
[Amit Varma]: like I am saying something good about a particular party one day and bad about the particular

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.840
[Amit Varma]: party the next day. But it's simply that I'm going on the basis of those principles or

02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:52.440
[Amit Varma]: those policies and all of that. While I think too much of politics in India has become incredibly

02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:57.440
[Amit Varma]: tribal where people get into these hardened positions, where everything that for example,

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:01.400
[Amit Varma]: the Modi government does is either right for one set of people or wrong for another set

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:06.640
[Amit Varma]: of people. And there can be no exceptions at all. And that simply doesn't make any sense

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.600
[Amit Varma]: to me. So I found that quite resonant. Now that the interesting part of your journey

02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:16.000
[Amit Varma]: is like, where you point out your realization that political consultants are doing the same

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.440
[Amit Varma]: for themselves, what they are doing for their parties, they're building a narrative, they're

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:23.680
[Amit Varma]: crafting an image that isn't entirely true. And you point out that what you know, Prashant

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Kishore's gang was really good at was event management and PR, but they weren't really

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:32.480
[Amit Varma]: making a greater difference in that which kind of disillusioned you when you said that

02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:37.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, to hell with this political consultants, like many people think of management consultants,

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:41.360
[Amit Varma]: perhaps, I don't know with how much justification, but these consultants are just paid too much

02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:44.680
[Amit Varma]: money at one point in your book, you point out that they would take crores for a job

02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:51.480
[Amit Varma]: that the parties figured out would only take lakhs. And you decided to actually jump into

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:57.520
[Amit Varma]: working within a party itself. So tell me about how that came about and where that took

02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:58.960
[Guest]: you next.

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:04.600
[Guest]: So yes, my personal belief system is that eventually every party will have to do everything

02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:10.480
[Guest]: a political consultant does in-house. This entire space of political consultancy is a

02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:15.200
[Guest]: dangerous space in a way, because they work for one party, they collect all of the data

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:21.640
[Guest]: from within that party and for that party, and then they retain it till the next elections.

02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:26.640
[Guest]: And there is no guarantee that they will not switch sides. It's not some sort of a cult

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:30.960
[Guest]: state where like, you're not ever allowed to leave. If you look at most political consultants,

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:35.000
[Guest]: they have worked with multiple political parties, and sometimes multiple political parties in

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.360
[Guest]: the state over like same state over two different elections. So things like that have made me

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:48.360
[Guest]: very sure that the field itself will not last very long. It's a blip in the democratic setup.

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:53.080
[Guest]: Eventually, there will be political consultants, but they're going to be employees of the political

02:21:53.080 --> 02:22:00.560
[Guest]: party itself. So after this realisation, and after realising that my interest in it wasn't

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.280
[Guest]: to become like some famous consultant who manages elections, I actually wanted to do

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:09.800
[Guest]: political things. I actually wanted to make policy difference. And I actually wanted to

02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:13.800
[Guest]: make like differences within the party structure, the party hierarchy. And I realised that the

02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:17.760
[Guest]: right way to do this was to work with like a big party leader and like work on a state

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:23.840
[Guest]: election as someone who is heading the state campaign. A big part of this also was that

02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:28.760
[Guest]: when I moved to the North East and started working with BJP, I was heading a lot of the

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:34.040
[Guest]: operations within IPAC, I was still like a pretty junior consultant. So that opportunity

02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:39.760
[Guest]: made sense in the sense of like doing more broader work for a political party doing more

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:43.760
[Guest]: intensive data work, because that is what BJP was also looking for and what I wanted

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:50.560
[Guest]: to do. So made this switch. I resigned from IPAC. By that time, I had this offer to move

02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:56.040
[Guest]: to Manipur and just start working on that one state election campaign. And this was

02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:00.620
[Guest]: the National General Secretary, Ram Madhavji, heading that entire campaign for that state.

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:06.920
[Guest]: So moved there, actually spent like two days in Delhi, packed up and headed down to Manipur.

02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:12.960
[Guest]: Spent a good eight months there. Extremely interesting experience. I still sometimes

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:18.560
[Guest]: remark on how much easier it is to work for the BJP than to work against the BJP. A couple

02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:25.160
[Guest]: of reasons for that. Now that the entire intelligence agencies after you think has come about and

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:29.640
[Guest]: is public, that is definitely a part of it. While working for the opposition, you do feel

02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:35.080
[Guest]: some amount of pressure. But more than that, it is just the resource difference. Working

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.720
[Guest]: for the BJP, you can literally like get a helicopter requisition and go to a different

02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:47.640
[Guest]: state the same day. No one asks you much. Our hotel bills, no one ever questioned anything.

02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:51.920
[Guest]: So for a lot of karakartas, they did. They never for us. So a lot of karakartas used

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:57.240
[Guest]: to come to our hotel room to order their food. So just things like that, very tiny little

02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:03.880
[Guest]: things. You want 10 cars going somewhere, you will get 10 cars. You want some data collected

02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:09.920
[Guest]: from somewhere, that data will get collected. So BJP that way, much stronger party. The

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:17.800
[Guest]: ground carder also like a lot of people believe in the social cause of it, the social cause

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:22.560
[Guest]: of Hindutva enough that they would spend more energy on it without looking for an immediate

02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.160
[Guest]: return. They will like any human being want recognition of their contribution. They will

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.720
[Guest]: want party leaders to know about it. They will want you to talk them up. But that is

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:37.920
[Guest]: all it will take for them to like do a lot more than other political parties, karakartas.

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:43.160
[Guest]: And a lot of parties had this. It's not like BJP is the only one. A lot of state parties,

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.240
[Guest]: a lot of regional parties have a very dedicated carder, especially within caste groups. If

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.520
[Guest]: it's a caste-based party, if you look at someone like the Shiv Sena has an extremely

02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:56.640
[Guest]: strong carder. Mamata Banerjee has an extremely strong carder. DMK that way probably has a

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:02.600
[Guest]: stronger carder than BJP within the state. So these carders exist at the regional level.

02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:08.760
[Guest]: It's just at the national level that you realize it's so much easier working for the BJP.

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Really fascinating. And a quick aside, since you mentioned Mamata a few times, I was just

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.720
[Amit Varma]: chatting with a friend in the know a couple of days back. And he told me that Sourav Ganguly

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.640
[Amit Varma]: is in a massive vidam bana now. Because on the one hand, during his career, he was kind

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.680
[Amit Varma]: of helped by Mamata at different points, I believe he got land for his academy and all

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:29.920
[Amit Varma]: of that which the government gives. So he can't mess with her. She's extremely powerful

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:34.720
[Amit Varma]: in Calcutta. And in fact, in Bengal, I mean, someone told me that BJP may not have a carder

02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:39.440
[Amit Varma]: there anymore, because you're getting knocked off, which is a fascinating kind of reason

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.560
[Amit Varma]: and might be a little exaggerated, but rings a little true as well. But apparently, the

02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.400
[Amit Varma]: BJP has been after Sourav to join them because he's exactly the kind of face that they need

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:51.360
[Amit Varma]: in Bengal. And he can't do that because he doesn't want to piss Mamata off. So there

02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:55.520
[Amit Varma]: was in fact, a rumor that he faked his heart attack recently, because he just wanted to

02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:59.960
[Amit Varma]: get away from having to take a decision. And of course, he's, you know, he's the president

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.640
[Amit Varma]: of the BCCI, but Amit Shah's son basically runs the whole thing. So it's quite hilarious.

02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:09.980
[Amit Varma]: And for someone who's, who was a pretty political animal in his cricketing days, in the sense

02:26:09.980 --> 02:26:14.040
[Amit Varma]: of political within the cricketing world, I know plenty of people who are feeling a

02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:19.680
[Amit Varma]: little bit of schadenfreude at this mess that he's found himself in. But that's sort of

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:26.000
[Amit Varma]: a digression. I found that chapter on your time in Manipur extremely fascinating. And

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.720
[Amit Varma]: one of the great insights there for me was when you quote what one of the IPAC directors

02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:36.760
[Amit Varma]: told you at one point in time, Rishi Raj Singh, when you were in Punjab, he told you that,

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, working with the party, the party workers and all of that, he'd said, quote,

02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.960
[Amit Varma]: it's like the army, not the traffic police, stop quote. Elaborate on that a bit because

02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:53.200
[Guest]: this was a TIL for me. So the interesting component of being a political worker is that

02:26:53.200 --> 02:27:01.280
[Guest]: you have to be on standby for most of your engagement. It's not a daily job. Like as

02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:05.440
[Guest]: a traffic police, what you do is that you stand at a traffic signal and you direct traffic

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.880
[Guest]: every day. You are telling cars when to stop, when to go. And that is a constant thing.

02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:13.000
[Guest]: You're doing it day in and day out. And you're doing it the entire year whenever you are

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.920
[Guest]: on duty. On the other hand, a political karakarta is someone who is in essentially like in the

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.000
[Guest]: army where you are training, where you are doing random exercises, you are doing random

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.560
[Guest]: things and you're waiting for the election period to come about. There is nothing for

02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.200
[Guest]: a karakarta to do for four years and three months. It's literally a nine month engagement

02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:40.440
[Guest]: that starts like or maximum of one year engagement. That's about it. So four years, you're disengaged

02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:44.920
[Guest]: four years. You are doing your own thing, whatever you want. One year before the elections,

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.920
[Guest]: you get activated, but you have to maintain this kardar like the army needs to maintain

02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:57.400
[Guest]: a troop. You are paying everyone's salaries. You're keeping them engaged. So what happens

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:03.480
[Guest]: in the army is that when a new general comes about, they make their entire troop do some

02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.600
[Guest]: random exercises. It's literally things like, I don't know if you remember, but Narendra

02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.840
[Guest]: Modi also did this when he came for the first time in 2014. He was like, oh, we are going

02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.240
[Guest]: to clean up all the government offices. We're going to clean up all the files. So you had

02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:20.680
[Guest]: visuals on TV where government officers were cleaning up all of their cupboards and cleaning

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:26.120
[Guest]: up the government offices. These are something that in politics we call engagement modules

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:32.120
[Guest]: because a lot of times there isn't any real work to be done. But if you don't give people

02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:35.760
[Guest]: work, they become so disengaged that it's very difficult to get them back and get them

02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:41.520
[Guest]: to start doing work. So you create fake work for them. And that fake work is essentially

02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:45.360
[Guest]: just for their engagement. It's not doing anything to make you win an election. And

02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:51.080
[Guest]: if you know anything about the army, a large part of commanding in the army is actually

02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:56.120
[Guest]: keeping the troops busy in non-deployment periods in peacetime. You have people with

02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:02.760
[Guest]: you on an army base in an area that is not under threat for most of their careers, but

02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:07.000
[Guest]: they still need to stay fit. They need to stay active. They need to keep exercising.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.080
[Guest]: But more than any of that, they need to not be bored and they need to be engaged. And

02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:17.640
[Guest]: this insight I found to actually be invaluable because if you drop the engagement, if you

02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.920
[Guest]: don't keep them busy, when you do require them, you're going to find it extremely difficult

02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:23.480
[Guest]: to get them back on the job.

02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's interesting. And you know, it must be leading to that classic problem where

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:33.480
[Amit Varma]: party workers realize that they are in an engagement module, that the work they are

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.000
[Amit Varma]: doing is completely meaningless. Why the hell am I doing this? Elections are three years

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.120
[Amit Varma]: away. I'm sitting and doing whatever the hell it is. Whatever, I guess elections are motivation

02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:43.520
[Guest]: enough and they do come about.

02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:48.000
[Guest]: No, so good. Good part about that is that most party karakartas realize that this is

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.720
[Guest]: what their internal assessments are based on. If they are active during this, the leadership

02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:59.920
[Guest]: will recognize them. So, interesting side parallel to this. So, Mulayam Singh Yadav,

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:05.480
[Guest]: when he used to be active in Uttar Pradesh and Mayawati's government was in power, every

02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:11.320
[Guest]: month he used to do a statewide agitation on some issue or the other. And he really

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:15.000
[Guest]: did not care what the issue was. It could be something related to teachers. It could

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.240
[Guest]: be something related to pensions. It could be something related to bad roads. It could

02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:24.400
[Guest]: be related to a corruption issue. It just did not matter. But on a monthly basis, he

02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:30.200
[Guest]: announced a statewide thing. And the entire concept was to get the kardar out. And the

02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:34.320
[Guest]: entire concept was just to like, for the kardar to know that, okay, the party exists, the

02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:39.840
[Guest]: party is busy, and the party is doing something to come back to power. So don't go away, stay

02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:45.000
[Guest]: in there. And I believe like this is a major lesson to be learned by like, say the Congress

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.920
[Guest]: party in the country right now, most of the kardar for the Congress, especially in the

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:52.880
[Guest]: states that I've worked in, doesn't know what they're supposed to be doing, they feel disengaged,

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:56.920
[Guest]: they feel like there is no direction in the party. So the party needs to strategize the

02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:59.960
[Guest]: creation of random work for them to be engaged.

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating, random work, which could be anything at all. You know, one party should give an

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:09.160
[Amit Varma]: instruction to all these karyakartas that your work is to listen to Amit Verma's podcast,

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:13.520
[Amit Varma]: and we will ask you questions from it. And that's how you will be assessed. No, not happening

02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.480
[Amit Varma]: anytime soon. Now, what's interesting about this little experiment, when you go down to

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Manipur, is that there are basically two people, you and Rajat Sethi, who was from Harvard

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:27.960
[Amit Varma]: and who had managed Assam for them earlier, who were kind of parachuted into the whole

02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:31.600
[Amit Varma]: party machinery over there to look after things. But it was basically you because Rajat you

02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:35.800
[Amit Varma]: said would like come once in a while. But otherwise, you were actually living there,

02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:40.160
[Amit Varma]: and you were on the job. And immediately, you started doing all kinds of professional

02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:45.080
[Amit Varma]: things like you say, you've written here quote, we hired a team of graphic designers, cartoonists

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:49.280
[Amit Varma]: and other campaign staff to manage the BJP social media for the next few months. We took

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:53.320
[Amit Varma]: control of all the party's official social media accounts from the local IT cell and

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:57.720
[Amit Varma]: started managing them from our office. We also got a few SIM cards and started making

02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:01.880
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp groups from the database of numbers that we were provided. Now, at an earlier

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:07.120
[Amit Varma]: point in time, you've also spoken about the data work that you did out there. Now, this

02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:10.800
[Amit Varma]: is really getting fascinating that you're out there, you're moving into areas which

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:15.680
[Amit Varma]: all the other party workers who see you perhaps as an interloper or an outsider or whatever,

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: they've never done, they don't get what's going on. But you realize that this is it,

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:25.640
[Amit Varma]: this is so incredibly critical. And as you point out what the BJP did, in terms of reaching

02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:30.240
[Amit Varma]: out through WhatsApp and Facebook and Twitter, and the micro targeting that you did, the

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:35.520
[Amit Varma]: way that you use data, the way that you use WhatsApp was what made the difference. Because

02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:41.680
[Amit Varma]: your opponent just used the traditional old school things that they know, but you managed

02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:46.800
[Amit Varma]: to do a lot more. So take me through sort of what was your thinking when you go out

02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:51.960
[Amit Varma]: there? How do you even strategize? And then what are the techniques you choose? Why do

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:55.680
[Amit Varma]: you think they will be effective? Why are they effective? What are the learnings from

02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:58.000
[Guest]: the whole process?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:04.160
[Guest]: So in politics, there are two parts to getting your message out. One is crafting the message.

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:09.000
[Guest]: The other part is creating a distribution channel. So both of these things need to happen

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:14.080
[Guest]: simultaneously. And your winning elections is dependent on it, because this is how you

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:17.840
[Guest]: shape reality for your voters. This is how you tell them why the other side is bad and

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:22.920
[Guest]: you are good. The first part of what your message should be is based on surveys and

02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:27.360
[Guest]: focus groups, and the collection of people's problems and data and like weaknesses of the

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:32.480
[Guest]: other candidate. So that is happening on one side. On the second side, what you need to

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:36.040
[Guest]: do, you might have the best message, but if you can't take it to the right people, then

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:40.680
[Guest]: it's all useless. So you start creating these information dissemination mechanisms, which

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:45.520
[Guest]: is a lot of Facebook pages, which is a lot of these WhatsApp groups. But you also realize

02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:51.280
[Guest]: that you can't reach everyone through the same Facebook page, largely because not everyone

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:55.360
[Guest]: is going to come and like your Facebook page. So the way to counter that, and BJP does it

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.200
[Guest]: extremely well, is that they create a lot of neutral looking pages. They create these

02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:03.840
[Guest]: we support Indian Army, we support this, some Bollywood link pages, we support Narendra

02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.520
[Guest]: Modi. So earlier, it was also done because it gave them plausible deniability for fake

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:13.040
[Guest]: news, because it would be, oh, some supporter is running it, we don't know who runs it.

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:18.400
[Guest]: Might be a BJP supporting page, but it's not an official BJP page. So a lot of these pages

02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:23.840
[Guest]: get created. Like if you look at Nation with Namo, something like that right now, millions

02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:29.440
[Guest]: of likes, millions of followers. Very rarely does anyone even talk about, okay, who funds

02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:33.560
[Guest]: Nation with Namo? Who is this entity? And it's regularly hiring graphic designers, it's

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.320
[Guest]: regularly hiring people to do targeted marketing, and a huge operation in general. There were

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:44.480
[Guest]: also like a couple of pages on the Namo app itself, which were basically designed by private

02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:50.800
[Guest]: entities separately. I know of different people who run social media teams, which run 100

02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.080
[Guest]: to 150 different Facebook pages. So these dissemination mechanisms are important, and

02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.440
[Guest]: they did not exist for the BJP in the Northeast. So when we got there, even before we knew

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:05.400
[Guest]: anything about the state and its politics, we started creating these mechanisms because

02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:11.320
[Guest]: they take time. And it takes a lot of resources, you boost it up, you get the right people

02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:16.000
[Guest]: who have the ability to write content that can go viral, that has the ability to like

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.560
[Guest]: resonate emotionally with people. So we were doing these exercises. On the other side,

02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:25.680
[Guest]: we were also collecting data on the state's demographic, about the constituencies, about

02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:30.280
[Guest]: what tribe votes were. Being Manipur, there are also some insurgent groups, so we were

02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.160
[Guest]: collecting data on, okay, who supports which insurgent group, which candidate would an

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:40.160
[Guest]: insurgent group support if you gave them a ticket, things like that. So political parties

02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:46.040
[Guest]: do take all of these things into account. We did this work for the first three, three

02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:51.000
[Guest]: and a half months. By that time, we also got together a team of PhD students who started

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:57.040
[Guest]: compiling a chart sheet against the incumbent government. So that did two things. One, like

02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:02.400
[Guest]: you get an excellent news day because you get to release a 100 point chart sheet against

02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:07.920
[Guest]: the opposition. And the media covers it very well. You get something else too. Once you

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.720
[Guest]: created this chart sheet, you distribute it to all your party leaders, and all of them

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:17.120
[Guest]: are blaming the opposition for the exact same issues. You get them like a top 10 from it.

02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:21.480
[Guest]: And at every speech, every social media post, they're repeating the same 10 things, all

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:27.480
[Guest]: of these leaders. So that reinforces the message. Another excellent side effect that we realized

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:32.080
[Guest]: was on a slow news day, when we didn't have any event lined up, we didn't have anything

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:37.360
[Guest]: lined up. We just got hold of some random MLA candidate or a famous like BJP Neta from

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:42.640
[Guest]: the area and told him, OK, call a press conference, read this page of the chart sheet. Tell them

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.000
[Guest]: what's wrong with the infrastructure development in the state. Tell them what's wrong with

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.920
[Guest]: corruption. Tell them what's wrong with human rights violation. And Manipur gave us a lot

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.640
[Guest]: of this content because it was a 15 year incumbent government. They weren't prepared for a blitzkrieg

02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:00.520
[Guest]: campaign. So when all of these things started happening in succession, when these WhatsApp

02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:05.120
[Guest]: forwards started going out, we'd also contacted all the newspapers because we've done this

02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.760
[Guest]: before. We know how it works. So we had all the prime newspaper pages on the exact key

02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:16.320
[Guest]: dates that mattered. So whenever like an ad day came out, like we had the front page,

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.400
[Guest]: they had like the second page, which doesn't really work very well because the first page

02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:26.880
[Guest]: is what sticks in people's memories if it's strong enough. Their messaging essentially

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:31.140
[Guest]: also had to be like a pro incumbent message, which is much tougher to design. It's much

02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:37.280
[Guest]: easier in politics to criticise than to like defend. Manipur also made me realise something

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:42.600
[Guest]: that an old enough government will always have skeletons in the closet. Tripura was

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.880
[Guest]: a different story because in Tripura, we could not make a 100 point chart sheet. The government

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.400
[Guest]: was so good that enough content did not exist. So we did make a chart sheet. We rebranded

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:56.720
[Guest]: it into something completely different from the Manipur one. But Manipur legit had a hundred

02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:03.240
[Guest]: huge points of failure against the government. So it did that entire exercise. Another thing

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:07.600
[Guest]: that we did was we started reaching out to a lot of the journalists in Manipur. Very

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:11.520
[Guest]: funny thing has just happened. You might have seen it on Twitter, the largest newspaper

02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:17.920
[Guest]: in Manipur, the guy that like I'd first got in touch with a newspaper called Sanghai Express.

02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:21.920
[Guest]: That is the largest circulated newspaper there. That is what people trusted and read. So I'd

02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:25.300
[Guest]: made friends with this guy. I reached out to him and talked to him about, okay, what

02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:29.440
[Guest]: is it that you think? What is the content that you're planning on writing? And we'd

02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:36.000
[Guest]: become like friends in a way. He's just joined BJP for the upcoming Manipur elections. So

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.840
[Guest]: yeah, a lot of these different things happen. The party leadership did not engage with us

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:47.960
[Guest]: for a very long time and we did not engage with them for one specific reason. As soon

02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:51.120
[Guest]: as party people know that you are doing all of this, you are doing the surveys, you are

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.880
[Guest]: responsible for the data collection. You get a lot of flattery, but you also get a lot

02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:01.000
[Guest]: of threats. A lot of people get after you telling you that, okay, this constituency,

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.280
[Guest]: you have to put this name in, even though that's not how it works.

02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:07.840
[Guest]: There's someone in the field collecting the data and you are assessing it. They think

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:12.920
[Guest]: you will manipulate data and the survey results for them. So it just becomes a lot of pressure.

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:16.880
[Guest]: It becomes a lot of fakery. So like until it was like three months before the election,

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:21.800
[Guest]: we never engaged with the party leadership and the candidates themselves. We always routed

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:27.040
[Guest]: all the messaging through party leaders that we were in touch with.

02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:31.840
[Amit Varma]: That's kind of fascinating, this little dance that you do. So I have another question here.

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.040
[Amit Varma]: One of the fascinating things about the Northeast was how you were crafting these individualized

02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:42.920
[Amit Varma]: narratives for Manipur and Tripura, which has nothing to do with perhaps, you know,

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.960
[Amit Varma]: what the national narrative might be. Like at one point, you talk about how, you know,

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.440
[Amit Varma]: messaging needs to be short and memorable. And how you arrive at that is through local

02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.240
[Amit Varma]: conditions, is through context. And you also point out, I think, in the context of Tripura

02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:01.080
[Amit Varma]: that there was no talk of Bangladeshi immigrants, there was no talk of Hindu-Muslim rivalry,

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:04.800
[Amit Varma]: because that didn't play there. And although you haven't mentioned it, and it may not have

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:09.080
[Amit Varma]: been in this campaign, but I vaguely remember that at one point, the BJP while campaigning

02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.960
[Amit Varma]: somewhere in the Northeast reassured the people that it's okay, you can eat beef, it's not

02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:18.440
[Amit Varma]: a big deal, you guys can eat beef, we'll have a different stance elsewhere. So my question

02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:25.400
[Amit Varma]: here is this, that the BJP seems to have built this incredible political machine, which,

02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:28.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, which knows how to win elections. I mean, whether they eventually govern or

02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:32.120
[Amit Varma]: not is a separate issue. But it's an incredible political machine, which knows how to win

02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:38.280
[Amit Varma]: elections and does what it takes to win. And this, in my mind, creates this conflict between

02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:42.560
[Amit Varma]: on the one hand, the will to power, that we'll do what it takes to win, you know, we'll take

02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:46.440
[Amit Varma]: whatever stances get us a win, we'll buy people from the other party that we might have been

02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:51.160
[Amit Varma]: against yesterday, we'll do whatever it takes. That's one part of it, the will to power.

02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:56.040
[Amit Varma]: But the other part of it is that the BJP at its core does stand for something, you know,

02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:00.840
[Amit Varma]: unlike the other parties, sort of, which could be blowing in the wind or trying to fill gaps

02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.800
[Amit Varma]: that think exist in the marketplace, the BJP does stand for something, there is a core

02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:09.880
[Amit Varma]: ideology, there is a core constituency, as such. And these two seem to be in conflict

02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:14.680
[Amit Varma]: with each other. That's the one part of it I can't figure out. Because, you know, on

02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:19.420
[Amit Varma]: the one hand, what is politics? Politics is, you know, downstream of culture, as Andrew

02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Breitbart famously said, you know, it's supply responding to demand, what do the people want,

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:30.400
[Amit Varma]: you kind of give them that, you shape yourself accordingly. But equally, the BJP is pre-shaped

02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.320
[Amit Varma]: in a particular way, which goes with a particular social current that's always been there, you

02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:39.520
[Amit Varma]: know, I had an episode with Akshay Mukul on sort of the social evolution of Hindutva,

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.120
[Amit Varma]: and one with Vinay Sethapathi on the political evolution of the BJP. So they've kind of gone

02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.040
[Amit Varma]: together and existed parallelly. But what do you make of this conflict? Because if politics

02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:54.840
[Amit Varma]: becomes all about efficiency, how do I win the election, I'm going to do what it takes,

02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:59.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, whatever gets me there is good. But on the other hand, do you also want to

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:04.400
[Amit Varma]: stand for something? What is your core identity? So is this a conflict that you kind of see

02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:09.760
[Amit Varma]: playing out? Is there a sense within BJP within the workers, perhaps within, you know, strategists

02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:14.320
[Amit Varma]: like Ram Madhava, who you've worked with, that, you know, there's a certain core thing

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:19.080
[Amit Varma]: we will never compromise on, but otherwise do what it takes.

02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:24.120
[Guest]: So BJP within itself, I don't think the senior leadership has any conflict about this thing

02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:30.120
[Guest]: at all. They are very pragmatic people in a lot of ways, and they're very clear on what

02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:36.800
[Guest]: the path to their end goal is. So the way they've structured is that they will do anything

02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:42.640
[Guest]: to come to power, no matter what the ideology required there. Once they are in power, they

02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:49.440
[Guest]: will push their ideology down on the population. So it's a very efficient system in a way.

02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:57.080
[Guest]: Marxists also from like a historic standpoint has always looked at power as a means of pushing

02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.720
[Guest]: its ideological goals. So what that does is that it lets you compromise on ideology till

02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:07.520
[Guest]: you are in power. Once you are in power, then you strengthen the ideology and make it the

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.880
[Guest]: dominant cultural stance of the population. So that is the way that it is structured.

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.440
[Guest]: So I don't think there is a major conflict there. What is very interesting though, and

02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:24.320
[Guest]: like at a local level, if you look at it, the RSS is an extremely embracing organization.

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:31.200
[Guest]: Like if someone leaves, say, BJP right now and goes to the Congress or goes to the CPI,

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.320
[Guest]: there will be resistance within those parties. Everyone is going to be like, we can't accept

02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:40.880
[Guest]: you. You're not ideologically pure kind of a thing. RSS, which you see as a very ideological

02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:44.280
[Guest]: organization, BJP, which you see as a very ideological party, especially based around

02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:50.120
[Guest]: Hindutva, is an entity that can embrace anyone and everyone. And it's structured that way

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:55.080
[Guest]: because this is the RSS culture from a really long period of time. They engage with people

02:43:55.080 --> 02:44:00.240
[Guest]: who disagree with them, and then they slowly get you within their fold. They tell you how

02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:05.680
[Guest]: nice they are as people and why you should convert to their ideology. So if you look

02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:13.360
[Guest]: at someone like, say, Sindhya moving there, Jatin Prasad moving there, these people would

02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:18.760
[Guest]: not be made to feel uncomfortable. They would instead be like senior leaders within the

02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:24.520
[Guest]: BJP instantly and the RSS cadre will mollycoddle them and try to get them to shift their entire

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:30.480
[Guest]: stance and speeches to the RSS line and the Hindutva ideology. So it's a very efficient

02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:36.680
[Guest]: way of doing things. The conflict might exist for someone outside, but within the leadership

02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:37.680
[Amit Varma]: there is no conflict.

02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:42.600
[Amit Varma]: My sense is that at some point it feels to me that something's gotta give. Like when

02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Adityanath was made UP CM, for example, this was something that I think got commented upon.

02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the ways in which they won in 2014, and Prashant Jha has a wonderful book

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.800
[Amit Varma]: on this, How the BJP Wins. He was also on my show. And one of the things that Amit Jha

02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:01.240
[Amit Varma]: managed to do brilliantly, especially in UP, was reconfigure the caste dynamics, where

02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.880
[Amit Varma]: they figured out that the OBC vote is gone, but they can appeal to the non-Yadav OBCs.

02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:10.160
[Amit Varma]: The Dalit vote is gone, but they can appeal to the non-Jatav Dalits. And in fact, in both

02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:16.840
[Amit Varma]: 2014 and 2019, more Dalits voted for the BJP than they did for any other party. And a natural

02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:20.440
[Amit Varma]: expectation from that would have been that when they were appealing to all these different

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:25.660
[Amit Varma]: groups, that the eventual state government that would form in UP would be sort of a more

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:32.000
[Amit Varma]: inclusive one than you eventually got. Eventually you got Adityanath as the CM. And I think

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.600
[Amit Varma]: there was a faction within the party which said that, you know, I think one of the deputy

02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:40.560
[Amit Varma]: CMs, was it Maurya, was OBC, so make him instead and whatever. And all those tussles were playing

02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:45.960
[Amit Varma]: out. But no, they then just went with their guy. And it seems to me that at some point

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:50.160
[Amit Varma]: down the line, people are going to wisen up to it and something's got to give. But that's

02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.240
[Amit Varma]: a little half-baked knowledge that I kind of have. Is there a greater insight that you

02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:55.760
[Guest]: would add to this particular?

02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:02.360
[Guest]: Yes, sir. So UP is an excellent example, because I've seen those elections pretty closely.

02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:08.360
[Guest]: One thing that happened was when BJP came to power in 2014, and then in 2017, in the

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:15.480
[Guest]: UP state elections, a lot of this caste mapping and these caste-based WhatsApp groups happened.

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:21.040
[Guest]: Non-Jatav Dalits and non-Yadav OBCs were essentially told how the reservation benefits were cornered

02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:25.880
[Guest]: by the dominant group within their sub-caste group, and why they should be voting for BJP

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:29.800
[Guest]: to get it back. Because if Samajwadi Party comes to power, it's always going to favour

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.120
[Guest]: the Yadavs within the OBC. If Mayawati comes to power, she'll favour the Jatavs within

02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.800
[Guest]: the Dalit community. So the only one who will respect the other groups' rights within

02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:45.320
[Guest]: these communities is BJP. If you look at 2019, though, that was actually not the case. So

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:51.560
[Guest]: all of the targeting, all of the data analytics, all of this declined heavily before the 2019

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:57.160
[Guest]: elections. 2019 was carpet bombing. It was entirely about Hindu, Muslim, India, Pakistan,

02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:02.960
[Guest]: the strongman image and the nation and Balakot dominating the larger narrative than it was

02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:08.840
[Guest]: about specific caste groups. What I have seen and what I believe to be the case is that

02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:15.480
[Guest]: to come to power, they exploit the differences between communities. And once the BJP is in

02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.560
[Guest]: power, the larger goal is to actually unify the Hindu community. And unifying the Hindu

02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:24.760
[Guest]: community does involve vilifying the Muslim community and pitting the Hindu one against

02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.880
[Guest]: the Muslim one. But the goal, even though BJP itself has a lot of like caste hierarchy

02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:34.640
[Guest]: within it, even though RSS has huge caste hierarchies within it and is a decently casted

02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:41.200
[Guest]: organisation, its vision for society is a consolidated Hindu identity. And I believe

02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:47.400
[Guest]: like Adityanath, Yogi Adityanath in UP has worked on creating a unified Hindu identity.

02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:52.200
[Guest]: How successful it is remains to be seen. Even if you look at the current elections, like

02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:58.480
[Guest]: BJP elections are what four, five months away, there isn't as much casteist messaging happening

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:01.360
[Guest]: as it is like Hindu versus Muslim.

02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in a sense, that's a kind of a political masterstroke, which I think 20 years ago,

02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.600
[Amit Varma]: no one would have said that they can pull it off, that they can get all these disparate

02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:16.960
[Amit Varma]: votes together and create this consolidated Hindu vote. And by the way, a digression here,

02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:21.240
[Amit Varma]: like one of the criticisms I have of these other parties, and I don't know if it is a

02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:27.720
[Amit Varma]: practical criticism, but it certainly I see playing out, is that many of the opposition

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:32.360
[Amit Varma]: parties also seem to be chasing this Hindu vote bank. You know, whether it's the Aam

02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Aadmi Party, which did not take a strong enough stance against the abolition of 370, or in

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:43.160
[Amit Varma]: the case of CAA, and they do a lot of posturing about how devout they are and how Hindu they

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:49.520
[Amit Varma]: are. And similarly, the Congress also does a lot of soft Hindutva in different ways.

02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:54.320
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of that? Do you feel that that is pragmatic, and they absolutely

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.920
[Amit Varma]: have to do that because there is no option that is a vote bank, you cannot but woo if

02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:03.840
[Amit Varma]: you want to come to power? Or is it your sense that there is a lack of imagination there,

02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.240
[Amit Varma]: that they see this block and they see that as a reality, and they are catering to that?

02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Because what it strikes me from perhaps an idealistic perspective, is that look, people

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:16.880
[Amit Varma]: contain multitudes. You know, earlier, there might have been someone who said that I am

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.040
[Amit Varma]: a Yadav OBC, and I'll vote as, you know, according to this party, which is appealing to me on

02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:26.280
[Amit Varma]: that regard. And the next day, he might say, no, no, no, Muslims are bad, Pakistan is a

02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:31.140
[Amit Varma]: danger. I am now identifying as a Hindu. But the point is, there are many other shades

02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:36.320
[Amit Varma]: of identity, which are not restricted to these two in particular. So are the other parties

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:41.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of doing the pragmatic thing? And is it necessary for everyone to appeal to that

02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:46.160
[Amit Varma]: Hindu vote to survive in Indian politics? Or is it a lack of imagination that you can

02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:51.880
[Amit Varma]: go beyond that? And you can look at other kinds of reconfigurations, ideally, of course,

02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:58.840
[Amit Varma]: not based on identity at all? I mean, why? So what's your sort of take on this?

02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:03.120
[Guest]: So yes, there is definitely a lack of imagination. But it's also because imagining and creating

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:09.440
[Guest]: new dynamics takes time. And for that, you need to come upon a theory of, okay, this

02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:14.480
[Guest]: is the reconfiguration that I want to make. So I don't think anyone sat down and clearly

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:18.760
[Guest]: articulated what reconfiguration they would do in society. So they're not campaigning

02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:23.560
[Guest]: towards that. But honestly, what the Congress is doing and what the Aam Aadmi Party is doing,

02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:29.440
[Guest]: I don't see it as appealing to the Hindu vote bank at all. It's actually like at least looking

02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:33.880
[Guest]: at the Delhi elections, it's quite a different thing. And it's a very sensible thing on the

02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:40.440
[Guest]: part of Aam Aadmi Party from a political strategy perspective. By not speaking on these issues

02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:45.720
[Guest]: of Hindu versus Muslim, they allowed for the election to be based around other issues.

02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:49.640
[Guest]: Like they could talk about how they're giving free electricity, they could talk about how

02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:53.080
[Guest]: they've bettered schools, they could talk about the free water that they're giving,

02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:59.520
[Guest]: they could talk about mohalla clinics. If they did choose to speak on CA, if they did

02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:03.960
[Guest]: choose to speak on Article 370, that is all the election would have been on and the BJP

02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:09.660
[Guest]: machinery would have assured. Because so much of the media is controlled by BJP supporting

02:51:09.660 --> 02:51:14.640
[Guest]: entities right now. That is what the nightly debate would have been on as soon as Aam Aadmi

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:18.520
[Guest]: Party gave a statement on the issue. All the editorials and newspapers would have been

02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:23.560
[Guest]: on that issue. All of the political speeches that any BJP leader gave, even without Aam

02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:26.680
[Guest]: Aadmi Party commenting, they were trying to present Aam Aadmi Party as someone who supports

02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:32.320
[Guest]: those causes. So if Aam Aadmi Party did comment, that would have actually helped the BJP in

02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:38.240
[Guest]: this sense. So not engaging with some of the issues that BJP plants and trying to create

02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:48.120
[Guest]: your own issues is a valuable part of doing politics. The entire going out there and doing

02:51:48.120 --> 02:51:53.680
[Guest]: overtly Hindu things to assert your Hindu identity, that might not be required. But

02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:57.960
[Guest]: it is required to not engage with these issues if you want to create a different issue and

02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:01.240
[Guest]: narrative for the election.

02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:05.600
[Amit Varma]: So I get the pragmatism of framing the narrative, that you're right, that this is how they wanted

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:09.720
[Amit Varma]: to frame the narrative. They see themselves as a development party. So let's frame it

02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:13.680
[Amit Varma]: that way. And let's frame it that way for practical political reasons. But I think the

02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:17.560
[Amit Varma]: danger then is something that I referred to earlier in the context of the BJP, but something

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:22.280
[Amit Varma]: that I think is an issue with politics. And I'll make this segue to my next question.

02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:26.080
[Amit Varma]: But basically, I think the broad issue there is that who is standing up for principles

02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:31.300
[Amit Varma]: then? You know, if the Aam Aadmi Party and they are the one party in India that basically

02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:36.160
[Amit Varma]: managed to be a disrupter that, you know, in terms of being a political entrepreneur,

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:40.320
[Amit Varma]: K. G. Rewald did a marvellous job, bring a new party out of nowhere, stand for something

02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:44.240
[Amit Varma]: that people haven't stood for before, come to power, that's great. And therefore people

02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:48.480
[Amit Varma]: had higher expectations from it as a party different from the others. But it seems to

02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:52.720
[Amit Varma]: me that it's a party identical to the others in the sense that it's a will to power driving

02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:58.040
[Amit Varma]: them, that they chose this particular decision, because from a political standpoint of what

02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:01.920
[Amit Varma]: will help them frame the narrative, get the votes, blah, blah, blah. And the inference

02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:05.800
[Amit Varma]: you draw from there is that they stand for nothing, that for all practical purposes,

02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:09.720
[Amit Varma]: that they're a sociopathic party, they'll do what it does to come to power. And perhaps

02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:13.600
[Amit Varma]: that's necessary. And sociopaths, by the way, it's a medical condition, your amygdala is

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:20.360
[Amit Varma]: damaged. So sociopaths are over represented in the criminal population, bankers and politicians.

02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:25.000
[Amit Varma]: That's just a medical fact. I'd written a column on this once in which naively, I think

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:29.800
[Amit Varma]: in 2014 or 15, I had pointed out to Kejriwal as an exception and said, no, no, he seems

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:33.880
[Amit Varma]: to be well intentioned. But now I know he's as much of a sociopath as them. But then the

02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:38.640
[Amit Varma]: point is that it's all incentives. It's all driven by will to power, that if you put Kejriwal

02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and an identical context to Modi, he will be identical to Modi. The only difference

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:48.240
[Amit Varma]: being sort of perhaps their intelligence, but not their intent or not what they will

02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:54.920
[Amit Varma]: actually do. And the question that I'm leading up to is that, is it then the case that politics

02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:58.840
[Amit Varma]: always corrodes character, that you can get into politics, and you said you might one

02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:02.400
[Amit Varma]: day get into politics. So perhaps it's a good question to ponder on, that you might get

02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:06.120
[Amit Varma]: into politics with the best of intentions, that I care about the country, I'll change

02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:10.240
[Amit Varma]: this, I'll do that. But the incentives of politics that you have to win elections, principles

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:14.920
[Amit Varma]: don't matter, you do what it takes, you have the dirtiest bedfellows, you may compromise

02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:20.120
[Amit Varma]: after compromise after compromise. And initially, you can tell yourself that the end justifies

02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:24.040
[Amit Varma]: the means. But that's a dangerous road to go down on. And eventually, I think if you

02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:29.560
[Amit Varma]: compromise too much, you change, the person you are, is dependent on the things you do,

02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:33.480
[Amit Varma]: no matter what you tell yourself while doing them. So is this something that you've thought

02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.760
[Amit Varma]: about? Is this something that when you look at politicians around you, do you see signs

02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:40.440
[Amit Varma]: of this? What's your sense of this?

02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:45.960
[Guest]: Oh, definitely. So I think a lot about this. And even in a personal context, I think about

02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:52.600
[Guest]: this. Principled politics in general, I haven't seen succeed in large part of this country

02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:58.160
[Guest]: yet. There are pockets where it succeeded once and then completely evaporated. Manipur

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.480
[Guest]: again, great case study for this, because while we were in Manipur, we were also looking

02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:10.120
[Guest]: at Erum Sharmila's campaign, who got 370 votes after months of efforts and fighting for the

02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:17.120
[Guest]: cause of Manipur and the removal of AFSPA for 30 years. You get the support of 300 people,

02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:22.580
[Guest]: 100 people. Other people in her party, there was a Muslim woman who was a lawyer who had

02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:29.360
[Guest]: actually contested cases for about 1,000 to 1,500 different Muslim women within her community

02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:34.040
[Guest]: who were suffering from different legal issues. She did not even get the vote of those 1,000

02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:38.200
[Guest]: people. She got some 91 votes or something like that. So in general, like looking at

02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:44.480
[Guest]: all of these people, looking at Jayaprakash Narayan of Lok Satta Party, you do start to

02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:50.440
[Guest]: lose some amount of faith in principled politics just because you are seeing it fail again

02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:56.680
[Guest]: and again and again. My sense of it is to do principled politics, you can't care about

02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:02.600
[Guest]: power. So you can't care about the politics of it at all. You have to be someone, one

02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:06.800
[Guest]: who is like financially secure enough to lead your own life that you don't need anything

02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:11.320
[Guest]: out of politics. You are doing it because you want to do politics for the betterment

02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:16.840
[Guest]: of the nation. You don't care about being in power. You care about the cause more. So

02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:22.600
[Guest]: you are willing to say things that are principled but can cost you votes. If you start thinking

02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:27.460
[Guest]: in calculative terms of votes and elections and winning, then you do become pragmatic

02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:34.720
[Guest]: to the level of seeming like a sociopath in a lot of ways. A lot of politicians are that

02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:39.360
[Guest]: way because that does get you votes and that does get you support, at least in the near

02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:44.480
[Guest]: term. And elections are always in the near term, right? No one is planning for, I want

02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:49.480
[Guest]: to win the elections 20 years later until then I am going to transform society. Most

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.360
[Guest]: people feel like I will do the pragmatic thing right now, come to power and then try to do

02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.280
[Guest]: the principled thing. But you can't do the principled thing after coming to power because

02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:01.920
[Guest]: then there is always the next election and you're scared about losing that and you're

02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:05.880
[Guest]: scared about the party disintegrating and you're scared about losing all of the privileges

02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:13.800
[Guest]: that you've circulated. So in general, very difficult place to be to do principled politics.

02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.480
[Guest]: I believe you'd have to study philosophy and stoicism in general, get to the level of not

02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:25.120
[Guest]: caring about winning or losing or even politics, just caring about the principles and then

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.120
[Guest]: doing politics.

02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it'll be, I wonder if such a politician can survive. One of my favourite episodes

02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:35.840
[Amit Varma]: of the show, by the way, is episode 149, A Life in Indian Politics, which I did with

02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:40.800
[Amit Varma]: JP Narayan. And I mean, he's one of my modern heroes, a man I admire intensely, who didn't

02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:45.440
[Amit Varma]: just sit in a corner and pontificate about politics should be like this or like that,

02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:49.200
[Amit Varma]: but he jumped into the fray himself and he tried to change things and he didn't. You

02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:53.920
[Amit Varma]: know, I mean, he did as long as the Lok Satha was a movement, but as a party, they couldn't

02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:59.180
[Amit Varma]: really move the needle, which one cannot blame on him in any way, you know, both incredibly

02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:03.400
[Amit Varma]: principled and incredibly pragmatic. And if he couldn't move the needle, you know, one

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:06.440
[Amit Varma]: wonders who can.

02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Moving on to sort of the next question. And we've kind of mentioned WhatsApp before. And

02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:16.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, in your book, in your first book, though in your second book, you elaborate

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.920
[Amit Varma]: much more on it. In your first book, you write, quote, during the 2014 general elections,

02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:25.840
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp was primarily used to create a network of party supporters and karyakartas with only

02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:30.640
[Amit Varma]: about 9000 to 10,000 WhatsApp groups nationally. At that time, Facebook and Twitter were the

02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:34.800
[Amit Varma]: primary social media channels that helped create the party's narrative and the party's

02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:39.160
[Amit Varma]: energies and funds were directed towards these platforms. The potential of WhatsApp seems

02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:44.000
[Amit Varma]: to have struck them only in early 2016, which is when the party began utilizing the platform

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:48.840
[Amit Varma]: for campaigning during assembly elections in all the states that went to polls. Today,

02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:53.160
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp has become a major part of the party's arsenal, with the party's IT cell head Amit

02:58:53.160 --> 02:58:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Malviya even telling the Economic Times, the upcoming elections will be fought on the mobile

02:58:57.280 --> 02:59:01.800
[Amit Varma]: phone. In a way, you could say they would be the WhatsApp elections, stop quote. And

02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:06.520
[Amit Varma]: you wrote this, of course, a couple of years back, and it's it's only sort of grown and

02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:10.680
[Amit Varma]: exacerbated since. And now you've also described in some detail on the kind of things you would

02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:14.260
[Amit Varma]: do in WhatsApp, like you, of course, described in a lot of detail about the kind of micro

02:59:14.260 --> 02:59:18.900
[Amit Varma]: targeting that you would do. And I would urge readers to check out sort of those passages

02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:23.540
[Amit Varma]: from both your books where you talk about how Facebook data was used by both the Obama

02:59:23.540 --> 02:59:29.960
[Amit Varma]: and Trump campaigns, incredibly fine tuned ways. I mean, one thinks if only Trump governed

02:59:29.960 --> 02:59:34.480
[Amit Varma]: as well as he kind of campaigned or his team campaigned, if all these guys governed as

02:59:34.480 --> 02:59:39.000
[Amit Varma]: well as a campaign, the world would be a different place. So tell me a little bit about this,

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:42.800
[Amit Varma]: because what strikes me about WhatsApp is that look, as far as it comes to Facebook

02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:48.680
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter, I can see what you're doing. In theory, in practice, of course, I don't know

02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:52.520
[Amit Varma]: what's happening in different silos all over the place. But all of Facebook is public,

02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:57.700
[Amit Varma]: all of Twitter is public. On WhatsApp, you have shit happening, which people like me

02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:01.920
[Amit Varma]: have no access to, you know. And one of the interesting things that you've mentioned is

03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:05.640
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, anytime someone adds me to a WhatsApp group, which doesn't happen often,

03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:09.800
[Amit Varma]: but anytime someone does it, I instantly leave. Because people like you and me, as you pointed

03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:14.240
[Amit Varma]: out in your book, PLUs, we have an aversion to it. But you also pointed out that most

03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:17.980
[Amit Varma]: voters across the country, they love it, because they feel they're getting to be part of an

03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:23.260
[Amit Varma]: inside group, they are being able to access privileged information, which they can then

03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: share at their panwala or in their social circles, and their status goes up because

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:32.480
[Amit Varma]: they have this privileged information, which again, another one of those insights, which

03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: I hadn't even thought about till I kind of read your book. So tell me a little bit about

03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:41.420
[Amit Varma]: this WhatsApp ecosystem from two points of view. One is how does it really work at the

03:00:41.420 --> 03:00:46.400
[Amit Varma]: consumption level at the people who are targeted and to as a level of someone who's actually

03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:52.180
[Amit Varma]: created bots in cards created all these WhatsApp groups, the built narratives and all of that.

03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:55.620
[Amit Varma]: What was that process like?

03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:58.720
[Guest]: So I'll actually start with the second one, because the first one will make more sense

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:05.680
[Guest]: after that. So creating these groups was actually a lot easier in 2016 and 2017. Because WhatsApp

03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:10.640
[Guest]: had no policies stopping anything, you could literally get SIM cards and create unlimited

03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:14.560
[Guest]: WhatsApp groups with random numbers on there, like random segregated numbers, you could

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:19.280
[Guest]: have numbers of like people in a particular booth of a particular caste, or a particular

03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:24.080
[Guest]: age group, or a particular demographic profile. So you could just get phone number lists like

03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:29.120
[Guest]: that and keep creating WhatsApp groups. You had like a couple of admins made in there

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:37.400
[Guest]: who kept pumping content. And you could do it at a mass scale. This transformed in 2018,

03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:42.840
[Guest]: because there was a huge human cry about WhatsApp funneling fake news and elections, these child

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:46.960
[Guest]: kidnapping rumours which led to murders in different villages. So there was a lot of

03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:52.320
[Guest]: pressure on WhatsApp to act not just in India, but also in Brazil and in a couple of African

03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:57.780
[Guest]: nations. And the US was basically targeting Facebook at that point of time on fake news

03:01:57.780 --> 03:02:03.360
[Guest]: in other nations. So WhatsApp had to act, they changed policies, they made this five

03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:10.520
[Guest]: forward limit, they started marking the messages as forwarded. These markings did nothing,

03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:15.160
[Guest]: this forward limit does nothing. But there was one policy which most people did not notice

03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:21.080
[Guest]: that made a major difference. If you buy a new SIM card, and you try to bulk create WhatsApp

03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:25.280
[Guest]: groups, literally after the creation of two to three groups, your SIM card is going to

03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:31.520
[Guest]: get blocked. So it is much more difficult to create WhatsApp groups as at bulk today

03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:38.000
[Guest]: than it was in 2016 and 17. Most people that I talked to think this is a good thing. This

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.560
[Guest]: is actually a horrible thing. Because no one in the opposition was doing it at that point

03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:48.040
[Guest]: of time, only the BJP was. Now the opposition is trying to do it, but they can't. So what

03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:53.040
[Guest]: this does is this locks up the competitive advantage that BJP has on WhatsApp message

03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:57.480
[Guest]: delivery forever. Because the previous group still exists. It's not like WhatsApp deleted

03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:04.880
[Guest]: all the WhatsApp groups in 2018, and everyone was at zero. BJP still has 20 to 30 WhatsApp,

03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:10.400
[Guest]: 1000 WhatsApp groups in the larger states of India, the opposition has like 1000, 2000.

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:15.440
[Guest]: So no matter how good their message might be, no matter how much the public would like

03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:22.320
[Guest]: it, their message would not reach the public. So WhatsApp is majorly fueling this problem.

03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:27.160
[Guest]: Creating WhatsApp groups also continue to get like more expensive as years went by,

03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:31.680
[Guest]: and also more illegal in a lot of ways because earlier you could acquire legal SIM cards

03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:38.120
[Guest]: and create a lot of groups. Now there are like troll farms in general who do a churning

03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:44.720
[Guest]: of SIM cards. So they get a lot of SIM cards, create groups, let the numbers get blocked,

03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:48.480
[Guest]: have multiple admins so that when this one is blocked, there is still one admin number

03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:53.440
[Guest]: that you control and the group stays alive. So it's just a more expensive process. Now

03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:59.240
[Guest]: it's a more specialized process now and can't happen at the same scale. When it comes to

03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:04.960
[Guest]: the content component, most people get very happy when they are added to a news-based

03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:08.720
[Guest]: WhatsApp group and a political WhatsApp group of a party that they support and they belong

03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:12.800
[Guest]: to because they believe they're getting some information that other people don't have access

03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:17.320
[Guest]: to. And a lot of times they do get information that other people don't have access to, but

03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:21.480
[Guest]: a lot of times it's fake information and it's fake news that they keep getting on these

03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:26.760
[Guest]: groups. But because it's unique information, because they think it's important, they circulate

03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:31.720
[Guest]: it to their other contacts. They forward it to whoever they know, their friends, their

03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:37.040
[Guest]: relatives, their family WhatsApp groups. And from there it just exponentially spirals out.

03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:41.520
[Guest]: So there's this very interesting calculation that even with just the five forward limit

03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:46.920
[Guest]: and with WhatsApp groups of only 20 people, it would only take five raised to the power

03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:52.720
[Guest]: of five. So like five people forwarding it to five more groups with 20 people within

03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:58.480
[Guest]: two cycles, it will reach four to 6 million people. So what that essentially means is

03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:04.480
[Guest]: that even five forwards is a lot and 20 people in a group is a lot because these things grow

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:09.440
[Guest]: exponentially. The spread is extremely fast if all the people in there are forwarding

03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:16.700
[Guest]: it. Content consumption on WhatsApp has changed in a lot of ways because I do see some saturation

03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:21.000
[Guest]: coming in. This thing that I wrote about people becoming very happy, this is going down because

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:25.600
[Guest]: more and more people are being added to more and more groups. The groups are getting busier.

03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:31.680
[Guest]: There is more content being pumped by all sides, all parties. There's more advertising

03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:37.320
[Guest]: happening on WhatsApp with surprisingly like bank messages are coming on WhatsApp slowly.

03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:40.520
[Guest]: Marketing people are realizing how they can do these bulk WhatsApp forward. So they've

03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:45.440
[Guest]: started doing it. This is decreasing the efficacy of WhatsApp, which might be a great thing

03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:52.000
[Guest]: in a lot of ways. Fake news is also a phenomenon that more and more people know about. So ultimately

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:57.360
[Guest]: at a cognitive level, a time might come, it's still far away, but a time might come where

03:05:57.360 --> 03:06:03.120
[Guest]: people just stop absorbing content altogether. Fake, real, it doesn't matter. They just stopped

03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:07.600
[Guest]: listening to everything. That's how full of it they are. And that might be a good thing

03:06:07.600 --> 03:06:09.600
[Amit Varma]: for democracy. We don't know.

03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:14.480
[Amit Varma]: So that extremely bleak image of there is so much content I cannot consume anymore actually

03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.160
[Amit Varma]: might work in our favor. I also think that, you know, while it appears kind of pessimistic,

03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:22.840
[Amit Varma]: it's actually perhaps too optimistic. There are a lot of insights about, you know, why

03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:27.120
[Amit Varma]: people believe this shit in the first place. Like there's of course stuff that we already

03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:30.480
[Amit Varma]: know that people will believe anything that lines up with their biases and then they'll

03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:35.160
[Amit Varma]: get invested in it. And if you then try to disprove it or dispute it, they'll take it

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:39.440
[Amit Varma]: as a personal attack. It's no longer a question of what is true or what is not true.

03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:44.320
[Amit Varma]: Another interesting advice was that fake news and clarification circulate in different groups.

03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:47.920
[Amit Varma]: So if there is some fake news that has spread across thousands of unknown WhatsApp groups,

03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:52.200
[Amit Varma]: which none of us have access to, and has also come on the public domain and so-called neutral

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Facebook sites, but we know who runs them and say the good Pratik or Fault News or,

03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:02.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, Boom Live and they do a fact check and all that. Their fact check is circulating

03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:07.040
[Amit Varma]: in a very limited group of really different people and the damage is already done. Like

03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:12.040
[Amit Varma]: one classic example that you've given is a 2018 video of which Koyna Mitra among others

03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:17.440
[Amit Varma]: forwarded which perpetrated to be a Naga sadhu being beaten up by Muslims. And that obviously

03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:21.480
[Amit Varma]: spread like wildfire all over. And by the time the fact check came that hey, it's not

03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:25.600
[Amit Varma]: a Hindu Muslim thing. The guy getting beaten up was a drunkard who had entered a house

03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:29.560
[Amit Varma]: and was trying to molest a woman. And that woman's brother then came and he was beating

03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:34.600
[Amit Varma]: him up. And that is a context. And they're both Hindu. You know, it's too late. Nobody

03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:39.520
[Amit Varma]: kind of gets that. And as you've pointed out that there is a lot of left wing fake news

03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:44.800
[Amit Varma]: also and you've given examples of that. Now, here's my question. You talk about one, there

03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:49.760
[Amit Varma]: is a worry of a virtual arms race phrase you use in your book, which I thought was superbly

03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:54.000
[Amit Varma]: evocative. Also, as you point out now that the change in rules that, you know, SIM cards

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:59.360
[Amit Varma]: get blocked and all of that has created has sort of solidified this imbalance where the

03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:03.320
[Amit Varma]: BJP has so many groups and the others don't have so many groups. And the implication in

03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:09.360
[Amit Varma]: that is that other people should also do a similar kind of narrative control in the sense

03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:13.800
[Amit Varma]: that the truth doesn't matter. As you explained, people don't care about logic or reasoning

03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:18.540
[Amit Varma]: or whatever. They believe what they want to believe. And therefore, all the opposition

03:08:18.540 --> 03:08:23.280
[Amit Varma]: parties should also get in there and they should run their own narrative factories and

03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:27.960
[Amit Varma]: try to counter at that level. And that makes me really uneasy. Like one of the things that

03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:32.760
[Amit Varma]: I have seen is that I know the BJP IT cell is vile and I've been attacked by them in

03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:37.240
[Amit Varma]: the past till I blocked all of them, I hope. But I have also been attacked by the Congress

03:08:37.240 --> 03:08:42.400
[Amit Varma]: IT cell when I have expressed my dissatisfaction with the Gandhi's. And even Aam Aadmi Party

03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:46.480
[Amit Varma]: got after me at a different point in time, though I have a different Aam Aadmi Party

03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:51.760
[Amit Varma]: leaders I admire on my show. It's almost like it's a race to the bottom. And that's what

03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:56.980
[Amit Varma]: kind of disheartens me that it doesn't have to be a race to the bottom. That maybe one

03:08:56.980 --> 03:09:00.920
[Amit Varma]: differentiator can be that you take a high moral ground. But that's regarding IT cells.

03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:04.600
[Amit Varma]: But regarding narratives, do you feel that there is no option? Do you feel that we are

03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:09.720
[Amit Varma]: reaching a stage where the parties have to say that truth jaaye bhaad mein? You know,

03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:13.640
[Amit Varma]: these guys are building a narrative that suits them. We have to build a narrative that suits

03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:18.680
[Amit Varma]: us. And it's war and what the facts are and what the truth is, who gives a shit. And then

03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:24.000
[Amit Varma]: everything gets extreme and partisan. And nobody is voting any more than on principles

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.760
[Amit Varma]: and policies and issues and so on. They are just voting based on the tribe.

03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:35.200
[Guest]: So that isn't necessary at all. In fact, truth might be an excellent thing to base all narratives

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:41.440
[Guest]: and campaigns for your side on. The issue is thinking truth will sell itself. If you

03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:44.440
[Guest]: release a fact check, you've written a fact check, and you think you've done your job

03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:48.960
[Guest]: and it's going to create like, it's going to correct everything, it's going to fix the

03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:53.880
[Guest]: fake news, it's going to fix the people who forwarded the fake WhatsApp news. It's not.

03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:58.520
[Guest]: So even if you are on the side of the high moral ground, even if you are on the side

03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:04.520
[Guest]: of the truth, and all you ever circulate is the truth, you need distribution. If your

03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:09.840
[Guest]: truth just stays with you in your heart, it's not going to make a difference from like a

03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:16.760
[Guest]: political and like democratic perspective. For a democracy to function, your truth needs

03:10:16.760 --> 03:10:24.020
[Guest]: to reach at least as many people as the lie is reaching. And that involves a lot of effort.

03:10:24.020 --> 03:10:27.360
[Guest]: What is happening right now is that okay, like all of the parties have created their

03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:32.480
[Guest]: own IT cells, a lot of them are trolling different people. But even the politicians who are taking

03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:37.080
[Guest]: high moral grounds, who are saying the truth, who are on side of like things that are in

03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:41.160
[Guest]: the benefit of the nation as a whole, which are not dividing different communities, those

03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:47.160
[Guest]: people might not be known entities right now. And they can't just bank upon the fact that

03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:52.360
[Guest]: they're supporting what is right, they will have to put in the energy of propagating their

03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:57.580
[Guest]: rightful narrative. So ultimately, the tools that we especially mentioned in the second

03:10:57.580 --> 03:11:02.760
[Guest]: book about like, how these silos are created, and how silos are unified, and how messages

03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:07.960
[Guest]: are propagated and spread and how you get people to believe a conjured reality. That

03:11:07.960 --> 03:11:12.920
[Guest]: entire thing is very important, even for people who are spreading the truth. Because you have

03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:20.800
[Guest]: to do the exact same actions to build a reality in facts as you have to do to build a reality

03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:22.360
[Guest]: that is completely fake.

03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I totally get that, that you can go with the truth, just package it well. But

03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:30.840
[Amit Varma]: sometimes I wonder how package it well, for example, look at Trump, right? When Trump

03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:35.960
[Amit Varma]: won in 2016, I remember I wrote a column at the time, arguing that one of the reasons

03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:40.240
[Amit Varma]: he would do well is that his narratives were really simple. They were wrong, but they were

03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:44.200
[Amit Varma]: simple. For example, you know, middle America was losing jobs, and there was an employment

03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.200
[Amit Varma]: problem there. And he came up with two answers. One, he said that the immigrants are coming

03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:52.160
[Amit Varma]: and taking away your job. So you know, anti immigration message. And the other he said,

03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:57.480
[Amit Varma]: your jobs are getting shipped to China. So anti free trade message, and you've demonized

03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:02.880
[Amit Varma]: China and immigrants. And that's a simple narrative that sells. Now, it's wrong. But

03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:07.840
[Amit Varma]: the truth is far more complex. And to package that complex truth in a simple way which people

03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:12.840
[Amit Varma]: can get behind, and which can motivate people becomes incredibly difficult. The other thing

03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:17.960
[Amit Varma]: as the German theorist Carl Schmitt once said is that in politics, you need an other. Now,

03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:22.280
[Amit Varma]: these gooey feelings of love and brotherhood is not going to motivate anyone to go to the

03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:27.240
[Amit Varma]: voting booth and vote for someone. What the BJP has done brilliantly is if they've, they've

03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:32.800
[Amit Varma]: always had that other, but now they've, you know, other is the other even more as it were,

03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:36.600
[Amit Varma]: and that drives a vote there. Now, you know, what are other parties to do? That is the

03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.040
[Amit Varma]: strongest narrative. Do you have to create another? How do you do that? Do you have to

03:12:41.040 --> 03:12:45.620
[Amit Varma]: create a narrative based on hate if that motivates people more than love? You know, do you have

03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:50.120
[Amit Varma]: to ignore the truth if the truth is too complex? These are the sort of issues that kind of

03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:51.800
[Guest]: worry me.

03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:56.440
[Guest]: So that is an excellent thing to worry about. But as you mentioned the Trump example, great

03:12:56.440 --> 03:13:00.800
[Guest]: one. Here you don't try to counter Trump's narrative by trying to supply truth and facts

03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:06.120
[Guest]: because that is a very messy thing to do. And it is a debate. The way to beat Donald

03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:13.400
[Guest]: Trump was never to engage with that rhetoric at all. It was always to create another narrative

03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:17.720
[Guest]: entirely that would demolish Donald Trump. And it could be based entirely on the truth.

03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:22.760
[Guest]: Things like how Donald Trump is a failed businessman, which like all of us knew was fact. Like now

03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:27.080
[Guest]: we know even more because the tax returns have come out. You build it on how many times

03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:31.320
[Guest]: he's declared bankruptcy and defrauded banks and the American taxpayer. You build it on

03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:36.760
[Guest]: his personal character and like how he has been against Christian values all his life.

03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:43.000
[Guest]: So you use the truth that you can use against him. But if you think that the truth will

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.760
[Guest]: win in an emotive battle, it will not.

03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:51.840
[Amit Varma]: That's excellently put. You know, I've taken up most of the time and we have some 15-20

03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:54.640
[Amit Varma]: minutes of the time you promised me. So I don't want to take up much more, which is

03:13:54.640 --> 03:13:58.320
[Amit Varma]: probably a good thing because I want people to buy both books and read both of them. What

03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:02.400
[Amit Varma]: we discussed mostly is really the material of your first book, which I must confess I

03:14:02.400 --> 03:14:06.880
[Amit Varma]: found way more fascinating because Indian politics is just such a deep, fascinating

03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:10.840
[Amit Varma]: subject that if the book was like five times longer, I would have, you know, still read

03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:15.800
[Amit Varma]: it in the one sitting I did read it in. But now, you know, I want to do a little bit of

03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:21.800
[Amit Varma]: justice to your excellent second book, The Art of Conjuring Alternate Realities. So what

03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:26.760
[Amit Varma]: got you to, you know, focusing on this book? Like, of course, you know, while you were

03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:31.640
[Amit Varma]: doing party work at, you know, it was all about narratives and they weren't necessarily

03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:36.200
[Amit Varma]: alternate narratives. It's just a question of like choosing what to focus on and what

03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:41.240
[Amit Varma]: brand to push or whatever. But at some level, it is alternate narrative. Like when you paint,

03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:44.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, Maharaj Amrindar Singh is Captain Amrindar Singh, people's man have coffee with

03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:48.400
[Amit Varma]: Captain how many people can actually go and have coffee with Captain, right? So there's

03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:53.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit of alternative in there. So tell me about this kind of book. And I wish we

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:56.440
[Amit Varma]: could talk more about it. Because one of the things I loved about the book, which readers

03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:00.760
[Amit Varma]: should really check out is all these lovely stories that you've thrown in which we can

03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:05.560
[Amit Varma]: all relate to like Vishwamitra and Vashishta and all the alternate realities that are happening

03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:11.000
[Amit Varma]: there. So it's it's great fun to read as well. But, you know, rather than focus on any aspect

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:16.120
[Amit Varma]: of it, what brought you to writing this book, the content of the book can be divided in

03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:19.920
[Amit Varma]: two parts, and neither of which are easy to summarize, or one is possibly easier than

03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:24.440
[Amit Varma]: the other. The part that's hard to summarize is, of course, the whole ecosystem of building

03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:27.960
[Amit Varma]: alternate realities, what are the different ways in which you create stories, which people

03:15:27.960 --> 03:15:31.560
[Amit Varma]: believe why they believe what they believe all of it is fascinating and extremely hard

03:15:31.560 --> 03:15:35.480
[Amit Varma]: to summarize. So I won't ask you to really try to summarize it unless you have a really

03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:39.480
[Amit Varma]: pithy way of kind of doing that. But the other more important thing, which I think would

03:15:39.480 --> 03:15:44.920
[Amit Varma]: be a good space to end is what do we do about this? You know, what are your sort of policy

03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:49.880
[Amit Varma]: solutions which you can put on the table? What can we do about this? And given that

03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:55.480
[Amit Varma]: the party in power has a most vested interest in keeping it going, because that's how they've

03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:59.640
[Amit Varma]: got to power. And that's how they can strengthen their hold on power. You know, are you optimistic

03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:03.400
[Amit Varma]: about all of that happening? Sorry, many questions packed in one. Let's start with the personal

03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:07.400
[Amit Varma]: one. What brought you to writing this book? And what is the process of writing these two

03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:11.000
[Amit Varma]: books been like, if I might digress there, like, you know, they've come out within a

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:14.920
[Amit Varma]: short span of time, you obviously write fast. What's your work ethic like? Like, has it

03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:18.120
[Amit Varma]: been easy? Has it been tough? How did you discover your voice?

03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:24.840
[Guest]: Starting with how the second one came about? Essentially, I met this guy called Anand Venkat

03:16:24.840 --> 03:16:29.480
[Guest]: Narayanan. The book is co-authored with him. He's a cybersecurity researcher based in Bangalore.

03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:36.360
[Guest]: So we actually met at a cybersecurity conference. And he was talking about Aadhar and data in

03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:42.440
[Guest]: general, and how data can be used against nation states, and can basically destabilize

03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:46.600
[Guest]: entire nations if they fall into the wrong hands. And I was talking about elections and

03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:51.560
[Guest]: politics and things like that. So we stayed in touch. And over the years, we've been discussing

03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:56.840
[Guest]: a lot around what do the rise of social media giants mean? What does it mean that people's

03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:00.840
[Guest]: reality is based on the information that they receive on their mobile screen, and they have

03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:07.160
[Guest]: no way to get information from any other source? What does it mean that even nation power is

03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.080
[Guest]: based around the narrative that a nation is able to create, instead of being based on like

03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:17.000
[Guest]: military strength, or just the amount of money that they have? The conflict between nation

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:22.520
[Guest]: states, especially like the US and China right now, we got into this discussion about how that

03:17:22.520 --> 03:17:26.920
[Guest]: is going to be influenced by which nation out of these two countries choose to support.

03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:32.680
[Guest]: So China is selling a model of fast economic growth, and you don't need democracy in Africa

03:17:32.680 --> 03:17:38.680
[Guest]: right now and Belt and Road across the entire Central Asian continent, and then Europe,

03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:44.360
[Guest]: it is telling nations that support us because faster economic growth. The US model, on the

03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:48.840
[Guest]: other hand, is that they have this narrative of liberty and justice and democracy. And they're

03:17:48.840 --> 03:17:54.520
[Guest]: like, you should support our cause for world freedom. So it is to a certain degree, also an

03:17:54.520 --> 03:18:00.760
[Guest]: informational conflict between nation states. It plays out in a lot of ways similar to how

03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:06.040
[Guest]: conflicts between political parties play out within a democracy. And surprisingly, we realized

03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:10.920
[Guest]: it's also similar to how religious government work and how essentially cyber scammers work,

03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:15.640
[Guest]: because all these entities are trying to convince you of a competing reality.

03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:22.600
[Guest]: Their goal is to get into your mind enough to shape your truth, to shape your reality.

03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:27.960
[Guest]: And discussing this over time, we realized that there are specific methods to do it.

03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:35.320
[Guest]: Good part for us was that cognitive security and just like mental cyber security is a major

03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:39.480
[Guest]: thing that the Russians have studied for a really long time. During the Cold War,

03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:45.800
[Guest]: especially when the KGB used to exist, they wrote a lot of manuals on manipulating people,

03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:52.120
[Guest]: manipulating media, manipulating thought in general. And there are also cyber entities

03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:55.800
[Guest]: in the world right now, who've realized that instead of trying to hack a system,

03:18:55.800 --> 03:19:01.400
[Guest]: it is easier to hack people's minds. So we covered the nuclear reactor hack at Kodankulam.

03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:08.120
[Guest]: And we realized that the North Korean people who hacked, will not say state actors. That's

03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:13.240
[Guest]: not conclusively proven, but the entity from North Korea that actually hacked the nuclear

03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:17.960
[Guest]: power plant, they did not do it by sophisticated programming. They actually did it by studying

03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:23.320
[Guest]: the two nuclear scientists there and realizing what kind of a link they would click on.

03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:28.680
[Guest]: Then they were sent a completely fictitious paper on thorium nuclear research that would

03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:33.560
[Guest]: pique their interest by the very title and the email. Very well crafted. As soon as they clicked

03:19:33.560 --> 03:19:38.280
[Guest]: on it, a malware was downloaded. Then they plugged their drive into the nuclear reactor,

03:19:38.280 --> 03:19:42.200
[Guest]: which is air-gapped. It's not connected to the internet. So there is no way to hack it.

03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:49.480
[Guest]: So we realized just hacking people's brains and creating a reality for them has vast usages across

03:19:49.480 --> 03:19:55.240
[Guest]: sectors. And politics is a very micro study of it because you get to see it at an individual voter

03:19:55.240 --> 03:20:00.360
[Guest]: level. And then there is a geopolitical aspect to it that Anand was working on and studying at

03:20:00.360 --> 03:20:06.600
[Guest]: that point of time. So we decided it's worthwhile to actually sit and research on how realities are

03:20:06.600 --> 03:20:12.200
[Guest]: shaped. Are there common themes? Are there common techniques that all of these people use? And there

03:20:12.200 --> 03:20:17.560
[Guest]: were a lot of common techniques. So the book came together well. Writing process for the first book,

03:20:17.560 --> 03:20:23.720
[Guest]: I would say was much easier because in general, that is my story. That is me telling my life

03:20:23.720 --> 03:20:28.840
[Guest]: story. And I was also freer then because I just resigned. I did not have a job. Now I'm working,

03:20:28.840 --> 03:20:34.280
[Guest]: I have consistent work. So the second book took longer. But for me, the second one was actually

03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:40.600
[Guest]: more interesting because I got to learn a lot. I got to study a lot. We got feedback on it. If

03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:45.160
[Guest]: you see the endorsements, then it's from an intelligence officer at the US Pentagon. Another

03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:50.520
[Guest]: one is from an intelligence officer from the Royal Air Force, UK, who's also worked as an advisor to

03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:55.160
[Guest]: UK's prime minister on defense modernization. The third one is from a friend in the Indian

03:20:55.160 --> 03:21:01.240
[Guest]: security establishment who worked with the NDRO and now works with the Australian Intelligence

03:21:01.240 --> 03:21:06.840
[Guest]: Institute. So just meeting all of these people, talking to them about geopolitical conflicts and

03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:13.880
[Guest]: shaping reality and cybersecurity, a lot more fun for me personally, a lot tougher to write.

03:21:14.440 --> 03:21:18.360
[Amit Varma]: It's all very fascinating. And you spoke about hacking minds. I remember I was sitting with my

03:21:18.360 --> 03:21:22.440
[Amit Varma]: friend Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution a long time back and we were chatting about

03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:27.880
[Amit Varma]: the allegations about the EVMs being hacked. And Nitin said something that stuck with me is that,

03:21:27.880 --> 03:21:32.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, why would they want to hack machines, it's much easier to hack minds. And your book

03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Innocence is a blueprint of how to do that, which is fascinating, and everyone should read it. And

03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:43.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, and everyone should also read it because we all seem to think that the rest of the world is

03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:48.360
[Amit Varma]: stupid, not me. Now, I will never get fooled by anyone. But the point is, all of us have biases,

03:21:48.360 --> 03:21:53.400
[Amit Varma]: all of us have certain things we want to believe. So you know, all of us can be lonely at times.

03:21:53.400 --> 03:21:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And some of these stories are very alluring, like you said, the whole community factor,

03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:02.200
[Amit Varma]: someone is connecting with me, all of that. So we should all I think, read it, partly for that

03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:06.840
[Amit Varma]: reason, just to understand human nature a little better, because that is really at the core of it.

03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:11.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not about information. It's about human nature is this way. And therefore people can

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:16.040
[Amit Varma]: manipulate it in all these really interesting ways. The second part of that question, then

03:22:16.040 --> 03:22:22.120
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, what can be done to sort of change this, which is a much broader question, because

03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:28.120
[Amit Varma]: it's technology that enables it. It's technology that enables it through algorithms, which actually

03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:33.320
[Amit Varma]: there's no reason to object to them at a principal level. Like if I am to say that as an individual,

03:22:33.320 --> 03:22:38.840
[Amit Varma]: it is my right to be served by a company which is giving me the kind of content I want to read,

03:22:38.840 --> 03:22:44.040
[Amit Varma]: who is anyone to stand in my way, but clearly something has to be done. Now you've mentioned

03:22:44.040 --> 03:22:47.960
[Amit Varma]: that WhatsApp did a few things and the SIM card thing is great. And although you know,

03:22:47.960 --> 03:22:52.360
[Amit Varma]: it might sort of perpetuate the imbalance that is already there. And it has those little things

03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:58.200
[Amit Varma]: like forwarded message and all of that. But broadly at a policy level, being a policy person

03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:03.320
[Amit Varma]: yourself also along with the politics person, what would you say can be done about this

03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:08.200
[Amit Varma]: realistically, in the sense that one can make a public case for something like this, and there

03:23:08.200 --> 03:23:15.160
[Amit Varma]: is a chance that people in power will actually put it in practice? So this question is actually

03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:20.120
[Guest]: something that is bothering all the multi-billion dollar corporations right now. It's a question

03:23:20.120 --> 03:23:24.920
[Guest]: that's bothering all national governments across the world right now. It's bothering every democracy,

03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:32.920
[Guest]: it's bothering every intelligence agency. How do you protect your society and your population from

03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:41.320
[Guest]: just this mental manipulation? So it's a very tricky question because Facebook, WhatsApp,

03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:47.160
[Guest]: all of these entities owned by the Facebook group, Twitter itself, TikTok,

03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:53.800
[Guest]: they're profit maximizing entities. And for that purpose, they've all done some degree of

03:23:53.800 --> 03:24:01.000
[Guest]: evilness where they've knowingly let people get mentally harmed. So as the recent whistleblower

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:06.280
[Guest]: report from Facebook just stated, they knew that girls in a certain demographic age group were

03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:10.280
[Guest]: getting into severe depression because of Instagram content. And they tried to suppress

03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:15.240
[Guest]: that report and actually did successfully suppress it. So these things, they also,

03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:19.720
[Guest]: Facebook has done a lot of research into manipulating people using its own platform. So

03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:26.280
[Guest]: historically, Facebook has experimented on how they can manipulate people using Facebook. We

03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:31.080
[Guest]: are guinea pigs to the platform historically. They've collected all of this data, they've not

03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:37.080
[Guest]: released it, they've tried to hide a lot of it. So it is not great history there. But if you look

03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:41.480
[Guest]: at these entities at this point of time, I truly believe they are trying to solve the problem

03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:46.280
[Guest]: because it's just bad for business to get so much scrutiny. If you look at the world today,

03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:51.240
[Guest]: everyone is talking about how bad the social media giants are, how fake news is spreading

03:24:51.240 --> 03:24:56.440
[Guest]: rapidly, how democracy is getting destroyed because of it. So solutions at a technological

03:24:56.440 --> 03:25:01.800
[Guest]: level when these multi-billion and trillion dollar corporations get involved is something that is

03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:08.920
[Guest]: likely. I believe it will come at an algorithmic level, but I also believe what is going to happen

03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:14.200
[Guest]: is that eventually we will have trust scores. For a lot of content that gets circulated,

03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:20.040
[Guest]: you could easily build something that gives it a trust score. If it's a news website,

03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:24.840
[Guest]: you could tabulate how many times fact checkers like a global group of fact checkers have

03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:30.440
[Guest]: identified this entity as circulating fake news. You could potentially design algorithms that then

03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:35.800
[Guest]: mark the separate links and separate pieces of content as, okay, this might be untrustworthy

03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:41.400
[Guest]: because the source has circulated fake news so many times in the past. Do you want to visit

03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:46.200
[Guest]: this page and see their history? Something like that is something that could also help.

03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:53.640
[Guest]: But ultimately, I don't think any of these is a solution. I think the solution lies in recreating

03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:59.400
[Guest]: society to be more resilient as a whole. It does lie in education. It's a long-term thing and I

03:25:59.400 --> 03:26:05.800
[Guest]: know educational and long-term solutions don't do well for a lot of things. But studying societies

03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:12.280
[Guest]: across the world, you find out that not every society is equally vulnerable. India is extremely

03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:18.200
[Guest]: vulnerable to a lot of divide within our own community. The US is extremely vulnerable in

03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:22.760
[Guest]: believing different conspiracy theories and people believe in different rhetoric against

03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:28.680
[Guest]: different groups. But you look at a place like Europe, then it's slightly more resilient.

03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:34.440
[Guest]: If you look at Australia, it's slightly more resilient than Europe. If you look at Scandinavia,

03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:39.800
[Guest]: it's extremely resilient. Then you have countries like Switzerland, which are surprisingly and

03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:46.760
[Guest]: like just uncannily resilient to these sorts of manipulation. So society and social level

03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:52.840
[Guest]: of education and understanding does have a major role to play on this. What we believe is that

03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:59.400
[Guest]: Indian culture in general has a huge advantage when you look at traditional Indian culture,

03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:03.880
[Guest]: because it has been a questioning culture. We are reinterpreting it to be a culture that is

03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:09.480
[Guest]: hardline, that believes in Hindutva. But the culture has always been based around debate.

03:27:09.480 --> 03:27:14.120
[Guest]: It's based around discussion. If you look at even the Hindu religion, then like there used to be

03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:17.960
[Guest]: Shastrath, there used to be debates between different schools of philosophy within the

03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:22.680
[Guest]: religious movement. Between Buddhism and Hinduism, there have been large debates.

03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:28.360
[Guest]: So India has been a questioning society. India has been a society that's been sceptical of what

03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:35.080
[Guest]: is told to them by just an authority figure or by a WhatsApp forward. We've lost this in, say,

03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:41.880
[Guest]: the past 100, 200, 300 years. We have to start recreating that within our society.

03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:48.040
[Guest]: So the school system has a major part to play here. The social groups that we are surrounded

03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:53.000
[Guest]: by have a major part to play here. What is important is that we recognise the problem first,

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:57.560
[Guest]: and then we explain the problem to other people without explaining it in the context of, say,

03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:03.000
[Guest]: BJP and Congress, without explaining it in the context of their caste group versus another caste

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:08.520
[Guest]: group, Hindu versus Muslim. That's why, if you look at the book, we have examples of manipulation

03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:16.680
[Guest]: from both sides. We actually focus on Iran using the divide and discontent within Indian Muslim

03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:23.080
[Guest]: youth to create more dissatisfaction and combine the Indian Muslim youth to its own cause.

03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:26.840
[Guest]: And Iran wasn't doing it because it has some geopolitical interest in doing it. It was

03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:32.040
[Guest]: literally doing it as an experiment in India. So once you understand what kind of geopolitical

03:28:32.040 --> 03:28:37.080
[Guest]: risk it presents, as anyone who cares about the nation, you will become someone who wants

03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:41.880
[Guest]: to fix the problem instead of making it into a political issue. Fantastic thoughts. And you

03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:45.800
[Amit Varma]: mentioned that, you know, Indian society has been sceptical in the past. I'll be a little

03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:50.120
[Amit Varma]: sceptical of that assertion when you talk about the traditions within Hinduism and say that

03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:54.920
[Amit Varma]: I would argue that they were probably only among the elites, as it were, the questioning,

03:28:54.920 --> 03:28:58.760
[Amit Varma]: the Shastrath and so on. I'm not sure how widespread they are, but that we'll never

03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:03.160
[Amit Varma]: know really, because the history written of that time would largely be by the elites for the elites.

03:29:03.160 --> 03:29:08.520
[Amit Varma]: So who knows? I'm also reminded when you were, you know, you used the word experiment and that

03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:12.360
[Amit Varma]: reminded me of this experiment you've written about in the book, I think Facebook carried it

03:29:12.360 --> 03:29:18.440
[Amit Varma]: out in 2012 or something, where, you know, one set of readers was for one week shown happy messages

03:29:18.440 --> 03:29:23.640
[Amit Varma]: and another set was shown sad messages. And they wanted to see at the end of this time,

03:29:23.640 --> 03:29:28.920
[Amit Varma]: what kind of posts these two groups will make. And lo and behold, the group with the happy messages

03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:33.480
[Amit Varma]: actually started posting happy messages and the other way around, which means they actually made

03:29:33.480 --> 03:29:39.160
[Amit Varma]: people sadder. And the great lesson in that is that we are not as much in control of ourselves

03:29:39.160 --> 03:29:45.240
[Amit Varma]: as we think that we are, that we are all the time being willfully and otherwise being manipulated by

03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:49.720
[Amit Varma]: everything that happens to us, that whatever we are right now, whatever we feel right now is

03:29:49.720 --> 03:29:54.520
[Amit Varma]: contingent on so many things, all the information we take in the media, we take in the food that we

03:29:54.520 --> 03:29:59.720
[Amit Varma]: eat, the chemical balance in our brain, which could be sort of happenstance. So, you know,

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:07.160
[Amit Varma]: I think many of us need to lose a little bit of arrogance and gain humility about how fragile

03:30:07.160 --> 03:30:12.360
[Amit Varma]: human nature can be and therefore take problems like this seriously. But so to finally bring an

03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:17.880
[Amit Varma]: episode to the end, a final question for you, and this is really for the benefit of my listeners as

03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:23.640
[Amit Varma]: well as me. If you had to recommend a handful of books which you feel shaped you and that everyone

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:29.240
[Guest]: should read, what would they be? So one I definitely recommend is something called

03:30:29.240 --> 03:30:36.120
[Guest]: The Dictator's Handbook. Bruce Bueno de Mosqueda, he's a professor at NYU who explores how dictators

03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:42.760
[Guest]: stay in power. So that book shaped a lot of my thought in life in general. A book completely

03:30:42.760 --> 03:30:49.240
[Guest]: unlinked to politics, but extremely linked to how people think is a psychology of money. Morgan

03:30:49.240 --> 03:30:55.240
[Guest]: Housel just read it. I realized that even at a financial and investing level, like all of us have

03:30:55.240 --> 03:31:01.320
[Guest]: too many biases, and it's important to assess the biases in all fields of life. And when you do it

03:31:01.320 --> 03:31:06.680
[Guest]: in a field that you don't work in, you realize how bad you are. So in politics, I'm less equipped to

03:31:06.680 --> 03:31:11.560
[Guest]: judge my bias than I am in finance. Reading that gave me a perspective on, okay, the bias exists.

03:31:11.560 --> 03:31:15.800
[Guest]: One interesting book that I'm reading right now is actually Josie Joseph's book.

03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:23.640
[Guest]: It's an incredibly scary read, and you realize how like the deep state in India has existed and

03:31:23.640 --> 03:31:29.800
[Guest]: vilified people in general throughout the process. I know you talked to Josie in a podcast recently,

03:31:29.800 --> 03:31:39.240
[Guest]: so that is an absolute must read. I also think reading just about, say, philosophy and stoicism

03:31:39.240 --> 03:31:44.280
[Guest]: and stoicism is something that I've just started reading on because I actually now believe that

03:31:44.280 --> 03:31:48.200
[Guest]: it's important to be a stoic if you want to do anything good in politics. You can't care about

03:31:48.200 --> 03:31:52.920
[Guest]: winning elections, you just do what you want to do. So Marcus Aurelius would be a good one to

03:31:52.920 --> 03:31:59.000
[Guest]: start on there. Epictetus, another excellent one, but yeah, philosophy. Wow, fantastic

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:03.320
[Amit Varma]: recommendations. And Shivam, thank you so much for your time today and for writing these two

03:32:03.320 --> 03:32:08.280
[Amit Varma]: wonderful books. And I can't wait to see what you do next, frankly. So thank you again for your time

03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:11.320
[Guest]: and insights. Thank you. Extremely great talking to you.

03:32:38.280 --> 03:32:41.080
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening.
