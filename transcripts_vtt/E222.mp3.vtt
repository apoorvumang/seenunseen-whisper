00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Here's a thought experiment I want you to think about and at the end of that

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.440
[Amit Varma]: experiment is a question. When I ask you that question I'd like you to pause this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.040
[Amit Varma]: podcast for a moment and take a stab at answering it. Imagine that you meet your

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.160
[Amit Varma]: future self in a zoom call that somehow travels through time. You are allowed to

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.000
[Amit Varma]: ask this future version of you one question. How should I live my life? What

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.880
[Amit Varma]: answer does your future self give? That's my question to you. What advice does your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.360
[Amit Varma]: future self give you when it comes to living your life? Pause and answer this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.920
[Amit Varma]: for me. Well here's my answer. My future self tells me two words. Pay attention.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.120
[Amit Varma]: When I think about the way I live my life that's one thing I don't do enough

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.600
[Amit Varma]: of. That's one thing all of us don't do enough of. We spend time living in the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.680
[Amit Varma]: past or the future and not enough in the present and when we are in the present

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.920
[Amit Varma]: we are not paying attention. We are always distracted, always absent. Think

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.360
[Amit Varma]: about the modern marriage for example. What is the modern marriage? Two people

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.880
[Amit Varma]: side-by-side in their bed, lights off, their face illuminated by the blue glow

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
[Amit Varma]: from the screen in front of them. What is the modern family? Maybe together

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.360
[Amit Varma]: sometimes physically but always alone together. You sit with your loved ones

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
[Amit Varma]: and stare into your phone. You sit at a cafe and never once look around you. You

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.380
[Amit Varma]: find yourself in a beautiful place and you take pictures one after another, even

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.080
[Amit Varma]: high-definition video so that you don't lose a moment and in doing so you don't

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.400
[Amit Varma]: even get to live the moment. One thing I'd like to do more of in the time that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
[Amit Varma]: I have left is be present in the moment. Pay attention. Pay attention to all the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800
[Amit Varma]: sensations around me. Pay attention to the people around me who might not be

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.380
[Amit Varma]: there tomorrow when it will be too late and one of the things I should pay

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.960
[Amit Varma]: attention to is my own body. What is it telling me? What am I doing wrong? And

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: also what food am I putting into it? I mean this is my body. The soul only

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.240
[Amit Varma]: exists as a metaphor. My body is all of me. So what I put into it should be a big

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.160
[Amit Varma]: big deal. Is it a big deal for you? How deeply have you thought about the food

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.640
[Amit Varma]: that you eat?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.000
[Unknown]: behavioral science. Please welcome your host Amit Verma.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is Nandita Iyer, famous food

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.440
[Amit Varma]: writer and author of the wonderful new book Everyday Superfoods. Nandita is a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.040
[Amit Varma]: medical doctor who was an early food blogger and then took her passion for

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.640
[Amit Varma]: food and writing into Instagram, YouTube and columns and books. Her writing about

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.120
[Amit Varma]: food has both conceptual clarity and practical utility and in this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800
[Amit Varma]: conversation we shoot the breeze about a lot more than that. Like all the rest of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.520
[Amit Varma]: us Nandita contains multitudes and this episode reveals aspects of her that will

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.040
[Amit Varma]: be shocking to many including how her friends once cut open a human skull while

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.600
[Amit Varma]: singing happy birthday to her. And also we have a bit of music at the start of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.600
[Amit Varma]: the conversation so if you listen to this podcast at a higher speed as you

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.840
[Amit Varma]: should you might need to come to 1x just for that. But first let's take a quick

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.400
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. These days I have taken to preaching the virtues of mindfulness

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.640
[Amit Varma]: and there is nothing we should be more mindful of than human behavior. One of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720
[Amit Varma]: the great books I have read in recent times is Behave by Robert Sapolsky and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.480
[Amit Varma]: many of his incredible insights are now available to you for free. Head on over

[Amit Varma]: lectures Sapolsky takes us through the neurology of the brain, how hormones can

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.800
[Amit Varma]: shape us, how behavior evolved, the role of genes, what studying animals tells us

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.040

[Guest]: listener for quite some time it's absolute pleasure and honor to be on your

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.640
[Amit Varma]: on and absolutely about time even if it is on the occasion of this wonderful

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.320
[Amit Varma]: book you've written everyday superfoods you know you should have been on earlier

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.800
[Amit Varma]: in the past but I'm going to kind of start this with an unusual request

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.480
[Amit Varma]: because I have just discovered as recently as yesterday that you sing as

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.920
[Amit Varma]: well that you're studying Hindustani classical music so why don't you sing a

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.320
[Amit Varma]: little bit of some song that counts as your comfort song that in difficult

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.640
[Guest]: times some songs that brings you peace. Well that would be great and I'm happy I

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.400
[Guest]: think I'll be the first person to be singing on your show so I'm very happy

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.800
[Guest]: to be doing that. Just a second I'll start my taanpura in the background so

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.920
[Amit Varma]: I know what scale to sing at. Sure sure.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.000
[Guest]: I'm just going to sing a couple of lines from a bandish that I'm learning

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.160
[Guest]: currently in Raag Yaman and Raag Yaman is like the most primary raag that people

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.440
[Guest]: start learning when they learn Hindustani classical music but it's also

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.400
[Guest]: like it's nothing primary that it's extremely deep and people can actually

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.440
[Guest]: learn it for a decade and still not have learnt enough so that's a little bit

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:22.360
[Unknown]: about the raag.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:46.600
[Unknown]: Unahi ke sangva aali di

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:56.360
[Unknown]: Neha kaise laga ho mora re

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:09.760
[Unknown]: Bhavara samana bhatkata tha

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:28.160
[Unknown]: Mana moraab toh neet hi

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:49.160
[Unknown]: Unahi ke daras anuraga Neha kaise laga ho mora re

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah that was lovely. I mean I don't really understand Hindustani classical

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.000
[Amit Varma]: music but that was so soothing and you know maybe at the end of the episode if

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.600
[Amit Varma]: you have the energy we'll do a bit of that. My mom was a Hindustani classical

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.360
[Amit Varma]: musician by the way and she died I think but 12 and a half years ago so to say

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.360
[Amit Varma]: and it's very interesting I was I was kind of reading through your book and

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.080
[Amit Varma]: your food memories and all of that and I was thinking how you know at different

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.760
[Amit Varma]: parts of your life the kind of food that you eat or the things that you drink are

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.000
[Amit Varma]: so connected to memories that you have you know so I could you know when I

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.840
[Amit Varma]: think of what is sort of my comfort food my mind immediately goes back to a

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.440
[Amit Varma]: few things my mother used to cook in my childhood in the 1980s you know one of

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.600
[Amit Varma]: her delicacies being something called fishala keev and I've never quite had

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.280
[Amit Varma]: fishala keev like that anywhere else but that of course is how it is food is so

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.800
[Amit Varma]: imbued with memories and one of the things I kind of liked about your

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.800
[Amit Varma]: writing is a recognition of the personal that your food writing isn't dry it is

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.080
[Amit Varma]: not like these are the recipes and these are the ingredients and this has vitamins

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.240
[Amit Varma]: and this has that and this is how you make it together but you know so much of

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.960
[Amit Varma]: your writing is also interspersed with the personal that which is quite

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.800
[Amit Varma]: charming but so I I will you know I of course do begin all my shows with the

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.800
[Amit Varma]: personal but there's all the more reason to do so here as well so take me back to

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.480
[Amit Varma]: your childhood which is of course you know in the city where I have lived in

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.080
[Amit Varma]: for more than a couple of decades tell me about you know growing up in Bombay

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.400
[Amit Varma]: what that was like early memories of food if there are early memories of food

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.280
[Amit Varma]: because I I don't want to commit the danger of you know just because you are

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.400
[Amit Varma]: such a prominent food writer and all that of just associating you with food

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.480
[Amit Varma]: ask everything about food I don't want to do that people contain multitudes as

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.960
[Amit Varma]: I like saying on the show to tell me about your childhood how was it growing

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.120
[Guest]: up in Bombay what was your family like so I was a 70s kid and I was born in

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.760
[Guest]: Bombay like you said and my three generations like right from my great

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:57.880
[Guest]: grandparents who had moved to Bombay in 1930s early 1930s and then of course my

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.200
[Guest]: grandparents and my parents and then me so I'm like a though I'm Tamil but I'm

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:11.880
[Guest]: fourth generation Mumbiker and yeah so I was the first in my generation both from

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.680
[Guest]: my paternal side and the maternal side so both my parents being the eldest kids

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.760
[Guest]: I was the first in my generation while you know I was pampered a lot and like

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.000
[Guest]: of course like the first child in any like a generation is always most

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.160
[Guest]: welcomed and it's the novelty like people are literally looking at diapers

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:39.480
[Guest]: after 20 years you know so I also I was living with my grandparents my three

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.120
[Guest]: maternal aunts and while my mom and dad were in the same city they both were

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.720
[Guest]: working so I was brought up by my grandparents and my aunts essentially

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.800
[Guest]: and my mom used to come over on weekends etc and we had this kind of different

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.800
[Guest]: arrangement for those days because it was not very common but and I would have

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.040
[Guest]: a tough time explaining to friends like where is your mother how how do you have

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.720
[Guest]: five mothers like you know three aunts one mom and one grandmom strong feminine

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.480
[Guest]: influence around me and like where are your parents they hardly come for any

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.440
[Guest]: school days so that that was my childhood and I think over a period of

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.760
[Guest]: time I got used to answering those questions and dealing with that my my

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.600
[Guest]: life is different from other kids who live in these nuclear families just

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.840
[Guest]: parents and kids or a sibling and my sister is 10 years younger to me so for

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: the longest time I was a single child all through my you know childhood and

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.680
[Guest]: that I think that also played a big role in shaping who I am today because one

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.760
[Guest]: growing up with grandparents there is that kind of undeniable generation gap

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.320
[Guest]: where you want to do something and you know you are a bit wired then they don't

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.640
[Guest]: want they have very strict rules also being this you know Tamil family but

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.160
[Guest]: although even Bombay I think I had a more conservative upbringing than people

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.600
[Guest]: stories I hear about in tier 2 and tier 3 cities I think even their parents were

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.120
[Guest]: like a little more aspirational thing yeah be modern wear jeans you know have

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.960
[Guest]: boyfriends and stuff which it was never the case in my house is very strict so

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.920
[Guest]: going back to actually I want to go back to my great-grandparents moving to

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.840
[Guest]: Bombay because that's the story I really like and you know I find it interesting

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.720
[Guest]: how did you guys just suddenly pack up and come here from you know Tamil Nadu

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.880
[Guest]: and I had the privilege of having my great-grandmother in my life even when

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.160
[Guest]: my son was born so she's she lived to 85 86 so we actually have a five generation

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.400
[Guest]: picture of my great-grandmother my grandmother my mother me and my son so

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.080
[Guest]: I was telling my son if you were a daughter we would we would have been

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.680
[Guest]: five generations of women together but yeah it's okay I'll be I won't complain

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.720
[Guest]: yeah so my great-grandparents my great-grandfather moved to Bombay first

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.280
[Guest]: to look for prospects and all he already had three daughters by then in in a

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.960
[Guest]: small town in Tamil Nadu and he came to Bombay because also he knew that a lot

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.480
[Guest]: of people had migrated from there so he stayed with a cousin who lived near

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.520
[Guest]: Ruia college somewhere he stayed like for a couple of months and he had

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.320
[Guest]: actually done MA in English and history so there was no way that he would find a

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.600
[Guest]: job of any you know relevance in the small town in Tamil Nadu and he said okay

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.720
[Guest]: this is a good place for me to find look I'm looking for a job I have three

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: daughters to support and I need to do something with my life so he stayed in

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.560
[Guest]: this cousin's place for a month or two and then he got a job with Western

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.720
[Guest]: Railways and then the best option to find a place was Matunga or King Circle

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.360
[Guest]: because there was already the set community the people speaking your

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.560
[Guest]: language you know the vegetable vendors selling your kind of subzis, temples so

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.400
[Guest]: like that whole ecosystem was kind of set up for someone migrating to such a

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.480
[Guest]: big city even in 1930s like Bombay was the kind of an intimidating city for

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.840
[Guest]: someone who's never been outside their village before so they found this small

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.960
[Guest]: apartment in King Circle and you know I often ask my mom and aunts about these

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.240
[Guest]: stories so they said that in those days this two rent board would be hanging

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.480
[Guest]: from the trees and outside the buildings and the rent was it was 1930s and the

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.520
[Guest]: rent was around five rupees a month and my great-grandfather's salary in those

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.640
[Guest]: days was around 30 rupees and he had like three and he had three children to

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.800
[Guest]: support and pay the house rent and the school fees and everything right so the

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.360
[Guest]: funny thing was that anytime that two rent board changed into like someone

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.120
[Guest]: offering even like a four rupee fifty paisa people would just pick up their

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.680
[Guest]: stuff and move to the next possible house because there were hardly any

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.080
[Guest]: furniture in those days hardly any possessions except for your cooking

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.000
[Guest]: utensils two three pairs of clothes and a sack of coal which was your supply to

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.560
[Guest]: run the kitchen for the month and that was all and my mom and my aunts tell me

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.320
[Guest]: that this was the situation in most families but surprisingly these guys

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.520
[Guest]: never moved they stayed in the same apartment for over 50 years and even I

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.680
[Guest]: have been there and I have stayed there with them and I have good memories of

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.740
[Guest]: that place and I even after they moved out of that place I used to go back and

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.320
[Guest]: hang around there just you know for the kicks of nostalgia and getting all

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.440
[Guest]: sentimental about the place where my family first came into Bombay so I asked

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.620
[Guest]: my mom other than the cultural reason why Matunga and King Circle so she said

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.120
[Guest]: in those days that was the cheaper kind of available option given the salary

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.760
[Guest]: that Tata was earning and also that you know having a self-contained house with

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.480
[Guest]: a bathroom inside the house was also a very big deal in those days and those

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:05.440
[Guest]: houses were quite expensive to rent and this given that it was only five rupees

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.200
[Guest]: a month it was five rupees a month not only but it was still a good amount for

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.520
[Guest]: having a bathroom in the house when you have three daughters and you have a

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.760
[Guest]: bigger family you don't want to risk you know not having a bathroom in the house

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:24.320
[Guest]: so that was the other reason and I found it like wow I mean you know it fills me

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:30.120
[Guest]: with the kind of feeling that I can't really explain how things were at that

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.000
[Guest]: time and because I've lived so much with my grandparents I used to hear a lot of

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.120
[Guest]: stories from them about their times in early Bombay the one thing that I know

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.760
[Guest]: firsthand is that my mother's cousin brother who's also my great-grandparents

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.840
[Guest]: grandson he would often tell my great-grandparents that you guys you

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.360
[Guest]: have lived in Matunga like for 50 years but you would never learn proper Hindi

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.480
[Guest]: or Marathi and all the Sabzi Walas have learned Tamil and they call you when you

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.920
[Guest]: go buying vegetables that you know they will name all the vegetables in Tamil

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.840
[Guest]: saying Amma you're not taking this vegetable today so that was like the

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.160
[Guest]: standing joke in our family that how much of the Tamil culture they infused

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.040
[Guest]: into the UP people the Bihar people the Gujaratis like everybody just became a

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.320
[Guest]: part of that Tamil culture going to temples and everything just became part

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.040
[Guest]: of their DNA purely because it was such a cultural hub of Tamilians in Bombay so

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:34.120
[Guest]: that's about my great-grandparents and then my grandfather had a government job

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.440
[Guest]: and with the central government and so I was born in the house where he had a

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.040
[Guest]: quarters in Napien Sea Road and it was this big beautiful house facing the

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.960
[Guest]: Arabian Sea and those days the Priyadarshani Park had not yet come up it

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.680
[Guest]: came up just when we left that house so it was this unobstructed view of the

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.600
[Guest]: sea and I was so spoilt I would say what is this every day I wake up I only see

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.880
[Guest]: the sea view I mean little did I know that you know I would kill for such a

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.600
[Guest]: view later on in my life but talk about having something at your disposal every

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.200
[Guest]: day and you don't have the value for that at all like especially in the

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.200
[Guest]: monsoons the you couldn't even open the balcony door because the winds would

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.840
[Guest]: come howling inside and push the door back so those are the memories I have of

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.920
[Guest]: growing up in Napien Sea Road and I didn't know that this was literally the

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.040
[Guest]: creme de la creme area to live in Bombay for me yeah it was just a house and it

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.280
[Guest]: was just a place in Bombay I had no idea about the suburbs and you know the

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.680
[Guest]: different hierarchies it was fun it was like this huge quarters government

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.640
[Guest]: quarters lots of families of you know different languages religions it was

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.200
[Guest]: like a melting pot and it was no longer just like a Tamil hub there was this

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.960
[Guest]: temple and lots of friends to play with so that that that was the first ten

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.920
[Guest]: years of my life and I attended school somewhere there near Chowpatty I was

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.800
[Guest]: always like quite a studious kid also because I didn't I was not a very

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.640
[Guest]: outdoorsy kid and I was not the one to be playing out all the time so my mostly

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.440
[Guest]: I would be studying reading or learning music or mostly indoor kind of things to

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.880
[Guest]: do and so then I would without much effort I would be in the top one two

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.880
[Guest]: three ranks in school I don't think anybody ever bothered about it in my

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.560
[Guest]: house they said yeah okay your exams you're studying and because my mom would

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.040
[Guest]: sometimes come on the weekends before my exam to coach me on some asking do some

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.760
[Guest]: mock test and all with me because they said what is this girl doing nobody

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.080
[Guest]: knows whether she's studying or not studying so just to keep a little bit of

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.160
[Guest]: a watch on me and we would do these things I don't know am I supposed to go

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.480
[Amit Varma]: on and on yeah no I'll ask you a lot more because yeah all this is so

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.680
[Amit Varma]: fascinating to me and I was I was actually you know I live in Andheri so I

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.800
[Amit Varma]: was thinking yeah okay humble beginnings in Matunga but suddenly you said

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.600
[Amit Varma]: Napiency Road and Napiency Road is so posh by the way for people who don't

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.160
[Amit Varma]: know Bombay that I've never even been there in more than 20 years because I

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.000
[Amit Varma]: don't have posh friends it is super posh I was I was struck by you know I'm

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.720
[Amit Varma]: really glad that you spoke about your great-grandparents because one of the

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.000
[Amit Varma]: things that sort of struck me and it's something that I was I've been kind of

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.720
[Amit Varma]: thinking about recently because I have to move house soon as soon as the

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.880
[Amit Varma]: lockdown gets over and the situation gets better and I'm just thinking of all

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.640
[Amit Varma]: the things we have to shift and how many of them seem to be you know needless

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.480
[Amit Varma]: just things that you accumulate over the sort of the decades and and you know the

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.880
[Amit Varma]: thousands of books even feel like extremely out of place because you know

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I do most of my reading on the Kindle or on the laptop and all of that it's very

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.040
[Amit Varma]: striking and something that we may not think about or take for granted that the

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.320
[Amit Varma]: things you mentioned that they used to shift with were you know you mentioned

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.200
[Amit Varma]: cooking utensils first so you have your cooking utensils and then whatever

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.320
[Amit Varma]: clothes you have and that's pretty much it while today you know in our modern

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.240
[Amit Varma]: worlds we love so much furniture so much electronics so many books so many curios

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.680
[Amit Varma]: and artifacts and all of that and and yet at a time cooking utensils are so

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.400
[Amit Varma]: fundamental like I remember I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra on

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.000
[Amit Varma]: partition where she's done this beautiful book on objects that people

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.880
[Amit Varma]: bring with them from partition and in many cases ever utensils because when

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.480
[Amit Varma]: people ran away from home that was the one thing they took with them partly for

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.160
[Amit Varma]: practical reasons of course because you know you may have to cook your own food

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.520
[Amit Varma]: while you're on the road and it's good to have something to cook it in because

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.160
[Amit Varma]: you know obviously you can't take some dal in your palm and hold that over the

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.760
[Amit Varma]: fire but did food and cooking was it ever something that ever interested you

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.020
[Amit Varma]: did you have to learn to cook when you were a kid especially when you were in a

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.240
[Amit Varma]: joint family with five mothers so to say three aunts one grandmom one mom was the

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.080
[Amit Varma]: kitchen a different kind of space like today you know in our experience of say

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.960
[Amit Varma]: nuclear households the kitchen isn't such a big deal but I can imagine that

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.960
[Amit Varma]: in a large joint family the kitchen would have played a different kind of

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.240
[Amit Varma]: role where almost a community space as it were do you have memories of any of

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.480
[Amit Varma]: that or is food just something that you know you ate absentmindedly while

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.720
[Guest]: growing up and didn't really think about yeah it's a very good question and you

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.600
[Guest]: know I get asked this quite a bit because people want to know if I was

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.440
[Guest]: always into cooking and did I start early see because having so many women

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.000
[Guest]: in the house and like I said I was the first child in my generation I was not

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.880
[Guest]: expected to enter the kitchen at all in fact if I even entered the kitchen I

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.760
[Guest]: would be shooed away saying go read go practice music or do something do

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.600
[Guest]: something worthwhile don't waste your time in the kitchen that was what was

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.640
[Guest]: told to me and despite the fact that like I said they were very traditional

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.280
[Guest]: and conservative but I think it's something about this being in a Bombay a

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.800
[Guest]: very aspirational city that there was the subtle thing that you had to do

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.680
[Guest]: something great in your life you know no matter what so you need to focus on

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.800
[Guest]: building those skills and that though I never was overtly a pressure to do

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.320
[Guest]: anything like nobody ever scolded me if I didn't get first rank but I did have

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.200
[Guest]: that pressure on myself since I was very young I don't know beat something like a

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.920
[Guest]: competitive spirit or if I do something I want to excel at it I don't want to be

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.640
[Guest]: in the middle like if I put an effort I need to see some good results for that

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:29.000
[Guest]: so yeah so I never I hardly ever entered the kitchen and like even my

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.880
[Guest]: grandfather I even remember as late as you know in before 12th standard I was

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:41.600
[Guest]: attending these classes in Dadar Agarwal classes to study maths and physics and

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.760
[Guest]: stuff to you know get good marks in the 12th science exams and those days we

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.160
[Guest]: were living in Mulund and I just take the local train leave home at around 5

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.560
[Guest]: 30 a.m. so I could reach the class at 7 o'clock when it started in the morning

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.720
[Guest]: and my grandfather would wake up at 5 and he would like standard two slices of

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.240
[Guest]: bread with jam and butter a glass of milk or whatever it would be there for

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.920
[Guest]: me ready when I got up at 5, gulp it down so 5.30 like get ready and 5.30 out

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.360
[Guest]: of the house and he would take me to the bus stop and then I would take the train

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.480
[Guest]: etc so there was nowhere expected that I had to do this on my own like even my

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.680
[Guest]: grandfather would do these things for me their priorities were very clear you

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.000
[Guest]: have to study well and you have to do something good with your life and also

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.080
[Guest]: for them it was like a kitchen was like what are you going to do in the kitchen

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.080
[Guest]: how is it going to help your life in any way and maybe later on when you're

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.960
[Guest]: independent anyway you'll have to be wasting your time here so might as well

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.000
[Guest]: don't do it now when there are so many of us to handle and in my family also

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.560
[Guest]: because they were so traditional they were very exacting requirements of how

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.160
[Guest]: everything has to be made so there was no place for a person like me with no

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.280
[Guest]: real knowledge about what exactly is going into anything and if I come they

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.520
[Guest]: think I'm only going to mess up something so that was the other reason I

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.600
[Guest]: was not allowed and like they were so super careful every time they were

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.120
[Guest]: making these like say Diwali sweets or some festival things they would keep the

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.440
[Guest]: gas on the floor and my grandmother would sit on the floor and make all

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.040
[Guest]: these things because it's it's tough to keep standing for like two and three

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.920
[Guest]: hours and you know do it on the standing counter so when that used to happen when

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.840
[Guest]: I was a much younger child you literally draw like a Lakshman Rekha outside the

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.080
[Guest]: kitchen and say you're not supposed to cross this and I would have all these

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.640
[Guest]: insane super aromas coming to me and I could not even cross the line and go

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.600
[Guest]: into the kitchen because they were worried that there's this whole plan of

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.240
[Guest]: boiling oil and you know they wouldn't trust me to be safe around that so those

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.560
[Guest]: are the things that I remember and the other very fond memories like these

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.800
[Guest]: Diwali times when my aunts even much later on my grandmother they would all

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.480
[Guest]: sit on the floor you know that was like a very unique and a fun situation

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.160
[Guest]: because usually that cooking was so mechanical and you know one person

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.240
[Guest]: standing on the counter and finishing off the things but this seemed like such

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.960
[Guest]: a community fun exercise they'll be gossiping about something or the other

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.360
[Guest]: and I would feel like I'm missing out on all the fun because I'm not even

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.560
[Guest]: allowed to go inside so I grew up not knowing much about cooking at all and I

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.200
[Guest]: think when I was 10 or something I learned to make a dosa from my

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.280
[Guest]: grandmother like standing on the stool and you know learning how it's made

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.800
[Guest]: that's because I kind of liked that process and it felt a bit like a craft

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.480
[Guest]: fun kind of project to do so that's one thing I learned I knew to make tea and

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.440
[Guest]: that's about it I knew nothing else growing up I just went to college with

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.520
[Amit Varma]: only this much knowledge about cooking yeah and no one of the things that you

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.880
[Amit Varma]: that you said that struck me and I'm just thinking aloud here is that

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.840
[Amit Varma]: perhaps you were given this push because you were in Bombay and it was this

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.840
[Amit Varma]: feeling of that hey we are in Bombay it's an opportunity so don't let it go

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.920
[Amit Varma]: to waste and you know which might not have been the case in a smaller town and

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.720
[Amit Varma]: I think as an extension of that I wonder if one could then say that a lot of

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.160
[Amit Varma]: parents who themselves have come up the hard way who were to fight for

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.640
[Amit Varma]: everything who perhaps just because of the times but perhaps because they've

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.520
[Amit Varma]: actually moved their way up that because they've had to fight all the way and and

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.160
[Amit Varma]: now they can you know offer the kid more opportunities they pressurize the kid so

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.360
[Amit Varma]: much because they feel that it's now almost obligatory to make use of the

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.280
[Amit Varma]: opportunities that they never had and I wonder if there's something similar at

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.800
[Amit Varma]: play so tell me something in these years growing up as you were where you are

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.840
[Amit Varma]: both you know in a traditional family where in a sense you're rooted but also

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.320
[Amit Varma]: you're driven you're ambitious you're doing things you're going to Agarwal's

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.720
[Amit Varma]: classes and all of that and you're a science kid and a good student neither

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.960
[Amit Varma]: of which I ever was so what what's your conception of yourself at this time like

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.640
[Amit Varma]: you did go on to become a medical doctor and we'll chat about that more but at

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.160
[Amit Varma]: this point in time as you're growing up in your through your childhood and

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.560
[Amit Varma]: through your teens and as you're getting to college what's your conception of

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.280
[Amit Varma]: yourself do you have fantasies about what you will do later on in life are

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.520
[Amit Varma]: there anything you could call either ambitions or dreams or are you just kind

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.160
[Amit Varma]: of going with the flow and just trying to excel in whatever is immediately in

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.960
[Amit Varma]: front of you which could be the exams or Agarwal's classes or whatever this is

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.840
[Guest]: such a question that it's really making me introspect I have never thought about

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.720
[Guest]: this myself to be honest and I knew coming as a guest on your podcast is

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.520
[Guest]: going to make me think a lot about myself and discover some things which I

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.400
[Guest]: had not really given a thought to earlier you know when I was born I was

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.640
[Guest]: born in that Napiency Road house like I told you our neighbors their eldest

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.160
[Guest]: daughter was a was an IAS officer and on the 11th day or 12th day they have this

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.080
[Guest]: cradle ceremony for the baby and in my house because I was the first kid there

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.800
[Guest]: was no earlier cradles in the house to put me in so they borrowed this cradle

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.360
[Guest]: from the next-door neighbor that belonged to the lady who was already

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.880
[Guest]: grown up by then she was the IAS officer and already in those days so they were

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.880
[Guest]: all saying she are going to become an IAS officer that was like something that

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:15.160
[Guest]: was driven to me I didn't even know what was IAS officer but I clearly remember

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.320
[Guest]: that term from very early on in childhood like maybe when I was 3 or 4

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.520
[Guest]: I knew that there's something like this IAS officer and my folks want me to

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.480
[Guest]: become that so that was the earliest thing of anything related to a career

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.800
[Guest]: that I ever you know even came across that that you may have this choice later

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.320
[Guest]: on in life that what to do in life you know and I was in grade 3 and 4 in our

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.680
[Guest]: school in the report card I would always get this my budding scientist something

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.560
[Guest]: like that teachers would write a comment and I think at that age these kind of

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.800
[Guest]: words somehow see I'm right now I'm almost 45 and I still remember those

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.280
[Guest]: words that were written in my report card so I think when teachers write

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.320
[Guest]: something like that and especially if the teachers you like write a comment

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.080
[Guest]: like that on your report card it's somewhere just plays on your mind and

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.000
[Guest]: you feel wow I am capable of this and it gives you that push and and that sense

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.600
[Guest]: that that is possible you know so I think that also stayed on my mind that

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.840
[Guest]: I maybe I'm supposed to do science maybe that's good for me but at the same time

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.400
[Guest]: I also loved writing early on as a kid like I had a lot of me time lot of

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.960
[Guest]: boredom because I didn't have a sibling for the longest time and I stayed with

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.920
[Guest]: my grandparents and I didn't have too many friends so all my spare time was

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.900
[Guest]: like spent writing something must be quite silly but I used to write and like

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.720
[Guest]: small poems and all I my mom has still preserved some diary sometime and

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.080
[Guest]: embarrassing embarrassingly she shows it to me at times it please I don't want

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:55.360
[Guest]: to see it now so I would keep writing and you know my aunts and my mom would

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.480
[Guest]: also say I'm good at this maybe you know it's something it's not not something I

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: ever thought about myself but there's a lot of little external influences that

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.360
[Guest]: unknowingly just settle down in the different you know levels of your head

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.520
[Guest]: and you feel maybe this maybe that I definitely loved English I loved words

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.840
[Guest]: and I loved the language and I said maybe this is this will make me happy

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.080
[Guest]: but in those days also there was a thing that you know if you got the least marks

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.680
[Guest]: in college is where you went to arts by default so the thing was you get a 95

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.600
[Guest]: plus you have you don't even have to think you're going into science

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.440
[Guest]: somewhere like 70s you're going to commerce and how 50s you're going to

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.360
[Guest]: arts and as stupid as that may sound today but that was how things were for

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.540
[Guest]: 70s kids we didn't really have any other options and for girls oh you like a good

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.280
[Guest]: you know feminine instinct and also medicine is good for you and boys you

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.000
[Guest]: like straightaway engineering you were not expected to think so much there was

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.680
[Guest]: nothing like career counseling and what is good for you what's your aptitude

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:02.040
[Guest]: nothing of that sort I think I was always going with the flow I never

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.720
[Guest]: really thought too much into it and neither did my family put like too much

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.480
[Guest]: thought like what is she going to do and they just thought whatever she does she

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.560
[Guest]: will do it okay like I was pretty self-motivated and driven so they didn't

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.280
[Guest]: really bother about what I'm going to do in my life and neither did I think about

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.440
[Amit Varma]: it to be honest so you know I did an episode with Sharda Ugra recently and in

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.880
[Amit Varma]: that Sharda was talking about how she was a 70s kid and I was saying I'm an

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.280
[Amit Varma]: 80s kid and the interesting thing is that you know you just gave your age

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.400
[Amit Varma]: away and I've realized I'm a little older than you and yet you are

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.720
[Amit Varma]: describing yourself as a 70s kid which I don't do because I don't really

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.400
[Amit Varma]: remember I was I was I was too much of a kid in the 70s to remember any of it so

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I think of myself more as an 80s kid because that is where my memories of

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.200
[Amit Varma]: kiddery were but I'm struck by a phrase that you used here which is something

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.240
[Amit Varma]: that you know was not even a phrase back in the day because it was the default

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.760
[Amit Varma]: and today is very much a phrase which is me time you know back in the day we had

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.000
[Amit Varma]: no me time because you know we have no laptops we have no internet we have no

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.200
[Amit Varma]: cell phones we have nothing you know if you're lucky we have some books around

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.760
[Amit Varma]: us but even even for a regular reader how much can you read so you you kind of

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.080
[Amit Varma]: do get a lot of me time that way and I know exactly what that's like so tell me

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.320
[Amit Varma]: a little bit about what kind of books did you read and what kind of writing

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.840
[Amit Varma]: did you do like firstly everything we write as children is obviously cringeworthy

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.880
[Amit Varma]: later if you're going to look at it with adult eyes obviously it's not going to

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.880
[Amit Varma]: pass standard no you should see what I wrote as a kid but nevertheless so what

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.640
[Amit Varma]: what were the kind of books that you read in those days and what kind of

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.560
[Guest]: writing did you like to do you know I have memories of this book a bookshop in

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.400
[Guest]: Napiency Road I think it was called Shobna I'm not very sure but I remember

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.280
[Guest]: going there like every fortnight with my grandfather and I've just opened that

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.880
[Guest]: door and this gush of cool very nice smelling air-conditioning would hit my

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.200
[Guest]: face and that itself was like so welcoming and that was just like one of

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.760
[Guest]: the many pleasures to be had when you enter that store those were still my

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.440
[Guest]: fairy tale and those kind of book reading days so I would pick up one book

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.040
[Guest]: and it was it was a store not a library so whatever my grandfather bought within

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.940
[Guest]: 10 minutes of coming home I would have finished reading that and he said okay

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.720
[Guest]: now you either read the same book again and again until I take you back or you

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.120
[Guest]: read something else so don't come and tell me it's finished so take your own

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:37.120
[Guest]: time with it so I think that that really made me eager made me an eager reader

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.960
[Guest]: just like taking me to the bookstore as a treat you know a lot of summer

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.120
[Guest]: holidays and holidays because I was living with my grandparents I would be

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.400
[Guest]: shooed off to my great-grandparents house during the holidays because I have

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.560
[Guest]: to go somewhere right I can't stay in the same place forever and holiday time

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.280
[Guest]: you have to shift and you know spend time with your other relatives or do

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.280
[Guest]: something that's what we used to do in like we had nothing else fancy to do in

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.240
[Guest]: our days my great-grandfather was a voracious reader like even like whatever

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:13.060
[Guest]: newspaper that he used to read literally end to end every word and sometimes he

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.640
[Guest]: would be lazing on in his easy chair and he would say that okay this full page

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.200
[Guest]: you have to read to me now and I would keep watching like is he asleep can I

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.160
[Guest]: stop reading because he doesn't seem to be listening to anything and sometimes

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.600
[Guest]: it used to be about politics and like absolutely the kind of subjects that you

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.300
[Guest]: may not be interested in at all or it makes no sense to you but he just wanted

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.360
[Guest]: you to read it to know that there are all these different words and all this

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.280
[Guest]: different vocabulary and sometimes he would make me like read something

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.760
[Guest]: complicated and say now write this very simply you know in one page or something

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.760
[Guest]: so that that's the kind of vacation fun quote-unquote that we had and also the

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.080
[Guest]: big thing that made me interested in these things that when I used to go

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.280
[Guest]: there during my holidays I was out of my comfort zone I didn't have my familiar

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.960
[Guest]: books and toys and whatever you know things that I was comfortable doing in

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.360
[Guest]: my free time so I had to find out new things to do and they had this balcony

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.760
[Guest]: and in that King Circle apartment complex there were like four or five

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.520
[Guest]: buildings and in between there was this big courtyard kind of space with a water

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:24.240
[Guest]: tank and all that and every afternoon a bunch of cows would come and sit there

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.240
[Guest]: for relaxation so these cows would be sitting there and swatting flies and

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.360
[Guest]: generally like chilled out and you can't imagine I've like watched them for hours

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.120
[Guest]: on end to kill my time because I had nothing better to do and other thing was

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.440
[Guest]: all because that was like the open courtyard where all the other buildings

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.400
[Guest]: could see what's happening all the vendors would come there right from salt

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:52.640
[Guest]: guy to banana guy vegetable guy and my other favorite pastime was to mimic all

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.720
[Guest]: their calls and because you know that this balcony level was like say to the

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.560
[Guest]: level of my shoulder or something so I could I would just mimic the call back

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.000
[Guest]: and hide under that thing so they would like wonder where is the sound coming

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.880
[Guest]: from and at the lower level there were these Jali so I could see that he's

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.800
[Guest]: wondering where's the sound coming from so these were the kind of creative

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.600
[Guest]: vacation pastimes that I had because I was no one else to play with and it's a

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.040
[Guest]: new place and I had I used to always take too much time making any friends so

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: it's not the place where I live regularly so I would not go out and play

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.400
[Guest]: with I don't know these people I can't go so this was you know all part of this

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.320
[Guest]: creative process and a way in which boredom really spurs on your creativity

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.400
[Guest]: to do something nice because you're so bored out of your skull and you say okay

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.960
[Guest]: let me do something fun you know let me write or let me draw something or let me

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:53.000
[Guest]: create something and later on I think I read the philosopher J Krishnamurti has

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.200
[Guest]: written something very similar that boredom is the best way to creativity

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:04.080
[Guest]: and I was like well I knew this from my childhood itself so I mean I don't

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.840
[Guest]: really remember what books I specifically read but a lot of fairy

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:14.880
[Guest]: tales Grimm's you know some inspirational autobiographies and and

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.880
[Guest]: then later on of course when I became a teenager I read all the usual paperbacks

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.080
[Guest]: that Sidney Sheldon Daniel Steele everything that was available in India

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.920
[Guest]: yeah I never read a Milson Boone though for the simple reason that I found that

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.880
[Guest]: it's too small I'll finish it too quickly so I don't even want to get into

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.640
[Guest]: this so I was reading the usual novels fiction I was not much into nonfiction I

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.480
[Amit Varma]: would love medical fiction also excellent you know and you know speaking

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.600
[Amit Varma]: of boredom being a spur to creativity there's also the saying about an idle

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.760
[Amit Varma]: mind being a devil's workshop but that that courtyard sounds so fascinating it

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.720
[Amit Varma]: sounds like a kind of a setting for an urban malgudi days as it were and indeed

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.360
[Amit Varma]: you know courtyards do have a special place in some Indian literature as well

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.800
[Amit Varma]: because almost like a gathering place of sorts and as the other sort of thread

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.320
[Amit Varma]: that I instantly connected with and I don't know if it's it's probably going

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.680
[Amit Varma]: to be a shared memory only for people of our generation is when you brought books

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and air-conditioning together you know you mentioned that you used to go to

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.620
[Amit Varma]: that store whatever it was in a PNC Road and the door would open and it blast of

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.640
[Amit Varma]: AC and I remember when I was in college in Ferguson College Pune I used to spend

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.600
[Amit Varma]: my afternoons at the British Council Library there on FC Road pretending to

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.440
[Amit Varma]: read books but actually combining my love for books with my love for

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:35.600
[Amit Varma]: air-conditioning so stuff that you know perhaps a future generation may take for

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.000
[Amit Varma]: granted you know unless there is a solar flare or something and there is no

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.560
[Amit Varma]: electricity and then they'll suddenly say how what was that we just went when

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.520
[Amit Varma]: they realize the importance of the internet and the electricity but I'm

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.560
[Amit Varma]: sounding too much like an old fogey now so tell me more about doing medical

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.800
[Amit Varma]: because on the one hand in this and you know in previous interviews you've kind

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.380
[Amit Varma]: of spoken about how you sort of wandered into doing medical because that was what

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.400
[Amit Varma]: was expected from a good student who were getting the kind of marks that you

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.920
[Amit Varma]: were but on the other hand you clearly had the aptitude and the bent of mind

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.360
[Amit Varma]: that a doctor actually needs and that bent of mind actually comes through in

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.720
[Amit Varma]: pretty much everything you have done since as well from what I can see which

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:22.320
[Amit Varma]: is you know sort of organized systematic going deeper and deeper into sort of

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.760
[Amit Varma]: first principles root causes all of that so tell me a little bit about what that

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.680
[Amit Varma]: process of doing medical was like did you you know was it natural for you was

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.600
[Amit Varma]: it easy for you was it something that interested you and was it something that

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you saw yourself doing for the rest of your life what was all of that like I

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.280
[Guest]: was always going with the flow and I had really not given a thought as to what

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.360
[Guest]: career I want to pursue and I got marks good enough to get a seat in a medical

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.160
[Guest]: college in Bombay and maybe if it was not in Bombay and if it was some rural

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.960
[Guest]: area my family would have thought twice about sending me away from this very

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.360
[Guest]: sheltered existence of the last 17 years but it was very much in Bombay and I

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:09.080
[Guest]: didn't have to stay in a hostel and things like that so I took admission in

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.800
[Guest]: that but I really didn't know what that life would be like even how would it be

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.160
[Guest]: to study medicine how would it be to practice medicine one thing I definitely

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.840
[Guest]: knew that it required a lot of dedication commitment and sacrifice to

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.160
[Guest]: practice medicine unless you are in a very specific branch like say pathology

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.840
[Guest]: but you could still get away with fixed working hours but if you were to

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.880
[Guest]: practice medicine or surgery then definitely you had to be available all

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.240
[Guest]: the time and when I joined I said you know yeah I if I do this I'm going to do

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.560
[Guest]: it well I am going to dedicate my life to being a good doctor if I get into

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.440
[Guest]: medical college it's not just you know studying for the heck of it because now

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.600
[Guest]: that I have got a seat I'm going to make the best of it you know there's this

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.480
[Guest]: incident that happened when I joined medical college it was the year of the

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:03.520
[Guest]: Mandal Commission and the admissions had got very delayed so you know in my times

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.760
[Guest]: the first year MBBS second MBBS and third MBBS were one and a half one and

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.960
[Guest]: a half one and a half years each so a total of four and a half years of

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.120
[Guest]: studies and one year of internship so that was five and a half years to

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.680
[Guest]: graduate so now in this one and a half years we had already joined six months

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.120
[Guest]: late because of the delay in the admission process when people are still

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.320
[Guest]: figuring out what kind of admissions to happen etc so but the first MBBS is also

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.400
[Guest]: a huge learning like within the first year itself your vocabulary goes up by

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.840
[Guest]: some 10,000 words because you are learning the kind of language which we

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:44.440
[Guest]: don't use as laypeople and just that kind of adjustment to seeing certain

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.040
[Guest]: things in such a stark light which was like a sheltered existence like me I've

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:55.800
[Guest]: never been exposed to anything and day one of medical college there is maybe a

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.720
[Guest]: little bit of some orientation or something huh you'll have these many

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.960
[Guest]: classes you'll have to get this much percentage this is the past percentage

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:07.720
[Guest]: some very basic orientation and then you know you're told come to the Anatomy

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:13.880
[Guest]: Hall so now they're 50 girls and 50 boys hundred kids in a class and a good like

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:19.160
[Guest]: 50-50 gender distribution there and okay you just wander into the Anatomy Hall

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:25.520
[Guest]: and first you're hit by that smell of formalin which literally makes you tear

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.360
[Guest]: up and like where am I come is someone like you know throwing gas some kind of

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.560
[Guest]: poisonous gas on my face by the time you recover from that you realize there are

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.720
[Guest]: tables and tables of naked dead bodies that you're staring at because it's a

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.640
[Guest]: dissection hall so all the unclaimed corpses are there and here you are with

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.640
[Guest]: a bunch of boys and girls that you've never met before in your life and you're

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:55.720
[Guest]: facing this scene which is like it's like a shock like I cannot explain I

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.080
[Guest]: don't think I've been so shocked in my life ever maybe today's kids may not

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.480
[Guest]: feel that way but we were still very innocent growing up and we didn't have

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.560
[Guest]: any exposure to any such gory stuff on TV or you know like Netflix that kids

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.200
[Guest]: now they just see and they brush off but for someone like me and I could

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.520
[Guest]: definitely tell it was the same for the boys and the girls in my class and it

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.440
[Guest]: was like a big big shock so that was like day one you feel like where have I

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:30.160
[Guest]: come you know and so that that smell and the sight and that general embarrassment

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.600
[Guest]: and everything put together so that was like and there were other classes like

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.280
[Guest]: in biochemistry and physiology but this is the one that stuck to me and I will

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:46.160
[Guest]: never forget that experience of that first day but we also adapt to something

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.880
[Guest]: strange like this so quickly. The new normal as it were. Exactly that new normal and within

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:59.160
[Guest]: like a couple of months we got used to seeing our anatomy professors

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.240
[Guest]: they will open their box on that very dissection table and start

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.480
[Guest]: eating their lunch and we would not cringe to see that also like you know

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:13.360
[Guest]: there's this dead body cut open in different stages and you know cadaver to

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.520
[Guest]: call it by the scientific term and somebody's just eating their lunch very

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.600
[Amit Varma]: coolly and like sharing do you want to eat this and that's also not advisable

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.920
[Guest]: right because it's not to be honest but I mean maybe I'm exaggerating a little

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.960
[Guest]: bit but even holding it in your hand with this view but it's not very

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.160
[Guest]: different from us watching absolutely gory stuff on Netflix and you know

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:40.240
[Guest]: eating our food in today's times we still do that right so but that that

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.880
[Guest]: also we got used to that and I think the other very very good memory of this

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.800
[Guest]: whole anatomy thing that I was still getting used to that it was my birthday

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.120
[Guest]: and you know we spent three three months dissecting each like one is HFN which is

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.080
[Guest]: head face and neck then what we call supex the arms then chest and abdomen

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.800
[Guest]: and then the lower extremities so in the head face and neck one very important

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.080
[Guest]: component is the brain where with a with a bone cutting machine the skull is cut

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.920
[Guest]: open and then they remove the brain and we are you know we understand what is in

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:24.440
[Guest]: the transverse section of each of the levels on the human brain right so it

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.560
[Guest]: was my birthday and we were cutting the brain and everybody sang happy birthday

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:34.840
[Guest]: to me it was I think about it now it was very amusing then but I think about it

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.200
[Guest]: now I think are we crazy or what like you know but but I think that's the

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.800
[Guest]: beauty of medical school you learn to see fun and you because your general

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:51.520
[Guest]: life is so you know full of fat books so much to study so much to learn you're

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.720
[Guest]: seeing disease you're seeing people in the worst stages of their life but you

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.120
[Guest]: learn to see some humor in things like these which keep you going I think it

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:08.120
[Guest]: provided some kind of you know soothing moments for the you're constantly

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.520
[Guest]: under stress and as a kid who was into every possible non-sporting

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:19.080
[Guest]: extracurricular activity like music or drawing or drama or anything I had to

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.720
[Guest]: give up everything when I joined medicine so that was also very here I

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.280
[Guest]: mean I had given up in 12th standard itself because had to make the most of

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:32.040
[Guest]: time and study etc so that also felt very I can't say depressing but it felt

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.760
[Guest]: like I had lost some of the fun in my life because these were the things I

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:41.360
[Guest]: really enjoyed doing and so that's how we learn to make the most of these

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.200
[Guest]: moments even in medical college when things felt like you know gloomy and you

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.760
[Guest]: were it was a tough I remember that time and I remember that it did feel quite

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:57.760
[Guest]: stressful because it was a huge jump getting used to regular science-based

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.400
[Guest]: college where you just learned physics chemistry biology to learning about humans

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.920
[Guest]: disease checking patients and you know hearing their stories and after all

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.720
[Guest]: imagine we just 17 years old just kids right I think in India we start this so

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.240
[Guest]: early in our foreign countries you have to finish your some full graduation and

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.880
[Guest]: then start studying medicine so here you can if you pass all your years in one

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:28.040
[Guest]: short you can well become a medical graduate at 22 which is very young to

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:33.760
[Guest]: kind of grasp the seriousness the realities and the kind of things that

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.440
[Guest]: accompany this very serious kind of study so these are my memories and yeah

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:43.240
[Guest]: I did well like I said the initial part of getting used to these things was a

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.840
[Guest]: struggle until then I could somehow my school and college I could get through

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.000
[Guest]: without studying much I would just you know pay attention in class and I could

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.640
[Guest]: manage to get good marks in the exams but this one some real effort had to go

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.840
[Guest]: into reading so much the books were so so huge so heavy that you wouldn't even

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.120
[Guest]: carry them anywhere you had to go where the book was the book couldn't come you

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.800
[Guest]: couldn't carry the book to you but it did instill in me a certain kind of

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:16.680
[Guest]: discipline of you know I used to wake up at 3 a.m. I think that's when I started

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.560
[Guest]: becoming a morning person so if I had to leave for college at around 7 I would

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.760
[Guest]: study from 3 to 6 because again a college was a train ride away and you

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.440
[Guest]: were exhausted when you came back home you couldn't really focus on studying at

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.680
[Guest]: that point of time so morning is when I felt this is the only time I can put in

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:40.480
[Guest]: some some time to study I had a natural liking for surgery because since

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.300
[Guest]: childhood I love to do things create things and not just speculate about okay

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.320
[Guest]: maybe will this work will that work so just get into the middle of the problem

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.440
[Guest]: and solve it and I always thought that I will pursue surgery in some form or the

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.420
[Guest]: other and I really liked it like think of it as a like a stitching or something

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.280
[Guest]: but in a very complex scenario where someone's life depends on it right I

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.080
[Guest]: loved surgery but I also liked medicine for the logic of it like a lot of things

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.000
[Guest]: in medicine are very logical if you understand certain basic principles even

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.160
[Guest]: without knowing pathophysiology of a particular disease you can kind of

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.320
[Guest]: interpret that this is how the things will progress and that kind of

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:26.800
[Guest]: application of logic I love that in medicine absolutely hated Gainac I would

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:32.240
[Guest]: like try to bunk every possible lecture without getting into trouble and just

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:38.240
[Guest]: watching women screaming and that kind of thing was not my cup of tea at all so

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.320
[Guest]: my first choice was surgery and my second choice was medicine but again I

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.720
[Guest]: had not finalized anything in my head I said I'll see how it goes and take it as

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:53.280
[Guest]: it comes and in my final year MBBS I got the results and I was declared failed

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.880
[Guest]: and for someone who has been a topper all my life it's good that I'm

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.400
[Guest]: reasonably strong mentally otherwise I don't know what would have been my

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.920
[Guest]: reaction to that I just I just couldn't believe that something like this could

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.480
[Guest]: happen and of course immediately I sent my papers for revaluation I had been

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:16.080
[Guest]: declared fail in medicine now out of 1,500 marks in final MBBS 500 is

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.920
[Guest]: medicine that's like one third of the entire curriculum which I have to

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:24.440
[Guest]: restudy if I'm not declared passed in the reval and just the thought of going

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.600
[Guest]: back to those books was like terrifying I just I said I had already done a good

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.560
[Guest]: job studying in the first place why am I supposed to do this all over again and

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.360
[Guest]: you know this was Bombay University and the center for all these corrections and

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.240
[Guest]: these admin work was in Kalina so literally every three four days I would

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.280
[Guest]: land up there and I would sit on that guy's head and think where is my paper

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.200
[Guest]: where's my reval I've not got it the next exam is nearing the re-examination

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.120
[Guest]: right and kind of I developed a rapport with that guy and he also started

00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:00.280
[Guest]: sympathizing saying this girl you know she's confident that she's going to pass

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.600
[Guest]: but the corrected paper is just not coming I kind of started losing hope and

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.120
[Guest]: I there was no other way but I started studying again for the next examination

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.720
[Guest]: and just two days before the re-exam this guy calls me because by then I we

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.360
[Guest]: were already exchanged phone numbers the admin guy in the university he calls me

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:25.000
[Guest]: saying look your result has come you are passed so you come immediately and

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.600
[Guest]: collect the result I don't want to put it in post because then it will not

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:34.080
[Guest]: reach you by the time you have to go for the next exam I think I went like I was

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.000
[Guest]: in tears and happiness and like it was such a relief not to have to give that

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.120
[Guest]: exam all over again and it was quite anti-climatic how my four and a half

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.560
[Guest]: years of medical studies ended in this kind of very low and then a high kind of

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.960
[Guest]: a situation and it was very excruciating and like I said we're not that old and

00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.480
[Guest]: we don't know how to take this kind of you know experiences in our life you're

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.160
[Guest]: not used to it and it was quite traumatic and I even remember that today

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.960
[Guest]: I wake up like with nightmares that I'm having to give my medical exam again

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:15.960
[Guest]: medicine exam again so that's where my medicine journey ended and like all my

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.920
[Guest]: classmates were shocked nobody could believe that I had failed and it was

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.280
[Guest]: kind of very embarrassing for me like how am I even going to face these people

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.520
[Guest]: you know not that I would think they would judge me but I was just judging

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:35.560
[Guest]: myself so badly and yeah so that that stint ended there. It's interesting you

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.960
[Amit Varma]: should talk about nightmares because you know I did arts and I did a BA in

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.880
[Amit Varma]: English literature only reason I chose that was because I knew I wouldn't have

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.000
[Amit Varma]: to study and obviously I sailed through and I never really cared about exams at

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.400
[Amit Varma]: all and yet for years afterwards I would get a nightmare that I hadn't managed to

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.640
[Amit Varma]: graduate or I wasn't getting my certificate or I had failed an exam

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.760
[Amit Varma]: while during those years it was never even on my mind I didn't give a shit I

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.880
[Amit Varma]: would have been happy to drop out so it's a very bizarre kind of not even a

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.080
[Amit Varma]: nightmare like a persistent dream that thankfully stopped a few years ago I was

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.720
[Amit Varma]: also stuck by how you said I became a morning person because I had to wake up

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.320
[Amit Varma]: at 3 a.m. like before this you were waking up as late as 5 a.m. having toast

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and jam and going to your agarwal classes and you become a morning person

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.120
[Amit Varma]: when you have to start waking up at 3. At an unearthly hour of 3. I love these

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:28.040
[Amit Varma]: definitions but the part that I love best about what you just told me about

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.080
[Amit Varma]: your medical years was that surreal scene that you cut open someone's skull

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.080
[Amit Varma]: and then they sing happy birthday you know that that sounds like a Louis

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.240
[Amit Varma]: Bonheur film almost or I can imagine you know an Eli Roth film starting like that

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.720
[Amit Varma]: where you have your opening scene close-up of skull the scalpel slices

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:50.040
[Amit Varma]: through it it opens out you know brains oozing out and then happy birthday to

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.720
[Amit Varma]: you starts and that's when the title starts have you have you seen do you

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.480
[Amit Varma]: watch horror films? Do I watch horror? No not much. There's this lovely series I

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.000
[Amit Varma]: love by Eli Roth who some would know for also being an actor he acted in

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds as well but he directed the series of films

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:15.560
[Amit Varma]: called Hostel which I think are absolutely brilliant there's just so much more so in

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:22.760
[Amit Varma]: in Hostel 2 there's a lovely scene towards the end where I don't know if

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll be judged for saying it's a lovely scene but it's a very striking scene

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.960
[Amit Varma]: right at the end where the end credits are happening where a bunch of people

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.760
[Amit Varma]: are kind of in the forest and two girls are being chased by someone I think and

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.920
[Amit Varma]: one of the girls is caught and she is beheaded and then they play football

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.520
[Amit Varma]: with a head and and and the end credits come on while they are playing football

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.080
[Amit Varma]: with a head and I thought as such a striking kind of scene and that's

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:52.760
[Amit Varma]: somehow what I remember. Mine was not as bad as that okay. It wasn't but it's the sort of the

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.680
[Amit Varma]: casualness of you know just that these are just body parts and what is a big

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.160
[Amit Varma]: deal and the whole casualness of it there of course the body part became a

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.680
[Amit Varma]: body part and not a living person because of actions on the part of the

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.760
[Guest]: protagonist well I'm sure you and your class never killed anyone. I don't want

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.760
[Guest]: people to judge me in thinking that you know we were too callous with the

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.960
[Guest]: cadavers we we would always thought you know like be very respectful and

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.920
[Guest]: grateful that people for whatever reason have landed up there and they are the

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.760
[Guest]: very reason that we are able to learn about the human body and understand you

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.920
[Guest]: know things which otherwise I mean at least in today's times of multimedia and

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.000
[Guest]: stuff you can still get a fair understanding even if you didn't dissect

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
[Guest]: a single cadaver but it was like really so important and the absolute basis of

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.640
[Guest]: everything you go on to learn later on in your medical school. And especially if

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.000
[Amit Varma]: you want to be a surgeon it's kind of essential I guess. Yeah no I mean I was

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.360
[Amit Varma]: drawn to that anecdote just by the element of black humor in there I guess

00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:01.000
[Amit Varma]: which is but let's let's move past that to something less black which is riots

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.240
[Amit Varma]: you know you've also described how a sort of a jarring incident in your early

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:11.240
[Amit Varma]: years as a doctor which you remember as an important moment for your choosing to

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.760
[Amit Varma]: give it up even though it had nothing to do with the profession per se tell me a

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.760
[Guest]: little bit about that what went on there. Once I finished my medicine I was put

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:26.300
[Guest]: into the internship rounds right so you have one year of internship and all my

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.920
[Guest]: classmates and my good friends from college they had already started their

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.280
[Guest]: internship five months before me because I was literally waiting for five months

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.640
[Guest]: to even get my results and usually you do internships in groups like you know

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.360
[Guest]: five six of you are together so you have like and this is the time you're

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.400
[Guest]: actually starting to see patients as a doctor and although I must make this

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.960
[Guest]: remark that most of the male patients would call us sister thinking that

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:55.560
[Guest]: because we are women we can't be doctors and even like the guy who's the is the

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.120
[Guest]: last ranker in our class is a doctor doctor he'll be like treating him with

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:04.200
[Guest]: so much respect but we are like nothing so we would go about in a group you know

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:10.040
[Guest]: for internship and here I was left all by myself I had nobody like it's also so

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.640
[Guest]: difficult that even it's the first time you're actually starting to do things on

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.280
[Guest]: your own it's always good to have your back covered by your friends and you can

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:23.040
[Guest]: jointly discuss and say what's what are we going to do and you know even you're

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.520
[Guest]: not questioned also on your own like if a senior professor is questioning is

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.640
[Guest]: questioning a group here it's like literally everywhere you're on your own

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.120
[Guest]: and I felt very exposed and very lonely in the whole process of internship and

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.760
[Guest]: again it was a huge transition from being a student to being a doctor and

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:48.000
[Guest]: having no support no friends and being on on my own those days was very

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.040
[Guest]: difficult more than anything else for this reason I felt very bad that my

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:57.920
[Guest]: papers weren't corrected properly because again it took made me rethink my

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:03.200
[Guest]: decision and I thought maybe this is not the right thing for me just having been

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.240
[Guest]: left alone and somehow I managed to still complete everything and I came out

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:13.120
[Guest]: of my internship with a degree you know also there's this team of when a whole

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.120
[Guest]: bunch of kids are doing this together to discuss okay we're going to apply

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.120
[Guest]: they're going to give these exams we're going to study for it together we're

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.420
[Guest]: going to apply to these colleges these are the specialties we want I was

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:26.640
[Guest]: completely out of the loop in all those discussions and I had nobody to discuss

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.000
[Guest]: those things with and even that kind of you know removed some of the steam from

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.960
[Guest]: my being very serious about pursuing a good career in surgery or something like

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.440
[Guest]: that when I got my degree I said okay let me do one thing I will work as an

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:47.240
[Guest]: RMO for some time which is like a medical officer and then I see you know

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:52.240
[Guest]: depending on what I feel I will decide what I want to do further because now

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.800
[Guest]: anyway I'm not in the rat race I have already fallen behind by six months so

00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.480
[Guest]: it doesn't matter there's no such rule that you have to join your PG as soon as

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.680
[Guest]: you finish your graduation so I was working there and I was straight put

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.000
[Guest]: into the ICU again very stressful because although I'm not expected to

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.480
[Guest]: take any decisions or do things on my own there's always the guidance of the

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.720
[Guest]: senior doctors the nurses etc but still it was like being thrown from straight

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.340
[Guest]: from one thing into like a boiling hot pan and have to figure out what to do

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:26.400
[Guest]: and you're only seeing critical patients again very stressful so that also made

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.040
[Guest]: me rethink whether this kind of stresses for a person like me is it good for my

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.960
[Guest]: temperament etc and I was there for like almost a year I think and somehow I was

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.080
[Guest]: learning all the you know ICU things around me because this is not something

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.740
[Guest]: that you're trained in in your medical colleges ICU work is like a whole

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.840
[Guest]: different ballgame everything is you know life and death decision kind of

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.640
[Guest]: thing it's a very high stress thing and now the intensivists are the one who are

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.600
[Guest]: like the forefront of the COVID warrior they are the ones taking these

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.280
[Guest]: decisions although you know given the lack of that many number of intensives

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280
[Guest]: literally everybody has promoted themselves to be an intensivist because

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.520
[Guest]: we have to save these lives I was getting used to that and then one very

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.200
[Guest]: high-profile politician got admitted after an accident and he had a emergency

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.520
[Guest]: surgery and all that and you know somehow see any any such major accident

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.200
[Guest]: and surgery this bound to be a risk of developing some complication or the

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.040
[Guest]: other and which was clearly explained even before the surgery was done which

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.840
[Guest]: is why most hospitals won't take such patients because they don't want the

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.760
[Guest]: risk of someone dying on you when it was really not your fault to begin with

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.040
[Guest]: right fortunately once this person was discharged from the surgery he died

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.880
[Guest]: there was the crowd of at least 10 to 12 thousand people who are gathered

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:51.280
[Guest]: outside the hospital we were some of us RMOs on duty some two three senior

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.840
[Guest]: doctors some two three nurses all in the ICU and they locked up the ICU from

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:03.280
[Guest]: outside after they took away the body and you know they set fire to the

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.880
[Guest]: hospital and what it is they all just from what I know I didn't see this

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.440
[Guest]: personally but I was told that they just lay down in front of the gate so neither

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.960
[Guest]: firefighting you know fire engine nothing could even come in and they kind

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.560
[Guest]: of sealed us from outside and here and because of the fire to avoid short

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.400
[Guest]: circuit the powers were switched off and here you have patients on ventilators

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:34.000
[Guest]: and other like it's I think it was a 20 or 25 or 30 bed ICU and you're worried

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.720
[Guest]: about how are these other patients going to survive without electricity and the

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.520
[Guest]: burden of that of just losing people you're in the dark and those days of we

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.880
[Guest]: had Nokia cell phone I think literally my battery was also out I could not call

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.600
[Guest]: anyone and we were just hiding and we were inside and we were just praying and

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.880
[Guest]: like somehow the patient's relatives started just lifting them and carrying

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.760
[Guest]: them outside the hospital with all those IV lines and everything hanging and

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.680
[Guest]: those kind of pictures were in the newspapers for a few weeks after that

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.280
[Guest]: was very traumatizing and we were holed up in the ICU with the hospital burning

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:15.160
[Guest]: outside and like the whole night and then the next morning and I think I had

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.040
[Guest]: driven to the hospital I would rarely take the car but it was a Sunday or

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.740
[Guest]: something I said okay I'm not going to change to autos and buses and all and go

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.600
[Guest]: and I took the car and the car got not just my car all the cars standing in the

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.160
[Guest]: parking lot were completely charred we just came out to see their skeletons and

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.200
[Guest]: this whole mental trauma the police dropped us home to each of our houses

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.160
[Guest]: then we were asked to come and give statements and all that now we see so

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.160
[Guest]: much you know we hear so much about violence against doctors and this mob

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.400
[Guest]: mentality people beating up doctors etc but again those days I was new into this

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:54.040
[Guest]: I'd never heard of something like this could happen I'm generally a very soft

01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:00.160
[Guest]: person don't like to get into any kind of you know controversy or just I like

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.520
[Guest]: to mind my own business so this was was very very very traumatizing and I could

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.320
[Guest]: just like I could not even go back to the hospital building where they had

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.640
[Guest]: called us to give our you know statements and stuff even that was

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.080
[Guest]: making me extremely panicky and I said I'm going to take a break from this

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.400
[Guest]: hospital work because this has I think it was like a huge turning point and one

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.520
[Guest]: would think that after five and a half years of studying to think about you

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.600
[Guest]: know not going back to that and especially in India you people will say

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.040
[Guest]: oh you did medicine and you're not practicing you wasted a seat you know

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.360
[Guest]: government subsidizes your education so much and you're not looking at patients

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.920
[Guest]: and stuff this is the standard thing that I have been facing since then

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.760
[Guest]: because ultimately I didn't get back to practice after that to seeing patients

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.400
[Guest]: and I have the standard retort I say that people who study you know say

01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.680
[Guest]: chemical engineering in IIT and then they do like finance in IIM and then they

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.880
[Guest]: start a restaurant so how do you explain those kind of things like even those are

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.600
[Guest]: government subsidized education but no I think medicine is seen with such a kind

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.200
[Guest]: of put it on a pedestal and the fact that you are supposed to serve the

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:20.360
[Guest]: society back because you have wasted a seat in medicine kind of attitude I over

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.040
[Guest]: the years I've gotten used to it and I'm very much in touch with my college

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.400
[Guest]: classmates and on their whatsapp groups and they only keep forwarding silly

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.200
[Guest]: jokes because I think that's their way of coping with life you know like the

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:40.000
[Guest]: the funny things we see on Twitter are all in those groups and yeah so I think

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.200
[Guest]: that's that's how I didn't go back I mean I didn't I didn't quit that stage

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.680
[Guest]: of my life permanently I said I'll see what happens again going with the flow

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.040
[Guest]: attitude but then I did find other interesting things to do and I didn't

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:59.080
[Guest]: really think that I had to practice medicine just because I had studied that

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.720
[Guest]: knowledge and that kind of processing information and that kind of

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.600
[Guest]: responsibility and dedication and commitment I think those kind of values

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.480
[Guest]: are never going to go away and I'm not going to waste what I learned and I

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.520
[Guest]: definitely I will be in touch with it in one way or the other I'm just not seeing

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:23.560
[Guest]: patients so I think that's how that whole cycle came around yeah you know

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.440
[Amit Varma]: now that you mentioned that incident I remember reading about it in the papers

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.680
[Amit Varma]: in those days and it's it's absolutely kind of horrendous what happened and

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.520
[Amit Varma]: speaking of your erstwhile profession like if there's anyone who has come out

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.080
[Amit Varma]: of you know what has happened in the last few months with any kind of credit

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.000
[Amit Varma]: it's really the frontline healthcare workers and the doctors and the nurses

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.640
[Amit Varma]: and I've seen some of that firsthand the kind of thankless work that they sort of

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.640
[Amit Varma]: put in and and what strikes me here is you know that typically before this you

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.640
[Amit Varma]: know the medical profession would kind of get a bad name that oh look it's so

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.960
[Amit Varma]: expensive and they are fleecing and they are making you do all these tests when

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.640
[Amit Varma]: you don't need to and they're all vultures and this and that and where is

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.560
[Amit Varma]: the Hippocratic Oath and yet in these very difficult times it seems to me that

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.840
[Amit Varma]: it's it's fair to say and it's not even sort of a generalization but it's

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.960
[Amit Varma]: absolutely fair to say that the other ones who've stepped up the most and gone

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.600
[Amit Varma]: way beyond the call of duty in you know what they've done though obviously it

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.720
[Amit Varma]: could be selection bias from what I have sort of seen with my own eyes but all

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.400
[Amit Varma]: the reports seem to back up that that's exactly what is happening also it's not

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.440
[Guest]: sorry it's not like they've had a choice also no matter what their own mental

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.840
[Guest]: state and whether they are actually capable of handling this kind of crisis

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.200
[Guest]: like you study medicine but you're not you're you don't expect that you will

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.920
[Guest]: encounter a pandemic in your lifetime because it has not happened in the last

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.400
[Guest]: hundred years and while your life is already stressful and you have these

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:57.200
[Guest]: emergency night calls but not this 24 by 7 stress where you don't see light at

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.720
[Guest]: the end of the tunnel and you don't know when you can stop going to work and take

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.120
[Guest]: one small break or you can be with your family or you you don't have to be in

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.000
[Guest]: that suffocating PPE so my heart literally goes out and I feel maybe at

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.920
[Guest]: this point I feel maybe I took a right decision because I I don't think I

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.640
[Guest]: would have been able to cope with I mean not for the lack of wanting to help

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.760
[Guest]: people but definitely it's not my kind of something that I can bear emotionally

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.560
[Guest]: as well seeing this kind of suffering I can't just take it and not be affected

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.760
[Amit Varma]: by it my my sense is if you were still in the profession you would have stepped

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.640
[Guest]: up and done what you had to do but maybe I think maybe yeah you're right but I

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.280
[Guest]: because I'm not there I feel maybe I would have totally crumbled but when

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.040
[Guest]: you're there that's a that's a different kind of an adrenaline rush and your you

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.080
[Guest]: know dedication that you want to do something for people and I think yeah

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.920
[Guest]: you're right maybe I would have I can't I can't tell now

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.240
[Amit Varma]: No and it's almost dichotomous that I'm struck by like on the one hand you have

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.880
[Amit Varma]: that negative impression of doctors always sort of fleecing patients and

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.120
[Amit Varma]: doing this and doing that and in a sense they're responding to incentives but here

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.320
[Amit Varma]: what what what you what you see a lot of where I think people have gone beyond

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.760
[Amit Varma]: the call of duty in what they have done and typically like I have seen doctors

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.920
[Amit Varma]: and you know people who work in ICUs for example who are just harangued by

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.060
[Amit Varma]: relatives of dead patients and you know who are also obviously upset and they

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.640
[Amit Varma]: are so calm and they deal with it so well and they're just going in there day

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.320
[Amit Varma]: in day out and kind of getting the job done and I don't know what incentives

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.320
[Guest]: function there no incentive is good enough for this it has to come out of

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.840
[Guest]: your own drive because I don't think what can you give to make people go

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.880
[Amit Varma]: through this nothing yeah no no it's it's fantastic but moving on from sort

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.400
[Amit Varma]: of that kind of darker subject you know when you were talking about how other

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.360
[Amit Varma]: professions are allowed to flit all over the place and you said chemical

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.040
[Amit Varma]: engineering and then finance in a bank and then started a restaurant and it

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.240
[Amit Varma]: sounded so incredibly specific that right after this is over I'm gonna

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.280
[Guest]: google if there's no specific I just use this in any kind of co-permutation

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.600
[Amit Varma]: combination I don't have anyone in mind okay we have that disclaimer but

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.760
[Amit Varma]: imagine if there's one poor guy who accidentally happens to fit this in I'm

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.400
[Guest]: not I'm not doing the equivalent of slight reading on a podcast no yes

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.560
[Amit Varma]: light reading is horrible no it's just Twitter can be so horrible sometimes

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.760
[Amit Varma]: when you know I mean for people who sort of want to be generally straightforward

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.040
[Amit Varma]: so you know what we've chatted for more than an hour about your personal life

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.360
[Amit Varma]: and we'll quickly do a little bit more of it after the break and then we'll go

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.880
[Amit Varma]: on to the food but for the moment let's now take a quick commercial break and if

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.040
[Amit Varma]: you are listening to this episode it would be entirely appropriate if you go

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.120
[Amit Varma]: get yourself a healthy snack right now

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.320
[Amit Varma]: have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it well

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.640
[Amit Varma]: your skills I can help you. Welcome back to the seen and the unseen I'm chatting

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.000
[Amit Varma]: with Nandita Iyer about her superb book everyday superfoods and about a very

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.680
[Amit Varma]: interesting life and her journey into learning more about food but before we

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.920
[Amit Varma]: actually get to the food so to say let's kind of go back to the way your life is

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.520
[Amit Varma]: unwinding after you have you know left medicine because of politics as it were

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.840
[Amit Varma]: at this point in time what is your conception of yourself what do you want

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.560
[Amit Varma]: to do what are the you know parts that you're thinking about so definitely I

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.600
[Guest]: wasn't a kind of I was in a crossroad and I didn't I didn't really know what

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:36.240
[Guest]: my next steps would be and one option definitely was to maybe start like a

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:41.800
[Guest]: general practitioner kind of a practice because there was always a huge emphasis

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.760
[Guest]: on being a super specialist and stuff but even in those days that whole GP

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.880
[Guest]: concept was dying down to have like a friendly neighborhood doctor who can

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.360
[Guest]: take care of all your basic problems and I thought I'm okay for that level of

01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:01.600
[Guest]: stress and I can still handle that that was one thing on my mind and the second

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.840
[Guest]: thing was that what else can I do with now that I have my medical degree can I

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:13.480
[Guest]: study like an MBA or can I do some other further studies which will open up some

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.880
[Guest]: more paths to me other than just being a clinical doctor while I was thinking

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.080
[Guest]: about these things I got a job opportunity in health insurance related

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.640
[Guest]: company where they were looking for doctors to understand certain aspects of

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.960
[Guest]: the claims and you know because a general person will not really know okay

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.320
[Guest]: this was the ailment and all this was done for this ailment so you need

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.760
[Guest]: someone to actually know what was actually required and what were not

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.840
[Guest]: required so to sort out those kind of things and because I didn't want to sit

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.800
[Guest]: at home for a single day and at this point an idle mind would have definitely

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.320
[Guest]: been a devil's workshop with all the stuff that I had experienced and gone

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.400
[Guest]: through and come out of and I think that would have been the right time to see a

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.280
[Guest]: therapist or something but that was out of question I didn't even know about you

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.720
[Guest]: know those kind of terminologies and even having studied medicine I didn't

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.360
[Guest]: even think of it as an option at that point of time there was this opening in

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.600
[Guest]: a health insurance related company and I just went and I took on that job and it

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.400
[Guest]: would keep my mind occupied and I said like while I do this I can understand if

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.520
[Guest]: this is something to my liking or I can see what else to do and I worked in that

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.040
[Guest]: field for two to three years and but again I've always been like a very

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.280
[Guest]: creative person and I need some kind of creativity and some that that's the

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.520
[Guest]: thing that gives me joy and here I was neither seeing patients and nor am I

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:48.120
[Guest]: doing anything creative that makes me happy and I said this okay while I was

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.000
[Guest]: getting some decent salary and stuff and I was not wasting my time at home I was

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.320
[Guest]: not entirely satisfied with what I was doing it felt very dry and boring at

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.940
[Guest]: this point I should also mention that I was a very early adopter into social

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.400
[Guest]: media even before the term social media existed so there was this networking

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.160
[Guest]: site called the rise business networking early on I didn't know what it was but I

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.920
[Guest]: just made an account for myself and I was connecting with a lot of people

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.280
[Guest]: around also because I was not in touch with my own classmates and you know five

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.720
[Guest]: and a half years of doing medicine leaves you with no friends no nothing in

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:32.160
[Guest]: your social life and you don't know anybody so then I said okay let me join

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.160
[Guest]: this I'll at least get to know people from other fields because you've been

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.000
[Guest]: living in a literal blinkered existence for from the day you step into medical

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
[Guest]: college you don't know what is happening in the outside world so I joined this

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.440
[Guest]: website and I came across people from advertising from so many different I

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.480
[Guest]: think Prem Panikkar and all I knew from that site early on because that same

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:58.760
[Guest]: gang moves on to every new good platform everybody is on Twitter now so literally

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:04.040
[Guest]: I know them for like 20 years I think so so I went on to that platform and I found

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.120
[Guest]: out thanks to that I came to know that there is something called health care

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.560
[Guest]: advertising which I would have not known otherwise and you know there's this

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.160
[Guest]: certain law which says that once you have heard about something you tend to

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.080
[Guest]: keep seeing similar things around you right I forget what's the name for that

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.000
[Guest]: phenomenon immediately after I saw that in a couple of days there was this

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.360
[Guest]: article in the Sunday supplement of Times of India about this new field

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.760
[Guest]: called health care advertising and all I said wow I just came to know about this

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.080
[Guest]: two days ago and now I'm reading about it in the newspaper I mean is this a

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.480
[Guest]: sign maybe I can apply my medical knowledge I can write it is creative and

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.840
[Guest]: it kind of seemed exciting to me at that point of time and I said but how on

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.880
[Guest]: earth I've never given a job interview in my life I don't have any management

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.160
[Guest]: degree I don't have any advertising background all I have is a medical

01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:00.120
[Guest]: degree what am I going to how am I going to get this and somehow through one of

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.560
[Guest]: the contacts and drives I got the contact of the woman who was heading

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.880
[Guest]: Ogilvy health care which is a branch of Ogilvy and Mathur a very leading ad

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:17.000
[Guest]: agency which is all over the world and this was the Mumbai branch so I just you

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.200
[Guest]: know some sometimes I have the spurt of confidence and drive I said let's do it

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.440
[Guest]: worst case what will happen she'll say get lost at least it would not be for

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.640
[Guest]: want of not trying so I just contacted her and I said I want to come and meet

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.080
[Guest]: you can you give me like 15-20 minutes of your time and also these are the

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.280
[Guest]: places where your doctor's degree sometimes helps because the minute they

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.080
[Guest]: see a doctor's degree they think they can't be such a nonsense person they

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.520
[Guest]: have some you know some substance in them and people don't refuse you when

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.400
[Guest]: you request for a meeting like this so I went and met her and she heard me out

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.960
[Guest]: and she said I said I want to be a part of this but to be honest I don't even

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.640
[Guest]: know what are the available options for me but somehow I feel like I could fit

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.840
[Guest]: in here I think I would feel that kind of creative fulfillment at place like

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.960
[Guest]: this what she did was very interesting she gave me a project and said I'm

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.440
[Guest]: giving you two weeks you do this project in whatever way I'm not going to give

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.160
[Guest]: you any guidelines or how we work out here you will just figure it out with

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.440
[Guest]: your own logic and you do this and you come back to me and I did it and I went

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.320
[Guest]: back in two weeks and I got the job and she said okay so I joined a strategy

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.640
[Guest]: planner so in healthcare advertising this was mainly for the pharma companies

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.720
[Guest]: so these are the kind of brochures and literatures that the medical

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.880
[Guest]: representatives take to the doctors and they tell them about these new drugs and

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.360
[Guest]: but also there are the same drug is manufactured by five ten different

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.920
[Guest]: companies so how do you gain some mind space in the doctor's head that he

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.800
[Guest]: remembers your brand better maybe because you conveyed it in a better way

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.280
[Guest]: or for whatever reason so that was the speciality of this field where you made

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.200
[Guest]: a creative communication rather than just dry blah blah blah twice a day you

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.040
[Guest]: give this is the milligram this is the side effect you know going beyond that

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.600
[Guest]: and trying to catch some emotions and that's the typical Ogilvy way of doing

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.480
[Guest]: things where everything has their own touch and their spin and they make

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.080
[Guest]: anything and they can make fevicol interesting so you can imagine how it is

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:31.160
[Guest]: so that's how I you know got the job and I really enjoyed it but there was one

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:36.440
[Guest]: you know one drawback was that these guys are all like very late starters in

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:42.520
[Guest]: the day and I'm a morning person I'll be there by 830 in the morning and people

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:46.920
[Guest]: come in by 1231 and when I wanted to leave on time they'll say are a half day

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.320
[Guest]: kind of you know because no one knows that you've been working from early and

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.760
[Guest]: and that whole culture was very different for someone coming from a

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.560
[Guest]: medical background it's very laid-back if there's a deadline for 5 p.m. 430 is

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.720
[Guest]: when people will start working on something which would like make me very

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.240
[Guest]: panicky because I I'm not although even I do my best when you know the deadline

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.680
[Guest]: is closest but I'll not start my work half an hour before I have to submit it

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.680
[Guest]: that is something that will drive me crazy out of you know anxiety that I've

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:25.800
[Guest]: not started my work so I got used to that kind of lifestyle also where again

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:31.280
[Guest]: all from different fields one somebody's in art somebody's a client servicing and

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.840
[Guest]: I am here dealing like in middleman between the advertising and the pharma

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:42.960
[Guest]: company so then by now I was in my late 20s after all these winding you know

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.720
[Guest]: side paths that I had taken and I was chugging along and then I got married in

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:55.880
[Guest]: my late 20s and at that time my husband had a job in the US and that was

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.880
[Guest]: literally the first time I I think I traveled outside the country and I went

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.640
[Guest]: to I went I went off to the East Coast with him after I got married and that

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.360
[Guest]: was the first time in my life I was sitting at home 100% leisure nothing to

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:18.040
[Guest]: do no deadlines and all my time is my own to do as I please and you know after

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.280
[Guest]: I think after middle school like fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:28.840
[Guest]: this was the first time I was in truly zone where I had nothing to account for

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:35.480
[Guest]: and I could just do my own thing and that is when the food bug bit me because

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:41.200
[Guest]: I used to I was fascinated by the kind of channels that were on TV and I was

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.560
[Guest]: even more fascinated that there was a channel to tell you what's going on on

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:50.880
[Guest]: all the other channels and for someone who has only seen like Krishi Darshan and

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.360
[Guest]: stuff back home because that's when my TV watching days also stopped after that

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.400
[Guest]: there was no chance to watch TV and I was totally fascinated and there was a

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.800
[Guest]: food network channel which was showing 24 by 7 food things on you know anytime

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.120
[Guest]: if you couldn't get sleep or you were jet-lagged you just started the TV and

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:12.840
[Guest]: you could watch like someone cooking and I found that like utterly fascinating

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:17.240
[Guest]: and then all apartments they come with this built-in oven which again I was

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.680
[Guest]: seeing for the first time I've never had an oven in my life so like it took me

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.880
[Guest]: two days to even figure out how what is on what is off what because everyone

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.440
[Guest]: just uses it as a storage to keep extra pots and pans so just took a while to

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.420
[Guest]: figure that out and then all that inspiration from food TV plus the

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:37.880
[Guest]: supermarkets with all the supplies and like so many things to buy which we

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:43.720
[Guest]: didn't have and this was in the year 2004 even though we had supermarkets in

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.120
[Guest]: India at that time that kind of variety even today you will not find right so

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:53.360
[Guest]: all that put together I actually started cooking and experimenting and I would

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.800
[Guest]: say experimenting because I really didn't know much about like even I didn't

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.520
[Guest]: know the exact recipe for a sambar or a rasam or anything for that matter so I

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.280
[Guest]: think all that inspiration put together is when I started cooking and

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.400
[Guest]: experimenting and those days it's not like you had whatsapp so you could

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.000
[Guest]: quickly call your mom and literally keep the stuff on the gas and say now tell me

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.480
[Guest]: how do I make this so I started I would call her and I would start making notes

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.520
[Guest]: and at least certain things that reminded me of home and the stuff food that I had

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:29.200
[Guest]: enjoyed in my childhood I wanted to recreate that because it was the first

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.120
[Guest]: time I was away from home it was in the East Coast where nine months of winter

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:40.560
[Guest]: literally getting dark at 3 o'clock you did need that comforting situation you

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.080
[Guest]: know to replicate like a feeling of home and that's when I actually started

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.600
[Amit Varma]: cooking. So you know that whole journey is very fascinating and different

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.640
[Amit Varma]: aspects there but first of all you mentioned deadlines that if there was a

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.440
[Amit Varma]: five o'clock deadline your colleagues would start working at 5.30 at 4.30 and

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.840
[Amit Varma]: I would actually when there's a five deadline I start working at 4.55 and

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:05.560
[Amit Varma]: there's this great quote by Douglas Adams my listeners might like which is

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:09.480
[Amit Varma]: quote I love deadlines I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:14.440
[Amit Varma]: stop quote although I would never advise any of my students to be so lax with

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.640
[Amit Varma]: deadlines but I am I'm terrible with them I like that quote though I love

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:25.120
[Amit Varma]: that quote yeah it's I think I quoted Adams in the last episode as well which

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.200
[Amit Varma]: makes it seem like I'm some kind of Adams fanboy and I'm actually not but

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:35.040
[Amit Varma]: these are great quotes though I'm not a hater either so so to kind of get back

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:41.920
[Amit Varma]: to what you mentioned about cooking is it in some way an advantage or does it

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.400
[Amit Varma]: give you a different kind of way at looking at cooking the fact that you

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.280
[Amit Varma]: learned it so late like for example I didn't do economics in college so

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.960
[Amit Varma]: whatever I learned about economics or political philosophy or whatever I

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.120
[Amit Varma]: learned much later in my life and therefore I wasn't bound say by the

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.400
[Amit Varma]: dogmas or the reflexive thinking of whatever the education system might tell

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.800
[Amit Varma]: you so I didn't read only the Keynesians but also the Austrians and also whatever

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.640
[Amit Varma]: and it's kind of broader and I feel that that's kind of an advantage the fact

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.400
[Amit Varma]: that I am learning different things on my own at different points in time and

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.520
[Amit Varma]: all of that going into the prism through which I sort of look at things is in a

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.960
[Amit Varma]: sense an advantage do you feel that in terms of cooking the fact that you know

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.640
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people will learn cooking by just picking up habits when they are

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.960
[Amit Varma]: kids that is go as a banana tea and this is how you do this and this is how you

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.800
[Amit Varma]: do that and you are almost learning everything from scratch right from how

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.360
[Amit Varma]: to turn an oven on and you're learning all the basics from scratch do you feel

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.360
[Amit Varma]: that one that that helped you and made you a little different from you know

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.000
[Amit Varma]: others who might have learned as kids and just internalized a lot of habits

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.960
[Amit Varma]: whether good or bad and do you think that it forced you to explicitly think

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.440
[Amit Varma]: about food about the process of cooking and that might have played a part in you

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.040
[Guest]: know what you then went on to become yeah I mean you are right and now that

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:08.160
[Guest]: you mention it I definitely feel like it did play a part in making me a more

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:15.760
[Guest]: fearless not bound to rules kind of a cook and I don't believe in like this is

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.720
[Guest]: the hundred percent authentic recipe that I must take to if it tastes good

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:27.400
[Guest]: it's good and yeah like in having different kinds of combinations which

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.000
[Guest]: traditionally you know we may not be cooking it together or serving two kinds

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.120
[Guest]: of dishes together I never had such hang-ups I would cook anything with

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.240
[Guest]: anything a few months ago I had posted this on Twitter like dosa with the

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.280
[Guest]: rajma okay so I got I got trolled by both the South Indians and the North

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:54.120
[Guest]: Indians how dare you like you know that Greta Thunberg gif how dare you kind of

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.840
[Guest]: thing that people were sending me and which is why I'm not bound to this you

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:05.200
[Guest]: know I I feel this is a good combination I like it and I'm not following anybody's

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.960
[Guest]: rules not even my grandmother's rules about what to be served with what and I'm

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.560
[Guest]: I'm eating this myself or I'm serving this to my family who don't mind eating

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.320
[Guest]: it so why is it anybody else's problem right so definitely made me a more

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.480
[Guest]: creative cook made me work with a whole lot of different ingredients which I

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.000
[Guest]: found in US at that time and it just kept my mind very open because I had no

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.360
[Guest]: set things to follow in the first place like only these vegetables can go into

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.640
[Guest]: sambar or with this sambar only this curry no such hang-ups I like whatever

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.160
[Guest]: is available or whatever I find fascinating and whatever I pick up from

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:51.560
[Guest]: the shop I would just cook with that I had no plan as such you know I I didn't

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:57.360
[Guest]: think about this factor at all but definitely I think it played a role in

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.120
[Guest]: how I started cooking and I continue to cook today and you also kind of

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.240
[Amit Varma]: mentioned that you know in your advertising days you know when you were

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.200
[Amit Varma]: writing copy and you were like an in-between between the pharma and the

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.840
[Amit Varma]: marketing people and I guess one of the things you were doing at that time is a

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.840
[Amit Varma]: skill that you practice anyway when it comes to food and is a skill that would

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.520
[Amit Varma]: in some senses have been inherent to you which is that you break down a complex

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:24.680
[Amit Varma]: idea in simple language and and the thing is when you're to have to do that

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.880
[Amit Varma]: is a great way to even learn about something because if you if you force

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.840
[Amit Varma]: yourself to put something in simple language you are you know and forcing

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.760
[Amit Varma]: yourself to understand it that much better so is that kind of that way of

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.840
[Amit Varma]: thinking that systematic assimilative way of thinking where you know you build

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.920
[Amit Varma]: a base and then you start from there is that something that you feel has always

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.220
[Amit Varma]: been there with you because that's also the approach that you will that you

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:54.560
[Amit Varma]: bring to your food writing for example that is and I imagine that even when

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.840
[Amit Varma]: you're you know learning Indian classical music that's partly it you

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.160
[Amit Varma]: know you you figure out certain first principles certain rules of the game and

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.760
[Amit Varma]: then you play around with those and then it gets more and more complex but your

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.940
[Amit Varma]: base is very solid at that point so is that kind of explicit thinking something

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.640
[Amit Varma]: that you do for whatever you take up or is it something that you had to do for

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.840
[Amit Varma]: the different things you've taken up what's what's your mindset like because

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.320
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that a lot of other people who might write about food for example

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.840
[Amit Varma]: will almost you know take an almost intuitive approach to it where it will

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.080
[Amit Varma]: be like you know if they're doing a food review it will almost be like what is

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.760
[Amit Varma]: their sensory experience while you know taking something while I think that you

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.080
[Amit Varma]: know people like you and Krish Ashok who was on the show earlier a kind of more

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.840
[Amit Varma]: methodical thinking a little harder about it tell me a bit about that

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.720
[Amit Varma]: mindset is that something that you've tried to build and cultivate or is that

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.320
[Amit Varma]: even something that in self-reflective moments you've kind of thought about

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.480
[Guest]: when it comes to how you go about your work so like we were discussing earlier

01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:00.920
[Guest]: I value the impact of almost everything that I have done in the past be it

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:06.280
[Guest]: medical college be it a healthcare advertising or the long stint in

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:12.240
[Guest]: freelance writing I think everything contributes even without your knowing it

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.840
[Guest]: small bits and pieces towards making you who you are and making your processes

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.680
[Guest]: the way they are when it comes to working so while I definitely like to

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.600
[Guest]: have a very intuitive approach to things like you know we talk about first draft

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.320
[Guest]: second draft my first draft is very stream of consciousness very intuitive I

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:36.760
[Guest]: don't I don't even think about how is the flow or is it I just put what's on

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:41.440
[Guest]: my mind and that's what lends that personal touch also and not make it

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.800
[Guest]: sound very like a science project methodical or a science paper kind of a

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:51.000
[Guest]: writing and then you know thinking about the flow thinking about what more

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.360
[Guest]: details could be added what more don't I know about the subject that I need to

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.120
[Guest]: study research a little bit on the side and then come back to add those kind of

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.560
[Guest]: details because it has never happened that I've written on a subject and I

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.680
[Guest]: knew everything about it on day one or when I started writing that I've only

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:11.880
[Guest]: learned more and more as I've written and you know then that knowledge gets

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:17.360
[Guest]: applied into the next thing you do so you just gets carried forward and yeah

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:23.040
[Guest]: so I think it's a combination of both definitely intuitive and because I'm by

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:27.320
[Guest]: nature very disciplined and I like to have a certain method to doing things

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.960
[Guest]: because I'm also the other extreme where if I don't have a method I can be

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.960
[Guest]: completely mad so for my own sanity I like to keep a certain method you know

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:40.440
[Guest]: break it down into smaller chunks and make sure I'm able to give my attention

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.120
[Guest]: to every of these little parts of any project that I'm working on so like you

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.960
[Guest]: rightly said even Indian classical music I learned Carnatic for quite a few

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.800
[Guest]: years as a kid and then I think maybe in my adulthood as a rebellion to be

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.560
[Guest]: rebellion to having forced to learn Carnatic music I started learning

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:03.560
[Guest]: Hindustani classical and it is something I definitely enjoyed more I found that

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:10.120
[Guest]: there is more scope for creativity and it's a less hard on you with in terms of

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.560
[Guest]: rules and stuff of course there are plenty of rules and I don't even claim

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.800
[Guest]: to know fully well the differences between the two streams even though I've

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:22.240
[Guest]: learned but you know applying these principles just makes it a little bit

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.320
[Guest]: easier which otherwise a vast subject like this it can feel completely

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.920
[Amit Varma]: difficult to even approach let alone conquer yeah absolutely and and I love

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.200
[Amit Varma]: the phrase that you just used here carry forward it which is such a charmed

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.360
[Guest]: forward Indianism no I'm not making fun of you I think it's a charming phrase

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:46.560
[Amit Varma]: and language evolves carry forward did so what you what what you also did

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.440
[Amit Varma]: during this time is you also did a diploma or a degree in nutrition I think

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:57.960
[Guest]: right so tell me a little bit more about that so in 2004 I went to the US for a

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:03.320
[Guest]: year or so and then I came back to India and the cooking bug had bitten me good

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:07.640
[Guest]: and proper so I continued you know my biggest worry in coming back to India

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.880
[Guest]: was how am I going to get those ingredients you know and the minute I

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:17.560
[Guest]: land have to get myself an oven because I wanted to continue that process even

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:24.320
[Guest]: though I was back home I was back in Bombay and I continued cooking and again

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.000
[Guest]: experimental I had not gained any expertise in just like nine months to

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.240
[Guest]: one year of cooking so you know at those in those days there was some few cooking

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:41.160
[Guest]: websites like this sify.com Bhavarchi they had one section then like there was

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.040
[Guest]: I think Tarla Dalal had set up a website or I don't remember but there were very

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:52.080
[Guest]: few cooking websites so you could get recipes from these websites and there

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.280
[Guest]: was my biggest regret was there was no food network in India and there were no

01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:01.200
[Guest]: food good food channels in India and there was no way to get them also but

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.120
[Guest]: anyway I had got enough inspiration from there and I just needed that to keep

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.880
[Guest]: continuing and when I did that I realized that I was so experimental and

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.160
[Guest]: intuitive in my cooking that I could never replicate a dish if it turned out

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.280
[Guest]: good because I didn't even know what I put into it in the first place I would

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.440
[Guest]: just keep putting things as I went right so then I said okay I need to start a

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:25.960
[Guest]: blog and this is how I will keep everything in one place and I can refer

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.960
[Guest]: to it myself I had no inkling that there was somebody going to search for recipes

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:33.800
[Guest]: on the web and land up on my blog and I didn't think that was going to happen at

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.400
[Guest]: all but then within a few weeks I got some comments and I realized that

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:42.360
[Guest]: there's a whole bunch of food bloggers out there mostly Indians in the US they

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.200
[Guest]: were trying to preserve their culture and you know like calling parents and

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.560
[Guest]: taking recipes and putting it down in this permanent kind of format where they

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:54.320
[Guest]: could access it at any time and which is why I thought oh this is already there

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.360
[Guest]: so I should continue at this and I whatever I would experiment at home I

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.480
[Guest]: would keep posting it on my blog and I think a year passed and I surprisingly

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.960
[Guest]: didn't get bored of it because I would have thought like okay you know blogger

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.960
[Guest]: had a very simple interface like if you could type you could just do it and it

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.840
[Guest]: was easy I kept continuing it at it and then I said okay I think I should

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.680
[Guest]: actually study nutrition properly because in medical school it's hardly

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.640
[Guest]: touched upon although there's one subject called preventive and social

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.320
[Guest]: medicine in the second IBBS but in that it's mostly the preventive disease

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.920
[Guest]: preventing diseases talking about things like polio tuberculosis vaccination

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.800
[Guest]: public health essentially while nutrition should have been integral to

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.880
[Guest]: this topic it wasn't and we hardly touched upon anything like our

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.400
[Guest]: knowledge of nutrition was as good as any layperson's knowledge and I said if

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.760
[Guest]: I'm writing so much about food and now I'm cooking so much I should know a

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.960
[Guest]: little bit more than what I know already so which is why I did this fellowship in

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.600
[Guest]: applied nutrition from Apollo which was a distance come residential kind of a

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.800
[Guest]: course and that helped me a lot in understanding things which I either knew

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.960
[Guest]: very haphazardly or I didn't know about at all so I thought it would be a great

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.880
[Guest]: way to marry the hobby and my qualification and it would just narrow

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.960
[Guest]: the gap and bring it somehow together but I think I'm doing I'm saying all

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.760
[Guest]: this in retrospect I didn't think so much then I just thought this is a good

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.560
[Guest]: idea and I'm learning something so it's not wasted anyway I will put it to use

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.760
[Guest]: and that's when I did that course and then it just you know that that's when I

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.480
[Guest]: started moving the niche of my blog and my writing I started I was a regular

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.560
[Guest]: writer for Men's Health India and I would write mostly on nutrition and

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.840
[Guest]: health related topics and also quite a bit of well-researched things in you

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:58.160
[Guest]: know nutrition the science of it etc because men's health is a very very

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.840
[Guest]: health focused magazine and you know everything is like proper verified

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.200
[Guest]: information and it's not just saying things which are popular on the internet

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.960
[Guest]: kind of thing so so that that course in nutrition helped me kind of figure out

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:19.800
[Guest]: what I want my focus to be over the next years and it also helped because I was

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:25.080
[Guest]: cooking a lot I was getting a lot more interested in food and you know I would

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:30.280
[Guest]: want to call friends home so I could try out different things and make lots of

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:34.160
[Guest]: food and serve people because otherwise it's just my husband and me how much are

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.640
[Guest]: we going to cook and eat I would look forward to these you know calling people

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.400
[Guest]: over and yeah so I think that that was the other turning point actually

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:52.080
[Guest]: focusing on nutrition and whereby using my education in somewhat a good way

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.680
[Guest]: where I can contribute my knowledge of you know the human body physiology

01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:02.440
[Guest]: biochemistry everything and nutrition coming together nicely and it kind of

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.040
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that the science of nutrition is a bit of a contrast to the science of

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.800
[Amit Varma]: medicine for example in the sense that the science of medicine you know what

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.480
[Amit Varma]: you know is what you know and of course there are things you don't know and you

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.280
[Amit Varma]: find out more about them but as far as what you know is concerned it's fairly

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:21.000
[Amit Varma]: settled it will evolve in terms of going deeper but you're not going to find that

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.160
[Amit Varma]: what you thought was a fundamental truth is completely false while I think in

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.120
[Amit Varma]: nutrition in a sense that has kind of happened like one of my pet themes and

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.840
[Amit Varma]: it's a surprise I haven't really done an episode on it is you know how America's

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:40.120
[Amit Varma]: obesity epidemic was actually caused by the state where for decades we had this

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.000
[Amit Varma]: impression that sugar is fine and fat is evil while in recent times we have

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.560
[Amit Varma]: realized that that's absolutely not true and for those who are further interested

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.480
[Amit Varma]: you know there's a great book by Gary Taubes called the case against sugar

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.520
[Amit Varma]: there's a great book by Nina Tycoles called the big fat surprise I'll link

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.360
[Amit Varma]: them from the show notes I think Tycoles also did a good episode with Joe Rogan

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:05.120
[Amit Varma]: on them but the TLDR of that or what fundamentally happened is that these

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.080
[Amit Varma]: cases were made to find out more about heart disease these studies were done

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.000
[Amit Varma]: rather to find out more about heart disease in the 50s and 60s and they were

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.400
[Amit Varma]: funded by the sugar lobby you know the methodology was suspect and they made

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.480
[Amit Varma]: fat the big villain and absorbed sugar while today we know that fundamentally

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.560
[Amit Varma]: sugar is poison certainly in certain forms and you know in processed foods

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.600
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth so it's very interesting that it's you know on the

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.360
[Amit Varma]: one hand you do medicine where the science is kind of settled but on the

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.640
[Amit Varma]: other hand you're doing nutrition where it seems like the whole world is being

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.760
[Amit Varma]: upended every two years and there are more and more sort of new things coming

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.160
[Amit Varma]: out how does one then cope with that because then the concept of healthy

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.080
[Amit Varma]: changes a little bit like when I was growing up I remembered at fatty foods

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.640
[Amit Varma]: weren't good you know even when it came to meats people were moving to leaner

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:57.120
[Amit Varma]: meats which we now know is completely unnecessary and at the same time you

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.680
[Amit Varma]: know it was okay to drink coke and and you know with all its many spoons of

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: sugar or whatever it is which is just insane and you've got a nice little

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.600
[Amit Varma]: screed against processed foods in your book so tell me a little bit about how

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.520
[Amit Varma]: you're thinking of nutrition evolved in this period of time because there are

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.400
[Amit Varma]: also so many fads and fashions going on and it's almost like different

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:23.840
[Amit Varma]: ideological camps form around these things so when when you so what was your

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.720
[Amit Varma]: what's your take on this what was your approach of all this you're right

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:33.400
[Guest]: because you know study of disease and the study of nutrition are like

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:38.440
[Guest]: completely different things happening and definitely there has been more

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.880
[Guest]: funding and more priority to the study of disease because you can save lives

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.800
[Guest]: whereas studying nutrition it's more like you're preventing something so it

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.080
[Guest]: definitely gets a little less or much less importance than the study or funding

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.640
[Guest]: of disease but then who funds the nutrition studies it is mostly lobbies

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:04.080
[Guest]: be it like the sugar lobby or the wheat growing lobby or the dairy lobby right

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:10.560
[Guest]: so I have I've heard about this in the US that if a certain lobby is funding a

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.680
[Guest]: study you can be like 75% sure that that study will only bring about the points

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.400
[Guest]: that are favorable to the lobby who funded them isn't that obvious because

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.520
[Guest]: there is such a conflict of interest if someone is paying me one crore to say

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.520
[Guest]: find out about this but they are themselves a sugar company how can I

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.120
[Guest]: come out and say that sugar is bad right so I think believing in such studies you

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.960
[Guest]: should also know who has funded these studies in the first place because that

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.160
[Guest]: also impacts to a great extent what the result of that study turns out to be you

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.880
[Guest]: know I think treating health is just the absence of disease and therefore not

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:56.320
[Guest]: giving nutrition an important role is also very what do you say it's not a

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:03.080
[Guest]: good thing because I think preventing is much easier it costs less and it's more

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:08.160
[Guest]: sustainable in the long run and you can just do it by making these small changes

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.520
[Guest]: in your day-to-day life rather than someone who has to literally flush down

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.120
[Guest]: his entire life savings to do a like a bypass surgery or undergo like a

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.080
[Guest]: dialysis every two weeks so I think we need to step back and we need to stop

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.720
[Guest]: thinking about health only when we fall sick you know in in traditional Chinese

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.040
[Guest]: medicine I had read about this thing where the emperors would pay a retainer

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.360
[Guest]: to the physicians the traditional Chinese medicine physicians and the

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.560
[Guest]: minute they fell sick they would not pay them because they are paying them to

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:47.200
[Guest]: keep them healthy not to treat them when they fell sick so if the Emperor or

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.640
[Guest]: their family the royal family fell sick they would not get paid for that month

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:57.840
[Guest]: so it's it's the reverse right and that is the importance of something like a

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:04.880
[Guest]: nutrition or your lifestyle where little steps matter a lot and what you can do

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.400
[Guest]: on a daily basis and that is exactly in contrast from some of these fads and the

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:15.800
[Guest]: camps that you were talking about where I can't think of any fad or a kind of a

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:21.440
[Guest]: you know a diet a diet that excludes a lot of foods a diet that deprives people

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.440
[Guest]: you can't possibly do it all your life and because there are a lot of other

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.520
[Guest]: factors that play a role in what you eat your emotional state your family your

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.080
[Guest]: socio-economic status and something like nutrition is impacted by so many factors

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:42.120
[Guest]: and it is not easy to just put a label and say that you do this diet and you

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:47.200
[Guest]: will lose you know 10 kilos of weight and that is the kind of oversimplified

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.040
[Guest]: information that is actually so much in vogue these days people just want

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.320
[Guest]: binaries are you vegan are you like meat eating is meat good is vegan good there

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:02.120
[Guest]: are no simple answers to this and nutrition see health itself is a

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.800
[Guest]: medicine and health is a very complicated science you're dealing with

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.520
[Guest]: the human body and every human body is different and in a space like nutrition

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.920
[Guest]: where there's even much less research and there are so many it's like in

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.440
[Guest]: mathematical terms it's like a multivariable problem where what

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.240
[Guest]: variable are you going to fix to understand what is the thing right and

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:28.640
[Guest]: someone may spend 20 years researching on where the maximum antioxidants are in

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.240
[Guest]: a grape and they find it that it's on the surface of the seed and you know we

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:38.440
[Guest]: are all eating seedless grapes these days but you find that and another one

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.440
[Guest]: year somebody else comes and says no no it's actually in the pulp so it's like

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.840
[Guest]: things like you said things change so rapidly so then are we supposed to keep

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.200
[Guest]: reading and updating ourselves on every such research paper or sometimes just

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.880
[Guest]: follow some absolute basic rules like eating whole foods eating in moderation

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:01.800
[Guest]: not eating too much like not stuffing yourself until you're 100% full and

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.000
[Guest]: therefore eating slowly so you realize when you're full you know eating in a

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.120
[Guest]: pleasant setup where you're eating mindfully so these are the things that

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.080
[Guest]: you can never go wrong with and no paper is going to come out tomorrow and tell

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.400
[Guest]: you that you ate a little less so you know you have created space for this

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.260
[Guest]: disease in your life that's never going to happen so why not follow the

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:27.560
[Guest]: principles that you know for certain are not going to change like if you if

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.400
[Guest]: someone eats one or two eggs in a day that's not going to kill them so don't

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:35.480
[Guest]: do anything extreme and I think the biggest problem in today's times is that

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.240
[Guest]: the more polarized you are in any field that you're more in news and the people

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:45.680
[Guest]: will lap up your information immediately but the minute you are very moderate and

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.480
[Guest]: you don't have that extreme bone in you you don't people say what is this so

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.040
[Guest]: boring like it being in between is the worst place to be because you'll get no

01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.320
[Amit Varma]: attention but see Nandita yeah you are the kind of person on Twitter that they

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.600
[Amit Varma]: would call you a centrist when it comes to food as a pejorative but no no sorry

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.480
[Guest]: I interrupted you finish I was pretty much done yeah I think that that's what

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.720
[Guest]: I wanted to say that you know also things like gut microbe for example that

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:25.920
[Guest]: it's like 37 trillions of gut microbes and is it even possible that even in a

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.440
[Guest]: century we'll do enough research to understand what impact this has on our

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.480
[Guest]: body but we do know certain things for sure that you know gut microbes

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:39.880
[Guest]: influence your immunity because they talk to your immune system gut microbes

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.560
[Guest]: influence your mental health you know gut microbes influence a lot of

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.200
[Guest]: functions in your body which still cannot be specified or list put down in

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.880
[Guest]: a listicle but what is known is that when you eat you're literally feeding

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.160
[Guest]: your gut microbes you're not feeding yourself because whatever the stuff that

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.920
[Guest]: your body hasn't digested these are the guys that are going to digest all of

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.400
[Guest]: that and then release the byproducts which then benefits you in so many

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:11.800
[Guest]: different ways like head to toe it's affecting your body so to think of the

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.320
[Guest]: science is so complex and so fascinating but even by just following some very

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.480
[Guest]: basic general principles having this background knowledge but doing simple

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.200
[Guest]: things which you know for certain will have positive impact in your life I

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.240
[Amit Varma]: think that is very important yeah in fact you know people say we were

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.840
[Amit Varma]: colonized by the British no we are colonized by our gut microbes and just

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.800
[Amit Varma]: to sort of elaborate on a thought which I kind of left halfway about how the

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.880
[Amit Varma]: state caused the obesity epidemic the thing is after all these studies came

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:46.080
[Amit Varma]: out in the 50s and the 60s in the late 1970s the US Health Association whatever

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.440
[Amit Varma]: they are called I forget the official name came out with a series of dietary

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.800
[Amit Varma]: guidelines on what you should eat and what you should not eat and they got it

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.960
[Amit Varma]: completely wrong and if you look at the graph of America's obesity epidemic it

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.040
[Amit Varma]: kind of begins from there and of course sugar is a big problem I wasn't keto for

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.600
[Amit Varma]: a while and it really worked for me but then I kind of went off and I sort of

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.960
[Amit Varma]: went back but it worked for me except that you know in India it's kind of hard

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:13.680
[Amit Varma]: to keep a keto diet because you are surrounded by biryani and dosa and so on

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:18.640
[Amit Varma]: so what do you do and I also agree about not getting too alarmed by whatever the

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.480
[Amit Varma]: fad of the day might be like I saw the headline a few months ago saying bacon

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.920
[Amit Varma]: causes cancer and that was too much for me I was like let it cause cancer I'm

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.440
[Amit Varma]: not going to stop having bacon for God's sake and by the way you mentioned gut

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.720
[Amit Varma]: there's a lovely book I'd read a few years back called gut by Julia Enders

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.920
[Amit Varma]: which was a fascinating book on the effect of the gut on our physical and

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.760
[Amit Varma]: mental health so I'll link that from the show notes as well let's go on to your

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.240
[Amit Varma]: book because one of the early things that you write in your fine book is

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.440
[Amit Varma]: where you talk about the virtue of the diet of our grandparents like you quote

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.800
[Amit Varma]: Michael Pollan saying quote don't eat anything your great-great-great

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:58.680
[Amit Varma]: grandmother wouldn't recognize as food stop quote and then you have this nice

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.720
[Amit Varma]: section on what your maternal great-grandparents actually ate and why

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.240
[Amit Varma]: and what their routines were like tell me a little bit about that because that

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:12.800
[Guest]: was also quite instructive for me so you know Michael Pollan's that quote is

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.400
[Guest]: obviously very very very famous almost everybody has heard of it but it's also

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.880
[Guest]: a bit extreme and it's not really it's not possible to follow it 200% in

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.640
[Guest]: today's times because we're not 200 years earlier we are in 2021 and we will

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.720
[Guest]: be influenced by the things that are happening now the things that are

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:38.080
[Guest]: available now the way our life is now so we can't really go back in time and eat

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.160
[Guest]: what exactly they ate but I think it's worthwhile just catching the the

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:48.040
[Guest]: sentiment behind that statement where if you have to choose between two kinds of

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.800
[Guest]: foods there should be enough knowledge that you're choosing something that is

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.200
[Guest]: lesser processed and there is knowledge everywhere but once you keep putting

01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.280
[Guest]: this into practice every single day which might feel a bit tough initially

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.920
[Guest]: but when you put this into practice every day it just becomes second nature

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:09.080
[Guest]: and you know that that knowledge becomes the way you deal with every little food

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.680
[Guest]: confusion that you have in your life because you know like there's this nice

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.600
[Guest]: saying which I read somewhere three times a day you get to choose what you're

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.080
[Guest]: going to put inside your body and how you're going to impact your health so

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:26.760
[Guest]: make it worthwhile it's very simple like say I have to choose between say you

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:33.000
[Guest]: know a banana and a banana bread even a kid knows that a banana is closer to the

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.280
[Guest]: way nature made it than banana bread which has added flour sugar baking

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:43.860
[Guest]: powder salt eggs everything right fat and it's it's cooked at a high heat so

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:49.520
[Guest]: it's baked just eating the banana would have been far simpler but here we are in

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:54.160
[Guest]: the times when we are like banana bread addition to with the pandemic you know

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:58.680
[Guest]: having restarted and we're all making banana bread as something like a comfort

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:03.600
[Guest]: food because banana as a fruit doesn't hit that spot as a comfort food it

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:09.400
[Guest]: doesn't have the added sugar added fats added carbs which is what qualifies to

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:13.520
[Guest]: make it as a comfort food and it ticks all those boxes to make us feel good so

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.640
[Guest]: there's this whole emotional aspect also like given the times we are facing now

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:23.360
[Guest]: we are having two kinds of behavior either there are people chugging liters

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:28.560
[Guest]: of cada and eating like a vitamin C going out of stock on Amazon people are

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.720
[Guest]: eating zinc and vitamin C tablets and the others are just saying chug this I'm

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:37.160
[Guest]: just having to stay sane in these times I'm going to eat whatever makes me

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:41.160
[Guest]: happy I'm not even stepping out so my weight is the last thing on my mind I

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.120
[Guest]: just need to eat something that makes me feel good and both these lines of

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:49.320
[Guest]: thought are right for the times that we are now you know so it's very difficult

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:54.160
[Guest]: to just tell people that hey these are the rules follow it and don't eat

01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.280
[Guest]: unprocessed at all but we need to have a decent enough inherent knowledge of what

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.200
[Guest]: is good for us and put that into practice in our day-to-day life whenever

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.960
[Guest]: possible and not really beat ourself up for the times like these when you know

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:13.280
[Guest]: this is the last thing on our mind right now and we just want to we have we are

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.800
[Guest]: in that survival instinct where neither are we worried about our weight nor are

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:24.120
[Guest]: we worried about the impact of some chips that I'm going to eat now or I'm

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:29.840
[Guest]: thinking of eating it in a raw state no because even like so many people even in

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.200
[Guest]: the wellness scene world over have said that they have been eating a lot of

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:38.320
[Guest]: sugar they've been eating a lot of carbs in the last one year can't blame

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.800
[Guest]: ourselves for that because that's the way the times are and that's how we are

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:46.580
[Guest]: trying to cope with that so that is also fine but overall you should know what is

01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:51.440
[Guest]: good for you and you know regarding yeah my great-grandparents I really found it

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.720
[Guest]: fascinating when I made that comparison between what we do and you know what

01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.680
[Guest]: I've seen my great-grandparents the way they eat and even much later when there

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.920
[Guest]: was a telephone at home they would actually keep the telephone off hook

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.760
[Guest]: during lunchtime because they don't want to be disturbed by phone calls and today

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.480
[Guest]: we are actually having the mobile phone in our hand and scrolling down and

01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:18.000
[Guest]: seeing what's going on like we we want to be disturbed right and we have gone

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.300
[Guest]: to the other extreme and sometimes they would forget to put the phone back on

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:24.720
[Guest]: hook even until 4 o'clock and and because they were growing old we would

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:27.680
[Guest]: like be you know getting mad at them like what is this they're forever

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.640
[Guest]: forgetting to put this back on hook but that was their dedication to the ritual

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.200
[Guest]: of eating even the most basic simple meal where they didn't know superfoods

01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:41.520
[Guest]: they didn't know what they would buy what was cheap what was in season and

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.440
[Guest]: what was available in their local market and you know they all lived up to 90 and

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.880
[Guest]: touch wood like no ailments or anything so I have seen that firsthand and the

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:58.320
[Guest]: same with my grandparents the kind of dedication and creating a ritual around

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:04.640
[Guest]: eating and having a calm scenario and you know having that respectful

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:09.840
[Guest]: atmosphere towards your food and not just gulping it down so I read this

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:16.200
[Guest]: interesting thing in B Wilson's book called the way we eat where she quotes

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:22.320
[Guest]: this study done on 4,000 Japanese men who live in the US and they were all

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.800
[Guest]: above 30 years of age and they wanted to compare that you know even though they

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:31.840
[Guest]: are eating Japanese food how does their heart disease incidence etc compare with

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.060
[Guest]: the men living in Japan and eating Japanese food and even though these

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:40.960
[Guest]: people living in the US were eating Japanese food their heart disease rates

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:45.520
[Guest]: were fivefold as compared to the ones in Japan why because they didn't have that

01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.760
[Guest]: slow culture they didn't have that sense of attachment towards their food setting

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.840
[Guest]: up everything nicely grab and this the whole American attitude of being rushed

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.760
[Guest]: and grab and go in a hurry and you know the impatience and urgency around food

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:06.160
[Guest]: versus the slower rhythms and the rituals of eating in Japan you know

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.800
[Guest]: though they were eating the same food they still showed where everything else

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:15.160
[Guest]: was constant they still showed fivefold increase in things like heart disease so

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:20.520
[Guest]: it just goes to show that how we eat is a lot lot more important than what we

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:25.360
[Guest]: eat and sometimes we don't even focus on what we eat so let alone how we eat

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:30.200
[Guest]: that's like the next step right so we need to not just understand what is it

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.960
[Guest]: that we're eating but we also need to understand how are we eating are we

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:38.360
[Guest]: eating mindfully and you know are we having that kind of relationship with

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.720
[Guest]: food where it's not over guilt or hate or emotions or boredom but you're eating

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.960
[Guest]: to nourish yourself and it's it's a very healthy relationship yeah there's a

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:53.520
[Amit Varma]: there's a lot of fascinating stuff to unpack them I mean it strikes me that in

01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.560
[Amit Varma]: modern times we are really fighting of a competition between two competing

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.200
[Amit Varma]: addictions or perhaps two cooperating addictions one is to carbs and one is to

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.160
[Amit Varma]: social media which is why we are eating lots and lots of carbs while staring at

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.760
[Amit Varma]: our smartphones I mean I was in keto a couple of years back and I lost almost

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.320
[Amit Varma]: 20 kgs and felt incredibly healthy and no brain fog and so on and it was pretty

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:18.920
[Amit Varma]: amazing but this year I have completely you know you described the kind of

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.120
[Amit Varma]: person who's just ordering comfort food all the time so I've finished my biryani

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.120
[Amit Varma]: phase thankfully that seems to be behind me but now I'm in my pizza phase so God

01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.480
[Amit Varma]: knows where this is going and definitely at my heaviest ever now a couple of sort

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.520
[Amit Varma]: of questions that emerge out of what you said and again staying on the

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.840
[Amit Varma]: grandparents seem because that seems to me to be an interesting dining table to

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.880
[Amit Varma]: use as a prism for looking at our own dining tables in in different ways and

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:49.560
[Amit Varma]: one of those ways is mindfulness like very often when I'm eating even if I've

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.440
[Amit Varma]: ordered something that I really love eating or you know if I've cooked

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:57.880
[Amit Varma]: something I love eating like I make the best bacon and egg fried rice in India

01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:02.640
[Amit Varma]: but even when I'm having food that I love you know I'm only focused on the

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.080
[Amit Varma]: taste for maybe the first 20-30 seconds after that I'm lost in my smartphone or

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm reading something or maybe I'm lost in my thoughts and it's all kind of gone

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.160
[Amit Varma]: and I'm not thinking about my food at all I'm gulping it down I'm definitely

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.480
[Amit Varma]: not chewing as much as I'm supposed to chew and all of that and this is

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.200
[Amit Varma]: something that kind of baffles me that I love food you know taste matters to me

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:28.560
[Amit Varma]: you know I like specific things and I don't like other things but sometimes I

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.040
[Amit Varma]: will be I will have finished a meal without even having focused on it for a

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:36.720
[Amit Varma]: single moment you know and I'm looking back at my childhood and I'm can't

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.600
[Amit Varma]: recall what it was like were we more mindful than like I can totally

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:44.720
[Amit Varma]: imagine taking the phone off the hook because you want it to be an experience

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.680
[Amit Varma]: where you're interacting with your family and you don't have four people

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.160
[Amit Varma]: sitting together but at the same time sitting separately because there's a

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:55.320
[Amit Varma]: screen in front of them have we become less mindful of our food what do you

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:58.680
[Amit Varma]: remember from your personal memories and is this something that you tell yourself

01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:02.680
[Amit Varma]: when you sit down to eat that I'm going to focus on the taste now that I'm going

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.600
[Amit Varma]: to actually do you have to force yourself to do that number one and

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.960
[Amit Varma]: number two if you were to sort of make a normative judgment on this is this bad

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:17.760
[Amit Varma]: is not being mindful while eating bad and if so why I just address the thing

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.720
[Guest]: you asked last first and then go back into the question see it is bad for a

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:29.640
[Guest]: few reasons the most obvious being that we are consuming calories or food in

01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:34.480
[Guest]: some form and we are not enjoying that and we are not putting our mind into it

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.120
[Guest]: and at the end of it we don't even know sometimes if have we eaten it or not

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.440
[Guest]: because we have been so absent from the whole process of eating and the other

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:48.560
[Guest]: problem this leads to is that you know even satiety is in a way linked to this

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:53.640
[Guest]: so if your mind has not been in the process your body may not even realize

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:57.560
[Guest]: that hey I've eaten so you may end up eating again something very soon because

01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:01.720
[Guest]: forget the digestion your mind has not digested the fact that you have eaten

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:06.400
[Guest]: that food and in a way one doesn't end up consuming more calories because

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.000
[Guest]: invariably when we are not focused on our eating process because it takes 20

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.080
[Guest]: minutes for the stomach to send the signal to the brain that it's full but

01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:18.680
[Guest]: if we have finished our whole food in five minutes then where is the time to

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.400
[Guest]: understand how full or how not full are we I was doing intermittent fasting for

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:28.040
[Guest]: a very long time and it helped me a great deal but I had to stop because I

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.560
[Guest]: started getting like excruciating headaches and I was not I was not able

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.560
[Guest]: to do it anymore but I realized when I started fasting that how hunger feels

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:43.080
[Guest]: you know because we are so used to being surrounded by food all the time and

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:48.000
[Guest]: especially being someone who is in the food space and I'm constantly cooking

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.520
[Guest]: tasting you know and I've never been religious so I have never done a

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:58.560
[Guest]: religious fast in my life and this is what I felt okay this is how hunger

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:04.840
[Guest]: feels like and just to experience hunger was like a miracle because we you know

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.000
[Guest]: in our privileged setup we never experience hunger before we feel hungry

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.720
[Guest]: we've already eaten something right and very rarely if we've gone out especially

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:17.320
[Guest]: in Bangalore scenario and you got stuck in traffic for two hours and then you

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:21.720
[Guest]: come back home really hungry but that's like a forced situation you've never

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:26.480
[Guest]: done it voluntarily so I think just experiencing what hunger feels like

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:31.880
[Guest]: experiencing what full feels like we don't unless we pay attention to our

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:36.840
[Guest]: body you're not going to even know this and even though I've written a book

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.760
[Guest]: about this it's a constant struggle you know sometimes even before I sit down to

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.280
[Guest]: eat I think what am I going to watch with this today you know because my

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.720
[Guest]: eating time is sometimes my only free time in the day and I have other

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.600
[Guest]: deadlines lined up and things to do so I feel this is the only time I can give

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:55.520
[Guest]: myself a break and watch something but why don't I treat the food itself as a

02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:00.840
[Guest]: break why do I need an additional crutch to add on to this break right and this

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.920
[Guest]: is interesting thing last December November I started watching these Korean

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:09.840
[Guest]: YouTube vloggers I'm not talking about Kdrama I haven't started watching that

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.160
[Guest]: yet despite too much pressure on Twitter I see that everywhere you know I was

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.680
[Guest]: fascinated by the way they lead their lives and these are not just Koreans in

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.520
[Guest]: Korea but also the ones who live in US and other places and trust me it was

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.920
[Guest]: like a rabbit hole and I could never come out of it it was so fascinating and

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:33.320
[Guest]: riveting how slow how meaningful how mindful they lead their life and I'm not

02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.080
[Guest]: saying because somebody on YouTube just posted a vlog about that and that's how

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:41.560
[Guest]: they all are but it does give me the impression that they definitely stick to

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.880
[Guest]: these traditions they take this very seriously they believe in cooking

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.960
[Guest]: everything from scratch and even their children and the next generation loves

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:54.200
[Guest]: Korean traditional food and no matter because their food also has quite

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.920
[Guest]: different kinds of sometimes bitter they even use things like karela in their

02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.680
[Guest]: cooking and you know the kids eat everything and they all sit together at

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.080
[Guest]: the table and this is one scene which I won't forget there's this and they also

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.960
[Guest]: show a lot of cleaning in their videos they're obsessed with keeping their

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.000
[Guest]: house spotlessly clean and I watched that while saying that my own room is

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.360
[Guest]: dirty but I'm watching that and you know after cleaning the bathroom and

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.160
[Guest]: everything scrubbing the whole house clean she'll come to her balcony and

02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:28.080
[Guest]: make herself a like a small pot of some beautiful tea and in a small plate some

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.400
[Guest]: two pieces of cake and cookie and she'll keep it on her table on the balcony no

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:39.360
[Guest]: no gadgets no books nothing around and she will slowly be sipping that and

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.360
[Guest]: eating that while one cat is purring around so this is the classic scene and

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:49.520
[Guest]: it made me feel like I want that life and I want to be in that mental state

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:53.720
[Guest]: where you know I finish all the housework and I take this break with a

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:58.840
[Guest]: cup of tea and a cake which I eat and drink absolutely guilt-free and I feel

02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.640
[Guest]: like I have earned this and putting my whole mind and all my five senses into

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.800
[Guest]: this experience and how can that cake make you gain weight because it has

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.560
[Guest]: already released so much of happy hormones the good kind of hormones instead of the

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.280
[Guest]: stressful cortisol that actually makes you accumulate the belly fat and all

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:23.600
[Guest]: that so I feel like this is why how you eat is so important imagine just going

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:27.520
[Guest]: through a drive-thru like in a country where there's a drive-thru and buying

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:31.400
[Guest]: some of these you know cakes or some milkshakes or something and drinking in

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.520
[Guest]: the car and going away that is so American but you know when you see this

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.440
[Guest]: stark difference in Korea and their culture you know there's so much to

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:43.960
[Guest]: learn from that I'm sure Indians were also like that but these guys just make

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.920
[Guest]: the most aesthetic and pleasing videos that make you aspire to that kind of

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:53.440
[Amit Varma]: life. In fact this is another cinematic moment like I can think of you know if a

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.800
[Amit Varma]: film of your life would begin with you know Eli Roth or Louis Bunuel perhaps

02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.640
[Amit Varma]: directing that scene where the skull is being cut open and they're singing

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.440
[Amit Varma]: happy birthday it could end with you know Ozu directing the last scene of the

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:09.600
[Amit Varma]: closing credits where you're in the balcony with a little cup of tea and one

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.600
[Amit Varma]: little biscuit and there's just peace and quiet and focus so suddenly you know

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.240
[Amit Varma]: a full journey we have kind of traveled here those who of course were Japanese

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:24.320
[Amit Varma]: and not Korean but you know similar feels as it were. The other aspect of

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.360
[Amit Varma]: you know what you describe about your great-grandparents table is

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:34.400
[Amit Varma]: something that almost seems to me to become a virtue out of necessity like

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:39.760
[Amit Varma]: you point out that they eat food which is local seasonal cheap they don't cook

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:43.080
[Amit Varma]: more than they are going to eat at a particular meal but that flows from

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:47.040
[Amit Varma]: necessity because there are no fridges so they can't store food there are no

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.960
[Amit Varma]: fridges the world is not so interconnected that food can come from

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.680
[Amit Varma]: wherever so out of necessity you are eating local seasonal and cheap and that

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:58.840
[Amit Varma]: becomes a virtue. Now you know going back to what Pauline said and of course

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:01.600
[Amit Varma]: Pauline didn't literally mean that you have to eat what your great great great

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.640
[Amit Varma]: great grandmother ate. Two conflicting thoughts come up here for me and one

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:09.960
[Amit Varma]: thought of course is the classic conservative thought that if there is a

02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.120
[Amit Varma]: particular diet that has evolved over a period of time if your grandmother said

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.760
[Amit Varma]: this is healthy eat this there's a reason it has evolved because it works

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:23.040
[Amit Varma]: for you and sometimes our traditions have sort of deeper reasonings behind

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:27.000
[Amit Varma]: them which might not necessarily be a reasoning that was scientific to begin

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.200
[Amit Varma]: with but just comes from the practice through generations and so on and there

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:35.720
[Amit Varma]: is much value and merit in that. At the same time it strikes me that our great

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.640
[Amit Varma]: great grandparents didn't have access to either a lot of the food or the

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.360
[Amit Varma]: knowledge that we do like we are surrounded by so many different kinds of

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:48.800
[Amit Varma]: foods today that our grandparents would not have known and and the question then

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:54.760
[Amit Varma]: comes up is that you know how how does one evolve a set of values around what

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:59.800
[Amit Varma]: one is to eat like when you think of your own eating for example so there is

02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.960
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of food that you like eating that because you've grown up

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:07.280
[Amit Varma]: eating that and you acquire tastes along the way but at some point in time you've

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:11.000
[Amit Varma]: clearly thought and said that this is the kind of food that I want to eat and

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.880
[Amit Varma]: this is my philosophy behind this kind of food this is why I want to eat this

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of food and at the same time of course I do want it to be tasty as well

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:24.040
[Amit Varma]: so it is not only you know this thing. How did you evolve your way of thinking

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:29.120
[Amit Varma]: about food and where would you say it has kind of arrived today. I've been a

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:35.120
[Guest]: vegetarian since I was born I was born in a vegetarian family and of course I

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:43.120
[Guest]: ate eggs and that was the limit of my you know dietary habits. See currently

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:47.200
[Guest]: like you said I'm always grown up eating Tamil food South Indian food there was

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:53.040
[Guest]: not like much experimentation happening my one of my aunts was like keen on

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:57.680
[Guest]: trying out new things and she would like cut things from magazines and try them

02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.920
[Guest]: out and I was like a willing taster for everything so that exposed me a little

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:09.400
[Guest]: bit outside of our very traditional food but growing up that was it and you know

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:13.800
[Guest]: we were not like the very restaurant visiting family either because one very

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:19.480
[Guest]: middle-class and money had to be saved for more important things and also you

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.640
[Guest]: know we had like a couple of restaurants in the Dadar, Sayan area where we would

02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:28.800
[Guest]: love the food and we'd go like once in few months as a treat and I just would

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:35.240
[Guest]: order the same thing you know in these places and that was my food world and

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:39.080
[Guest]: it's not like we had like too much of a social circle of friends or eating at

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:43.880
[Guest]: other people's houses so I was not even exposed much to other Indian cuisines

02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:50.560
[Guest]: let alone much of foreign cuisines but today as you say there's been such an

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:56.320
[Guest]: explosion in the last decade or so from things like food shows, cookbooks,

02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:04.680
[Guest]: magazines, YouTube and you know on the web so much of content and even stuff

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:09.880
[Guest]: that's available like at the click of a button on Amazon you can order anything

02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:14.600
[Guest]: right from gochugaru to a smoked paprika to you name it you will get it

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:20.120
[Guest]: instantly so availability is there all the kind of creative ideas are there and

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:24.280
[Guest]: if you are interested in trying out these new things and of course there's

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.720
[Guest]: whole bunch of restaurants and delivery services so it is so much stimulation

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:34.540
[Guest]: available for you to choose from so it becomes increasingly difficult what the

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.000
[Guest]: hell do I eat you know sometimes you know I tell my husband I'm not going to

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.520
[Guest]: cook today I'm very bored and you say okay let's order and then we figure out

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.360
[Guest]: for half an hour, one hour what to order and I said I would have just finished

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.120
[Guest]: cooking in this much time you know so it's just like what to order and what to

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.720
[Guest]: eat is like you just tear your hair over that and it's sometimes more painful

02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:59.240
[Guest]: than the cooking process itself so how do you even choose what to cook and

02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:04.320
[Guest]: sometimes sometimes I go about the way of a menu plan where I tell myself also

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.520
[Guest]: in some sometimes I'm in the middle of some recipe testing for my books or my

02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:13.160
[Guest]: column etc so I will write down that I want to make these things in the week

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.960
[Guest]: and sometimes something catches my fancy online and I say okay I wish I could try

02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:23.200
[Guest]: that out and I will make a note of that but then you know some I just go back to

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:29.040
[Guest]: sambar rice and sabzi because I don't want to think about what to make and I

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.080
[Guest]: don't have to you know read my whole kitchen which ingredient is where this

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:39.120
[Guest]: that and just keep it very simple and I think five days a week I just keep it

02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.460
[Guest]: very very simple because I think like Steve Jobs who just knew what to wear in

02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:47.160
[Guest]: the morning every day I just feel more comfortable knowing what am I going to

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:52.400
[Guest]: cook every day I don't want to be raking my head in the morning what's for lunch

02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:58.480
[Guest]: what's for dinner so I think one is a comfort of going back to tradition and

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:04.720
[Guest]: two not having the hassle of thinking too much about what so within the

02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.760
[Guest]: spectrum how can I eat healthy maybe one day I will eat millets and I'll have

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:15.480
[Guest]: some kind of raw salad along with my meal and I in the vegetable it will be

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:20.080
[Guest]: something seasonal and you know am I having something fermented like dahi or

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:25.200
[Guest]: some pickle with this so within the construct of my traditional food I just

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.760
[Guest]: figure out what is available what is the best see also even cooking is a process

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.920
[Guest]: of choosing from the best ingredients and making something nice out of it and

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:39.200
[Guest]: in this case by best I mean what is the healthiest and best for you for your

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:43.480
[Guest]: health and if I could choose from ten different things okay I want to put this

02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.000
[Guest]: this this together in my plate today but I know what I'm going to make if it's

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000
[Guest]: just like a sambar or a rasam or a curry I just know have to apply that into this

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.760
[Guest]: that process just makes it simpler when you are the one cooking because I have

02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.040
[Guest]: seen friends and people who you know they are outside and their cook calls

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.280
[Guest]: them from out ki madam kya banao and they just say kuch bhi banao because they

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.580
[Guest]: one they've outsourced the whole cooking process outsource the buying of the

02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:13.040
[Guest]: grocery and stuff now you're also outsourcing the process of deciding what

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:16.920
[Guest]: you are going to eat the person who's cooking for you I find that most

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.240
[Guest]: fascinating amusing and also like boss why are you giving away your health in

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:25.120
[Guest]: your cooks hands like you can't even decide what you want to eat you know

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.840
[Guest]: because even that process is so tough telling the cook what to cook no it's

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.600
[Amit Varma]: it's all fascinating and you mentioned Steve Jobs and obviously the reason

02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Jobs used to kind of wear the same clothes every day like not literally the

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:42.600
[Amit Varma]: same clothes clothes but you know that the same kind of uniform as it were the

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.000
[Amit Varma]: black turtleneck shirt and the jeans was to avoid what cognitive psychologists

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.840
[Amit Varma]: call decision fatigue because every decision you take through a day tires

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.800
[Amit Varma]: you out and you want to save as much energy as possible and one way of jobs

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.920
[Amit Varma]: was that he doesn't have to decide what he's going to wear so it's the same

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.960
[Amit Varma]: thing every day and equally in your first book which is the everyday healthy

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.220
[Amit Varma]: vegetarian which you wrote in 2017 for Hachette you spoke about I think the

02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:08.440
[Amit Varma]: importance of menu preparation of deciding in advance what you're going to

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:12.240
[Amit Varma]: eat through the week and all of that and that kind of brings me to my next

02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.040
[Amit Varma]: question now one reason for doing that would obviously be to save yourself from

02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:20.080
[Amit Varma]: decision fatigue so rather than tire yourself out by thinking what you're

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.320
[Amit Varma]: going to eat you can decide a menu for the week in advance and just go with

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.660
[Amit Varma]: that but the other aspect of that is that what you're really doing there it

02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:30.760
[Amit Varma]: seems to me is setting out a process for yourself like one of my favorite self

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:34.880
[Amit Varma]: help books of modern times is James Clear's atomic habits where he talks

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:39.240
[Amit Varma]: about how it's more important to have processes and goals that everybody can

02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:42.840
[Amit Varma]: have great goals but the only people who achieve those goals are the people who

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.600
[Amit Varma]: have great processes and it strikes me that you know when one is eating it's

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:52.360
[Amit Varma]: you know more important to just build healthy eating habits over a time

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.840
[Amit Varma]: through certain processes rather than set yourself a target like you know I

02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:02.040
[Amit Varma]: will eat so many calories every day or I will lose so much weight by this period

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: of time and all of that and those goals can get counterproductive and the goals

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.440
[Amit Varma]: alone can stress you out whereas if you just internalize a self-image of

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.600
[Amit Varma]: yourself like I am a person who eats healthy I am a person who eats at

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.000
[Amit Varma]: particular times and that's another thing you mentioned about your

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.240
[Amit Varma]: grandparents that they ate at these fixed particular times during the day so

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:24.800
[Amit Varma]: like one I guess it's a two-step process one you build a prism through which you

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:28.080
[Amit Varma]: look at food which you built in which you've kind of outlined in your book as

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.880
[Amit Varma]: well and we'll talk a little more about that now but and then once you build that

02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:37.640
[Amit Varma]: prism you use it to build processes and then everything takes care of itself is

02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.240
[Amit Varma]: that an accurate description is that how you've sort of approached it yeah you're

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:47.440
[Guest]: right because see healthy eating more than anything else it is the planning

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.480
[Guest]: that counts because I may have all the good intentions but when I open my fridge

02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.520
[Guest]: and the first thing I see is like a desert in front of me and if I'm hungry

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.860
[Guest]: I am going to reach out for that I mean it's it's not willpower or anything it's

02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:06.080
[Guest]: just that it's there so what you see is what you eat if I had planned a little

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.000
[Guest]: bit better and if I had kept things like a hummus or some vegetables or some you

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.520
[Guest]: know fruits which are cut and ready in transparent containers when I open the

02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:21.120
[Guest]: fridge that is what I see so that is the planning that you know telling yourself

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:26.340
[Guest]: what are you going to eat like even when they tell people to visualize your

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:31.400
[Guest]: success right like you imagine yourself going and doing all that so this kind of

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.880
[Guest]: planning is that I'm only telling myself tomorrow I'm going to eat this this this

02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:39.960
[Guest]: and you know if we have told ourselves that that plan is already in place so

02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.860
[Guest]: when I get hungry I don't have to think about what am I going to eat now because

02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:47.960
[Guest]: when you're hungry most likely the decision you take will not be a correct

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.600
[Guest]: decision anyway so for those times is when which is why they also say that you

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:56.120
[Guest]: never go for food shopping when you're hungry always go after you've had your

02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:01.560
[Guest]: lunch and because that definitely impacts the way you think and the choices

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:07.040
[Guest]: you make so having a plan in place is the first step towards any kind of

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:10.600
[Guest]: healthy eating even if you're going to order out you tell yourself that these

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.880
[Guest]: are the restaurants this these are the dishes and keep a list of them and you

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.240
[Guest]: know that of all the other choices these may be better so I'm going to order from

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:24.440
[Guest]: these so and that's how you can even be prepared stock up for these things and

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.440
[Guest]: have all the things you need for a certain meal or something already

02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.240
[Guest]: because then it's so tough if you want you have the intention you want to eat

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.560
[Guest]: something healthy but there is nothing available and when you open your fridge

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.880
[Guest]: the only things that you see are things that are not good for you then how is it

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:45.920
[Guest]: going to help you stick to your plan it's going to be so difficult so I try

02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.840
[Guest]: to follow that and of course all this planning and prepping it does take so

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:54.720
[Guest]: much time and effort and it is tough I'm not saying no but if you keep doing this

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:58.320
[Guest]: it kind of becomes a second habit like when you order your groceries you also

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:04.240
[Guest]: order a few couple of fruits or you know something like that so yeah so that

02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.720
[Guest]: that's that's a simple way to go about this the planning and processes and

02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.280
[Amit Varma]: being well prepared no and I guess there are ways to even outsource little bits

02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:17.440
[Amit Varma]: of that like when I was in Quito I realized that there are these services

02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.600
[Unknown]: in you know Mumbai and I'm sure even Bangalore who'll provide you four keto

02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:24.720
[Amit Varma]: meals a day so you don't actually even have to think about it or there are apps

02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.600
[Amit Varma]: where which will calculate the calories of everything and tell you what you

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.040
[Amit Varma]: should have next to meet your macros and all of that my next question is kind of

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:37.600
[Amit Varma]: about a theme that I've thought a bit about but I've only sort of while

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:41.320
[Amit Varma]: chatting with you it struck me that it applies to food as well which is about

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:45.760
[Amit Varma]: how you know along with the great technological advances we have had in

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:48.760
[Amit Varma]: these times all of which are a blessing to us and have made our lives so much

02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:53.000
[Amit Varma]: better and which in fact are enabling this conversation there are also some

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.320
[Amit Varma]: that have a flip side and the flip side is that there is a lot of technology

02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.480
[Amit Varma]: today for manipulation of the brain for example in the context of social media

02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:06.360
[Amit Varma]: everything becomes much more addictive that people have sort of figured out and

02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.440
[Amit Varma]: in my years as a professional gambler I kind of read up a lot on how casinos do

02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:15.240
[Amit Varma]: this also how the lights and the sounds and all of that will ensure that you

02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.960
[Amit Varma]: keep chasing the next dopamine rush and similarly you know social media also

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:24.960
[Amit Varma]: does that it's meant to keep keep you on that dopamine like you know one of the

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.320
[Amit Varma]: things that some of the apps did a few years ago I think they all probably do

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:31.640
[Amit Varma]: it now is that if you press the back button you wouldn't go back the screen

02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:35.600
[Amit Varma]: would refresh so you'd have more stories so you simply can't get away you're

02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:39.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of trapped and it strikes me that this also happens in the context of food

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.400
[Amit Varma]: where our brain is drawn towards sweet food there are certain kind of foods

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.360
[Amit Varma]: that we get addicted to like I really think that carbs in a sense are an

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:52.000
[Amit Varma]: addiction this is an addiction that processed foods take advantage of they

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.320
[Amit Varma]: are not just designed to be tasty or and they're not just designed to have some

02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.960
[Amit Varma]: nutrition as and when they do but they are designed to be addictive in fact

02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:04.160
[Amit Varma]: that is a fundamental you know design imperative of processed food because

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.840
[Amit Varma]: whoever's making them wants you to go out and buy them again and again and

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:11.640
[Amit Varma]: again and this also makes them incredibly unhealthy and this is

02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:16.160
[Amit Varma]: something that you've also you know spoken about in your book so tell me a

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:20.760
[Amit Varma]: little bit about processed foods and what can we do to fight them because a

02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:24.480
[Amit Varma]: lot of processed foods are common everyday foods like white sugar or

02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:28.000
[Amit Varma]: tomato ketchup you know how should we reduce the kind of processed foods we

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.920
[Amit Varma]: take are there any processed foods which are actually okay and you know what is

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:37.880
[Guest]: your approach to all of this see the processed food industry I'm sure they

02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:45.640
[Guest]: spend millions or billions of dollars on just the science of creating an

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:51.680
[Guest]: addictive combination in matters of flavor so people just it's like that you

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:56.640
[Guest]: can't eat just one tagline of Lay's right and that's how they are designed

02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.120
[Guest]: to be and recently I was reading up on this thing about comfort foods right the

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.760
[Guest]: kind of foods that we reach out to when we are feeling low and we want to feel

02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:12.960
[Guest]: better etc and invariably a comfort food anywhere in the world will be a

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:21.320
[Guest]: combination of sugar fat and carbs in some way and either one or two or all

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:26.800
[Guest]: three of these it goes back to when we were babies you know when we were

02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.840
[Guest]: agitated or when we would cry when we would be hungry mothers would feed us

02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:36.960
[Guest]: breast milk or any milk bottled milk and that milk had the same combination of

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:42.520
[Guest]: sugars fats and carbs that would instantly soothe us and babies either go

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:49.040
[Guest]: to sleep or they stop crying right so that same thing has continued as a part

02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:53.680
[Guest]: of our evolution all into our adulthood there that same combination of food no

02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:58.440
[Guest]: matter what the end result may not be milk at all it may be chips or it may be

02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:04.480
[Guest]: a desert or it may be pasta or whatever it is that same combination of compounds

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:10.080
[Guest]: triggers off that same dopamine kind of scenario in our brain where we feel

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:14.840
[Guest]: soothed and comforted and the way we would feel as babies so it is something

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:20.720
[Guest]: as basic as that and no matter what diet somebody's on they cannot be not

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.880
[Guest]: comforted with these kind of foods and that's why it becomes all the more a big

02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:31.840
[Guest]: struggle to you know avoid these things in my life I mean not anyone's life and

02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:36.480
[Guest]: you know I often tell people that if I have to give up rice then I might as

02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:40.040
[Guest]: well give up living because what am I going to do with my life if you tell me

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:46.440
[Guest]: I can't eat rice ever so I think this this is definitely one aspect of it and

02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:51.560
[Guest]: the processed food industry takes maximum advantage of the fact that these

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:56.280
[Guest]: three compounds you given any combination plus with the added flavor

02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:01.640
[Guest]: molecules which they have done so much worth of research on they know that

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.200
[Guest]: people are going to be hooked to this product and in my book I have written

02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:11.160
[Guest]: about the very basic cornflakes or the cereal that a lot of Indians have moved

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:14.840
[Guest]: towards eating that for breakfast because you just remove it from a box

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.920
[Guest]: and you add some milk and you add some fruit and you think it's healthy but

02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:26.440
[Guest]: compare a cornflakes to a Bhutta or the full the corn on the cob that we see in

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:31.040
[Guest]: the monsoons and now pretty much see around the year so that is the real food

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:35.840
[Guest]: at least close to real because even that must have gone through some chemical

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:42.400
[Guest]: processes and whatever but each of those corn kernels the ectosperm or the skin

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:49.480
[Guest]: is peeled off then it is cooked then it is dried and then it is roasted and then

02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:53.800
[Guest]: it is a flattened and then it is packaged and in the middle of these

02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:59.000
[Guest]: processes you get all the additives of sugar salt flavorings all the artificial

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.200
[Guest]: strawberry fruit flavor or the chocolate flavor and of course preservatives so

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:07.880
[Guest]: that you can buy it and keep it even for one year nothing will go wrong try to

02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:11.880
[Guest]: keep like a corn on the cob for one year in your fridge and see what happens

02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:17.080
[Guest]: right so we don't even realize we think how I ate cornflakes this is called a

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:22.240
[Guest]: healthy brand of cornflakes and I've had it with milk and fruit and honey all of

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:26.200
[Guest]: it is very healthy so we feel happy that we've eaten something healthy but if we

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:31.280
[Guest]: give a little thought as to what process has gone behind you know from its

02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:35.680
[Guest]: natural form to the form that you see it in front of you what are all the

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:40.160
[Guest]: processes that have gone into it and it could all have been avoided if you chose

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.760
[Guest]: something as simple as a poha which is just rice which has been flattened so

02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:48.720
[Guest]: the number of processes have been so less and then you make it in whatever

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.760
[Guest]: way you want right so even like in the Bengalis they just have that with milk

02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:59.520
[Guest]: the poha right and some sugar so even that is much less process than eating

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:05.720
[Guest]: your processed cereal so I think the first step is definitely awareness and

02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:09.880
[Guest]: again that question of mindfulness comes in because if I'm in a hurry I'm just

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:15.320
[Guest]: shaking that box of cereal into my bowl and adding milk and eating it on the go

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:19.560
[Guest]: where am I going to spend a minute thinking about what how did this

02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:24.440
[Guest]: cornflakes come across and how did it become like this what is there in it

02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:28.880
[Guest]: have I read the nutritional label do I know what ingredients these are do they

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:33.480
[Guest]: even sound like food so you know and like I said initially it may be a bit

02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:37.720
[Guest]: tiresome because we are surrounded by things like this and I don't say it is

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.800
[Guest]: easy at all to think about everything that we put in our mouth then we say I'd

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:46.360
[Guest]: rather be fasting because this is too complicated but I think having this

02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:51.520
[Guest]: basic knowledge about at least the 10-15 things that you eat on a regular basis

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:56.160
[Guest]: and translating that knowledge into a second nature by which you just know

02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:01.920
[Guest]: what is good you don't and I think human beings as a race we have been innately

02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:06.800
[Guest]: using food as medicine we know what is good for us in the hunter-gatherer thing

02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:10.960
[Guest]: they didn't have any barcode or app to tell them what is this how many calories

02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:17.400
[Guest]: is this and stuff they just knew and I think over the last thousands of years

02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:22.520
[Guest]: we have moved away so much from our inherent knowledge and trusting our own

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:27.280
[Guest]: instincts that for everything we have to either Google or understand what is

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:33.280
[Guest]: happening so I think as humans we have lost the we have lost the knowledge or

02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.200
[Guest]: that inherent knowledge of what foods are good for us what we should go for

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.680
[Guest]: and I think we have distanced ourselves so much and a lot of industries lobbies

02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:46.760
[Guest]: and all they are also responsible for that but we are also responsible in a

02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:50.720
[Guest]: way that we have not been so careful we just think okay it's something I'm going

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:53.280
[Guest]: to eat it you don't realize that there is something external which you're

02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:57.920
[Guest]: putting into your body which is going to become part of your body in the next 24

02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:03.920
[Guest]: hours and you don't give it that much importance so I think understanding food

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:09.000
[Guest]: is more important than just trusting these YouTube videos or these Instagram

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.080
[Guest]: posts with millions of views where they just say this is good this is bad very

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:19.200
[Guest]: binary very yes and no kind of answers which is very easy for people because it

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:24.280
[Guest]: saves their time and their effort but do these people even know your body do they

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:29.200
[Guest]: know your lifestyle your culture because it is it is never a yes and no it's

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:35.640
[Guest]: never a binary it is so complicated and it is so personalized and it differs

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.640
[Guest]: from person to person so how can you just believe something that gives you

02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:44.480
[Guest]: such an oversimplified information just because you don't want to spend time and

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.160
[Guest]: invest that time into your own health by understanding what you should eat

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.440
[Guest]: because you are the only person who knows what is best for you yeah and it

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.560
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that you know earlier we spoke of decision fatigue and Steve

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Jobs and all of that and one of the ways people deal with decision fatigue is

02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:01.640
[Amit Varma]: something called satisficing which is a combination of satisfying and sufficing

02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.040
[Amit Varma]: where you're satisfied with something that suffices and a lot of people do

02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:10.520
[Amit Varma]: satisficing when it comes to their diet and that makes no sense because it's a

02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.840
[Amit Varma]: question of what you're putting inside your own body it is shaping the

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.240
[Amit Varma]: well-being of your future self why on earth would you want to satisfy with

02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.440
[Amit Varma]: that you can satisfy say if you're going out to buy a new shirt or a toaster or

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:24.160
[Amit Varma]: whatever but when it comes to the food that you're putting inside your own body

02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:27.720
[Amit Varma]: you you should not be absent-minded you should not go with the flow or you

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:32.000
[Amit Varma]: should not follow like you said what an influencer might say on Instagram or

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.680
[Amit Varma]: YouTube unless that influencer is around the third year and instead sort of think

02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.240
[Amit Varma]: a little harder for yourself by the way I'm half Bengali but despite that I like

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:45.600
[Amit Varma]: the thought of neither poha nor milk nor sugar so that was for a moment I was a

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.440
[Amit Varma]: ghastly thought of a combination now I am reminded by something you said of

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:54.240
[Amit Varma]: this great book called behave by Robert Sapolsky and and you know the listeners

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:57.320
[Amit Varma]: who will hark back to the first commercial of this episode will realize

02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:01.480
[Amit Varma]: that I've recommended a course by Sapolsky which is on the great courses

02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:04.920
[Amit Varma]: plus who are the sponsors of this fine episode so do check them out but

02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Sapolsky's written this great book called behave and what he does in behave

02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:13.120
[Amit Varma]: is really interesting where he'll take an action and then he'll explain the

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:16.680
[Amit Varma]: proximate reason for it and then he'll go a little further back in time and

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.840
[Amit Varma]: explain a deeper reason for it which goes further back and he'll go all the

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.040
[Amit Varma]: way back to how we are wired in prehistoric times and in a similar sense

02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.600
[Amit Varma]: I think when it comes for our addiction to packaged food you can go far back

02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:32.400
[Amit Varma]: like you went as far as a baby having the mother's milk but you know really I

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:37.000
[Amit Varma]: think one has to go back to prehistoric times where the you know when our brains

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.240
[Amit Varma]: were wired by natural selection and the fact of the matter is you didn't know

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.560
[Amit Varma]: where your next meal was coming from you didn't know when you're going to you

02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:48.680
[Amit Varma]: know get you know kill the next deer as it were or managed to find suitable food

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:52.520
[Amit Varma]: growing somewhere and and therefore whoever had the instinct to take in as

02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.640
[Amit Varma]: many calories as it possibly can would be more likely to survive and therefore

02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:00.520
[Amit Varma]: more likely to propagate and therefore those genes kind of go forward into the

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:04.960
[Amit Varma]: world which is why it's so hard for some of us to stop eating that you know we

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.800
[Amit Varma]: might be full even after the stomach sends a signal to the brain that hey

02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:12.360
[Amit Varma]: you're full 20 minutes have passed you're full you were full 20 minutes ago

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.920
[Amit Varma]: chill out and stop but still you'll continue you know who can stop at one

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:22.280
[Amit Varma]: like in many ways we need to fight our own hardwiring and this seems to be to

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.640
[Amit Varma]: be one of the ways let's let's talk about your book now before the entire

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:30.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of conversation gets over and Nandita I hear fanboys and fangirls tell

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:33.760
[Amit Varma]: me that you spoke to her for three hours and you didn't even ask her what are

02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.120
[Amit Varma]: superfoods so I can't do that obviously what was the impetus behind writing this

02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:43.920
[Amit Varma]: specific book and what are superfoods so the impetus behind writing the book is

02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:49.520
[Guest]: something we already discussed that in the space of food and nutrition the

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:55.760
[Guest]: misinformation is in abundance and oversimplified information and you know

02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.840
[Guest]: trying to dumb down things to a level where they're no longer even true and it

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.880
[Guest]: would annoy me a great deal and you know the typically how these algorithms on

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.280
[Guest]: social media and the internet work is that if people have watched this YouTube

02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.720
[Guest]: video a few million times and no matter what you search for it will come up as

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.720
[Guest]: the most watched recommendation right so that misinformation cycle is just going

02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:26.580
[Guest]: on faster and faster and you know things like you know drink this tea and lose

02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:32.980
[Guest]: weight in 20 20 kilos and there's so many such videos it's not funny and you

02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:37.080
[Guest]: know I'm not saying that someone who does not have a health or medical

02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:42.280
[Guest]: background cannot understand nutrition but it does help in understanding it at

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:47.560
[Guest]: a deeper level or understanding when you read certain studies journals papers you

02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:52.000
[Guest]: understand the language you understand what they are trying to convey and you

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:57.360
[Guest]: understand what is verified versus just some you know legend going around the

02:29:57.360 --> 02:30:01.960
[Guest]: internet so you learn to differentiate good from bad and it really helps so when

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:07.480
[Guest]: people who have absolutely no background purely because of internet fame and

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:11.560
[Guest]: stuff and algorithms they just call themselves experts and continue

02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:17.680
[Guest]: spreading misinformation it used to like trouble me a lot and I said okay I am

02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:24.120
[Guest]: why not write something that speaks of moderation and not just in binaries and

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:30.360
[Guest]: trying to explain the complexity behind the science and also in a way provide

02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:34.280
[Guest]: the knowledge to people and readers so they can take their own decisions and

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:39.240
[Guest]: create their own diet plans create their own menus and I don't want to force feed

02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:43.000
[Guest]: anything to people that is not a part of their culture that is they cannot

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:50.480
[Guest]: sustain for their whole life and this was just this was the whole thinking

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:54.920
[Guest]: behind the book is to create like a step-by-step hand-holding kind of

02:30:54.920 --> 02:31:00.680
[Guest]: approach where people understand that it's not straight jumping to a recipe or

02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:05.960
[Guest]: a diet but first you need to understand what is your relationship with food how

02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:10.680
[Guest]: can you improve your relationship with food then what are the ways in which you

02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:15.160
[Guest]: know that how we eat aspect of things versus you know what are we eating and

02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:19.640
[Guest]: then talking about how certain superfoods are good for certain

02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:23.740
[Guest]: conditions so while you may eat everything these things may benefit you

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:29.800
[Guest]: more I chose 39 superfoods to be a part of this using the criteria of are they

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:35.160
[Guest]: local are they easily available are they fairly inexpensive and is it processed

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:40.080
[Guest]: or unprocessed like I won't count orange juice as a superfood so using these

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:44.200
[Guest]: criteria I chose these but this is just a very small introduction of course

02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:48.560
[Guest]: through this people will also understand that other similar you know if red grapes

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:53.440
[Guest]: is good even green grapes are good and they can build their own list and when

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:57.760
[Guest]: they cook or they eat why not pick things which are already so rich in

02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:02.020
[Guest]: nutrients that finally the dish that you cook will be very nutritious for you

02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:06.000
[Guest]: rather than choose lesser nutritious ingredients which are not giving that

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.120
[Guest]: much nutrient per calorie so it is calorie rich but nutrient poor so why

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:14.760
[Guest]: not when you're cooking something make the most of the food that is easily

02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:20.440
[Guest]: available to us and and then coming down to describing each of these ingredients

02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:24.760
[Guest]: a little bit of history and the different ways again anything that you

02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:28.560
[Guest]: call a superfood and you want to eat more of it throughout your life it has

02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:32.800
[Guest]: to be a versatile ingredient it can't be just used in one particular dish in a

02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:36.600
[Guest]: small quantity and then you're not going to get enough benefit out of it so

02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:41.520
[Guest]: things like say a green moong or a pumpkin they are so versatile you can

02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:46.040
[Guest]: cook it in hundred different ways and still come up with newer ways so talking

02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:50.400
[Guest]: about the different ways in which people can include this in their diet in simple

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:56.120
[Guest]: ways and then coming up with things like meal prep because like we said planning

02:32:56.120 --> 02:33:00.000
[Guest]: is everything when it comes to healthy eating and if you have meal prep these

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.960
[Guest]: five six different things and it's in your fridge it's so easy to put together

02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:09.520
[Guest]: a salad if you've already cooked some rajma or chana and you have some millet

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:13.360
[Guest]: and then you add that and then you have some shelled pomegranate you add that so

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:18.040
[Guest]: you and some just lime juice and some olive oil and you have a hearty salad

02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:21.320
[Guest]: ready like less than five minutes you don't have to do anything more than that

02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:25.160
[Guest]: like more than the time it takes you to decide what to order on Swiggy this is

02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:30.640
[Guest]: ready so that's the next chapter and then I am definitely concerned about

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:35.280
[Guest]: things like sustainability especially in the superfood context because people

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:39.840
[Guest]: tend to go crazy over one particular ingredient and that leads to a lot of

02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:44.880
[Guest]: things like monocropping and people only focusing on growth farmers focusing on

02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:49.760
[Guest]: growing that one thing because that's giving them more returns so which is why

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.840
[Guest]: people have to be eating more biodiverse produce not because it gives you more

02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:59.840
[Guest]: variety of nutrients but also because it's good for the earth you don't want

02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:03.480
[Guest]: to go back to a situation where turmeric is good for you so there's an

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.800
[Guest]: industrialized farming of turmeric with heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers

02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:12.480
[Guest]: then what good is that turmeric to you so you have to make sure that you have

02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:17.240
[Guest]: to know how it is grown and to make sure that it is grown in a more gentler

02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.560
[Guest]: manner treating the earth more gently you need to make sure that you're not

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:25.200
[Guest]: running after only one ingredient because that will force the whole

02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:30.280
[Guest]: ecosystem to change and produce more of just that so and also all other aspects

02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:34.360
[Guest]: like what cookware are you using because that's another having been in the

02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.820
[Guest]: blogging space for more than 15 years I have a sense of the problems that people

02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:43.720
[Guest]: face and the kind of confusions they have in choosing because earlier we had

02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:48.000
[Guest]: not much choice in our grandparents time but now there's so much choice and is

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.840
[Guest]: nonstick good is aluminum good is you know stoneware good cast iron is good

02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:56.920
[Guest]: it's so heavy how am I going to use it it gets rusted so many questions I've

02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.900
[Guest]: tried to simplify that as well and also talk about certain very simple

02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:05.760
[Guest]: sustainable techniques that you can use in your day-to-day life in your kitchen

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.780
[Guest]: without spending too much but also making sure you have chosen something

02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:13.360
[Guest]: that's better for the environment in the long run because it's not good to only

02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:18.200
[Guest]: think of our human body and think of our health but then damage the planet's

02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:26.280
[Guest]: health and so in a nutshell this is all that my book covers yeah and and to sort

02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:30.280
[Amit Varma]: of summarize one of your points with apologies to non Hindi speakers if we

02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:37.680
[Amit Varma]: don't treat the earth well anarth ho jayega so sorry for that I had to get away with one of these

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:41.120
[Amit Varma]: know what I kind of loved about your book and why I would you know

02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.560
[Amit Varma]: recommended everybody actually own a copy don't just buy it on Kindle but get

02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:48.240
[Amit Varma]: the physical copy if you can as well and keep it with you and why it's almost a

02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:51.960
[Amit Varma]: collector's item is that it combines two things that I think you know are

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:56.520
[Amit Varma]: difficult to find together one is that it is conceptually clear you know it's

02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:00.360
[Amit Varma]: simple language you know I get it all in fact your first couple of chapters

02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:03.960
[Amit Varma]: especially where you deal with people's relationship with food and how you need

02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:07.880
[Amit Varma]: to reset that the importance of you know mindfulness and the importance of

02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:11.200
[Amit Varma]: thinking about where your food comes from what it contains all of that I

02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:15.720
[Amit Varma]: found it enormously useful and and that brings me to the second aspect of what I

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:19.040
[Amit Varma]: really like about your book is that it is bloody useful you know you're not

02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:22.480
[Amit Varma]: just telling me what are the superfoods and why this is a superfood have this

02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.360
[Amit Varma]: but you're also giving useful tips on how to integrate it into our everyday

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:32.200
[Amit Varma]: sort of cooking and all of that though how I will incorporate amla into my

02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.720
[Amit Varma]: bacon and egg fried rice I have still to figure out but maybe we can have an

02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.200
[Amit Varma]: offline discussion about that but I found it incredibly useful tons of

02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:44.280
[Amit Varma]: recipes tons of you know guidance at a conceptual level that you know X

02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:48.000
[Amit Varma]: ingredient is great because of these reasons and hey here's what you can do

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.600
[Amit Varma]: to you know put it into your diet so I am for that reason I found it kind of an

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:56.480
[Amit Varma]: important book if you care about what you're putting into your body then

02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:01.080
[Amit Varma]: please buy everyday superfoods by none that are here so I have a handful of

02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:05.640
[Amit Varma]: questions before I let you go not that you're a prisoner I'm saying before I

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.000
[Amit Varma]: let you go but you know what I mean and one of them is about social media one of

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.360
[Amit Varma]: the things that you've done extremely well is that you've built without

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.040
[Amit Varma]: thinking of yourself as a brand because I realized that over a period of time by

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:22.800
[Amit Varma]: doing all these different things people talk about how I built my brand and I

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:25.960
[Amit Varma]: never thought of it like that but you you're just true to yourself and you do

02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:30.520
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of different things and it kind of works out that way now you started of

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:34.120
[Amit Varma]: blogging with saffron trail which you know became very I mean that it was the

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:37.560
[Amit Varma]: only food blog I think I actually knew of back in the day though I must confess

02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:41.760
[Amit Varma]: that I wasn't much into cooking so it wasn't like I was taking recipes of it

02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:47.320
[Amit Varma]: on a daily basis or such like but you started off by blogging and from there

02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:53.200
[Amit Varma]: you then moved on to you know to Instagram to Facebook to Twitter and

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:57.760
[Amit Varma]: you're doing interesting things on all of them like you know you had a tweet

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:01.440
[Amit Varma]: and I'll ask you more about that on the kind of food that one should eat during

02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.000
[Amit Varma]: these covid times and your Twitter thread took a very separate approach to

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.280
[Amit Varma]: it and on Instagram you took a very different approach to it so you've got

02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.360
[Amit Varma]: the same content but you're packaging it very differently so how did these

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.280
[Amit Varma]: different medium shape your content as you went along and as it shaped your

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.560
[Amit Varma]: content did it also change the way you started thinking about food or writing

02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:26.640
[Amit Varma]: about food and and were there aspects of it which you had to learn from scratch

02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:31.960
[Amit Varma]: like the importance of the visual for example like in actual food will today's

02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:35.680
[Amit Varma]: masterchef inspired kids will keep talking about the importance of plating

02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.880
[Amit Varma]: and how you eat through the eyes and all of that and on Instagram it strikes me

02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:43.440
[Amit Varma]: that you know it could be a photography blog where the photographer has just

02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:47.980
[Amit Varma]: happened to choose food because those are very enticing and beautiful pictures

02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:52.400
[Amit Varma]: as well what was that process like where you get into each of these forms and you

02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:56.600
[Amit Varma]: start figuring out what to do in this form to express yourself so to say

02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:02.080
[Guest]: actually I don't think I have planned or thought much and I should have a little

02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:06.840
[Guest]: bit more because I joined Instagram the day it was launched when it was launched

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:11.280
[Guest]: only for iPhone users and by now I should be having at least a million

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:15.120
[Guest]: followers but I have like some 70,000 followers that is because I don't really

02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.760
[Guest]: follow a plan or I don't have a schedule and I post what I cook I mean I don't

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:28.120
[Guest]: cook to post something great and I post what I eat because if I had to do too

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:31.360
[Guest]: much planning and there are so many platforms and there's something new

02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:36.760
[Guest]: coming on all the time and I'm social media is not my main thing it just helps

02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.400
[Guest]: like I tell friends I would have happily deleted Facebook and Instagram not

02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.600
[Guest]: Twitter if you know I wasn't in the space because it's it's required to

02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:52.200
[Guest]: showcase your brand and yourself to this whole audience and you lose out on that

02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:56.080
[Guest]: if you're not on these platforms so I just use it as something that's

02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.520
[Guest]: essential I really don't have that time or bandwidth to create content

02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.960
[Guest]: especially do things for Instagram alone although I do especially in the context

02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.800
[Guest]: of my new book I have been thinking of a couple of ideas which may work in you

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.560
[Guest]: know talking more about my book without just being it like a salesy kind of a

02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:22.120
[Guest]: pitch yeah regarding that Covid series that you were talking about I just I

02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:26.440
[Guest]: wanted it to be a Twitter thread at first but then I said that like posting

02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:32.080
[Guest]: it as it was was more than 13 or 14 tweets and you know Instagram gives you

02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:36.000
[Guest]: only 10 options to swipe through so if I took a screenshot of every tweet and it

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.920
[Guest]: would not fit into that whole 10 picture carousel so then I said okay let me

02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:46.160
[Guest]: write things in one like keep it a shorter kind of a slideshow and that is

02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:53.120
[Guest]: purely because of the kind of availability of space and the way it works and you

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.080
[Guest]: know I was absolutely clear I don't want to talk about my book or market anything

02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:01.880
[Guest]: in this scheme because this is purely because I want to help people who are

02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:05.760
[Guest]: wondering what do we eat in these times and I didn't want it to be anything

02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.680
[Guest]: about my book or my blog or no links nothing so it was purely something which

02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:17.280
[Guest]: I thought I want to follow this and I think it's good for people who are

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.160
[Guest]: conscious and who are worried about what to eat in these times maybe it will give

02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:28.040
[Guest]: some kind of guidelines and format on how to plan their food that said I think

02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:33.720
[Guest]: the platform that I truly enjoy is Twitter and although people keep saying

02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:39.760
[Guest]: now toxic place and this and that but I think I've curated my crowd fairly well

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:45.600
[Guest]: and I either follow people who make me laugh or I get something to learn from

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:50.680
[Guest]: that you know or appears in my field where I know what they are doing and I

02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:55.560
[Guest]: can get some inspiration from them so these are the only reasons for which I

02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:01.400
[Guest]: follow people on Twitter so I use it in this way and it works for me and you

02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:07.040
[Guest]: know even for my first book I've written a few articles and given a few talks on

02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:11.160
[Guest]: you know how to use Twitter what do you get out of Twitter so when I check my

02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:14.720
[Guest]: blog stats it is the platform that I spend the least time on which is

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:21.560
[Guest]: Pinterest that gives me maximum views to my blog and Twitter where I spend the

02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:27.560
[Guest]: most time on gives me the least number of views but everything is not tangible

02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:34.360
[Guest]: and it gives me a lot of visibility and things like my first book it just got a

02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:39.360
[Guest]: lot of a lot of journalists knew about this book it got written about and all

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:43.640
[Guest]: that counts for a lot and people recognize you in this space and then you

02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:49.560
[Guest]: build a circle of friends you know with whom you can have a banter or you meet

02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:53.560
[Guest]: when they are in your city because you know when you're in your 30s and 40s it's

02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:58.660
[Guest]: just so difficult to make friends and maybe sometimes if you have a kid you

02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:03.680
[Guest]: befriend their parents and that kind of thing but on your own how are you going

02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:08.200
[Guest]: to even find like-minded people without being creepy and say hey let's be

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.840
[Guest]: friends you know that happens only on Twitter because it just you just

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:18.080
[Guest]: gravitate towards like-minded people so easily somehow I think that's the good

02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:21.080
[Guest]: thing about the algorithm of that platform that it just brings you

02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:27.160
[Guest]: together and whatever the reasons I love being on that platform connecting with

02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:31.800
[Guest]: people and also learning so much about a diverse range of things which I would

02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:37.440
[Guest]: not have been exposed to otherwise because I'm not going to pick up a book

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:42.080
[Guest]: on say policy or economics because that's not some that's not my subject

02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:45.600
[Guest]: and I think I may not understand that but when you read about it on Twitter

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:50.040
[Guest]: you at least get an inkling of what's happening you're not a complete dumbo

02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:53.040
[Guest]: in the other subjects you know a little bit about everything I think that's very

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:57.880
[Guest]: important you know in general to know about things and Twitter really feeds

02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:04.120
[Guest]: that curiosity in me so it is my favorite platform you know I kind of

02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:07.720
[Amit Varma]: mirror that it's a platform I'm most active on and parts of it are very toxic

02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:10.760
[Amit Varma]: but you you just need to curate your field and decide on the kind of

02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:14.600
[Amit Varma]: interactions you need to have I mean my one of my thumb rules I block a lot and

02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:18.400
[Amit Varma]: one of my thumb rules is earlier it was trolling then it was rudeness now it is

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.520
[Amit Varma]: simply if someone says something to me on Twitter which they would not say to

02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.360
[Amit Varma]: me in one person I block them because those are not the kind of conversations

02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.320
[Guest]: absolutely I do the same and on Instagram recently when I said that

02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:33.920
[Guest]: everybody must go out and take their vaccines I was told that I'm being a

02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:38.760
[Guest]: bully on the internet for forcing people to get vaccinated because people may

02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:42.720
[Guest]: have their own reservations against the vaccine and like this was the first

02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:45.840
[Guest]: thing I read when I opened my phone in the morning and I said serves you right

02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.360
[Guest]: for opening a phone like first thing in the morning and checking Instagram

02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:54.640
[Guest]: comments from strangers and I instantly blocked this often because it's like

02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:59.640
[Guest]: this my social media is my home why will I let someone come into my home abuse me

02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:05.120
[Guest]: for no reason and then still want to continue reading my content and being a

02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.160
[Guest]: part of my circle so if I wouldn't want that person in my home I wouldn't want

02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.480
[Guest]: that person reading or understanding all that useful content that I keep

02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.640
[Guest]: posting for free so they have no business reading that so I I just block

02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:21.640
[Guest]: and earlier I would feel bad and you know sometimes friends say you're giving

02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:25.360
[Guest]: them too much you know space in your head they will think you're giving them

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.120
[Guest]: too much importance I said I don't care if that hurts me I'm blocking them so I

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:35.760
[Guest]: think that really works well for me and there's no why should I force you know

02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:40.600
[Guest]: unpleasant things into my head it's not like I'm not that kind of a person

02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:45.160
[Amit Varma]: exactly no I block liberally and and sometimes some random bhakt will say but

02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:48.240
[Amit Varma]: how can you say you're for free speech if you're blocking and the point there

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:51.200
[Amit Varma]: is that has nothing to do with free speech you're free to speak wherever you

02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:55.160
[Amit Varma]: are but you're not entitled to my attention and it is exactly if you're

02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:58.560
[Amit Varma]: caught if I'm allowing you on my timeline it is exactly like you said

02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:01.680
[Amit Varma]: that I'm allowing you into my home and if I don't want you in my home I'm

02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:05.880
[Amit Varma]: entitled to kick you out and you can say whatever you want outside or on your own

02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:09.820
[Amit Varma]: platform or whatever so I think we should all be kind to ourselves and be

02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:13.960
[Amit Varma]: careful of who we let into our mind space so to say so I try to curate that

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:17.800
[Amit Varma]: carefully now I'll link to this excellent thread of yours on what to eat

02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:20.800
[Amit Varma]: in these covid times in the show notes so I meant to ask you about that but

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:23.920
[Amit Varma]: because we're running out of time I'll do the Karan Johar thing right I have

02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: never done a Karan Johar kind of rapid-fire so you know I'm afraid you

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.160
[Amit Varma]: don't get a hamper at the end of it and if I if I did have a hamper to give you

02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:36.700
[Amit Varma]: I would have to ask you to curate it because who better but here's a rapid

02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:39.640
[Amit Varma]: fire anyway and it's only four little questions and the first of them is a

02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:44.500
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment that look why do we eat we eat to live right in a sense we

02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:49.920
[Amit Varma]: need certain nutrients to keep our body going so if in an you know imagined

02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:53.080
[Amit Varma]: future and I think they have been thought experiments like this before

02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.000
[Amit Varma]: somebody could just give you a pill in the morning and that satiates you that

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.760
[Amit Varma]: takes care of all your nutritional needs you don't your body doesn't need to eat

02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.080
[Amit Varma]: anything after that during the day and if you want pleasurable sensation of

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:10.360
[Amit Varma]: taste then you have things like a bacon pill you eat that and for 15 minutes you

02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.760
[Amit Varma]: feel the taste of bacon in your mouth or whatever the case might be it's a thought

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:17.320
[Amit Varma]: experiment right we can get away with this shit so would that kind of world

02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.640
[Amit Varma]: seem utopian or dystopian to you does it seem absolutely wonderful absolutely

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:25.040
[Guest]: horrible at present I welcome that thought because I'm kind of fed up of

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:29.360
[Guest]: cooking every day so I would just devote my time into all other fun things that

02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:33.440
[Guest]: like music and other things that I enjoy and not be at the you know in the

02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.160
[Guest]: kitchen the whole day so utopian right now wonderful and the interesting thing

02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:41.720
[Amit Varma]: is you know you pointed out that in 98 in your book you pointed out that in 98

02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:45.480
[Amit Varma]: percent of Indian households a primary cook is a woman so I think men and women

02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:48.560
[Amit Varma]: might just answer this question differently where the men will say

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:53.480
[Amit Varma]: nahi yaar wo swaad chahiye parathe ka and the woman will be like bivi ke haath ka khaana

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:58.080
[Amit Varma]: nahi to maa ke haath ka khaana and the woman will be like I'm not making no more parathas okay

02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:03.800
[Amit Varma]: next question what is what according to you is a criminally underrated item of

02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:10.240
[Guest]: food you can give multiple items I think I would say daal because in Indian

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:15.640
[Guest]: cuisine we just end up making like a daal to go with rice but it is very

02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:21.200
[Guest]: versatile and we don't explore the so many different things that you can end

02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:25.560
[Guest]: up making with that and we treat it like very careless roz ka kind of stuff but

02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:29.920
[Amit Varma]: there's a huge potential to play around with that ingredient yeah so even that

02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:33.880
[Amit Varma]: phrase ghar ki murgi daal barabar should therefore be changed it should be ghar ki

02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:39.560
[Amit Varma]: daal murgi barabar is basically what you're saying okay next question most

02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:48.120
[Amit Varma]: overrated food biryani oh god this feels like a personal assault on me but I'll

02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:53.440
[Guest]: forgive you this for that I would have said bacon but I didn't say I didn't I

02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:57.360
[Amit Varma]: didn't want to be so personal but by now saying that I am NOT saying bacon you

02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:03.920
[Amit Varma]: have said bacon also well done bacon bhi gaya biryani bhi gaya okay well what can we do

02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.840
[Amit Varma]: okay and and final question as the show ends why not end on a nice note that at

02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:12.800
[Amit Varma]: some point in time we are going to reach a phase where people can go out and eat

02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:16.920
[Amit Varma]: again and restaurants are open again and there are joys to dining out especially

02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:21.520
[Amit Varma]: with friends and loved ones so what are your favorite restaurants in the two

02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:24.720
[Amit Varma]: cities I know a little bit of in the ones that you've lived in which are

02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai and Bangalore what are your favorite restaurants which you feel

02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:36.440
[Guest]: people must try so I'll talk about Bombay I love this place called Sika or

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:43.920
[Guest]: Seiko in is it in I think I'm Lamel's compound it's Mexican cuisine and it's

02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:48.760
[Guest]: fairly authentic it's not like substituting rajma in every dish so they

02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:55.400
[Guest]: even have you know corn mold I forget it's got a very complex sounding

02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:59.840
[Guest]: Mexican name for it so it's the mold that grows on corn and that's like a

02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:05.080
[Guest]: delicacy and very expensive so they use ingredients like those to create like

02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:12.920
[Guest]: the authentic Mexican flavors so I'll go with that one and in Bangalore I mean I

02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:17.240
[Guest]: would day any day vote for the dosa because I try as I might I can't get

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:25.400
[Guest]: the similar kind of dosa experience here so anything like a CTR or that kind of

02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:30.240
[Guest]: one of those traditional dosa places I am dying to go there but these they are

02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.280
[Guest]: always so crowded I haven't stepped out in over a year thank you so much I mean
