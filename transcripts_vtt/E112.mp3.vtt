00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Guest]: I-V-M

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And humans for even longer than that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: It seems short-sighted to make

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that nation-state the focus of our identity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's equally short-sighted,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact, to base our identity

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: on any other circumstance of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: our birth, like our ethnicity

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: or religion or caste.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Those also haven't been around for too long

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and are far more fluid than we realize.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: If you think of your identity

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[Amit Varma]: as an atomized individual

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Amit Varma]: who is a product of chance and circumstance,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: that's part of the truth right there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But if you see yourself also as

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: connected to the past, a small part

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: of something much bigger and older

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: than yourself, then you need to go

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: a little further back

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: than 70 years, or a few

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[Amit Varma]: hundred years, or even

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: a few thousand years.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[Amit Varma]: You need to read Tony Joseph's book,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Early Indians.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Unknown]: politics, and behavioral science.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Badma.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. I've spoken

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Amit Varma]: to historians on the show before and chatted

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: about history, but the furthest back I've

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: gone is a few hundred years. My

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: guest today, the author Tony Joseph, will

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: take us back tens of thousands of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: years. Early Indians is

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: a book that answers many important questions

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: about our species, particularly our species

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: in India. Where did humans

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: come from? When did they get to India?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Who are the original Indians, if such

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: a term applies? Who were the Harappans?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Who were the Aryans?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Whose descendants are we? Are

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: North Indians and South Indians different from

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: each other in some fundamental way?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Are tribals lesser than our city

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[Amit Varma]: dwellers? Some of these

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: are questions of politics, but

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: all of them can be answered only by science.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And in the last few years,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: literally in this decade, there have

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: been radical advances in a number

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
[Amit Varma]: of sciences that now answer

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: these contentious questions.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And Tony's remarkable book

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: reveals all. As does this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: episode, so keep listening. I'll begin

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: my conversation with Tony after a quick

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: commercial break.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
[Amit Varma]: range of new products, including

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
[Amit Varma]: fridge magnets with some stunning motifs

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and salad bowls and platters made of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Amit Varma]: mango wood. Their artists include

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Amit Varma]: luminaries like Babu Xavier,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Vazvo X Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson and Pradeep

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Mishra. They accept bulk orders for

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Amit Varma]: corporate and festival gifting, but even

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
[Amit Varma]: if you want to buy just for yourself or a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: friend, head on over to

[Amit Varma]: Thank you very much, Amit. It's a pleasure to be here.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Tony, two very close friends of mine whom I both

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
[Guest]: adore and admire and almost revere,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Devangshu Dutta and Nilanjana Roy,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
[Amit Varma]: have mentioned to me that you gave them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Amit Varma]: a gift for Indian Colors.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Amit Varma]: What is it?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Amit Varma]: They have mentioned to me that you gave

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[Amit Varma]: them their first job and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: that makes you for me an almost mythical

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: figure. Like you are an early Indian in my eyes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Guest]: bit about your career. I'm really

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
[Guest]: glad that I did so and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
[Guest]: I was glad then that I did so and I'm

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: glad that looking back that we worked together.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
[Guest]: And that was

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
[Guest]: a time when I was in

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Guest]: business standard with the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
[Guest]: brief to start a feature section a day.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
[Guest]: That's about, you know, a pull

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Guest]: out full section and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Guest]: that involved every day

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Guest]: of the week and build the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
[Guest]: team that will pull it off. So we

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
[Guest]: had things ranging from smart investor on

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Guest]: stock markets to the strategist

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Guest]: on management. This is early to mid-90s.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Guest]: This would be

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
[Guest]: 80, yeah, that's right.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: And you had to find people

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Guest]: for that to staff this and you needed

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: people who are really, really bright because

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: you needed to go into new areas that

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
[Guest]: had not been covered in the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: get the talent from existing

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Guest]: newspapers because many they had not been

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: looking at these areas in the way that we

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
[Guest]: intended to look at these areas and cover

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Guest]: them. So we might as well

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[Guest]: use this opportunity to break

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[Guest]: bring in new talent into journalism

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
[Guest]: and it is absolutely amazing

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Guest]: experience. I think the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Guest]: people that I worked with in business standard and later

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Guest]: on in business world also and

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
[Guest]: those were really

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
[Guest]: outstanding teams and a pleasure to work with.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[Amit Varma]: When did you actually start as a journalist?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Amit Varma]: What brought you into journalism?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Amit Varma]: You know when I was growing up in the 80s

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
[Amit Varma]: the common view about journalists is

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that they failed at everything else.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
[Amit Varma]: They didn't become an engineer or a doctor.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: What brought you into journalism?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Guest]: Journalism has always been

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Guest]: what shall I say, an attraction

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
[Guest]: for me because I think the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: idea of engaging with public ideas

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: or public mind

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
[Guest]: has been exciting. So the place

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: that I joined us for first was a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
[Guest]: newspaper called Newstime. It was a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
[Guest]: newspaper that was began for the first time by the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
[Guest]: Inado group in Hyderabad. Which year?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: This would be 1983.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
[Guest]: Right. I would have been all

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Guest]: of 21 years old. Right.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Guest]: So I started as a trainee with a

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: stipend of 600 rupees a month

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[Guest]: and it was fascinating

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: that it was a completely new paper then

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
[Guest]: that would become a late motive

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
[Guest]: for all of the rest of

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest]: my career because I would have always

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
[Guest]: worked with one year exception.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
[Guest]: I always worked in places which were either starting up

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: or were already there but

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: were going through a complete rejuvenation

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: or a complete revamp of some kind

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Guest]: and that's when you actually

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Guest]: learn the innards of a process or

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
[Guest]: a profession or of a system because

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Guest]: you can see things being put together or being

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Guest]: pulled apart. If you always work in places

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Guest]: that are completely settled

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest]: your pace of learning is much much lower.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Guest]: So yeah, I started

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: at Newstime in Hyderabad

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
[Guest]: then I was with India Today in

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Guest]: Delhi for a year

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Guest]: then I joined Economic Times

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[Guest]: where I was features editor when I left

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Guest]: in 1991

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: then I was with Business Standard from 1991

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: till

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: 1998 I think

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: and then I was with Business

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Guest]: World as editor

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: for about 8 years in all

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Amit Varma]: with a break in between. So you know

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[Amit Varma]: a young journalist starting out today has

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Amit Varma]: the advantage of the internet, he can read the best

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
[Amit Varma]: journalism in the world, he can see back issues

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Amit Varma]: of the New Yorker, the New York Times, whatever

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Amit Varma]: but back then when you were starting out in the

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: 80s, who were sort

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Amit Varma]: of your journalistic models and

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[Amit Varma]: how did your ideas of best practices

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and what benchmarks to aim for

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Amit Varma]: evolve over time, like who were

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Amit Varma]: your early heroes for example and how did

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Guest]: that change? When I joined

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: India Today at that point of time in

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: 1987, I mean at that

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Guest]: point of time that is the most highly

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Guest]: valued, it's the most

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Amit Varma]: important news

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: magazine at that point of time

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: and had made a large impact and a very good team

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: and I was starting out

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Guest]: as a copy editor on their team

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: and it was a very good place to be to learn

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: from the rest of the team as well

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: When you were in economic

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: times, you again

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Guest]: that was a period when you are starting out

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: when you were learning to

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
[Guest]: change this place from inside out

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
[Guest]: because you are starting your features

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest]: pages in a newspaper that had

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
[Guest]: never, forget about features, they had never even

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
[Guest]: new, worked on

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Guest]: anchor news or anything

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Guest]: other than just essentially plain vanilla

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: news stories that

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: mostly come out of government announcements

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: So working with staff

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Guest]: who had been in that kind

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[Guest]: of an environment with the same staff

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
[Guest]: and to try and bring out

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Guest]: completely new, those were learning, so I think

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: these were periods when you are learning from your

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Guest]: peers, your bosses

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: and what you are doing yourself

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
[Guest]: All that changed when I was

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Guest]: in business standard, when you are starting those

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
[Guest]: sections, because that's when

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: you realize that each of those sections when you

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Guest]: went into, you did not have models

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: which you could

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: pick from anywhere in the country

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: because nobody was doing anything

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Guest]: of that quality that you could say

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: I want to beat that or I want to

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest]: You first had to look at

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Guest]: the best models in the

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Guest]: world and then look at what

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
[Guest]: trade-offs did they make

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: that you don't want to make and what different kind of

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: trade-offs do you want to make for the audience

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: and the market that you are in

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Guest]: So if you are looking at stock markets, for example, you will look

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Guest]: at Barron's, you will look at many other

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: publications, like if you are looking at

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Guest]: building the Strategist

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Guest]: the Harvard Business Review

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Guest]: and the McKinsey Quarterly, so there are a whole range

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
[Guest]: and the management books that are globally

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Guest]: well accepted

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
[Guest]: So in each of those areas that we got into

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Guest]: this was when it

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Guest]: became clear or

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Guest]: really clear that your benchmarks have

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: got to be global

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: and since then it has been like that

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: to answer, since I have been in

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
[Guest]: multiple areas all the time

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Guest]: I would stay with the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Guest]: Smart Investor for about six months

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
[Guest]: start the team and then move on

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
[Guest]: to starting the next section which is

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Guest]: the Strategist, which is management, again build

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: the team and then move on. So what you

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Guest]: were considering as your competition or

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: model to beat depends on which areas

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: that you are in. And when did

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: you move on from journalism?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: You know the entrepreneurship bug bit me

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Guest]: at some point of time and I was looking

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
[Guest]: at for a way of building something

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest]: that is related to media

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
[Guest]: and in around 2001

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: we did start a company

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Guest]: I co-founded a company with two, three

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: others which would work with media

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
[Guest]: companies abroad

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Guest]: to create, edit

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
[Guest]: and design their products

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Guest]: but I mean things didn't work out exactly

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Guest]: the way that we planned because the market

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Guest]: collapsed, media, print media

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
[Guest]: especially in the West

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
[Guest]: went through the kind of

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[Guest]: radical destruction of value that

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[Guest]: we have rarely seen in any industry

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Guest]: so they themselves

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
[Guest]: removed most of their editing staff

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Guest]: so many of the work

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Guest]: that we were planning to get became

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
[Guest]: our assumptions became

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
[Guest]: untenable

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Guest]: but you could say this was an

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest]: entrepreneurial break or a

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[Guest]: period but it was still related

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Guest]: to media and not

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Amit Varma]: outside of it. And sort of

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Amit Varma]: coming to your book now, kind of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
[Amit Varma]: early Indians, how did you

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
[Amit Varma]: start getting interested in this subject?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: I have always been

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[Guest]: interested. It's not that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: I had a greater interest in history per se

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: but pre-history

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
[Guest]: for some odd reason which I still

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
[Guest]: can't fully understand

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[Guest]: the Harappan civilization for example

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
[Guest]: has always had a

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
[Guest]: great hold on me and

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Guest]: ever since I came across it

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
[Guest]: and these were also things that

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[Guest]: because this is not about chronology

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
[Guest]: who did what because the very

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
[Guest]: fact that you cannot know the names of the people

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
[Guest]: in pre-history because there are no documents or the places

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean the definition of pre-history is before

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Guest]: writing starts

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
[Guest]: and therefore you are dealing

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
[Guest]: with actual issues because to me

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[Guest]: what is frustrating in history

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: is that there are too many people and too many

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
[Guest]: specific

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
[Guest]: issues and specific concerns

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Guest]: and in pre-history when you don't have any of

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[Guest]: those things you are dealing with pure issues

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Guest]: it's not talking about

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: perspectives it's about what

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: really happened here so some of the

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
[Guest]: questions that were on my mind which has always

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Guest]: been the case is who were the Harappans

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Guest]: where did they come from where did they go

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Guest]: and

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[Guest]: why did it take more than a thousand

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest]: years imagine this more than a thousand years

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
[Guest]: for cities

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: and urbanism itself to rise up

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Guest]: again in the subcontinent

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
[Guest]: it strikes you if you haven't

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: been to Dhaulavira in Gujarat please go

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
[Guest]: one day it's one of the

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
[Guest]: major Harappan centres

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
[Guest]: the most distinctive Harappan

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Guest]: city in India today

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
[Guest]: and it's a

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
[Guest]: stunning sight you know most of the

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Guest]: superstructure has already been destroyed so you

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
[Guest]: can only see the substructure

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: the foundations but even

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Guest]: seeing that you can see the robustness

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Guest]: with which these places

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Guest]: were built and you should see

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Guest]: the scale of the ambition you know

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
[Guest]: there's a large stadium

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: stands for people and you can imagine

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Guest]: what could have been going on there

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: just that scale of ambition

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: and the sturdiness with which things

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Guest]: are built the huge reservoirs that have

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: built and

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Guest]: then you realize that

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
[Guest]: this was would have been around 2600

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Guest]: BCE

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Guest]: and you have to wait till the Mauryans

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest]: arrive you know

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Guest]: nearly a thousand five hundred years later

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Guest]: to see structures

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
[Guest]: of that scale ambition

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
[Guest]: again so these were questions

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Guest]: that did not have good answers to

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Guest]: they were suppositions

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
[Guest]: so around six years ago

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: I decided that it would make sense

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
[Guest]: to try and look at the Harappan

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
[Guest]: questions in detail and see where

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
[Guest]: we are compared to where we were then

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
[Guest]: and what all the

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Guest]: relevant disciplines today based on

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
[Guest]: current research has to say

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
[Guest]: on the equation I thought I would be able to write a big

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: story or a cover story

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
[Guest]: somewhere on the Harappans

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Guest]: and I started going to all these

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Guest]: sites, Tholavira,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
[Guest]: Lothal in Gujarat, Rakhigarhi

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Amit Varma]: in Haryana. How did it feel to see all these

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Amit Varma]: places because to someone who is not aware of the context

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Amit Varma]: or the history it will just be ancient ruins

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Amit Varma]: or whatever but you are actually

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Amit Varma]: going there with a sense of what it was

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and what the ambition behind it was and how old

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
[Amit Varma]: it all is. That's right. And how was

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[Guest]: the experience? Oh it's absolutely stunning

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: and the visit to Tholavira

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
[Guest]: I would say of all the places

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
[Guest]: I have visited a lot of places I have been to

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
[Guest]: other prehistoric places in India

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: which are not related to the Harappans

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: but that happened later

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
[Guest]: but the visit to Tholavira was

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: really moving because

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: at that point of time

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
[Guest]: it was not yet when I visited it was not yet

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Guest]: fully clear are these

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Guest]: people our ancestors or

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Guest]: did they people who came from somewhere and disappeared

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: now we know of course that they are

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
[Guest]: to stand there and see the work

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Guest]: that had been done and

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[Guest]: the streets that had been laid out

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Guest]: because you can see the streets right

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Guest]: and when you can see the streets you can almost

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
[Guest]: see even though they are not there you can

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
[Guest]: almost see the people walking down there

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
[Guest]: visually it projects itself onto your mind

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
[Guest]: so it was a very very moving

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[Guest]: experience. Lothal is a port city

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
[Guest]: and yeah

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Guest]: it also is much smaller than Tholavira

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[Guest]: but a stunning one. Rakhigarhi

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[Guest]: there is nothing much to see

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Guest]: because whatever has been excavated

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
[Guest]: they haven't they have filled it up again

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
[Guest]: and to preserve it I think

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
[Guest]: but there is nothing much to see

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: but it is still interesting to

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
[Guest]: go there and imagine that this

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
[Guest]: place there used to be a thriving

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
[Guest]: civilization the best of its time

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and the interesting thing is you said

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Amit Varma]: that you sort of got interested

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Amit Varma]: in this again about you know 6-7 years

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: ago and that's around the time

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that the science was also evolving

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Amit Varma]: at a rapid pace

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact if I may quote from your book

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
[Amit Varma]: quote just to get a sense of the speed

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
[Amit Varma]: at which things have moved consider this

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Amit Varma]: when work on this book began 6 years ago

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
[Amit Varma]: we did not know who were the people of the Harappan

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
[Amit Varma]: civilization or where their

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
[Amit Varma]: descendants had gone but now

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
[Amit Varma]: we do. 6 years ago we did not know

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Amit Varma]: how much of our ancestry we owed to the

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Amit Varma]: original out of Africa migrants who reached

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
[Amit Varma]: India about 65,000 years ago

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
[Amit Varma]: but now we do. 6 years

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Amit Varma]: ago we did not know when the caste system

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
[Amit Varma]: began but now we can zero in on the

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
[Amit Varma]: period with a fair degree of genetic accuracy

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
[Amit Varma]: these are just a few examples that

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
[Amit Varma]: demonstrate our rapidly improving understanding

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Amit Varma]: of prehistory and not just with regard to India

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
[Amit Varma]: stop quote and

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
[Amit Varma]: what you go on to describe in the pages

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Amit Varma]: of your book and I urge all the listeners to read

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
[Amit Varma]: it for themselves but what you go on to

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
[Amit Varma]: describe is a

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of a revolution in the science

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
[Amit Varma]: not just in like one field

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
[Amit Varma]: of it but you have looked at like

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
[Amit Varma]: 6 or 7 different disciplines

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Amit Varma]: here to kind of come to the conclusions

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Amit Varma]: but that you've come to which is

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
[Amit Varma]: now the new evolved understanding of what

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
[Amit Varma]: exactly happened and I

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: had absolutely no idea all of this has happened

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
[Amit Varma]: till I read your book to be honest so tell

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit about what has happened in the

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
[Guest]: science. Yeah when I started on this

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
[Guest]: 6 years ago I wasn't

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: aware of the revolution that is

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
[Guest]: happening with population genetics I wasn't

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Guest]: I was barely conscious of the fact that there

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
[Guest]: is something called population genetics

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
[Guest]: that might be relevant to the

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Guest]: area that you're looking at I was

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
[Guest]: going through sites I was talking to archaeologists

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Guest]: who had excavated them I was talking to

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
[Guest]: historians I was talking to epigraphists who

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
[Guest]: had looked at the script

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
[Guest]: talking to philologists who might have

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: something to say about what the old texts have

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
[Guest]: to say about these things

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: so I was going through

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
[Guest]: all the traditional disciplines which

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
[Guest]: they themselves had

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Guest]: progressed during the last few decades

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
[Guest]: that one had not been following it

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
[Guest]: so it was quite interesting

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Guest]: to see how far we had come and

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
[Guest]: so it's only about 2-3 years into the

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
[Guest]: research then you start

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
[Guest]: understanding that hey

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: a lot of new interesting information is coming

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
[Guest]: from a new field that you had not been focused on

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Guest]: which is called population genetics

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
[Guest]: and they were using understanding

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
[Guest]: of the genome of present day populations

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
[Guest]: mostly initially

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
[Guest]: to work out affinities between

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
[Guest]: different population groups

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
[Guest]: and that is absolutely interesting to the

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
[Guest]: question of who were the harapins

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
[Guest]: so then I started reading in the

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
[Guest]: papers and getting in touch with the

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
[Guest]: world's leading experts

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
[Guest]: in India and outside

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
[Guest]: and discussing with them

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: their work and what they were finding

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: and how it has been changing

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: and during this process what you realized

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
[Guest]: also is that population

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: genetics itself is a

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
[Guest]: science that is proceeding

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: at a very fast rate

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: it's progressing, it is introducing

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: new ways of analyzing

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and the cost of doing

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
[Amit Varma]: It almost seems like it's not incremental

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
[Guest]: it's exponential, that's how it felt to me

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
[Guest]: I think all disciplines go through that at some point

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
[Amit Varma]: in their lifetime, maybe automotive

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
[Guest]: technology does that, then it stabilizes

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
[Guest]: I think all disciplines in their

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Guest]: life has a period when it is

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
[Guest]: ramping up very rapidly

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
[Guest]: in terms of its understanding

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
[Guest]: and tools that it uses

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
[Guest]: so population genetics went through that phase

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
[Guest]: in the last 4-5 years

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
[Guest]: so and

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
[Guest]: then in the last 2-3 years

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
[Guest]: what has happened is that they started

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Guest]: using ancient DNA

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: that is DNA from people who lived

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Guest]: thousands or tens of thousands of years ago

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: and then

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: the whole game changed

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: because now you can not only understand

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[Guest]: affinities between populations

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Guest]: now you can answer the question who moved

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: where and when

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Guest]: and that is dramatic right

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Guest]: because that answers

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Guest]: the most basic questions

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: about prehistory of people

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Guest]: movements that formed populations

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Guest]: and these have answered questions

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
[Guest]: not just in South Asia, they have answered

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
[Guest]: questions of population formation in

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
[Guest]: Europe, in the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
[Guest]: Americas, in Australia

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
[Guest]: in every part of the world

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
[Guest]: so India is just one part

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
[Guest]: of the new understanding

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
[Guest]: of prehistory and how populations

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
[Guest]: formed across the world

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
[Guest]: to finish it, it just

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: happened to be looking at these issues

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
[Guest]: when a new

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: science happened to be there

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: providing the answers, so it was serendipitous

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
[Amit Varma]: you could say in that way

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
[Amit Varma]: serendipitous and you know you've got a

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
[Amit Varma]: very complicated and nuanced

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Amit Varma]: discussion in your pages of population

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
[Amit Varma]: genetics and I'll just urge everyone

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Amit Varma]: to read, it can't possibly be summed up

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I took those pages very slow to kind of

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
[Amit Varma]: make sure I could understand

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
[Amit Varma]: all of that, but the basic

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Amit Varma]: thing is that if you are for example

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Amit Varma]: trying to now go back

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
[Amit Varma]: in history and tell all those grand

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
[Amit Varma]: stories like you said, you know

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Amit Varma]: without perspective, just what happened

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Amit Varma]: where did we come from, where did we move, what were the

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
[Amit Varma]: roots of migration, all of that can be told

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Amit Varma]: through genetics because through each

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
[Amit Varma]: generation you have those imprints coming down

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and you can go back in history and

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Amit Varma]: figure out all of that exactly

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
[Guest]: is that a correct summation?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
[Guest]: Yes, because of mutations

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
[Guest]: that happen over time

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: and mutations are carried on

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: through successive generations, not everybody

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Guest]: has the same mutations

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
[Guest]: you can't find affinities between

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Guest]: people who carry

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Guest]: the same kind of genetic fingerprints

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
[Guest]: or marks or mutations

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: that's one way of

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
[Guest]: I think my book explains it

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
[Guest]: in much more detail, that's one way of

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
[Guest]: describing how it is possible to look at

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
[Guest]: different populations and see

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: genetically without

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Guest]: anything else, just their genomes

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
[Guest]: to see who, which populations

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
[Guest]: are related to which populations

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
[Guest]: and to what extent, for example

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
[Guest]: we now know that all

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: populations outside of Africa

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: came from a

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
[Guest]: small subset of the

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: African population that moved

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: out of Africa around 70,000 years

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: ago. This is a genetic

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: discovery. It's a genetic

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
[Guest]: discovery based on the huge understanding

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: of the genetic diversity of

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest]: existing human population

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Guest]: around the world in Africa and outside

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
[Guest]: of it and we know that all of the

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
[Guest]: people outside of Africa come from a very

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
[Amit Varma]: small subset. And these are all

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Amit Varma]: generically called out of Africa migrations

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
[Guest]: That first one migration

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
[Guest]: out of which people went out to populate

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
[Guest]: all of the rest of the world is called the out of Africa

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
[Amit Varma]: migration. And this happened

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
[Amit Varma]: around 70,000 BCE

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and then you talk about how around

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: 65,000 BCE or 60,000

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
[Amit Varma]: BCE you have India

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Amit Varma]: being inhabited by what you

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
[Amit Varma]: by these migrants from Africa

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
[Amit Varma]: whom you describe as the first Indians

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Correct. So tell me a little

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
[Amit Varma]: bit more about you know how

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Amit Varma]: we get this kind of knowledge

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
[Amit Varma]: and what are the kind of patterns of migration across

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
[Amit Varma]: the world during this time from out of Africa

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Guest]: The out of Africa migration

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Guest]: now we have, now you

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
[Guest]: need to use archaeology

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
[Guest]: and other disciplines also to

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: arrive at rough dating of

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
[Guest]: how people went to

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Guest]: arrived at different continents. For example, we

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
[Guest]: know that the

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
[Guest]: earliest modern humans or homo sapiens

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
[Guest]: to reach

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: the Americas, that was the last

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
[Guest]: major continent to be occupied by

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
[Guest]: modern humans was only about

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
[Guest]: 16,000 years ago. We

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
[Guest]: know that Australia

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Guest]: and this is by archaeological evidence

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: we know that Australia was

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
[Guest]: occupied by modern humans

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
[Guest]: at least by around

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
[Guest]: 59,000 years ago

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: and that Southeast Asia was occupied by

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
[Guest]: modern humans at least by around 63,000

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
[Guest]: years ago. So if you know that

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
[Guest]: the first out of Africa migration

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest]: happened around 70,000 years ago

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: using genetics and some

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: amount of climatic

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Guest]: possibilities at that point of time

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
[Guest]: and you know that they reached Australia around

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
[Guest]: 59,000 years ago

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
[Guest]: then it is reasonable to assume that they were in

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
[Guest]: India by around 65,000

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: years ago. I think the people

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: who moved on from India

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: went across to Southeast Asia

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: East Asia, Japan,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Guest]: India, sorry China

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
[Guest]: and they also went across to

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
[Guest]: Australia

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
[Guest]: and the best understanding

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Guest]: is that there is one stream of out of

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Guest]: Africa migrants who went up

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
[Guest]: what is today Pakistan into

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: Central Asia and then

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
[Guest]: West and they might have another group

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Guest]: that went even across West Asia

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: into Europe. We know

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
[Guest]: that the earliest science of modern humans

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
[Guest]: in Europe is around 45,000

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Guest]: years ago or so. So

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Guest]: that's the very rough

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
[Guest]: sketch of the peopling of the

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
[Amit Varma]: world. You can, yeah.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other interesting thing is that

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Amit Varma]: we weren't the, I mean those out of

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Amit Varma]: migrants weren't the first humans here

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that you know, I mean we are all of course

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Amit Varma]: homo sapiens which are the only surviving human

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
[Amit Varma]: species left but there were various other human species

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
[Amit Varma]: across the world and what I kind of

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: found fascinating was where you mentioned that

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
[Amit Varma]: homo sapiens in Africa

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[Amit Varma]: if you look at the evidence they did not really

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Amit Varma]: intermingle with other humans

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
[Amit Varma]: but everywhere else they went

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Amit Varma]: they intermingled. For example

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to quote again from your book

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Amit Varma]: quote, all non-African

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
[Amit Varma]: homo sapiens today carry about 2%

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Neanderthal genes in their DNA.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Some of us like the Melanesians, Papuans

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and Aboriginal Australians also carry

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
[Amit Varma]: 3-6% Denisovan DNA.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Because of the genetic inheritance

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
[Amit Varma]: we may call them our ancestors

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Amit Varma]: but it is perhaps more reasonable

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[Amit Varma]: to see them as our evolutionary cousins

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Amit Varma]: with whom homo sapiens

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Amit Varma]: did dally.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: Stop quote. It only

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: means that Neanderthals were present

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
[Guest]: in Europe and Denisovans

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
[Guest]: were present in Central Asia and those

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: regions. And we partied with them.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: And we partied with them.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Guest]: But it doesn't mean that

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
[Guest]: if Neanderthals were not in Africa

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
[Guest]: they couldn't have mixed with Neanderthals. Exactly.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
[Guest]: But there were many more species of

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: homo species in Africa

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
[Guest]: than in outside of Africa.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Guest]: So it is a given

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
[Guest]: that they would have mixed. In fact

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
[Guest]: the beginning of the modern human

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
[Guest]: himself would have been as a result of

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Guest]: multiple mixtures between

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
[Guest]: different species of the

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[Guest]: homo species. So it is just that

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
[Guest]: in Africa you would not see

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: evidence of mixing with Neanderthals

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
[Guest]: or Denisovans because they were

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
[Guest]: probably not in Africa. They were

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: in those regions. And the

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
[Guest]: out of Africa migrants came across them

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: when they immigrated out of

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: Africa. And they did mix with them.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
[Guest]: Must have mixed with them pretty early for all of us to have

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: around 2% Neanderthal

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
[Amit Varma]: ancestry. Marvellous. And

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Amit Varma]: through all these years like before

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
[Amit Varma]: we sort of come to modern

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Amit Varma]: times of 7000 BC which is going

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
[Amit Varma]: to be our next stop. But before we come there through all this

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
[Amit Varma]: time, how were these human migrations

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and the evolution

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and the dominance of homo sapiens affected by

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Amit Varma]: things like geography and geology and weather?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: Very very significantly. I

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
[Guest]: think since when we

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
[Guest]: talk about tree history we are talking about

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Guest]: such large spans of

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: time. And we

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: are usually used to speaking about

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
[Guest]: decades or centuries

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
[Guest]: etc. In which case

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
[Guest]: climates and these don't change

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
[Guest]: all that much. So this

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: is a radical shift that takes place when you are

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: discussing tree history that you have to

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: because that's a predominant

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: formation of and affects human

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: behaviour. For example

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: when many of the

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Guest]: population movements, how do

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[Guest]: humans or even

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
[Guest]: animals or mammals move from one

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Guest]: place to another? What is it that

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Guest]: drives it? One of the things that

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Guest]: drives it is

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: you know dramatic climate changes.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: During the glacial ages

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: since almost all of the water

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
[Guest]: is locked up in ice

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Guest]: sheets, there is very little

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Guest]: evaporation, much less evaporation happening

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
[Guest]: and so glacial ages are very arid.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: So quite apart from the fact that

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: a lot of the world will be

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Guest]: covered in ice sheets, even other parts

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
[Guest]: that are not covered in ice sheets, there

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: is a very great aridity. So

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: places that would have been earlier

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
[Guest]: luxurious and thriving with life

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
[Guest]: and greenery would

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: go back to being deserts.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: So and when

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: warms up again, then you see

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: there are new lush pastures where

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: there were deserts earlier and

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: you would then see animals

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Guest]: and you know moving in there

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
[Guest]: because there is a new territory for them

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: and when animals or cattle

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
[Guest]: move in, you can also see their predators

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
[Guest]: and humans and everybody moves in. That's

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: what makes

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
[Guest]: one of the earliest historic

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: monuments of people or even the out of Africa

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest]: migrations would have been shaped

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
[Guest]: by these changes in

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
[Guest]: climates in various ways.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: And sometimes it may not be in ways

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest]: that we imagine, it might be in counterintuitive

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: ways also because

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: if there is greater aridity, it may mean

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
[Guest]: they have to move to new areas

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: in search of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Guest]: food. So

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: this has to be taken into account

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
[Guest]: when any specific question

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: of the prehistoric period is being

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: taken into account. And my book talks

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
[Guest]: about how around 35,000

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Guest]: years ago in the Indian

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Guest]: subcontinent, while there

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: is evidence that there is something dramatic happened,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: the climate deteriorated,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
[Guest]: modern humans started using

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: because they were in competition with

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: the previous would have been for

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: the same kind of remaining

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: refuges that are there, that are

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: usable for homo species.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: We can see them using,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Guest]: relying more and more on

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
[Guest]: advanced weaponry such as microlithic

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: tools, which are usually associated

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: with modern humans and not with

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: the... But 35,000 BC they were using

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
[Guest]: natural... Yeah, that's right.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
[Guest]: Microlithic

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: tools which can be used for

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
[Guest]: spears, arrows,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Guest]: blades and things like that.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: And

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: you can see genetic evidence says

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
[Guest]: that their population increased actually during that period.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest]: So you can

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: see where climate deteriorating,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Guest]: conflicts arising, modern

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
[Guest]: humans using, relying more on

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
[Guest]: new technology that they have introduced

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Guest]: and they are succeeding widely

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[Guest]: and their population expanding

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
[Guest]: during a period

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Guest]: by 20,000 BCE

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: scientists say that it's likely

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: that South Asia

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[Guest]: and the Indian subcontinent was

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: the center of modern human population.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: So next time somebody says, you know,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: we are the largest population or one

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
[Guest]: of the largest centers, it's nothing new. We have

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest]: always been one of the largest centers

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
[Guest]: or if not the center

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: of modern human populations.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: And in fact that might apply to

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: earlier homospecies too.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Guest]: This region has been very, very

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
[Amit Varma]: good for the homospecies.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
[Amit Varma]: This is indeed where the party is. We'll take a

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Amit Varma]: quick commercial break, which in terms of

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Amit Varma]: geological time will get over

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Amit Varma]: very fast.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000

[Unknown]: family's army background, how jingoism is

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Unknown]: detrimental to patriotism, the notoriety

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Unknown]: cases in his law practice, and how he addresses

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Unknown]: them on his podcast, Know Your Kanu.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000

[Unknown]: on public facilities. On the Sponge

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Unknown]: Podcast, Ambi explains why it is consequential

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
[Unknown]: to set expectations on a realistic level

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
[Unknown]: and then slowly elevate them. On

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Unknown]: Shunya One, founder of Wayopo, Chirag Triplani

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000

[Unknown]: expert Venkat Anand to discuss the influence

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Unknown]: of social media in the coming elections and how

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[Unknown]: it has changed the playing field. And with that,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Unknown]: let's continue on with your show.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
[Amit Varma]: back to the Scene in the Unseen. I'm chatting with

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Tony Joseph about his book

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Early Indians and some really old times.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's get a little more modern now.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's come all the way to 7000 BC

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and around 7000

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Amit Varma]: BC is where

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
[Amit Varma]: you talk about a place

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Amit Varma]: in Balochistan called Mehrgarh.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
[Guest]: Why is Mehrgarh significant?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
[Guest]: Mehrgarh is hugely

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
[Guest]: significant because

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
[Guest]: it changed earlier assumptions about

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: the Arabian civilization

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Guest]: about how it began.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
[Guest]: Assumptions that Arabian civilization

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
[Guest]: was just offshoot of the Mesopotamian

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
[Guest]: civilization. Now we know that it is not so.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
[Guest]: It has a long history

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Guest]: before the civilization began.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Guest]: Mehrgarh is the first place

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Guest]: where you can see

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Guest]: the earliest beginnings of agriculture

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest]: that sustained itself

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: over a long period of time. There's another region

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: called Lahurudeva in

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
[Guest]: Ganga plain in UP today

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Guest]: where they have around 7000

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Guest]: BC again evidence of people,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Guest]: first Indians experimenting with

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
[Guest]: harvesting of wild

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
[Guest]: cereals, if not cultivation of

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
[Guest]: wild. It could have grown into cultivation

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Guest]: of cereals also, but we don't have full evidence.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Guest]: But in any case, that did not

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
[Guest]: develop into a full-fledged

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Guest]: rice-based, this was rice

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
[Guest]: that they were harvesting.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Agriculture in... And would some of this have

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Amit Varma]: come about because the climate also was appropriate

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Guest]: to sort of... Right.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
[Guest]: Around the time, after the glacial

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Unknown]: age ended, around 12000

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Guest]: years ago, and the

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
[Guest]: climate started warming up, you can see

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
[Guest]: popular modern humans across

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
[Guest]: many parts of the world were experimenting

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
[Guest]: with various ways of

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Guest]: agriculture. So it is not that it just

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: began in one place and spread everywhere. People

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: in different parts of the world were experimenting with

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Guest]: different things. Some wouldn't have succeeded,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: some would have succeeded. Some would

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest]: have succeeded for a long time and then

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: disappeared. So many things have to come in

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: place for it to sustain

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
[Guest]: itself over a long period of time.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Guest]: So, we know that

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: Mehrgarh is one of those places

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: starting from around 7000 BC

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
[Guest]: we can see that there is a settlement

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: and we can see that they are

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
[Guest]: doing farming. They are cultivating

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Guest]: cereals, barley, wheat.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: We can see they are domesticating

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: animals. Initially they don't have

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: pottery and later on around

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: 6000 BC they start having...

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
[Guest]: You can see how the initial pottery is.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Guest]: It's put together with bitumen.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
[Guest]: So, we can almost see

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
[Guest]: the civilization starting up.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
[Guest]: From earlier...

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Guest]: The earliest phases they are depending

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Guest]: on wild animals

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: for example. As time goes on

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest]: you can see it's the domesticated from the

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: remains of their feasts that you can see

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: it's their dependence on domesticated

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: animals goes up dramatically.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: So, Mehrgarh gives you a very good

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: understanding of how

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: a new way of living

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: is dramatically different from the earlier

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: Handakadra life

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: took root in the Indian subcontinent

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: and spread across the entire

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Guest]: northwestern region

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
[Guest]: from over a period of time

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: ultimately of course

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: leading to the Harappan civilization

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: because without going through

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
[Guest]: the phase of agriculture and the

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: surplus that it produces

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
[Guest]: you can't imagine a civilization rising

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: and agricultural revolution

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: in that part of Indian subcontinent

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Guest]: led to the Harappan civilization

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Amit Varma]: that followed. And you know obviously

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[Amit Varma]: when we look back on history or prehistory

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Amit Varma]: there's always a benefit of hindsight. Everything seems

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
[Amit Varma]: inevitable. But if you were

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
[Amit Varma]: to sort of simulate

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Amit Varma]: the starting of an agricultural

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Amit Varma]: revolution, you are going to

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
[Amit Varma]: eventually proceed in exactly

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
[Amit Varma]: the way history seems to have proceeded

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
[Amit Varma]: in this case because you'd logically

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
[Amit Varma]: assume that because of agriculture you have

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot more surplus time for the

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
[Amit Varma]: people that finds expression firstly

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
[Amit Varma]: in cultural ways such as you point

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: out through the beginning of pottery and

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Amit Varma]: also myth making narratives all of that stuff

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[Amit Varma]: that happens later. And it also

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Amit Varma]: finds expression in

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Amit Varma]: urbanization and that also takes a period of

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Amit Varma]: time but eventually you will expect to see

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
[Amit Varma]: cities develop, you'll expect to see cultures

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Amit Varma]: develop, myths and narratives develop

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Amit Varma]: language develop, all of it

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of is completely logical and that's

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
[Amit Varma]: exactly how it works. So it almost

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Amit Varma]: seems as if once you have the climate changing

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Amit Varma]: after the glacial age

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Amit Varma]: a Mehrgarh is inevitable and from

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: there eventually a Harappan

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Amit Varma]: civilization is inevitable.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[Guest]: There are lots of important

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Guest]: variables, there are lots of

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: luck, so to

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Guest]: say, that is needed for this to

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: happen in that way. For example

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest]: there has

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Guest]: there is nothing that says the moment

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: you take to agriculture that your productivity

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
[Guest]: will be high enough

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
[Guest]: for you to have, not

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Guest]: everybody to have to work at

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
[Guest]: farming and some people can

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: be employed in

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
[Guest]: building

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Guest]: statues and other things and not

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
[Guest]: everybody has to be working. So productivity

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
[Guest]: has to be high

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
[Guest]: and there has to be enough food produced

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: by not the 100% of the

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
[Guest]: population but only a smaller

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
[Guest]: percentage of the population so that the rest

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: of the people can do other things, right?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest]: So it is not always

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: possible that you have such productivity

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: for example you know in Southeast Asia

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
[Guest]: there are people have been farming taro and

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
[Guest]: other tuber, other around

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest]: for a very long time but

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: that does not lead to the kind of

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Amit Varma]: productivity that cereal gives. So it is kind of

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Amit Varma]: the survivorship bias at play that these are the

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
[Amit Varma]: guys who did well and sort of expanded

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and became a civilization so now

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: we can look back and draw these conclusions.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
[Guest]: No, it depends on

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: what kind of cereals you had. For example

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: we know that wherever cereal cultivation

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
[Guest]: and that I mean not always

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: some exceptions also.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: So what kind of things were possible

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: for you to domesticate and cultivate

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: in the region that you were in is a

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Guest]: significant factor in saying

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
[Guest]: how successful it came to be.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[Guest]: It is possible that the earliest rice varieties

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Guest]: that we had were not

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
[Guest]: productive enough and that it had to be

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
[Guest]: hybridized with a newer variety

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Guest]: which happened we now know

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Guest]: from recent research

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: the Indica variety got hybridized

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Guest]: with the Japonica variety of rice

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
[Guest]: around 4000 roughly

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
[Guest]: years ago in India

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Guest]: and it is possible that led to a huge

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: increase in productivity. So

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: some of these are developments

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
[Guest]: that you can't foresee

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
[Guest]: and so that's why you did not

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: have a rice based civilization

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
[Guest]: possibly because it was not

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
[Guest]: and you also need for the civilization to

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
[Guest]: take off initially. It's not just

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Guest]: agriculture. You have to have an agricultural

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Guest]: package of multiple crops

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: along with a package

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Guest]: of domesticated animals.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Guest]: So all of these

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
[Guest]: things has to be available for you

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Guest]: to be using them and

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: it's not possible that all regions have it. In some

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: regions you may not find the exact

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: solution to the problem

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
[Guest]: but yes but broadly it is

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: correct. Once you have productivity

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Guest]: happening and

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
[Guest]: it's also important that there has to be

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
[Guest]: institutions that can

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: take that

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
[Guest]: productivity and

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
[Guest]: use that productivity to

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Guest]: direct labor to

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
[Amit Varma]: other activities productively.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Which would also be a sign of the evolving

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[Guest]: culture I guess. It is

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
[Guest]: my book goes into in detail on how

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
[Unknown]: it happened in Uruk, the

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
[Guest]: first city and the fascinating

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: thing is that it happened initially

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Guest]: because they had to be

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Guest]: I mean it's a long story

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: but the interesting thing is

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: that when the productivity starts going

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
[Guest]: up

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
[Guest]: what you see is not increasing

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Guest]: prosperity, not that people's homes

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Guest]: start growing bigger

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
[Guest]: or that they have greater, you can

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
[Guest]: see they stay as they have

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Guest]: always been but there is one thing

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Guest]: whose size and opulence

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
[Guest]: does increase as productivity

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
[Guest]: increases and those are the temples

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
[Guest]: the Sigurads and

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
[Guest]: which shows you what

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
[Guest]: was the institution

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
[Guest]: that was coordinating

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
[Guest]: the activities necessary to bring out

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
[Guest]: higher productivity including building

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
[Guest]: canals and having new ways

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Guest]: and therefore who was appropriating

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
[Guest]: a lot of the surplus

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
[Guest]: while also providing

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
[Guest]: some of the surplus into the building of

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
[Guest]: new kinds of cities or organizations

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: so you have some insight into how that

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
[Amit Varma]: The elites with their false religions

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Correct

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
[Amit Varma]: So that journey from

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Mehrgarh to Harappa is like

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Amit Varma]: 4400 years approximately as you say

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book, 7000 BC to

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
[Amit Varma]: 2600 BC and we know

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
[Amit Varma]: the Harappans lasted from about 2600

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Amit Varma]: BC to 1900

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
[Amit Varma]: BC. Tell me a little bit about

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Harappa, I mean what kind of a civilization

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
[Guest]: was it? First thing

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
[Guest]: it was the largest civilization of its time

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
[Guest]: which we do not often realize

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
[Guest]: as big as Egyptian

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
[Guest]: and Mesopotamian civilizations

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Guest]: put together both in terms of

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
[Guest]: area and in terms of

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
[Guest]: of the number of people

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[Guest]: of the population. Today

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
[Guest]: in terms of area it would be

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
[Guest]: about one third the size of India that

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
[Guest]: is today

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Guest]: and it had

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
[Guest]: a fair degree of standardization

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
[Guest]: in its mature phase

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
[Guest]: across a large number

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[Guest]: of things, the kind of seals it had

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
[Guest]: the kind of language

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
[Guest]: that may have been used because

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
[Guest]: that still

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Guest]: my book talks about what the language could have

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
[Guest]: been. The imagery on the seals

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
[Guest]: that we talk about, the way the cities

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
[Guest]: were built, so there are

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Guest]: a lot of similarities and the size of the

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: bricks, the weights that were used

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: so you can see lots of things

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: that have been standardized

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
[Guest]: across that larger

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
[Guest]: region and mind you this is

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[Guest]: before there is modern communication

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
[Guest]: transport any of these things

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
[Guest]: it's quite mind-boggling

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
[Guest]: to think about how that was accomplished

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
[Guest]: over in that period

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: and one of the striking

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
[Guest]: things about the Harappan civilization

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: is that

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
[Guest]: you know especially when you consider

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
[Guest]: it with the West Asian civilization

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
[Guest]: the Mesopotamian civilization with which

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: we had always had strong

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
[Guest]: trade and other contacts

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
[Guest]: we were always in contact but despite

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
[Guest]: that the differences are so striking

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: I mean in the Harappan civilization

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
[Guest]: there are no large statues

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: of kings and you know

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
[Guest]: there is nobody deified as

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Amit Varma]: kings of

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
[Amit Varma]: no temples as well

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
[Guest]: no temples as well

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: so even the sculptures that we have from the Harappa

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
[Guest]: you would be surprised at how small they are, when you actually see them

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
[Guest]: that's not the imagery that you had

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
[Guest]: you thought they were much bigger, they are actually quite small

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
[Guest]: and

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: another striking thing again

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: there are no images

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
[Guest]: of human on human

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
[Guest]: violence except for one seal

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
[Guest]: somewhere which also

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: shows a woman being flanked on two sides

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: with two men who are

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[Guest]: with their spears

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
[Amit Varma]: you know

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
[Amit Varma]: angled at each other, which has multiple fascinating

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
[Guest]: interpretations you mentioned in your book

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: so except that

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
[Guest]: seal there is no imagery of human

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
[Guest]: on human violence, there is human on animal

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: violence, human on super human

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
[Guest]: all kinds of things

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
[Guest]: which is quite unlike other civilizations

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
[Guest]: like in West Asia where you can often

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
[Guest]: see wars being

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: and conquests all being

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
[Guest]: valorized and displayed in

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: imagery, we don't have royal

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
[Guest]: burials which are full

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
[Guest]: of you know, some king has been buried

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
[Guest]: along with huge amounts of treasures

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
[Guest]: and things like, we don't

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
[Guest]: burials are not very

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: surprising, there are some personal

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
[Guest]: possessions

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
[Guest]: that may include some jewellery also

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
[Guest]: and some food for their after

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Guest]: journey I suppose

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: so that's it

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: which is stunning, it is not that

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: especially considering the fact

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
[Guest]: that a lot of the jewellery in the Mesopotamian

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[Guest]: civilizations were jewellery that were built

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
[Guest]: were made in the higher up civilization

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[Guest]: and then sent there, so it is not that

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
[Guest]: we knew, we were actually making

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
[Guest]: money from it, we just didn't think it

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: made sense for it to be

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
[Amit Varma]: buried in royal chambers

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: so these are just some of the differences

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
[Guest]: between the uniqueness of the

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
[Guest]: civilization and just as

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: there are no large temples

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: or ostentatious

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
[Guest]: palaces and burials

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
[Guest]: but you do see

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
[Guest]: such investments going into public

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
[Guest]: conveniences which you do not see in other

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
[Guest]: in the West Asian

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
[Guest]: civilizations, for example

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
[Guest]: the sewage system, the roads

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
[Guest]: the facilities for visitors to

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
[Guest]: cities from water and

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
[Guest]: so all of that my book describes in detail

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
[Guest]: so there is a lot more attention

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
[Guest]: and money spent on public

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
[Guest]: conveniences than on

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
[Guest]: private

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
[Guest]: so that's our

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
[Amit Varma]: tradition. And it also

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
[Amit Varma]: fascinates me that at that point they must have

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Amit Varma]: evolved traditions of

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
[Amit Varma]: governance and so

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
[Amit Varma]: on, which took a long

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Amit Varma]: long time to actually re-emerge in the

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Indian subcontinent, so it's not just

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the scale of the cities

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and the city planning and the ambition of

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
[Amit Varma]: all of that, that took a long time to re-emerge

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
[Amit Varma]: but they very obviously could not have done this

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
[Amit Varma]: without evolved systems of governance

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and if you don't have big temples and

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
[Amit Varma]: gods and all that, then

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
[Amit Varma]: it's like a republic of men, it seems

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: so modern. We can't today guess, if you

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[Guest]: assume that the lack of symbols means

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
[Guest]: temples were not the authority structures

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
[Guest]: brought all these things together, then who

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: were it? Yeah, it's a surprising

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
[Guest]: thing, but there was an interesting point that was

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: made by one of the historians, which my book also

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
[Guest]: talks about, is that if you go

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: to one of the palaces of the

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Guest]: of the

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
[Guest]: Travancore royals, it does not really

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
[Guest]: look like a palace, it looks like an

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest]: interesting house. So it's possible

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
[Guest]: that we may not recognize

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest]: a palace or

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: a temple, but that's

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[Amit Varma]: unlikely I think. Which would also

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
[Amit Varma]: if that is the case, be a cultural value

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that passed through the genes, because the Travancore

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Amit Varma]: royals would, in a sense, be descendants

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
[Amit Varma]: of the Harappans, right?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the Harappans, where did they

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
[Amit Varma]: come from? Like, are they from West Asia?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
[Amit Varma]: What is

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
[Amit Varma]: the role of the early Indians in this, so

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
[Amit Varma]: to say, who are till this point the original

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
[Guest]: inhabitants? What's going on here?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
[Guest]: My book calls the people who came

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Guest]: out of Africa, migrants, who arrived here around

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
[Guest]: 65,000 years ago and their descendants

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
[Guest]: as the first Indians. The Harappans

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
[Guest]: are a mixture of first Indians

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
[Guest]: and West Asians who arrived

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
[Guest]: from roughly the Saghros region of

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
[Guest]: Iran, around 9,000

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
[Guest]: years ago or earlier,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
[Guest]: and they mixed with

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
[Guest]: the first Indians, who

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
[Guest]: may have already been experimenting

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
[Guest]: with agriculture in places like Mehrgarh, for

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
[Guest]: all you know, but this mixed population,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
[Guest]: it is clear that they catalyzed the

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
[Guest]: agricultural transition across

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: the entire region and then

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
[Guest]: laid the foundation. So we now know

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
[Guest]: the clear answer to who were the Harappans.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
[Guest]: The Harappans were a mixture of the

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
[Guest]: first Indians and

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
[Guest]: West Asian agriculturalists who moved in

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
[Amit Varma]: here around 9,000

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
[Amit Varma]: years ago. And population genetics absolutely

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[Guest]: establishes that now. Yes,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
[Guest]: this is based on

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
[Guest]: ancient DNA evidence, which

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
[Guest]: again talks in detail, which

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
[Guest]: shows that the Harappan

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
[Guest]: civilization, this was the mixture of

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
[Guest]: the Harappan civilization and I understand

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
[Guest]: this is the finding that is coming from

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
[Guest]: the Rakhi Gadi DNA, which is

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
[Amit Varma]: yet to be published as well.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Right, and given that

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
[Amit Varma]: the Harappan script has yet to be

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
[Amit Varma]: deciphered, as you pointed out

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, in this age of computers

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and AI and all, it's probably only a matter of

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
[Amit Varma]: time, but given that it's yet to be

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
[Amit Varma]: deciphered, what assumptions can

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
[Amit Varma]: we make about their language

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and the possible successors to that

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
[Guest]: language? What is

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
[Guest]: really surprising is that

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
[Guest]: even before the Harappan

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
[Guest]: civilization, forget about the new

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
[Guest]: discoveries, even before the Harappan civilization

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
[Guest]: was discovered, anyone knew

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
[Guest]: that there is such a thing as the Harappan civilization,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
[Guest]: there has been suggestions

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
[Guest]: by linguists of

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
[Guest]: links between Dravidian languages

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
[Guest]: and the language of

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
[Guest]: the Elamite, which is today an extinct

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
[Guest]: language, but which was spoken by

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
[Guest]: in Elam, which is in the Zagros

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
[Guest]: region of Iran and

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
[Guest]: close to the Mesopotamian

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
[Guest]: region, and that these

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
[Guest]: two languages are much in common is an idea

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
[Guest]: that predates the

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
[Guest]: discovery of the Harappan civilization.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
[Guest]: But there's

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
[Guest]: no way of, you can prove it, it has

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
[Guest]: always been, papers written, these

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
[Guest]: are the links, this is connected, this

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
[Guest]: language is like this in

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
[Guest]: these areas.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
[Guest]: Now what we have found

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
[Guest]: is that first, the archaeological

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
[Guest]: discoveries in Mehrgarh

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
[Guest]: and the Jarij, who is the archaeologist

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
[Guest]: who led the discoveries in his paper

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
[Guest]: which my book quotes, talks

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
[Guest]: about the similarities,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
[Guest]: the surprising similarities

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
[Guest]: between Mehrgarh and regions

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
[Guest]: of Zagros region in Iran

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
[Guest]: where also archaeologists had

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
[Guest]: found early settlements

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
[Guest]: and the similarities are stunning

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
[Guest]: in terms of the house designs,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
[Guest]: in terms of the first pottery

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
[Guest]: that is made, you know, with bitumen

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
[Guest]: and things like that. So there is a

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
[Guest]: range of similarities between the two

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
[Guest]: which he is surprised, he talks about

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
[Guest]: in his paper. So archaeologically

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
[Guest]: now, linguistically

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
[Guest]: there has always been a suggestion of a link.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
[Guest]: Archaeology has linked Mehrgarh

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
[Guest]: with Zagros region

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
[Guest]: of Iran and now genetics

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
[Guest]: has gone further

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
[Guest]: and said there is indeed

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
[Guest]: migration of people from the Zagros

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
[Guest]: region of Iran, roughly that region of

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
[Guest]: West Asia into India

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
[Guest]: and who mixed with the first

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
[Guest]: Indians to form the...

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
[Guest]: So you have now evidence from multiple

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
[Guest]: places offer links

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
[Guest]: between these two regions.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
[Guest]: Now, what is the link?

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
[Guest]: Is it possible?

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
[Guest]: We know that the Indo-European languages

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
[Guest]: arrived in India only much later,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
[Guest]: in the period between 4000

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
[Guest]: to 3000 years ago.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
[Guest]: So what is likely to happen in the language of the

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
[Guest]: Harappans in that period?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
[Guest]: There are two, three things that one can

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
[Guest]: possibly say. One is that

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
[Guest]: it's too large a region, it couldn't happen.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
[Guest]: Even today in that region there are many, many languages

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
[Guest]: and it couldn't happen in one language,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
[Guest]: it must happen in multiple languages. Yes, that's true.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
[Guest]: But it is possible that there was still one dominant

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
[Guest]: language because there is uniformity

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
[Guest]: in seals. Seals are writings

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
[Guest]: and those writings are in

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
[Guest]: a particular way, they don't change radically.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
[Guest]: If a script is used to

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
[Guest]: used for one language and then used

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
[Guest]: in another language like the Harappan script

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
[Guest]: has been used in, it is used in

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
[Guest]: West Asia for example, in trading

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
[Guest]: and things like that. We can see the

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
[Guest]: sequence of words changes

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
[Guest]: because it's a different language.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
[Guest]: Across the sites of the Harappan sites

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
[Guest]: the sequence is

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
[Guest]: consistent. So it suggests

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
[Guest]: that there is at least for trading purposes

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
[Guest]: so at least for administrative

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
[Guest]: purposes there is some kind of language that is

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
[Guest]: used as common.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
[Guest]: Now what language that

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
[Guest]: could be? It's a civilization that survived

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
[Guest]: for 700 years

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
[Guest]: and it

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
[Guest]: has to have left

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
[Guest]: a significant mark on the Indian

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
[Guest]: culture. And the language that could

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
[Guest]: fit the bill is the Dravidian languages

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: which are today spoken by about

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
[Guest]: 20% of the people of

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
[Guest]: India and which is

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
[Guest]: also linked to Brahui language

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
[Guest]: which is today spoken by

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: the Brahui in the north western parts

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
[Guest]: of which is today in Pakistan.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
[Guest]: So the idea that

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: Elamite and Dravidian are

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest]: linked has now been

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
[Guest]: revived in the light of

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
[Guest]: comes back with much stronger

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: force in the light of new

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
[Guest]: discoveries of that link Elam

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
[Guest]: to India. So the

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
[Guest]: first time that these

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
[Guest]: suggestions were made that there are

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
[Guest]: similarities between the two languages

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
[Guest]: they were dealt with skepticism

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
[Guest]: for multiple reasons.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
[Guest]: One of the reasons being that

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
[Guest]: the earliest proto-Dravidian

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
[Guest]: suggests not Harappan

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
[Guest]: like cities but more like

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
[Guest]: herding situations.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
[Guest]: But that's not surprising

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
[Guest]: if you assume that the earliest

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
[Guest]: introduction of

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
[Guest]: Dravidian languages as we

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
[Guest]: discussed earlier, the people who came

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
[Guest]: from Zagros region to Harappa

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
[Guest]: were not necessarily agriculturists

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
[Guest]: but were herders

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
[Guest]: who may have been exposed to

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
[Guest]: the developing culture of agriculture in

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
[Guest]: Mesopotamia but were themselves

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
[Guest]: nomadic herders.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
[Guest]: So if that they came some of them

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
[Guest]: might have settled down to agriculture

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
[Guest]: and then went on to create but even now

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
[Guest]: there are nomadic, Brahui themselves are

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
[Guest]: nomads and

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
[Guest]: pastoralists. So there are

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
[Guest]: not all the people who came may have settled

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
[Guest]: down to farming and then went on to

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
[Guest]: create the Harappans. Some of them may have been

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
[Guest]: pastoralists and it is possible that

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
[Guest]: it is pastoralists who brought

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
[Guest]: Dravidian languages of Harappa

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
[Guest]: down to South India first.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
[Guest]: The common assumption

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
[Guest]: that the Harappan languages

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
[Guest]: or Dravidian languages reached India

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
[Guest]: after the Harappan civilization

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
[Guest]: fell apart and they moved down south

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
[Guest]: need not be the case.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
[Guest]: It is possible that it is

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
[Guest]: this pastoralists who brought down

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
[Guest]: and we have evidence

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
[Guest]: from archaeobotany and

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
[Guest]: other things of the

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
[Guest]: how the first

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
[Guest]: agricultural package

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
[Guest]: which includes both millets and pulses

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
[Guest]: and a domesticated animal.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
[Guest]: The domesticated animal was brought into

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
[Guest]: South India from the north.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
[Guest]: So it is possible

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
[Guest]: that it is this pastoralists who brought

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
[Guest]: it into the south and

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
[Guest]: that is the first

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
[Guest]: bringing of Dravidian

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
[Guest]: languages into South India

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
[Guest]: and it might have been pastoralist at

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
[Guest]: that time. So I am saying many of the

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
[Guest]: old questions that

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
[Guest]: challenged the idea of a

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
[Guest]: Dravidian language in Harappan

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
[Guest]: may now have new answers

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
[Guest]: based on new findings

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
[Guest]: as well as

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
[Guest]: possibilities like that that have now become

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
[Amit Varma]: evident. So before we get to

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
[Amit Varma]: the Aryan migration which happens

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
[Amit Varma]: after this, just to kind of

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
[Amit Varma]: sum it up, some of

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
[Amit Varma]: the story of the link

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
[Amit Varma]: between Mehrgarh and Harappa

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
[Amit Varma]: all the way to South India and

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously what we are now beginning to realize

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
[Amit Varma]: is that South Indians in a sense are the

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
[Amit Varma]: descendants of the Harappans. Where did they go?

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
[Amit Varma]: They came south and the story really

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
[Amit Varma]: is that you have these pastoralist

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
[Amit Varma]: migrants from West Asia, from Zagros

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on, coming, perhaps settling

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
[Amit Varma]: in Mehrgarh where agriculture starts and

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
[Amit Varma]: that starts booming and there are various experiments

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and then you probably have a

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
[Amit Varma]: like you said luck being involved, a perfect

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
[Amit Varma]: storm of circumstances and from that cities

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
[Amit Varma]: evolve and productivity

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
[Amit Varma]: goes up, cities evolve, cultures evolve

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth and eventually

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
[Amit Varma]: of course the Harappan civilization

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
[Amit Varma]: as we know lasted between 2600 and

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
[Amit Varma]: 1900 but even

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
[Amit Varma]: while it was on and perhaps after it's

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
[Amit Varma]: declined, you have all of those guys

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
[Amit Varma]: coming down and settling in

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
[Amit Varma]: South India and there

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
[Amit Varma]: is evidence of that genetically of course

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
[Amit Varma]: it's pretty much confirmed

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
[Amit Varma]: through archeology and all that, it's there

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and now you are saying that even

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
[Amit Varma]: linguistically there is coming to be

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
[Amit Varma]: this strong belief that the modern

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Dravidian languages like Tamil, Malayalam

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on originated from

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
[Guest]: there. Yeah, I would make

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
[Guest]: some, when the Harappan civilization

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
[Guest]: started declining, people moved

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously. And it was already

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
[Guest]: by then a mix of Zagrosian and

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
[Guest]: early India as you are saying. And they

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
[Guest]: have moved both, they are moving

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
[Guest]: from North-Western India right, so moved

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
[Guest]: East to what is today North India

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
[Guest]: and South to what is today

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
[Guest]: South India. So in a

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
[Guest]: sense the Harappans are ancestors

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
[Guest]: to both North Indians

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
[Guest]: and South Indians, both in a

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
[Guest]: genetic sense and in a cultural

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: sense because they carried with them many

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
[Guest]: practices, beliefs of the

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
[Guest]: Harappan traditions with them to both these

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
[Guest]: regions. The only difference is

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
[Guest]: that they would have brought their languages

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
[Guest]: also to both these regions, North India

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Guest]: as well as South India, but later

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
[Guest]: migrations of Indo-European

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
[Guest]: language speaking people from

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
[Guest]: Central Asia overly

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
[Guest]: or displaced. There was a language shift that

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
[Guest]: happened in North India from

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
[Guest]: Dravidian languages to Indo-European

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
[Guest]: languages. That shift did

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
[Guest]: not happen in South

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
[Guest]: India where the language still

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
[Guest]: continues. So the difference between

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
[Guest]: North India and South India is that

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
[Guest]: as regards to Harappan is that the

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
[Guest]: linguistic heritage of

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: Harappa is with the South

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
[Guest]: Indians, but the cultural and genetic

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
[Guest]: heritage of the Harappans

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
[Guest]: are both in the South

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
[Guest]: and in the North. In a sense

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
[Guest]: the Harappans are in many

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
[Guest]: ways the glue that holds

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
[Guest]: us together because

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
[Guest]: it has left such

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest]: an imprint on the cultural practices

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
[Guest]: today because if you build houses

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
[Guest]: around courtyards today,

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
[Guest]: that's the way houses were built in the Harappan tradition.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
[Guest]: So many many factors

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
[Guest]: that you today take for granted,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
[Guest]: we may not realize that they actually come from

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
[Guest]: the imprints that have been left

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
[Guest]: behind by the Harappan civilization.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
[Guest]: If many of the things that we today

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
[Guest]: see as continuities between

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
[Guest]: different parts of the region

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
[Guest]: could owe their beginnings

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
[Guest]: to what people did

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
[Amit Varma]: in the Harappan civilization.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, as you pointed out, even

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Sanskrit and even some of what we know

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
[Amit Varma]: as a Vedic culture has

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
[Amit Varma]: imprints of Harappan civilization

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and you've detailed some of it in your

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
[Amit Varma]: book. Let's talk about the Aryan migrations

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
[Amit Varma]: now. It is clear that, I mean,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
[Amit Varma]: there is this term called Indo-Proto-European and you

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of know that there is a much commonality

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
[Amit Varma]: between, for example,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
[Amit Varma]: that set of languages

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
[Amit Varma]: which come from Sanskrit and

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
[Amit Varma]: the European languages

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and until recently there were

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of two schools of thought and there were people

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
[Amit Varma]: who would say that, hey,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
[Amit Varma]: the migration could have happened in any

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
[Amit Varma]: direction. It isn't necessary that

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
[Amit Varma]: they came here. Maybe it originated here

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and we went there. But as you point out in

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
[Amit Varma]: your book, the new science

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
[Amit Varma]: has decided that question

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
[Guest]: decisively. Tell me a little bit about that.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
[Guest]: The new science is ancient DNA, but

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
[Guest]: before ancient DNA, there's

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
[Guest]: a simple way to answer it, right?

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
[Guest]: Indo-European languages, the family

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
[Guest]: of languages are spread from Iceland

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
[Guest]: to India. India forms

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
[Guest]: the eastern most area in

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
[Guest]: which Indo-European languages are

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
[Guest]: spoken. There's no community of people

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
[Guest]: towards the east of India

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
[Guest]: that speaks Indo-European languages.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
[Guest]: So how did

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
[Guest]: the language come to be

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
[Guest]: spread as it is? For India

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
[Guest]: as well as for any other region, the only answer

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
[Guest]: is either somebody else brought it in there

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
[Guest]: or it went from this region to the rest of the world.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
[Guest]: Those are the only two answers.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
[Guest]: Now if it went from India

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
[Guest]: to the rest of the world, there should

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
[Guest]: be a signal of that

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
[Guest]: movement genetically,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
[Guest]: meaning you should be able to see.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
[Guest]: Remember, we are talking about

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: even today, we know that

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
[Guest]: the ancestry of all Indians

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
[Guest]: in almost all populations carry

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
[Guest]: 50-65% of

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
[Guest]: first Indian ancestry. No

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
[Guest]: matter where in the caste hierarchy you are,

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
[Guest]: no matter what language you speak, no matter

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
[Guest]: which region you inhabit,

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
[Guest]: you are likely, if

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
[Guest]: this applies to most Indian population groups,

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
[Guest]: you carry between 50-65%.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And much more in the case of the Andaman

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
[Guest]: residents who, as you pointed out, are probably

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
[Guest]: the less

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
[Guest]: purest descendants.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
[Guest]: So that is the ancestry of the

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
[Guest]: first Indians.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
[Guest]: So if there was indeed

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
[Guest]: a large migration that took

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
[Guest]: these languages from India to the rest of the world,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
[Guest]: you should see a trail

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
[Guest]: of first Indian ancestry

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
[Guest]: going from India

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
[Guest]: to the rest of the world. In the genome.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
[Guest]: But

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
[Guest]: we know that first Indians

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
[Guest]: are by and large, they don't have close

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
[Guest]: relatives anywhere else in the world.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
[Guest]: Because the people who

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
[Guest]: went, their descendants who went on to

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
[Guest]: populate the rest of the world

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
[Guest]: 65,000 years ago,

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
[Guest]: that happened so long ago, that they are

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
[Guest]: no longer close relatives because

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
[Guest]: they spread apart so long ago.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
[Guest]: So today, if you

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
[Guest]: ask any geneticist, he would say first Indians

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
[Guest]: ancestry is

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
[Guest]: South Asian and it doesn't have to have close relatives

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
[Guest]: outside. Now, there is

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
[Guest]: an exception to this rule that proves

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
[Guest]: the case. The exception is that of a

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
[Guest]: community called Roma, who were earlier called

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
[Guest]: Gypsies. Everybody knows

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
[Guest]: that the Roma came from India

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
[Guest]: around 1,500 years ago

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
[Guest]: and they spread from India, northwestern India

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
[Guest]: and then spread out. And there are

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
[Guest]: millions of them today in Europe as well as

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
[Guest]: in the Americas.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
[Guest]: So if you, and the

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
[Guest]: recent studies that have been done on the

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
[Guest]: DNA of the Roma

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
[Guest]: shows that their

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
[Guest]: empty DNA or mitochondrial DNA

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
[Guest]: suggests that they do.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
[Guest]: The signal of the first Indian is

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
[Guest]: there. A haplogroup called M2

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
[Guest]: which is the most common haplogroup

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
[Guest]: in India today

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
[Guest]: and that signal is there. But this

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
[Guest]: is an exception. They couldn't have spread

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
[Guest]: into European languages

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
[Guest]: to the rest of the world because that happened

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
[Guest]: only in 1,500

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
[Guest]: years ago roughly, in historical

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
[Guest]: time, not prehistorically. So this

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Guest]: is a strong

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
[Guest]: instance, one strong reason

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
[Guest]: to say that out of India is untenable.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
[Guest]: The theory that

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
[Guest]: Indo-European languages went from out of

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
[Guest]: India to the rest of the world is untenable

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
[Guest]: because there is no evidence to support it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
[Guest]: The second factor

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
[Guest]: is that out of India has always

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
[Guest]: in recent times has been an angry

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Guest]: retort to suggestions of

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
[Guest]: this is how Indo-European languages spread

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
[Guest]: but it has never been

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
[Guest]: fleshed out. There is not a

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
[Guest]: single paper that

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
[Guest]: says this is how it happened.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
[Guest]: This is the period when it happened.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
[Guest]: This is the routes that they took and this is how

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
[Guest]: they spread across the rest of the world. There is no

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
[Guest]: scientific paper

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest]: that lays out the case for out of India.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[Guest]: It has always been a single

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
[Guest]: retort, rhetorical answer

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
[Guest]: to the idea that this is how the Indo-European

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
[Guest]: languages spread across the world.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
[Guest]: Now, what

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
[Guest]: has happened in recent times is

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
[Guest]: that ancient DNA

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
[Guest]: has proved there is significant

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
[Guest]: movement of people from Central Asian steppe

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
[Guest]: into Europe

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
[Guest]: around 5000 years ago

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
[Guest]: and into South Asia around

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
[Guest]: 1000 years later, around 4000 years

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
[Guest]: ago, between 4000 and 3000

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
[Guest]: years ago. And this

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
[Guest]: is what carried

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
[Guest]: Indo-European languages

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
[Guest]: into both regions.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
[Guest]: How do we know this?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
[Guest]: There are multiple answers to this.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: From the different disciplines.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
[Guest]: From the different disciplines between archaeological

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
[Guest]: similarities and

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
[Guest]: the spread of the languages themselves

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
[Guest]: and to the fact that

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
[Guest]: today when you look at

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
[Guest]: steppe ancestry among Indians

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
[Guest]: you will see that it is

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
[Guest]: much higher, it is elevated levels

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
[Guest]: as one of the studies puts it,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
[Guest]: recent studies. Steppe

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
[Guest]: ancestry is elevated in

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
[Guest]: those groups of people

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
[Guest]: who have been traditional custodians

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
[Guest]: of Sanskrit texts.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
[Guest]: So, I think there is a multiplicity

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
[Guest]: of evidence

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
[Guest]: with suggesting the

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
[Guest]: link between the spread

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
[Guest]: of migrations into both

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
[Guest]: Europe and into South Asia

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
[Guest]: and the languages that they carried.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
[Guest]: That's a perfect fit for the kind of

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
[Guest]: distribution of this family that we

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
[Amit Varma]: see across the world.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So, continue the story for me. We have Harappa

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: between 2600 and 1900 and then

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: there is a decline. I mean, firstly

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: what are the possible causes of the

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: decline and what happens after that and

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
[Amit Varma]: secondly, you have the Aryan

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: migration coming in sort of

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: from the top and how is all of that

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
[Guest]: playing out?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
[Guest]: You know, there was an earlier assumption that

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
[Guest]: the earliest version of, nobody

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
[Guest]: uses, nobody has used the Aryan

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
[Guest]: invasion theory for at least many many decades.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
[Guest]: It's a straw man which has been put up

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
[Guest]: by those who do not like to

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
[Guest]: accept the idea that there has been migration.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
[Guest]: But, when there was

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
[Guest]: the Aryan invasion theory was spoken

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
[Guest]: about in the very early,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
[Guest]: you know, during when the Harappan civilization

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
[Guest]: was discovered, because then the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
[Guest]: assumption was that what caused the decline

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: was the arrival of the Aryans.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: When I was in school, I was distinctly, I remember

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I was taught the Aryan invasion theory.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
[Guest]: So, this was when

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
[Guest]: they came about that they

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
[Guest]: destroyed civilization and that was the earliest

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
[Guest]: cause of the civilization,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
[Guest]: decline of the civilization.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
[Guest]: But this statement

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
[Guest]: made by the head of the

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
[Guest]: Indian Archaeological Survey, then a Britisher

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
[Guest]: who said Indra stands accused.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
[Guest]: He himself

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
[Guest]: withdrew that statement

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
[Guest]: later saying that

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
[Guest]: that's not the evidence because

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
[Guest]: for different reasons, for reasons such that

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
[Guest]: the dating of the Vedas were much

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
[Guest]: later, so they couldn't have come around the time

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
[Guest]: when, so for a variety of reasons.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
[Guest]: But the person who made the accusation himself

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
[Guest]: retracted it. There has been

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
[Guest]: no archaeological evidence to support

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
[Guest]: that the sites

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
[Guest]: of the Harappan civilization were

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
[Guest]: destroyed by invading

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
[Guest]: armies. And for

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
[Guest]: many years now, the evidence has been

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
[Guest]: accumulating that it's a

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
[Guest]: long drought that caused

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
[Guest]: the decline of not just

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
[Guest]: Harappan civilization, but many other

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
[Guest]: civilizations around the same time.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
[Guest]: To the extent that there is

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
[Guest]: now a new age is being

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
[Guest]: defined, my book talks about it, it's called the

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
[Guest]: Meghalayan age, Meghalayan age because

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
[Guest]: the proof for this long

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
[Guest]: drought was discovered from

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
[Guest]: geological formations in

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
[Guest]: Meghalaya, but it's being called

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
[Guest]: the Meghalayan age to describe

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
[Guest]: this new period that began with

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
[Guest]: the long drought. So it's

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
[Guest]: not clear that it is climatic factors that

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
[Guest]: were the major factor,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
[Guest]: major cause of the decline of the Harappan

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
[Guest]: civilization, though other things, as

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
[Guest]: is always the case, other things might have

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
[Guest]: added to it later on, including

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
[Guest]: migrations as possible.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah. And then,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, once the Aryan comes, there's also

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
[Amit Varma]: besides the genetic interminglings, there's cultural

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
[Amit Varma]: interminglings, like

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out, you know, a lot of Harappan

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: culture is reflected in

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
[Amit Varma]: what we call Vedic culture and

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
[Amit Varma]: assumed to be, you know, something pure that

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
[Amit Varma]: originated out of itself, sui

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
[Amit Varma]: generis, as it were, but there are

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
[Amit Varma]: influences of Harappa. There are influences of

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Harappa on the language, Sanskrit

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
[Guest]: itself. Yes. The earliest versions

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
[Guest]: of Sanskrit that we have

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
[Guest]: already has what is called

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
[Guest]: retroflex consonants in it, like ta,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
[Guest]: na, these are

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
[Guest]: consonants, these are sounds that you have to make by

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
[Guest]: curling your tongue and striking your palate.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
[Guest]: And this is, retroflex

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
[Guest]: consonants are not there in other Indo-European

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
[Guest]: language families, not even in

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
[Guest]: Persian, which is the closest that you

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
[Guest]: can find. But it is there in Sanskrit,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
[Guest]: in the earliest Sanskrit. So

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
[Guest]: why is it there? It is there

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
[Guest]: because retroflex consonants have

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
[Guest]: been a common factor

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
[Guest]: across many earlier South Asian

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
[Guest]: languages, including Dravidian.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
[Guest]: So, it's clearly

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
[Guest]: a sign of the

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
[Guest]: influence on the earliest

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
[Guest]: Sanskrit that

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
[Guest]: we have, that it has

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
[Guest]: retroflex consonants that other Indo-European

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
[Guest]: languages mostly do not have. There might be one

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
[Guest]: or two exceptions, but by and large, they

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
[Guest]: don't have. And the striking thing is even Persian

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
[Guest]: doesn't have. And if you look

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
[Guest]: at, and my

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
[Guest]: book says that there is a

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
[Guest]: disconnect between the Harappan

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
[Guest]: civilization and what its concerns

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
[Guest]: and images were.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
[Guest]: And the earliest texts,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
[Guest]: Vedic texts, such as

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
[Guest]: the Rig Veda,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
[Guest]: and over time you can see that

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
[Guest]: disconnect disappears. Such as?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
[Guest]: Give me some example. For example,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
[Guest]: take the case of

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
[Guest]: the Rig Veda speaks poorly

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
[Guest]: of phallus worshippers,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
[Guest]: Shishnadeva. Right.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
[Guest]: And it doesn't want

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
[Guest]: those people to be associated or come anywhere

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
[Guest]: near Lord Indra and

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
[Guest]: they really dislike them.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
[Guest]: But there is evidence, archaeologists

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
[Guest]: have excavated places like Taula Vida,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
[Guest]: R.S. Bisht, for example,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
[Guest]: talks about how there is significant

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
[Guest]: evidence of phallus

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
[Guest]: worship, not just in Taula Vida, but in other

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
[Guest]: Harappan cities as well.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
[Guest]: So, that's a disconnect.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
[Guest]: Disconnect between what the Rig Veda says and what

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
[Guest]: you can see as a practice in the Harappan

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
[Guest]: civilization. But that disconnect

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
[Guest]: goes later, because

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
[Guest]: the objection to phallus

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
[Guest]: worship is not something that sustains,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
[Guest]: that goes away.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
[Guest]: You can see in the Harappan civilization,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
[Guest]: you can see many images, or even

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
[Guest]: one seal, which is so strikingly

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
[Guest]: similar to a yogic position.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
[Guest]: We don't know whether it was a yogic position,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
[Guest]: but you can't deny the fact that it is.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
[Guest]: This sounds very

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
[Guest]: familiar to you. And not

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
[Guest]: only the seal, there are also many other

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
[Guest]: small artifacts which remind you

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
[Guest]: of yoga

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
[Guest]: or yogic things. But in the earliest

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
[Guest]: parts of the Vedic texts, there's no mention

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
[Guest]: of yoga. But by the time you come

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
[Guest]: to the later parts, later

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
[Guest]: compositions, you can see

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
[Guest]: clear evidence of it.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
[Guest]: So, there are multiple levels at

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
[Guest]: which you can see, like

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
[Guest]: it happens everywhere.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
[Guest]: You can see that there is an intermingling of cultures.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
[Guest]: There's adoption,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
[Guest]: there's adaption, both

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
[Guest]: happening as the newcomers

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
[Guest]: mingle with the already existing

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
[Guest]: settled populations of

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
[Guest]: the Harappans in the area.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
[Guest]: So, you have to see

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
[Guest]: the Indian culture has

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
[Guest]: draws from multiple, it doesn't come from

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
[Guest]: a single source as we have often imagined.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
[Guest]: It comes from multiple

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
[Guest]: sources. It has put together,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
[Guest]: just as genetically, we are a combination

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
[Guest]: of four major prehistoric

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
[Guest]: migrations that happened.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
[Guest]: There are other migrations too, but nothing

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
[Guest]: left us big and imprint us these four

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
[Amit Varma]: migrations. Which are these four?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
[Amit Varma]: The Out of Africa migrations that we talked about,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
[Guest]: the West Asians that we

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
[Guest]: talked about. There's a third one

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
[Guest]: which we haven't talked about, which is

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
[Guest]: there's a migration from East Asia that happened

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
[Guest]: around 4000 to 3500

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
[Guest]: years ago, which brought

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
[Guest]: Austro-Asiatic languages such as

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
[Guest]: Khasi, Mundari, etc.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
[Guest]: which are spoken by tribals in

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
[Guest]: Central India and Eastern India.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
[Guest]: India actually has four

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
[Guest]: major large language

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
[Guest]: families. Of course, Indo-European which is

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
[Guest]: spoken by three-fourths of the

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
[Guest]: people, Dravidian languages,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
[Guest]: Austro-Asiatic languages

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
[Guest]: and

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
[Guest]: Tibeto-Burman languages. This is not including

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
[Guest]: the Andamanese languages which are a separate one.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
[Guest]: There are also one or two isolates.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
[Guest]: So of this, the four

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
[Guest]: Indo-European, Dravidian,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
[Guest]: Indo-European we spoke about, Dravidian we

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
[Guest]: spoke about, Austro-Asiatic

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
[Guest]: came from East Asia.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
[Guest]: Tibeto-Burman obviously is a part of

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
[Guest]: the language family. That also came as part

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
[Guest]: of migration but it's a very small population

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
[Guest]: in, smaller than

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: even the Austro-Asiatic.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And what was fascinating and very

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
[Amit Varma]: apt to me and even moving is your

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: use of the Pisa analogy

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: where you describe sort of

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
[Amit Varma]: India as, you know, to think of

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
[Amit Varma]: it as a Pisa. Just can you expand on

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
[Guest]: that? Yeah, it came

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
[Guest]: quite accidentally when a

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
[Guest]: friend of mine

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
[Guest]: who knew what I

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
[Guest]: was writing on wanted to

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
[Guest]: know how I would describe

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
[Guest]: his state's population

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
[Guest]: as a mixture of what and what.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
[Guest]: So it was in the context of

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
[Guest]: trying to explain it to him that

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
[Guest]: the Pisa analogy came to me that

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
[Guest]: but when I thought

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
[Guest]: about it, I thought, you know, this is just a

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
[Guest]: this doesn't sound like a good

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
[Guest]: one. I'm sure I'll be able to find a better

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
[Guest]: metaphor later on

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
[Guest]: but as it stands, I have never been

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
[Amit Varma]: able to find a metaphor. It's a fantastic metaphor.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
[Amit Varma]: So just expand on it.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
[Guest]: So the

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
[Guest]: base of the Pisa

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
[Guest]: are the first Indians

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
[Guest]: or the first Indian ancestry that forms

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
[Guest]: 50 to 65 percent of

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
[Guest]: the ancestry of most Indian population

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
[Amit Varma]: groups. That came 65,000 years ago

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
[Guest]: from out of Africa.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
[Guest]: And this is a striking, which we did not

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
[Guest]: know earlier. In fact, we used

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
[Guest]: to ask out of Africa migrants

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
[Amit Varma]: where did they go?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
[Guest]: It is true, of course, that you can see

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
[Guest]: them in

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
[Guest]: the Andaman Islands who did not

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
[Guest]: mix with people as all of us did.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
[Guest]: But the first answer to the question

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
[Guest]: is look in the mirror.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
[Guest]: 50 to 65 percent of the ancestry of

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
[Guest]: most Indian population groups first comes from

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
[Guest]: the first Indians. So that's the base. That's the

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
[Guest]: foundation. It also shows

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
[Guest]: that how wrong it is

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
[Guest]: for anyone to think as we often think

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
[Guest]: that the tribals, for example,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
[Guest]: are somehow very different

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
[Guest]: and from the rest of the population.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
[Guest]: That's not true. If we share,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
[Guest]: if the rest of the population shares most with

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
[Guest]: anyone else, that's with the tribals. The tribals

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
[Guest]: are us. Us in inverted

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
[Guest]: commas. But

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
[Guest]: the point is that's the

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
[Guest]: so it's the wrong impression.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
[Guest]: So the first Indians are

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
[Guest]: the foundation, are the base of the Indian

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
[Guest]: piece. That's what is unique about us

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
[Guest]: because there's nothing else like this

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
[Guest]: anywhere else in the world.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
[Guest]: So if you want to say what's unique,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
[Guest]: what makes us, anyone else look

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
[Guest]: Indians and say he is an Indian, I mean

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
[Guest]: Indian I use in the entire South Asian context.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
[Guest]: This is the base that makes it

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
[Guest]: who is an Indian.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
[Guest]: So I mean base not, I mean I'm

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
[Guest]: exaggerating is all of the rest.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
[Guest]: So on the foundation is laid

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
[Guest]: the source. What's the source?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
[Guest]: The source is the Harappans. How

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
[Guest]: come? Because the Harappans, when the

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
[Guest]: civilization declined, they spread

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
[Guest]: across the pizza.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
[Guest]: Both North India

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
[Guest]: and South India, they are the ancestors of both.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
[Guest]: And so that's

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
[Guest]: the source that has spread all over the pizza.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
[Guest]: And then there is

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
[Guest]: the cheese, the

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
[Guest]: area. And they are not

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
[Guest]: spread uniformly. They are spread more in the

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
[Guest]: North, less in the South. But they are

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
[Guest]: there everywhere. So that's

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
[Guest]: the cheese you could say.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
[Guest]: Then there are the toppings, which is both

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
[Guest]: the Austro-Asiatic and the Tibetan

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
[Guest]: and all the others who came later

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
[Guest]: who may not have left a large imprint

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
[Guest]: on our demography, but are still

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
[Guest]: makes the pizza what it is.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
[Guest]: It will taste very differently if those

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
[Guest]: toppings were not there.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
[Guest]: So that's the Indian

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
[Amit Varma]: population.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know the other

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
[Amit Varma]: large and very welcome and

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
[Amit Varma]: gratifying conclusion of all of this science

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
[Amit Varma]: is that there is no such

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
[Amit Varma]: thing as races

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: or racial purity or any of

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that. All of that is just conceptual

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: nonsense. Because we are all

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
[Guest]: completely mixed. Absolutely.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
[Guest]: Conceptual nonsense born out of

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
[Guest]: a need to

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
[Guest]: people have an innate need to create

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
[Guest]: identities and they need

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
[Guest]: you know classifications

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
[Guest]: and things to create those identities

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
[Guest]: that will set them apart from other

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
[Guest]: identities. But the reality is that the more you closely

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
[Guest]: look at them, they are not

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
[Guest]: black and white stories. All populations

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: are combinations. You cannot find a population that is

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
[Guest]: not a combination. Unless you suddenly

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
[Guest]: find that there is this population in Amazon

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
[Guest]: Forest somewhere who hasn't been in touch

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
[Guest]: with anybody for 50,000 years.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
[Guest]: Well, it can't be 50,000 in the Amazon.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
[Guest]: It has to be less than 16,000.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
[Guest]: So that's impossible. So I'm saying somewhere

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
[Guest]: you find that there is an out-of-Africa

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
[Guest]: population that hasn't

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
[Guest]: mixed with anyone forever.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
[Guest]: And then you can say, yeah, and that might

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
[Guest]: be very different. It must be a pure race. But

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
[Guest]: other than that, all populations are mixes

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
[Guest]: multiple times.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
[Guest]: And one of the amazing things that

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
[Guest]: is now clear is that one

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
[Guest]: of the strong objections of people when you

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
[Guest]: look at Indians is the result

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
[Guest]: of four major population migrations

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
[Guest]: because they think that's why

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
[Guest]: are you taking, picking out India and

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
[Guest]: you know, why are you portraying India as

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
[Guest]: some peculiar case where there is multiple

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
[Guest]: migrations. This is not true. This is true

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
[Guest]: of all parts of the world.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
[Guest]: This is true of all parts of

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
[Guest]: the world. Europe has seen its populations.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
[Guest]: In fact, we have been less affected

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
[Guest]: by migrations

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
[Guest]: than other parts of the world because

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
[Guest]: most of the parts of the world in Europe, for example,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
[Guest]: the first hunter-gatherer ancestry is

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
[Guest]: in single digits.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
[Guest]: Why? Because there have been

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
[Guest]: there have been at least two major

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
[Guest]: migrations that completely

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
[Amit Varma]: changed the demography of Europe. So you'd say

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
[Amit Varma]: their pizza doesn't really have a base

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
[Guest]: per se. New base because

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
[Guest]: new migrants, the old base is

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
[Guest]: gone. Right. Or reduced

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
[Guest]: to single digits, except in North Europe

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
[Guest]: where there is a much larger percentage

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
[Guest]: of their, Northern

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
[Guest]: Europe has a much larger percentage of

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
[Guest]: their hunter-gatherers. So Europe

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
[Guest]: has seen at least two major migrations.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
[Guest]: First around 9000

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
[Guest]: years ago from West Asia

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
[Guest]: again, not from the same region as Zagros, but from

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
[Guest]: Anatolia, that went

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
[Guest]: into taking farming into

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
[Guest]: Europe. And then around 5000

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
[Guest]: years ago, the same guys, or

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
[Guest]: close to the same guys who came here, who went

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
[Guest]: into Europe, taking Indo-European

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
[Guest]: languages, horse riding,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
[Guest]: carriage driving,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
[Guest]: masters of metallurgy,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
[Guest]: the new, the step-pastelists

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
[Guest]: who went and

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
[Guest]: either mixed with the

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
[Guest]: existing Neolithic farmers in

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
[Guest]: Europe to some extent and replaced them to

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
[Guest]: a large extent. That's the story of Europe.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
[Guest]: America, we know that even before the

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
[Guest]: Europeans came in, European story is a

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
[Guest]: different one. Even before the Europeans came in, there were at least

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
[Guest]: three major migrations from Asia

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
[Guest]: that populated the

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
[Guest]: Americas as they are. In East

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
[Guest]: Asia, we know that there are at least

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
[Guest]: two major migrations

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
[Guest]: that changed the entire demography of

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
[Guest]: East Asia. One of those bringing

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
[Guest]: is what brought in Austro-Asiatic

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
[Guest]: languages to India. The other one brought

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
[Guest]: Austronesian languages to many parts

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
[Guest]: of the Pacific Islands.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
[Guest]: So, repeated

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
[Guest]: mass migrations

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
[Guest]: that changed demography is

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
[Guest]: not specific, is

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
[Guest]: not a speciality of South Asia.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
[Guest]: In fact, it is

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
[Guest]: true of most regions

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
[Guest]: in the world. In Central Asia, for example,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
[Guest]: it would be difficult to keep track

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
[Guest]: of the number

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
[Guest]: of times the migrations

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
[Guest]: have changed the demography

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
[Amit Varma]: of the region.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Possibly the most fascinating chapter

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book for me was actually the epilogue

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
[Amit Varma]: where you sort of

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: move on from the science and

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
[Amit Varma]: you look at some

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
[Amit Varma]: of the really new findings and you

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
[Amit Varma]: raise questions with them which you don't

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
[Amit Varma]: necessarily want to answer or

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
[Amit Varma]: go out of your way to answer. But it's important that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
[Amit Varma]: those questions are being

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
[Amit Varma]: raised. And

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
[Amit Varma]: one of those questions is

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
[Amit Varma]: about caste. Where

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
[Amit Varma]: like you point out, the new science shows

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that the caste system really solidified

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
[Amit Varma]: around 100 CE.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And as you say, it is not at

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
[Amit Varma]: all inevitable in a cultural sense

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that it was going to turn out that way because

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
[Amit Varma]: within Hinduism there were other

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
[Amit Varma]: competing traditions like

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Charvakas and Lokayuktas which were

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
[Amit Varma]: much more based on rationalism

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and not so hierarchical and all that.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
[Amit Varma]: But nevertheless the caste system

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
[Amit Varma]: came about. So what's the kind of evidence

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
[Amit Varma]: through which we know this that

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
[Amit Varma]: it became so endogamous and what are the consequences

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
[Guest]: of this? Yeah, as you said

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
[Guest]: the new information that we have now

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
[Guest]: which we did not have earlier

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
[Guest]: I mean before two years ago

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
[Guest]: is that

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
[Guest]: endogamy which is a distinguishing

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
[Guest]: mark of the caste system of people marrying

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
[Guest]: within their community

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
[Guest]: did not begin until

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
[Guest]: about 100 CE

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
[Guest]: and that between, genetics

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
[Guest]: also says this, between around 4000

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
[Guest]: years ago

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
[Guest]: and the beginning of the common era

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
[Guest]: that's almost for 2000 years

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
[Guest]: 2000 BCE to

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
[Guest]: 100 CE, around 2000

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
[Guest]: years, there was

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
[Guest]: significant mixing between

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
[Guest]: different population groups

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
[Guest]: that's also a finding in the country

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
[Guest]: of the kind that has never been seen before

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
[Guest]: or later. Just

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
[Guest]: imagine all that happened.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
[Guest]: If you were to ask yourself what is the most

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
[Guest]: tumultuous period in the history

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
[Guest]: of this

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
[Guest]: region, there would be no doubt

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
[Guest]: about what that period was. It is around

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
[Guest]: 2000 BCE to 100 CE

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
[Guest]: Why is that? Think of all that

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
[Guest]: happened. A long existing

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
[Guest]: civilization that had thrived

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
[Guest]: in its mature form alone for 700

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
[Guest]: years went away

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
[Guest]: the Harappan civilization slowly

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
[Guest]: but definitively went

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
[Guest]: away. New

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
[Guest]: migrants came from East Asia bringing

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
[Guest]: a new set of languages and perhaps new

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
[Guest]: farming practices. Another set

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
[Guest]: of migrants came from Central Asia

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
[Guest]: bringing warlike

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
[Guest]: bringing new languages

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
[Guest]: who are dominant and there is a language

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
[Guest]: shift that happens in Northern India

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
[Guest]: and in

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
[Guest]: this midst there is

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
[Guest]: major mixing between

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
[Guest]: different population groups that is going

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
[Guest]: on that is unheard of any

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
[Guest]: point of time because you have to remember

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
[Guest]: that by 4000 years ago

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
[Guest]: all the four major population

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
[Guest]: groups that would form

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
[Guest]: the foundation, that would form the Indian

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
[Guest]: demographic piece, they are all in

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
[Guest]: and for 2000 years there is significant

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
[Guest]: mixing that leaves no one

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
[Guest]: untouched. Today if you take

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
[Guest]: the most remote tribal

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
[Guest]: population, you would

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
[Guest]: still find that he

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
[Guest]: carries the ancestry of multiple populations

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
[Guest]: so that's the extent to which

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
[Guest]: the mixing happened because

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
[Amit Varma]: 2000 years is a very long time. We were the party

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
[Guest]: capital of those days.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
[Guest]: The only people who escaped

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
[Guest]: it were the Andamanis

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
[Guest]: because they are actually physically cut

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
[Guest]: off from the rest of the mainland and they don't know what is going

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
[Guest]: on there. But this

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
[Guest]: suddenly comes to an end.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
[Guest]: Not suddenly, it may have happened over a period

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
[Guest]: of time but around

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
[Guest]: 100 CE it comes to an end

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
[Guest]: and this is counterintuitive

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
[Guest]: right because you can easily

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
[Guest]: imagine people

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
[Guest]: who are, you know, so far

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
[Guest]: decided to stay separately, deciding

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
[Guest]: one day, hey this is silly, let's

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
[Guest]: start mixing.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
[Guest]: But it's far more difficult to imagine people

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
[Guest]: who have been freely mixing

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
[Guest]: for 2000 years

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
[Guest]: almost and then suddenly

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
[Guest]: decided, hey this doesn't make sense, let's

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
[Guest]: stop mixing.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
[Guest]: I mean, the horse has already bolted

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
[Guest]: right? So what is this about?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
[Guest]: When you think it like that

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
[Guest]: you realize that and

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
[Guest]: you also realize that this takes

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
[Guest]: away the suggestion that the caste system

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
[Guest]: began with the arrival of the

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
[Guest]: Aryas, right? It doesn't begin

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
[Guest]: there's almost a 2000 year difference.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
[Guest]: Then you realize

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
[Guest]: that this is more a political development

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
[Guest]: than a religious development

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
[Guest]: though with the caveat that it's often

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
[Guest]: difficult to distinguish politics

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
[Guest]: from religion. Even today.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
[Guest]: Even today.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
[Guest]: But it suggests that it's a

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
[Guest]: caste is a political development

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
[Guest]: more than a religious

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
[Guest]: development and it has, doesn't

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
[Guest]: have enough genetic

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
[Guest]: reasoning behind it because we are already

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
[Guest]: have, that's why Ambedkar is

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
[Guest]: right when he says there is no

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
[Guest]: difference between the

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
[Guest]: Dalits and the others because yes

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
[Guest]: we are a mixed population.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
[Guest]: So what caused

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
[Guest]: this new political

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
[Guest]: ideology to come

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
[Guest]: into the front in around 100

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
[Guest]: CE?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
[Guest]: We do not have clear answers.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
[Guest]: So my book only says these are ways to

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
[Guest]: we need to farm our research

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
[Guest]: to answer these questions.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
[Guest]: But we have some initial things to go by

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
[Guest]: and one of the things is

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
[Guest]: what you can see in the text

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
[Guest]: as a tension

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
[Guest]: between Aryavarta

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
[Guest]: and Malaysia Desha

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
[Guest]: or things that are not part of

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
[Guest]: Aryavarta.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
[Guest]: And mind you both these regions are

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
[Guest]: inhabited by the Arya or people

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
[Guest]: who call themselves Arya and Indo-European

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
[Guest]: language speaking people.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
[Guest]: Still the people of a

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
[Guest]: particular region who call themselves Aryavarta

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
[Guest]: find people

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
[Guest]: of the other region who are Arya

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
[Guest]: and who are Indo-European language speaking

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
[Guest]: not Kosher, not

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
[Guest]: really part of Aryavarta.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
[Guest]: Why is that?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
[Guest]: The best argument that we can

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
[Guest]: possible reason that we can find

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
[Guest]: is that there are differences of

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
[Guest]: social attitudes and conservatism

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
[Guest]: and ideas about social mixing

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
[Guest]: between different parts of

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
[Guest]: the Arya who came into India

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
[Guest]: that they were not all of the same mind.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
[Guest]: We already know this to some extent because

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
[Guest]: our texts themselves talk about

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
[Guest]: multiple groups and conflicts between groups.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
[Guest]: So it is wrong to think of one monolithic

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
[Guest]: group of people with the same ideas

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
[Guest]: and same approach

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
[Guest]: to life in general and to

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
[Guest]: how societies should be structured

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
[Guest]: coming into the country. These are multiple groups

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
[Guest]: they had multiple beliefs

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
[Guest]: and ways of approach

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
[Guest]: somewhere more conservative, somewhere

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
[Guest]: to use current terminology

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
[Guest]: more liberal.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
[Guest]: And it is likely that the

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
[Guest]: more conservative approach

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
[Guest]: to social life was dominant in what is called

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
[Guest]: Aryavarta which is in the confluence

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
[Guest]: in the area between the Ganga

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
[Guest]: and the Yamuna.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
[Guest]: And the areas outside of that confluence

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
[Guest]: are regarded as

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
[Guest]: Malaysia Dasha by who asked this question

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
[Guest]: which is the land of the Aryavarta

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
[Guest]: and defines it in this way.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
[Guest]: So the area outside of the confluence

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
[Guest]: of the Ganga and Yamuna which would include

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
[Guest]: parts of what would later

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
[Guest]: come to be known as Magadha

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
[Guest]: is actually where the next

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
[Guest]: is the center of the second urbanization

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
[Guest]: that happens. It is a place where

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
[Guest]: the new religions arise.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
[Guest]: Buddhism and Jainism

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
[Guest]: which did not accept many

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
[Guest]: rituals and practices

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
[Guest]: of the earlier religion

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
[Guest]: and it is also where the next

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
[Guest]: empire comes from.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
[Guest]: So if you assume that there is

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
[Guest]: a tension between these two

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
[Guest]: regions, by around

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
[Guest]: 100 CE you have to, the only

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
[Guest]: conclusion that you can arrive at is that

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
[Guest]: this tension was resolved

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
[Guest]: in one way with the victory

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
[Guest]: of one, victory meaning

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
[Guest]: one opinion of

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
[Guest]: how the society should be structured and organized

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
[Guest]: gaining over the other side

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: on how it should be.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
[Amit Varma]: So that one cultural strand and the

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
[Amit Varma]: you know this continued

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
[Amit Varma]: almost enforced endogamy

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense has interesting

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
[Amit Varma]: consequences. I want to quote this passage from

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
[Amit Varma]: David Reich's book Who We Are and How

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
[Amit Varma]: We Got Here which

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
[Amit Varma]: you know you have quoted in your book and

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
[Amit Varma]: that is also a great book.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Quote, people tend to think

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
[Amit Varma]: India with its more than 1.3 billion

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
[Amit Varma]: people is having a tremendously large

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
[Amit Varma]: population and indeed many Indians

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
[Amit Varma]: as well as foreigners see it this way.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
[Amit Varma]: But genetically this is an incorrect

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
[Amit Varma]: way to view the situation.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
[Amit Varma]: The Han Chinese are truly a large population

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
[Amit Varma]: they have been mixing freely for thousands of

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
[Amit Varma]: years. In contrast there are

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
[Amit Varma]: few if any Indian groups that are

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
[Amit Varma]: demographically very large and the

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
[Amit Varma]: degree of genetic differentiation

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
[Amit Varma]: between Indian Jati groups living

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
[Amit Varma]: side by side in the same village

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
[Amit Varma]: is typically 2 or 3 times

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
[Amit Varma]: higher than the genetic differentiation

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
[Amit Varma]: between Northern and Southern Europeans.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
[Amit Varma]: The truth is that

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
[Amit Varma]: India is composed of

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
[Amit Varma]: a large number of small populations.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. And this is

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense very disturbing

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
[Amit Varma]: just as a picture of where we are today

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
[Amit Varma]: because this is not just true in a genetic

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
[Amit Varma]: sense, a large number of small populations.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
[Guest]: Yes and this is

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
[Guest]: the result of the last

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
[Guest]: 2000 years. We have a history

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
[Guest]: that is much larger

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
[Guest]: and as I put it, yeah

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
[Guest]: it is disheartening to read that

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
[Guest]: and but

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
[Guest]: the way I see it is

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
[Guest]: that we have to realise

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
[Guest]: that this was not inevitable

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
[Guest]: this was not the way we were going

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
[Guest]: even after all of the elements

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
[Guest]: of the Indian population groups were in

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
[Guest]: this was not the way we were going.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
[Guest]: So what happened around 100 CE

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
[Guest]: has to be seen as something

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
[Guest]: as a political development

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
[Guest]: and if it is a political development that

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
[Guest]: happened around then it can be

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
[Guest]: pushed back and can be

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
[Guest]: seen to be different. When you say

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
[Guest]: pushed back, I am not talking about laws and things

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
[Guest]: like that, that has already been done.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
[Guest]: But culturally. But I am saying our basic

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
[Guest]: understanding, why does it survive?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
[Guest]: Because our basic understanding

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
[Guest]: of how this population, how we are

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
[Guest]: put together hasn't

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
[Guest]: changed and that's what I hope this book will

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
[Guest]: change that our basic understanding

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
[Guest]: of who we are has to change

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
[Guest]: for this miss

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
[Guest]: for this reality to change

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
[Guest]: also that endogamy

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
[Guest]: has cost us and the cost is much

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
[Guest]: one of the cost we already know

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
[Guest]: because we talk about it because

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
[Guest]: a division like this prevents

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
[Guest]: people from reaching to the heights

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
[Guest]: of their competence and

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
[Guest]: to how far they can go because if you are saying

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
[Guest]: birth determines to a large extent

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
[Guest]: where you can go, we are saying

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
[Amit Varma]: no to a lot of

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean the human cost is incalculable, there is no question

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
[Guest]: yeah. The second part

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
[Guest]: is equally important which we may

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
[Guest]: not realize all the time

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
[Guest]: is that it's important for people

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
[Guest]: in any community, especially

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
[Guest]: in a locality

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
[Guest]: society's progress

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
[Guest]: and progress fast when they

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
[Guest]: take common action to the benefit of

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
[Guest]: everybody. But if the

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
[Guest]: structures are even within villages are such

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
[Guest]: that it is difficult

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
[Guest]: to take common action that would

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
[Guest]: benefit everybody because there are so many

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
[Guest]: divisions, then that's a

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
[Guest]: whole lot of positive things that we

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
[Guest]: are saying no to

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
[Guest]: and so the cost of this

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
[Guest]: we have to realize, only then will

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
[Guest]: I think we will get to

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
[Guest]: reversing this in a significant way

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
[Guest]: it's distressing to see how often

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
[Guest]: how inter-coming is still

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
[Guest]: a practice if you know

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
[Guest]: various research that is done in

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
[Guest]: marriage practices and things like that still shows

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
[Guest]: that it's a very dominant trend

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's not changing. It's embedded

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
[Amit Varma]: in our culture now no matter what the laws might say

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
[Amit Varma]: speaking of you know

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
[Amit Varma]: current modern politics

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
[Amit Varma]: why do these

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
[Amit Varma]: new findings

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
[Amit Varma]: get so much pushback

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
[Amit Varma]: like even you have been trolled so often on twitter

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
[Amit Varma]: for example

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
[Amit Varma]: you know why does it matter

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
[Amit Varma]: why do people in politics have a stake on

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
[Amit Varma]: whether the Aryans came this way or that way

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
[Amit Varma]: who was there first

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
[Amit Varma]: what is the original Indian culture

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
[Amit Varma]: what is the role of the Vedas

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
[Amit Varma]: why does all of this matter

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I imagine that look we are in the 21st century

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and it should not matter

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
[Amit Varma]: all of this is just of academic interest

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
[Amit Varma]: but no but these are like life

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
[Guest]: political questions why

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
[Guest]: that's right I think it's also interesting

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
[Guest]: to note that I know I consistently

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
[Guest]: talk about four large migrations

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
[Guest]: nobody has any problems with

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
[Guest]: three of them

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
[Guest]: there's nobody raises an

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
[Guest]: objection to saying no

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
[Guest]: we did not come from out of Africa

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
[Guest]: nobody says no there was no

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
[Guest]: Tamil is not

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
[Guest]: related to Ilam

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
[Guest]: we came from here there's nobody saying

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
[Guest]: any objection to any of the first

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
[Guest]: three migrations the only objection

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
[Guest]: is to only one of them

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
[Guest]: the Arya migration

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
[Guest]: and the reason I think is born out of a

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
[Guest]: misunderstanding that

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
[Guest]: our civilization is single source

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
[Guest]: and it is from

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
[Guest]: the Aryas, the Vedas, the Sanskrit

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
[Guest]: and if you say that came from

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
[Guest]: that was the result of a migration then you are saying

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
[Guest]: all of our culture is

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
[Guest]: imported that's wrong because

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
[Guest]: what the book argues is that

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
[Guest]: our civilization is a mixture of

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
[Guest]: multiple influences the

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
[Guest]: Harappan civilization is as much is

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
[Guest]: an earlier source is the first

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
[Guest]: source if you can say or at least

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
[Guest]: an earlier source of Indian civilization

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
[Guest]: which has left a large imprint on our

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
[Guest]: culture the Arya Sanskrit

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
[Guest]: Vedic tradition is a very important

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
[Guest]: constituent of the Indian civilization

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
[Guest]: but it is not the earliest

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
[Guest]: or the only one so you do not

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
[Guest]: need to be horrified if you say

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
[Guest]: like other migrations the Arya

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
[Guest]: also came as migrants about

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
[Guest]: 4000 to 3000 years ago

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
[Guest]: the second factor is that there is an

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
[Guest]: assumption that if you say they brought

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
[Guest]: into European languages then you are

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
[Guest]: saying the Vedas and the Sanskrit you know

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
[Guest]: all came from imported

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
[Guest]: in flat pack you know and then

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
[Guest]: recombined after

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
[Guest]: opening the package that's not true

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
[Guest]: the Sanskrit

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
[Guest]: and the Vedas almost all of it

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
[Guest]: is the result of interaction with people

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
[Guest]: who are already settled here and

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
[Guest]: that's not something that is foreign that is very much

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
[Guest]: that's how all of our things are

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
[Guest]: it is a mixture of different traditions

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
[Guest]: different ancestries different stories

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
[Guest]: so these two things

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
[Guest]: have to be these

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
[Guest]: fears have to be taken out of the picture

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: but that's only part of the problem

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
[Guest]: the other part of the problem is not out of

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
[Guest]: these fears but as

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
[Guest]: the British historian E.J.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
[Guest]: Hobsbawm said

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
[Guest]: the historian is to

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
[Guest]: nationalists but the opium

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
[Guest]: makers or poppy growers

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
[Guest]: are to heroin addicts

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
[Guest]: they provide the raw material that the market

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
[Guest]: needs. The market for nationalism

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
[Guest]: needs an idea

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
[Guest]: of identity

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
[Guest]: creation requires myths

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
[Guest]: about who we are

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
[Guest]: and what we are and there are myths

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
[Guest]: that are more

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
[Guest]: appealing for political purposes

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
[Guest]: and there are myths that are not that appealing to

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
[Guest]: political purposes or

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
[Guest]: reality that is not appealing to political

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
[Guest]: purposes. So I think

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
[Guest]: what this book tries

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
[Guest]: to do is that until now we did

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
[Guest]: not have solid

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
[Guest]: scientific data and evidence

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
[Guest]: to give clear answers to our

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
[Guest]: prehistory which is essentially where the

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
[Guest]: fundamental questions about the formation of our

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
[Guest]: population lie

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
[Guest]: now we have. So I hope

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
[Guest]: that discussions about

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
[Guest]: our population formation

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
[Guest]: and therefore everything else that follows

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
[Guest]: will begin to be

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
[Guest]: based on actual scientific

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
[Guest]: data and findings

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
[Guest]: rather than

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
[Guest]: myths, fancies and

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
[Guest]: caricatures of reality.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I find it

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
[Amit Varma]: bizarre that there are some nationalistic narratives

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that are so simplistic that they

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
[Amit Varma]: place value judgments on what came

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
[Amit Varma]: earlier or what originated here

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
[Amit Varma]: or what came from outside. I mean it doesn't

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
[Amit Varma]: matter we are all from Africa

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and we are all basically a Khichri

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
[Amit Varma]: and your book in that

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
[Amit Varma]: sense by summing up the

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
[Amit Varma]: dramatic advances that

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
[Amit Varma]: science has made in the last 6 years

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
[Amit Varma]: both gave me a lot of joy and a lot of hope. Thank you

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
[Guest]: so much for coming on the show Tommy. It was a pleasure

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you very much. I really liked this conversation.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
[Amit Varma]: You can follow me at

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
[Amit Varma]: You can follow me at

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and you can browse past

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
[Amit Varma]: episodes of The Seen and the Unseen

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
[Amit Varma]: on seenunseen.in and thinkpragati.com

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:18.000
[Unknown]: Thank you for listening.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:36.000
[Unknown]: Thank you for listening.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
[Unknown]: Thank you for listening.
