00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
[Guest]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.120
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I woke up and found that I was not on my bed.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.040
[Amit Varma]: No, instead I was curled up in what appeared to be a box.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.280
[Amit Varma]: I was curled up like a little kitten inside this box and the top was closed and the bottom

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.040
[Amit Varma]: was closed and three sides were closed.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.520
[Amit Varma]: And on one side, just one side, there was a window with thick transparent glass.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.580
[Amit Varma]: I blinked a few times and peered out through this window.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.360
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side, I saw a family of four sitting in a living room, staring at me.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.560
[Amit Varma]: There were four of them, mummy, daddy, one boy, one girl, they were all staring at me.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.440
[Amit Varma]: I wondered what was going on.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.320
[Amit Varma]: I shouted, hey, help me, let me out of here.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm trapped inside this box.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.880
[Amit Varma]: The boy giggled, mummy-ji smiled, daddy-ji looked stern as if he was not amused.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.360
[Amit Varma]: None of them moved.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.440
[Amit Varma]: All of them kept staring at me.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.760
[Amit Varma]: The boy reached out his grubby hand for some popcorn.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't understand this, I shouted.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm trapped in this box, let me out.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360
[Amit Varma]: How can you just watch?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.920
[Amit Varma]: None of them moved and this time, none of them smiled also, as if this was amusing no

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
[Amit Varma]: Then I noticed a mirror on the wall behind them.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And in that mirror, I saw all of them from behind, sitting and watching a television.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.760
[Amit Varma]: And my alarmed face was in that television.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.480
[Amit Varma]: I was trapped inside the television.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
[Amit Varma]: What the hell, I shouted, let me out of here.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Why am I on television, I mean in television, whatever, let me out, let me out.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.520
[Amit Varma]: I started banging on the screen of the television, from inside of course.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Then daddy-ji got up.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.840
[Amit Varma]: He said to his family, it is appalling, what is this nonsense?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.600
[Amit Varma]: The quality of Indian television has become so bad.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.200
[Amit Varma]: In saying that, he pointed the remote control at me and everything turned black.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.160
[Amit Varma]: I lay there sobbing silently, trapped in the darkness.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.360
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.040
[Amit Varma]: If you can hear these words, you are obviously listening to this podcast and I want to congratulate

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.940
[Amit Varma]: you for your wise choice.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: You could have been doing something worse with your time.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.600
[Amit Varma]: You could have been watching Indian television.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, all of us bemoan the quality of our television, but we often assume that it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.720
[Amit Varma]: is a cultural issue.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: It has nothing to do with economics or government regulation.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Well, recently I read this excellent piece in the Hindustan Times with the headline,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.800
[Amit Varma]: Why are Indian news channels so disappointing?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.680
[Amit Varma]: It was written by Ashok Malik and in his piece, he explained how price controls imposed by

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.680
[Amit Varma]: the government on how much channels can charge their subscribers transformed the incentives

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.920
[Amit Varma]: of the channels.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.560
[Amit Varma]: In the case of the news channels, it led to a race to the bottom, but it affected all

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.440
[Amit Varma]: other TV programming as well.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.200
[Amit Varma]: Children's channels, for example, ran crappy reruns instead of investing in quality indigenous

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200
[Amit Varma]: content.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.660
[Amit Varma]: Well, Ashok is a renowned columnist and writer.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.160
[Amit Varma]: He won the Padma Shri last year for his journalism.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.280
[Amit Varma]: He's currently a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
[Amit Varma]: Besides being a prolific columnist, I'm delighted that he's agreed to join me on the scene and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.360
[Amit Varma]: the unseen today to discuss Indian television.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the show, Ashok.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
[Guest]: Hi, Amit.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
[Guest]: Looking forward to this.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Ashok, when back in the day when you and I grew up in the 70s and 80s and so on, we got

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.120
[Amit Varma]: a lot of our knowledge about India and about our culture and so on from things like Amachitra

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120
[Amit Varma]: Katha.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.680
[Amit Varma]: And kids today, of course, don't read Amachitra Katha and things like that.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.760
[Amit Varma]: They watch television all the time.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Can they get the same kind of learnings that we did from television?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.800
[Guest]: You know, that's a very interesting question you've touched upon.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.000
[Guest]: And it's something which I've been thinking about for a long time because I have two young

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.200
[Guest]: children who watch a lot of television, who are inquisitive young children, but who don't

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.520
[Guest]: read as much as, say, you and I did when we were growing up.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.040
[Guest]: And whether it's Amachitra Katha or the Nehru Bal Pustakale, we had access to a great amount

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.800
[Guest]: of published material on Indian history and heritage.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.880
[Guest]: Not all of it was perfect, but it was still very, very useful and educative.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.400
[Guest]: The television equivalent, frankly, does not exist.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.520
[Guest]: In fact, today's children don't even watch Disney.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.560
[Guest]: They watch reruns of Japanese cartoons because 30 or 20 year old Japanese cartoons are most

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.460
[Guest]: easily and inexpensively available to television studios.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.680
[Guest]: They are imported from Japan or elsewhere and reruns of them are telecast over and over

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
[Guest]: again.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.080
[Guest]: And all our kids end up watching that.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.960
[Guest]: To run a serious, well-produced national geographic type or even semi-national geographic type

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.520
[Guest]: channel in any language in India, English or regional, depicting Indian history, culture,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.040
[Guest]: and the richness of this country, the diversity of this country, is very, very difficult because

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880
[Guest]: such programming costs money.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.120
[Guest]: Such programming would require using animation and graphics, which ironically is produced

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.600
[Guest]: in India, but produced by companies that are outsourcing firms for Hollywood filmmakers.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.640
[Guest]: But they can't do the same work in India for children's programming or heritage programming

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.480
[Guest]: for Indian television because there just isn't a market for it.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.960
[Guest]: Channels tell you we can't recover money from our subscribers or consumers because they

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.680
[Guest]: are price caps and the market is structured in such a manner that even if I want to pay

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.840
[Guest]: a hundred rupees for a channel of this nature, I can't.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.820
[Guest]: And so you end up getting, frankly, rubbish programming on television for children.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.520
[Guest]: You get endless reruns of Japanese cartoons, some of which are good, some of which are

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520
[Amit Varma]: just rubbish.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.800
[Amit Varma]: So I want to shift for a moment from children's television, which we'll come back to and talk

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.000
[Amit Varma]: about news channels.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the reason I invited you on this show for this episode was this excellent piece

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.920
[Amit Varma]: you wrote for the Hindustan Times a few days ago, and where you spoke about how our news

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.400
[Amit Varma]: channels are now, quote, increasingly part of the entertainment economy rather than the

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.800
[Amit Varma]: information ecosystem, unquote.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'd like to quote a paragraph from you just to give a sense of what that's like.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think all the listeners will pretty much agree with all of this, it'll strike

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080
[Amit Varma]: a chord.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.880
[Amit Varma]: Quote, why are Indian news channels so astonishingly disappointing?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.840
[Amit Varma]: They oscillate between over-the-top studio debates and relatively sober studio debates.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.160
[Amit Varma]: There is rarely deep reportage, documentaries are practically unheard of, spending on editorial

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.280
[Amit Varma]: and news gathering scares management's, preference is given to paying some talking head a few

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.760
[Amit Varma]: thousand rupees to scream for 30 minutes.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.960
[Amit Varma]: What is at the root of this?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.100
[Amit Varma]: Question mark, unquote.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.360
[Amit Varma]: And what you go on to speak about being at the root of this is, in fact, common to white

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.640
[Amit Varma]: children's television is so messed up and entertainment television is so messed up.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And that's what I'd like you to elaborate on.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
[Guest]: Okay.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.520
[Guest]: There are two or three things that are wrong with news channels in my experience.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.640
[Guest]: One, of course, it is a lack of imagination of editorial leaders and journalists.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.400
[Guest]: Television in India, perhaps in the West as well, has been reduced to one reductionist

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.840
[Guest]: idea, right versus left.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.320
[Guest]: So Kumle has a fight with Kohli, let's make it right versus left.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.120
[Guest]: That's the Ayodhya issue, let's make it right versus left, which makes sense, because that

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.280
[Guest]: is a right versus left issue.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.680
[Guest]: But Kumle versus Kohli is not a right versus left issue, but we end up converting everything

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.840
[Guest]: into a right versus left issue, because that's the only reductionist model television seems

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840
[Guest]: to know.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.520
[Guest]: So every evening you get two right-wingers, two left-wingers getting to scream at each

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.920
[Guest]: other over any issue.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.340
[Guest]: But why aren't managements willing to spend on news gathering, on editorials, on sending

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.960
[Guest]: out correspondence to not just parts of the world, but parts of India?

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.920
[Guest]: Again, that is because we have legislated the subscription model to death in India.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.880
[Guest]: When we were growing up and reading newspapers, there was this hope that one day you'd be

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.800
[Guest]: able to produce a magazine or a newspaper that wasn't aiming at a mass circulation,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.280
[Guest]: that wasn't aiming at half a million or 250,000 buyers or readers, but was aimed at maybe

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.200
[Guest]: 20,000 high-quality readers, and would charge 100 rupees rather than 50 rupees or 20 rupees

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.560
[Guest]: per copy.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.800
[Guest]: This is really the economist model, because you spend a lot of money buying The Economist,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.580
[Guest]: irrespective of whether you live in Minnesota or Meerut.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.480
[Guest]: But you read it because, well, The Economist has seen better days, but you read or read

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.220
[Guest]: The Economist because it gave you a certain value.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.160
[Guest]: This model did not exist in India because our newspapers and magazines had an advertiser-driven

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
[Guest]: model.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.460
[Guest]: But that was a conscious decision newspaper managements took as private sector entities.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:09.880
[Guest]: In the case of television, the same model now exists, but it's been mandated by the

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.880
[Guest]: state.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.920
[Guest]: So, I'm not suggesting that news channel managements would not have taken the same

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920
[Guest]: route.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920
[Guest]: They may well have.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.960
[Guest]: But here, they don't even have a choice.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:25.040
[Guest]: Because TRAI, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which is a telecom regulator, it's

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.160
[Guest]: not a content manager, has been given the job over the past 12 odd years, I think, since

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:38.320
[Guest]: 2005 or 2006, of setting price caps on the bouquet you can buy from your DGH provider

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.680
[Guest]: or your cable provider or whoever delivers television channels to your house.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:53.280
[Guest]: And they have priced it ridiculously low, without any understanding of what content

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.920
[Guest]: cost or what it takes to produce content.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:04.860
[Guest]: And so, Balaji Telefilms rerunning old soap operas, cost of content zero, because they

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.600
[Guest]: all exist already.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.680
[Guest]: And Amit Verma and Ashok Malik setting up a high quality news channel that wants to

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.280
[Guest]: send correspondence from everywhere from Iraq to America, which would cost a king's ransom.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.160
[Guest]: We will both be under a ridiculous price cap.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.480
[Guest]: And we will not be able to charge viewers what they would perhaps be willing to pay

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.000
[Guest]: for a high quality news channel.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.080
[Guest]: And this is true for not just news, it's true for entertainment as well.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.760
[Guest]: Because in the West, something like 70% of revenue for channels across the board comes

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:47.720
[Guest]: from subscribers, 30% comes from advertisers.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:55.440
[Guest]: In India, it's the reverse, 36% comes from subscribers and 64% from advertisers.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:02.420
[Guest]: In the case of news channels in India, just 10% of revenue comes from subscribers.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.640
[Guest]: So most channels have simply given up on subscription and said, the figures are so ridiculously

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640
[Guest]: low.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.040
[Guest]: We may as well make our channel free and not even chase subscribers for those five rupees

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.640
[Guest]: or 10 rupees or whatever.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.640
[Guest]: Make it free.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.720
[Guest]: Let's make it part of the entertainment economy.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.880
[Guest]: Let's entertain our viewers and get ads.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.720
[Guest]: And so every evening, whether it's a right wing channel or a left wing channel or a center

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.640
[Guest]: channel or whatever you want to call it, it's all equally disappointing for a country of

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:34.240
[Guest]: such diversity, richness, intellectual depth, and media consumption.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.040
[Amit Varma]: And typically, I imagine how a media market would work is that if there is a news channel

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.480
[Amit Varma]: or an entertainment channel, which doesn't necessarily want to be broad based, but which

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.060
[Amit Varma]: wants to appeal to a specific niche with specific tastes, all they would really have to do is

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.080
[Amit Varma]: figure out a price point which that niche is willing to pay for that content.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And then if it is feasible, then produce content according to that.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.440
[Amit Varma]: And what you're essentially saying is what these price caps do is they make that impossible.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.120
[Amit Varma]: You can't charge over a certain number.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.140
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, even if there is a niche which is willing to pay more for higher quality

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.600
[Amit Varma]: content or even content of a particular type, they can't do that.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the channels, especially the news channels, are forced to just apply to

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.660
[Amit Varma]: the you know, take the easy way out, be lazy, not spend too much money on news gathering.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.240
[Amit Varma]: Just pick up the you know, hot burning hashtag of the day from Twitter and set a debate around

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.400
[Amit Varma]: that and take the easy way out.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.400
[Guest]: Precisely.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:34.000
[Guest]: Now, let me again clarify that our newspapers and magazines do not have the burden of price

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.960
[Guest]: caps, but they have not followed the subscription route, they've stuck to the advertiser mass

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.220
[Guest]: circulation route.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.240
[Guest]: But that I hope that is disappointing as well.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.480
[Guest]: That is a conscious decision taken by private sector managements.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.600
[Guest]: In the case of television, maybe the management should have taken the same decision all along,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.860
[Guest]: I'm not denying that.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:02.480
[Guest]: But there is a state or TRAI cap, which is what makes this different from what print

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.480
[Guest]: is doing.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.380
[Guest]: What print is doing is also unforgivable.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.880
[Guest]: But here in this case, there is a price cap in the case of television or in the case of

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.800
[Guest]: news television in particular.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.560
[Guest]: And that is actually astonishing because it means that even if somebody wants to set up

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:27.080
[Guest]: a serious entertainment or children's programming, or of course, news channel, he finds he or

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.520
[Guest]: she finds the market and market conditions impossible to deal with, the TRAI will come

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.880
[Guest]: in the way of, of that actually happening.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880
[Amit Varma]: So here's my question for you.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these price caps happened some 15-16 years ago, right?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.560
[Amit Varma]: So what was sort of the thinking behind them and who are the interest groups that benefit

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.560
[Guest]: from these price caps?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.760
[Guest]: You know, what happened was in the early 1990s, when whole neighborhoods in our big cities

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.760
[Guest]: began to be wired up using cable networks, the local cable operator was your local goon,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.640
[Guest]: who actually jumped from building to building, almost literally, with a wire and wired up

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
[Guest]: whole cities.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.840
[Guest]: Now, over the years, some of those networks became consolidated, became semi respectable

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.440
[Guest]: businesses, but the cable business broadly, in this country remains one run by musclemen,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.880
[Guest]: local, local thugs, local political fixers, and so on and so forth.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.040
[Guest]: So the idea back then, a very noble idea was that you must have a uniform pricing strategy

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:32.600
[Guest]: so that a cable operator in neighborhood X, where access and competition is limited, will

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:39.280
[Guest]: not be able to profiteer and cheat a consumer, as opposed to a cable operator in neighborhood

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.520
[Guest]: Z, where there is more competition and access is easier.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.840
[Guest]: So that sounds a very good idea, and you need to have a market regulator, and the market

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.360
[Guest]: regulator has to keep cable operators or DTH providers and so on and so forth under control.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.440
[Guest]: That makes perfect sense.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:03.960
[Guest]: But the mechanism that TRAI and the government adopted was to set price caps on channels,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.200
[Guest]: because or rather price caps on bouquets of channels offered by cable operators and other

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.380
[Guest]: service providers, and that in effect became a price cap on a channel.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:19.320
[Guest]: So in preventing or attempting to prevent the cable operator from cheating the consumer,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.760
[Guest]: which is a legitimate aspiration and something which needs to be done, you ended up telling

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.720
[Guest]: the channel that you can't charge above a certain price.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.760
[Guest]: And if you can't charge above a certain price, I don't care whether your content costs less

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.740
[Guest]: than that price or more than that price, I'm not going to allow you to charge above that.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:44.160
[Guest]: So you wanted to regulate the cable operator, you ended up punishing the creative economy,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: or in this case, the news media space.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.160
[Guest]: And we left 10 years on the line with, frankly, completely disappointing and rubbish news

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.280
[Guest]: television.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.560
[Guest]: So a well-meaning bureaucratic intervention, like many well-meaning bureaucratic interventions,

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.900
[Guest]: years down the line leads to something very, very different.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.040
[Amit Varma]: So they essentially wanted to control the cable mafias and what instead, the unseen

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.440
[Amit Varma]: effect, however, was that the quality of television suffered and consumers suffered and that whole

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.800
[Amit Varma]: paternalistic thinking behind price caps, which if something is valuable, let's make

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800
[Amit Varma]: sure it's not too expensive.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.060
[Guest]: Yes, you see a dumbing down of television across the board, again, not just news.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest]: So you actually have consumers who are spending much more on, let's say, a Netflix or various

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.760
[Guest]: platforms that they access using the net, they're spending much more on one month subscription

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.560
[Guest]: of any one of those platforms than they do, perhaps in a year subscription of cable or

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560
[Guest]: DTH.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560
[Guest]: Absolutely, I mean,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.640
[Guest]: And they don't end up watching cable or DTH.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.760
[Guest]: So who suffers?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.680
[Guest]: The Indian channels don't get the high quality viewers they want, they don't get satisfaction

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.400
[Guest]: from producing content that is truly world class, or even respectable.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:03.160
[Guest]: And they're losing their key subscribers or viewers, really, to digital.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Which is crazy.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.720
[Amit Varma]: And like, just speaking for myself, I spent 650 a month on my Netflix subscription.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.120
[Amit Varma]: I think my Hotstar comes to about 100 bucks a month or whatever.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.140
[Amit Varma]: And the fact is, all this money could have been going to Indian channels, if they had

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.120
[Amit Varma]: actually been able to spend money on content acquisition, which they would have been able

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.040
[Amit Varma]: to if they'd been allowed to charge prices for it, because at some point or the other,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.480
[Amit Varma]: this niche that exists, which Netflix and Hotstar have now jumped upon and Amazon Prime

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.160
[Amit Varma]: have jumped upon, would have been available to our channels much earlier, except they

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.440
[Amit Varma]: weren't allowed to reach this niche.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.840
[Amit Varma]: So to carry on from there, my further question then is that if this is how things are, what

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.000
[Amit Varma]: hope do you have that things will change?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.100
[Amit Varma]: What can drive change?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.240
[Amit Varma]: What can drive, say, TRAI to remove these price caps?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.080
[Amit Varma]: What are the interest groups in play that would now prevent it from happening?

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.400
[Amit Varma]: What's in the way of change?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:18:01.080
[Guest]: Well, I guess the cable operators will be one very strong lobby to resist this because

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.880
[Guest]: they would not want agency taken from them and moving on to either subscribers or to

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.160
[Guest]: channels themselves.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.640
[Guest]: But frankly, digital technology is changing everything because digital is just one more

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.380
[Guest]: way of delivering content like wired cable is.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.400
[Guest]: So either you bring both of them under price caps, which is completely ridiculous because

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.440
[Guest]: I don't think Netflix would want to be under TRAI price cap, either you bring them both

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.200
[Guest]: under price caps, or you free them both.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.360
[Guest]: It doesn't make sense otherwise, you know, technology has raced ahead of all of us.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:44.420
[Guest]: So you can't decide that I will have price caps on content delivered through one pipe,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.840
[Guest]: but no price caps on content delivered through another pipe.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.440
[Amit Varma]: That's in a sense, that's analogous to what's happening with Uber and black and yellow cabs,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.040
[Amit Varma]: that you had, you know, black and yellow cabs, the supply restricted with, you know, licensing

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.400
[Amit Varma]: regulations and so on, price ceilings and so on.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.600
[Amit Varma]: And that market has been completely disrupted with Uber and now you can't turn the clock

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.760
[Amit Varma]: back and the same thing seems to be happening in terms of audiovisual content.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:14.120
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, obviously, Uber is a slightly different example, but yes, I get what you're

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.160
[Guest]: trying to say.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:22.240
[Guest]: But here, digital has completely changed the market anyway.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.480
[Guest]: Digital has also had a collateral impact in that, it's thanks to the internet release

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.360
[Guest]: so much of free content online, some of it dubious and some of it fake, but much of it

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.320
[Guest]: not fake, but still available free.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest]: That the news business in India, that the model of the news business in India is under

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.680
[Guest]: serious interrogation anyway, even without this price cap nonsense.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:55.120
[Guest]: So frankly, I don't know whether the news television business in India can now be rescued

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.720
[Guest]: because even if price caps are lifted, people have got used to this opium or this opiate

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.900
[Guest]: of free content.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:09.680
[Guest]: And once you get used to that, it takes a long time and a lot of trust for you to go

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.840
[Guest]: back to a subscription-based model, where you will pay a good amount of money every

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.080
[Guest]: month with the assurance that the person you're paying that money to will deliver quality

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: content and will not just deliver quality content for one month and then change his

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.380
[Guest]: or her mind.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:32.280
[Guest]: So I'm afraid much of the debate we're having today, I wish we'd had it three or four years

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.080
[Guest]: ago, five or six years ago, I think the advent of the internet and the ferocious rollout

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:44.920
[Guest]: of digital technologies and online platforms may have put much of this debate behind us.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.440
[Guest]: And the news business in India may be under a very serious threat.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.200
[Unknown]: Some of our news channels may be beyond being rescued.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And just speaking of myself, though, you know, a counter view to that would be that I don't

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.960
[Amit Varma]: watch any news television at all, I simply can't stand to.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.520
[Amit Varma]: However, if there was an intelligent news channel, I might give it a shot.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore there is a niche so you know, you never know if you remove the price caps,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680
[Guest]: what could happen.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.400
[Guest]: I'm actually more hopeful for, for radio opening up for news.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:22.080
[Guest]: Because you see, news on television ends up being not what you hear, but what you watch.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.880
[Guest]: So people need to be dressed up, people need to be good looking people need to be all sorts

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.000
[Guest]: of stuff which you don't need to be, if you really asked me, but radio can have you and

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.400
[Guest]: me sitting in whatever shorts and jeans in our homes or wherever we are, or in the studio,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.680
[Guest]: having a conversation.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:47.920
[Guest]: And it's also a less expensive platform or delivery mechanism than television because

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.640
[Guest]: it simply requires less equipment.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:22:01.380
[Guest]: I'm actually hopeful for private radio, news shows, news commentaries, news discussions.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.000
[Guest]: Not just news per se, because news per se is not easily available.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.440
[Guest]: But it's what happens after the news break, which is really what we're talking about.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.280
[Guest]: And whether we can get something more intelligent than just four people screaming at each other

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.840
[Guest]: every evening at 9pm.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.440
[Guest]: So I'm hopeful radio will, will do some of that magic.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.400
[Amit Varma]: Ashok, what you're saying is absolutely music to my ears.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And if you could see what I'm wearing now, I think you'd know exactly why.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Ashok, thanks for doing this, man.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.520
[Amit Varma]: I really appreciate this.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.440
[Amit Varma]: To read Ashok's piece, which inspired this episode, search for an article titled Why

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.680
[Amit Varma]: Are Indian News Channels So Disappointing in the Hindustan Times.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.480
[Amit Varma]: You can also follow Ashok on Twitter at Malik Ashok.
