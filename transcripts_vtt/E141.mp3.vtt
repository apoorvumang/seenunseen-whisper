00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of the scene in the unseen, I have a recommendation for you.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Do check out Pulya Bazi, hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Kotesane,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.040
[Amit Varma]: two really good friends of mine. Kick-ass podcast in Hindi. It's amazing.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: More than a decade ago, in 2007, I wrote a column with the title The Matunga Racket.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
[Amit Varma]: The Matunga Racket was a scam run by the police that a gay friend of mine told me about.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.960
[Amit Varma]: This was how it functioned. Cops would go to this online messaging board for gay people.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.840
[Amit Varma]: This was in the days before smartphones and Grindr. A cop would pretend that he was looking

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.640
[Amit Varma]: to hook up. He would lure his victim to Dadar railway station at a particular time.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.120
[Amit Varma]: A plainclothes cop would complete the rendezvous and be joined by other cops,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: who would then drag their unsuspecting victim, some poor bloke who wanted nothing more than

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.160
[Amit Varma]: a memorable consensual encounter, and take him to King Circle police station. There,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.720
[Amit Varma]: they would threaten to book him under section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which effectively

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.680
[Amit Varma]: made homosexual sex illegal. If he was a young man, as he often was, they could even threaten

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.480
[Amit Varma]: to call his parents. Then they would make him empty his pockets, and often they'd take him

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.600
[Amit Varma]: to a nearby ATM, force him to use his ATM card, and take as much as they wanted.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.800
[Amit Varma]: The point of that column of mine was to talk about the criminalizing of victimless crimes

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640
[Amit Varma]: with laws like 377, then used by the cops as a tool for extortion. What is the police after all,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.480
[Amit Varma]: but a legal mafia with a monopoly on violence. Now, since section 377 is no longer on the books,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.560
[Amit Varma]: you'd imagine that we've solved that particular problem. Not really. Gay people in India may not

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.320
[Amit Varma]: be terrorized by a bad law, but they are still shackled by social attitudes that look upon

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.400
[Amit Varma]: homosexuality as a dangerous aberration, even a disease, and many young people grow up with guilt

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.680
[Amit Varma]: about their secret desires, a guilt that should be as unnecessary as, say, guilt about being left

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.640
[Amit Varma]: handed. Millions of people in our country carry this burden with them every day, this burden of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.520
[Amit Varma]: shame when there should be no shame, this burden of hiding something about yourself from a family

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.400
[Amit Varma]: that otherwise embraces you as you are. Those born to privilege can find ways of escaping this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.160
[Amit Varma]: burden. But most gay people in this country, even if they now do not have a law dangling over their

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.400
[Unknown]: heads, still spend their lives in prison. Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.360
[Unknown]: on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen. My guest today is my friend Vivek Tejuja, who has just

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.920
[Amit Varma]: come out with his first book. So now you know, growing up gay in India. This is a charming

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.680
[Amit Varma]: memoir of growing up gay in India. And while it's written in a deceptively breezy, lighthearted way,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.160
[Amit Varma]: I also found it to be a deeply moving book. Vivek and I have met just a handful of times,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.280
[Amit Varma]: and our online friendship is actually based on a love of books. Vivek makes his living writing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.880
[Amit Varma]: about books and his transparent, infectious love for books has often made me rush to Amazon right

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.080
[Amit Varma]: after reading a review or a tweet by him. So some of our conversation today will be about the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.560
[Amit Varma]: literature and poetry that we enjoy. But much of it will be about the brilliant book that he's just

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.720
[Amit Varma]: written. Before I begin chatting with Vivek, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Did you know that Parsis in Mumbai, instead of being left at the Tower of Silence after they die,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.600
[Amit Varma]: are now cremated? And why? Because a cow fell sick in the early 1990s? Did you know that the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.720
[Amit Varma]: smog in Delhi is caused by something that farmers in Punjab do, and that there's no way to stop

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.800
[Amit Varma]: them? Did you know that there wasn't one gas tragedy in Bhopal, but three? One of them was

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.560
[Amit Varma]: seen but two were unseen? Did you know that many well-intentioned government policies hurt the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.320
[Amit Varma]: people they're supposed to help? Why was demonetization a bad idea? How should GST have

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.080
[Amit Varma]: been implemented? Why are all our politicians so corrupt when not all of them are bad people?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm Amit Verma, and in my weekly podcast, The Seen and the Unseen, I take a shot at answering

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.920
[Amit Varma]: all these questions and many more. I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.280
[Amit Varma]: of public policy and private action. I speak to experts on economics, political philosophy,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.800
[Amit Varma]: cognitive neuroscience and constitutional law, so that the insights can blow not only my mind,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.640
[Amit Varma]: but also yours. The Seen and the Unseen releases every Monday. So do check out the archives and

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.920
[Guest]: Hey, hi, Amit. Thanks. Thanks. Happy to be here.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.920
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about how this book came about.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.520
[Guest]: So, you know, in 2009, about 10 years ago, I was just working on a couple of chapters. And

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.960
[Guest]: it just started with the memory of which is also there in the book of me and a couple of gay men

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.560
[Guest]: going to Gorai for a trip. And at that time, like you mentioned, it was totally unheard of for

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.720
[Guest]: someone. And I just met one of them once. And I was so taken in by him and his charm. And it was

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.800
[Guest]: not even him that I chatted with online, I chatted with a friend of his that I wasn't interested in.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.400
[Guest]: And he introduced me to this fellow, Tori, and I absolutely got taken in by him. And I was like,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.560
[Guest]: okay, you know what, let's do this. Let's go on a trip. And that trip memory, which is in detail in

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.600
[Guest]: the book just evoked the chapter that I first wrote. And then I just started writing chapter

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.560
[Guest]: after chapter. And this was then shelved for 10 years or more. 10 years, yeah, a little less than

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.080
[Guest]: 10 years still. The book was supposed to be a young adult fiction book with another publisher,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.600
[Guest]: who then decided not to publish it in the memoir form, because they had some objection. And then

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.600
[Guest]: the book went to HarperCollins, my editor Udayan picked it up and he loved it. And that's how this

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.360
[Guest]: book came to be. And that's how I wrote this book. And I added more chapters to those chapters.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.440
[Guest]: So yeah, and so it's a very short book. So yeah. Yeah, I enjoyed reading it thoroughly. I mean,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.120
[Amit Varma]: my only criticism, as I told you was that it was too short. It got over when I was just

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.160
[Amit Varma]: settled in. And I thought, okay, a little more of it would have been really nice. Did you always

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.120
[Guest]: kind of want to be a writer or? No, actually, but in a way, it was just one of those very

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.360
[Guest]: lofty dreams that one has, while growing up, when you read other books, and you are so taken in by

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.680
[Guest]: the love of literature that you're like, okay, one day, I'm going to be a writer. So the story

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.400
[Guest]: there is that my father gifted me and he didn't even realize what he was gifting me. I was about

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.600
[Guest]: 14, 15. And he handed me a book called Sisters by Shobha Dey. Okay, I don't know what this is,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.560
[Guest]: but it just felt close to home, not because of the affluence, but just because they had an Indian

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.560
[Guest]: characters. It had Indian sex, it had everything. And I was like, okay. And then I finished the book

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.080
[Guest]: and at the end of the book I had written, one day I want to be published. You know, I want to write

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.520
[Guest]: and then that's how it came about. And this was way back in 1998-1997. What do you mean Indian

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.680
[Guest]: sex? Sex between Indian characters or something specific? Sex between Indian characters and I

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.840
[Guest]: never read it in a book. Nobody used to write books like these where there was sex between

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.840
[Guest]: two characters and Shobha Dey was all out and I actually enjoyed her after that. I actually read

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.120
[Guest]: all her books. And I was like, why am I reading this shit after a couple of years? But then you

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.200
[Amit Varma]: know what, it's good shit. So I loved it. It's good shit in a sense, she is delightfully

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.720
[Guest]: unpretentious. There are no literary airs or illusions. And I wanted to write in the same

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.360
[Guest]: vein. And that's why this book is so simple. Because it's not. I'm glad that it also ends

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:18.560
[Amit Varma]: when it ends because I intended it to be short. Let's kind of go to the book and the subject of

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.520
[Amit Varma]: the book and kind of growing up gay. And, you know, I'd done an episode before on this with

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.360
[Amit Varma]: Naveen Nirona, who of course hosts the podcast Keeping it Queer, even you've done an episode

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.400
[Amit Varma]: with him, which we'll link from the show notes. So growing up, I mean, one of the interesting

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.000
[Amit Varma]: things I found about your book was that you were also sort of born to privilege in a sense,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and aware of that privilege. Oh, yes, completely. And how did you know, when did you become aware

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.520
[Guest]: of being gay, that there was a difference? I think I was eight. Honestly, I was about

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.960
[Guest]: eight or nine. And I would watch these videos. Or I would watch there would be cassettes brought

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.640
[Guest]: at home of Hindi movies or Bollywood. And I remember watching a movie of Vinod Khanna in it.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.840
[Guest]: And he was shirtless on the beach in his trunks. And it was Gurbani, I think. And I fell in love

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.400
[Guest]: with what I saw. I fell in lust, actually. I don't know at nine if you can fall in lust.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.080
[Guest]: But I knew that, you know, I couldn't care about a Zeenat Aman in a bikini. I mean,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.160
[Guest]: it just didn't matter. And then just incidents and instances kept getting piled on one after

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.440
[Guest]: the other. And while boys in school were talking about girls, I was thinking about other boys,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.200
[Guest]: pretending to talk about girls. And I was like, Okay, I think I know. I didn't have a term for

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.600
[Guest]: it. I didn't know. It was homosexuality. I didn't know it was being gay. I didn't know any of that.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.880
[Guest]: I just knew that. Yeah. And I couldn't even ask or tell anyone. So it became a little difficult

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.680
[Amit Varma]: to give a name. Did you feel that? Oh, I mean, what's going on? There's something wrong with me?

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.880
[Guest]: Or? Oh, yeah, completely. Completely. I just wanted to fit to mainstream. Because everywhere

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.120
[Guest]: around you, as you grew up, you see heteronormativity. And that's what I wanted. I

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.880
[Guest]: wanted a wife. I wanted four kids. I wanted a house. I wanted a nine to five job. I wanted

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.040
[Guest]: everything that my father had. Until you saw Vinod Khanna without a shirt. Yeah. And I was like,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.640
[Guest]: Okay, now I don't think I didn't know whether I wanted him or I wanted the straight life,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.080
[Guest]: so to say. But but I guess over a period of time, with whatever you go through,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.120
[Guest]: and whatever you internal conflict, and you just figure along the way that you know,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.720
[Amit Varma]: this is what you want. And this is what you do not want. It's a kind of an overlap between these two

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.600
[Amit Varma]: phases, like one, because you're looking at your father, and you're looking at all the

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.640
[Amit Varma]: heteronormative stuff. And you're looking at Bollywood romances, and you're thinking,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Oh, okay, that's the way it's going to go. And then you discover this.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.200
[Guest]: So the only overlap was that, when I discovered and then as I went into my as I entered my teens,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.560
[Guest]: I just because of the heteronormativity, all I wanted to do was be a woman.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.040
[Guest]: I equated that there was a man and there's a woman. Right. So while being gay, I never thought

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.360
[Guest]: of it as two men. So at that time, now, of course, things are very different. You're more aware and

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.440
[Guest]: more aware and you read and you interact and you grow with the world, and the people around you.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.640
[Guest]: But at that time, it was just a dream to be married, even to another man without realizing

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.800
[Guest]: the laws without realizing. So this is the kind of privilege I'm talking about, right? You don't

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.560
[Guest]: was so mollycoddled, you're so cushioned, that you don't realize

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.800
[Guest]: you mentioned in your book, you were the Raja Beta.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.400
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, clearly. And, and it was sickening after a point, because then they just invaded

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.800
[Guest]: my life. They wanted to know everything, nothing was hidden, except for this one thing, which was

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.640
[Guest]: hidden for a very long time, till I came out at 18 in frustration, because a man rejected my

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.560
[Guest]: advances or rejected me. And I just didn't know what to do. I was so mad at him that I was like,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.440
[Guest]: okay, I was angry. And then I decided to come out.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.160
[Amit Varma]: You begin your book with an incident which you then allude to later, which is basically you saw

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.760
[Amit Varma]: the film Sarak and you were attracted to the character of Maharani.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.200
[Amit Varma]: No, I wasn't attracted to the character. But I quite liked what I watched on screen.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And then you went home and you imitated him and your uncle slapped you. Everybody was,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.840
[Amit Varma]: and you were stunned by that. And you've written in your book, quote, one incident is all it takes

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.080
[Amit Varma]: for you to not confide in your loved ones, stop quote. And from that point on, it's, it's like,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.320
[Amit Varma]: it's a secret. You can't even tell your family about it.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And you also, you know, you write in your book that Bollywood was a sort of a big influence on

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.400
[Amit Varma]: you. It had a big effect on you, which is very interesting, because one is a heteronormativity,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.600
[Amit Varma]: which you've pointed to that it will show male female relations in a typical cliched way.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.840
[Amit Varma]: And even there is basically it's not even healthy relationships. A lot of it is just

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.880
[Amit Varma]: toxic masculinity. All of it is very toxic. So it's just that one very toxic prism coming

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.920
[Amit Varma]: through even for women. And the other part of it was how they treat gay characters. So

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:14.640
[Amit Varma]: how was it for you where your big influences in your life are Bollywood, which is most of the

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.280
[Amit Varma]: popular culture that you're then consuming, and seeing how they treat gay characters after you

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.800
[Guest]: figure out that you're gay yourself?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.080
[Guest]: Yes, it was very problematic. Because in my head, then I didn't want to be associated with those

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.720
[Guest]: characters, which I've also mentioned in the book, like Pinku from Maskalandar or Maharani

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.600
[Guest]: from Sadak. Or even the way Dostana years and years later, when it came out, I was very,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest]: very upset with that movie, that how they were depicting. But then I also realized that

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.120
[Guest]: they don't know any better. And how Bollywood played a major role is because in my house,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.000
[Guest]: there was nothing but screen used to come as a newspaper, as a weekly newspaper then.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.440
[Guest]: And everybody would just read that. There were only Bollywood magazines, from Stardust to

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.680
[Guest]: Cineblitz to Filmfare and movie and it was just that. That was the consumption. And which is

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.680
[Guest]: until of course, my mother decided to put an end to that. And you know, while that was also going

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.680
[Guest]: on, she decided to involve me more in the world of books and literature. And that's where the

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:29.360
[Guest]: love began. But I think, and Bollywood upset me for a very long time. But then I decided that

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.560
[Guest]: I also wanted to be a part of the fantastical world. I want to be immersed in that fantasy so

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.200
[Guest]: desperately that you know, I wanted to probably just be with Akshay Kumar when I when I watched

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.720
[Guest]: him shirtless or also there were those other romantic ideas of how Rishi Kapoor was wooing

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.600
[Guest]: Sridevi in Chandni. Or how it was in Lamhe, you know, when you're pining for a lover.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.880
[Guest]: And you were a big Sridevi fan.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.720
[Guest]: Oh yeah, completely. Still am. And how you're pining for your lover and how,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.120
[Guest]: you know, you're longing, I think, I think it was just the feeling of longing.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.840
[Guest]: The romance.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.040
[Guest]: The romance, more than the romance, I think the unrequited love, because if one thing that game

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.480
[Guest]: and know most than most men out there is unrequited love. I mean, I could be wrong,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.240
[Guest]: but from personal experience, I feel is just so looming large or loomed large then.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.560
[Guest]: But but as you grow, you start seeing things with a different perspective, which helps.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what must just thinking aloud what must make that unrequited love a worse problem than it

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.920
[Amit Varma]: is for the toxic in cells who are among the straight men who otherwise roam our countryside

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.040
[Amit Varma]: is that the pool of available choices to you is far less like if I'm a straight person,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.680
[Amit Varma]: and I see and I'm attracted to a woman, you know, it's something that I can think about

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.280
[Amit Varma]: and consider. And it's fair game if you're both single. But for you, most men are also out of

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.960
[Amit Varma]: bounds. I mean, how do you even is that something that is a I mean, that goes beyond unrequited

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:10.400
[Guest]: love? It's just, I think maybe that's why we assert our sexuality so much. Like we want

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.440
[Guest]: other men to know at least wanted them to know that we are gay, that we are available,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.880
[Guest]: that we are single. I mean, the flamboyance and the assertion and the entire drama associated with

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:33.200
[Guest]: us comes from that latent to be seen, you know, and not to be unseen. To be seen to be visible,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.480
[Guest]: I think it is so important. Because in your head, how will people know that you're gay?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.640
[Guest]: How will a man then want to show interest in you? If he is gay? How do you how do you see the signs?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.280
[Guest]: Do you write it on your forehead and walk on the street? Do you sashay your hips when you're

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.880
[Guest]: walking? Do you do you show it in your talk? Do you be soft and genteel and a little high pitch

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.160
[Guest]: in your voice? How do you show like I remember somebody telling me that in Marine Drive people

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.960
[Guest]: used to wear white kerchiefs on their right wrist to indicate their sexuality and cruise that way

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:17.920
[Guest]: or you cruise and then you speak through eyes and you speak through expression and at right

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.840
[Guest]: opposite Taj Mahal, what Gateway of India wall used to be called the wall and people used to

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:32.720
[Guest]: cruise there. They used to cruise in every local platform loo. And that's when these cops used to

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:39.760
[Guest]: go masquerading online and then, you know, sort of nab them. We had only voodoo, which I've also

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:46.880
[Guest]: mentioned in the book. And then it is it was a crazy time because how and then coming back to

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:55.200
[Guest]: that, right, you just had to be seen to be able to get sex, love, or both in good combination or

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.600
[Guest]: anything that you wanted, like in the so called straight world or the heterosexual world. People

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.960
[Guest]: take it for granted, right? You see a woman or a woman sees you, you're seen to each other. Yeah,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:14.240
[Guest]: there's nothing like the unseen. But here you have to present yourselves. And that's when you know,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.200
[Guest]: from all your choices, the way you dress, to the way you talk, to the way you walk, to what you're

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.120
[Guest]: reading, to what interests you have to all of that, you want some way of signaling that you're

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:32.080
[Guest]: not interested in sports. So for the longest time, in the 90s, if you were a boy, you have to be

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.880
[Guest]: interested in sports. And the minute you're not, then something is wrong with you. And that wrong,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.960
[Guest]: I wanted to convert the advantage of being right for me, so that somebody could pick it up. And I

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.880
[Guest]: could perhaps be with that someone. But how do you signal a disinterest in sports? You make it very

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.800
[Guest]: clear. Yeah, you're very loud about it. Like with my parents, I was extremely clear. My mother used

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.840
[Guest]: to force me to go down and play a sport. But she's like, oh, sport leads to teamwork, it leads to

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.920
[Guest]: building character and blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, no, I'm just bored. It tires me and I don't

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.880
[Guest]: want to do this. I just want to be this lazy boy and sit at home and read. Which sounds like an

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.200
[Amit Varma]: excuse not of a gay man, but also a Bengali man. I mean, half Bengali. I mean, who wants to

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:23.040
[Guest]: do physical activity and sweat? I'm sorry, I don't want to perspire. I just don't I'm, I'm, I'm not,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.480
[Guest]: I'm just averse to the idea of my pores, emitting something that I don't want on my on my skin.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.800
[Amit Varma]: That's all. And you mentioned voodoo. And there's a nice quote about voodoo in your book, which I'll

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.840
[Amit Varma]: again read out, quote, voodoo makes you not want to look in the mirror. Once you get out from there,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.720
[Amit Varma]: there is this heavy sadness in the air, in the low ceiling, the expression that is still muted.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.040
[Amit Varma]: And with all the strangers, it doesn't make it much easier. Stop good and voodoo, of course,

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.480
[Amit Varma]: is this gay club that you went to to meet people and yet there was no option you all of you had to

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.360
[Guest]: be there because how else do you? Yeah, initially, till gay Bombay party started. And then you went

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.520
[Guest]: on and even there, there was such a class difference. Like there was something called

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.560
[Guest]: Salvation Star, which was just for the South Bombayites. Oh, and if you were say from

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.320
[Guest]: out of South Bombay, and you would come to that party,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.000
[Guest]: somehow they would sense you, I think they would smell you that you're not from South Bombay.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.640
[Guest]: The other. Yeah, the other and they would treat you like that.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.440
[Guest]: Well, and you would be shunned into a corner and nobody would show any interest in you.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:31.440
[Guest]: And then there was a gay Bombay party culture at Velocity in Tarde, where every Saturday,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.600
[Guest]: there used to be a party. And just the idea of going there with your other friends,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.880
[Guest]: or with your friends and just dancing to item songs and, and just living, getting drunk and

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.160
[Guest]: to be able to grind against each other, a stranger even and make out on the dance floor.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.840
[Guest]: It just gives you such a sense of liberation. And this is all pre 377. Yeah, we just absolutely

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.960
[Guest]: snatched what we got. At least I did that. I remember my moments of just snatching,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.400
[Guest]: of just grabbing with both hands and not being apologetic about it at all. And I guess privilege

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.360
[Guest]: had a very big role to play. Because in my head, I knew that I was cushioned and comfort

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:17.200
[Guest]: was there to whatever extent back home. So I could manage to put myself out here and do this.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.440
[Amit Varma]: But it must have been much harder, for example, from the non South Bombay types who happened to

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.120
[Amit Varma]: come to the Salvation Star party. And what do you do? I mean, it's, I think you, you have added

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:34.080
[Guest]: insecurities, you learn, you find your own tribe. Because it's so important to find your tribe

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.360
[Guest]: when you're like, for me, while growing up in college, I was dying to speak with another gay

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.280
[Guest]: boy. And I literally thought to take a quote from Little Britain, that I was the only gay man in the

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.200
[Guest]: village. There was nobody else. And it frustrated me no end till of course, internet came about.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.560
[Guest]: And I was like, Oh, there are other people. And there are other people very close by.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And I guess the internet came at just the right time. And how has the internet changed things?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Like are there still gay Bombay meetups? Is that still a necessity?

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.400
[Guest]: Gay Bombay parties? Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. Those still go on. But now I've stopped going.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.560
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned that there are more hookup apps for gay men than for straight men.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.480
[Guest]: Gay men are everywhere. Gay people are everywhere. We are on Tinder, we are on Grindr,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:25.040
[Guest]: which is exclusively for us. We are on something called Planet Romeo. We are on Bumble. We are on

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:34.960
[Guest]: Hinge. Yeah, everywhere. And I think also with 377 gone, a lot of men are coming out.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.040
[Guest]: They are coming out as bi curious. I don't know what that means. Or as curious or as bisexual or

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.320
[Guest]: whatever label they want to give themselves. But they also making themselves seen that you know,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.280
[Guest]: this is us. And you know, we are out here. Actually, people have it on their Twitter profile,

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.160
[Guest]: that they're bi curious, bi poly, bi curious, bisexual, trying to figure trying to navigate

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.880
[Guest]: waters. Again, I don't know what that means. But, but yeah, I think it's a very good thing that

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.280
[Amit Varma]: all of this is happening. It's a great thing that a lot of people who had these sort of

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.040
[Amit Varma]: repressed feelings can now just come out in the open. And like a friend of mine was recently

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.400
[Amit Varma]: telling me and he's otherwise I've known him as heterosexual. He has a girlfriend and all that.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.280
[Amit Varma]: But he said that he wanted to go to Grindr and check it out and see what the curiosity, right?

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.400
[Guest]: I mean, it's interesting. And how the expectation is set with two men. But I've only known men,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:37.760
[Guest]: right? That, that how it's either going to be this or that, or something else. So I think it's so

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: clear the communication is transparently transactional. So there's nothing else.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.440
[Guest]: Yeah. Like you move with the idea, like if somebody says he's, he's a little discreet or

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.000
[Guest]: closeted or whatever, you know, he's not going to give you his number, you have to still go by

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.720
[Guest]: the trust factor and meet him where he wants you to meet him, if you're interested,

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.480
[Guest]: if there's been a conversation, if there's some chemistry. So you have to take that risk. Like

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.720
[Guest]: earlier, though, I wouldn't be able to see a picture of somebody online because people wouldn't,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.840
[Guest]: there's to be no option of sharing pictures. You just met. And then you took it from there.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And so you didn't even know who you were meeting.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.360
[Amit Varma]: You have an account of a date you had at just around the corner, which, which again,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.840
[Amit Varma]: makes me very nostalgic, because just around the corner is like a defines a certain time in Bombay

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.960
[Amit Varma]: and a certain time in Bandra. And he had portrayed himself as I think being very tall, and he turned

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.080
[Guest]: out to be really short, very short. Yeah. And you still went along.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.520
[Guest]: I was, I was in a sense desperate. I was young. I was horny. I was desperate.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.280
[Guest]: And, and I just wanted to experience everything.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.360
[Amit Varma]: You also got a very interesting account of how you seduced a straight man.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, at Cafe Mondega.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.440
[Amit Varma]: So what happened there?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.080
[Guest]: I think it was a very unusual evening. Things, all the chips fell into place. I didn't, I didn't

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.520
[Guest]: even plan it that it would go this way. I thought he would slap me. I thought I'm done for. He was

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.520
[Guest]: this huge Delhi boy. And I was like, Oh, my God. And that time I was scared of Delhi boys. I mean,

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.280
[Guest]: I was like, okay, you know, and I'm trying to take him home. That was another kettle of fish

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:20.400
[Guest]: all together. So I think we just, I was just a little brave and stupid. Because it could have

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.480
[Guest]: gone anywhere. I could have just not been here. I could have been murdered in the taxi or something.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.000
[Guest]: And I say it with all earnestness, because these things used to happen. People wouldn't know about

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.880
[Guest]: it. I think a lot of gay hate crime was very prevalent. I don't know if it still is.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.160
[Guest]: Have you experienced any of that?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.440
[Guest]: I've experienced verbal hate. A lot of it. I mean, in school, college, bullying.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the painful parts of your book is where you know, for a few pages, you describe

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.880
[Amit Varma]: your first crush, this friend called Deepak and then he is the first person to call you a faggot

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.280
[Guest]: one day.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:03.840
[Guest]: Yes, yes, because of whatever influence of other boys and extremely painful. I mean,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.440
[Guest]: the fact that I still remember it the way I do after all these years, should say something but,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.800
[Guest]: but yeah, but these things happened. And I don't know if they happened to every gay boy growing up.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.840
[Guest]: But universally, yes, these things happen.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And, and, you know, so let's, let's take this opportunity to sort of go back to your school

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.920
[Amit Varma]: days where you talk about how okay, you had a sheltered life at home and everything is fine.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.440
[Amit Varma]: But then you go to school and everything changes. And again, quote from your book,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.200
[Amit Varma]: quote, consider this, a boy who has never been short on confidence, suddenly finds himself at

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.360
[Amit Varma]: a loss for words when it comes to defending himself at school. He just cannot speak.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.080
[Amit Varma]: He has no idea what has beset his life. And before he can call out for his dad or mom,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.880
[Amit Varma]: he is surrounded by bullies, bullies who do not lose a single opportunity to make his life

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.640
[Amit Varma]: miserable, stop quote. And to some extent that this is because the sense that

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.680
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, I think I think children, like we all know, can be very crude. And they have,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.560
[Guest]: they have the sense that perhaps adults just do not, this instinct that something is off in a way

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.920
[Guest]: that this person is different. Like, I think it just started from the time I refused to

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:20.960
[Guest]: be in any sports club or engage beyond like, I wouldn't want to wrestle in the mud.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:29.360
[Guest]: I wouldn't want to pick a fight just for no reason. So the angst or teenage angst just got

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:36.320
[Guest]: channelized in other ways. So I think they picked on that a very, very, they didn't know.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.720
[Guest]: And children know. And they know how to pick on weaknesses, just like Lord of the Flies.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which is very accurate.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.840
[Guest]: Yeah. And they just, so I felt like piggy. Just that, I think I came out of it

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.520
[Guest]: a sane at the end of it all.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.200
[Guest]: How did you navigate your school years?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.600
[Guest]: I hid. And I did a very good job of hiding. So the dichotomy there, right? I mean, in school,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.840
[Guest]: you want to be hidden. But the minute you're out of school, and you're exploring your sexuality,

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.760
[Guest]: you just want to be seen. So, and seen in a way that, that again, you don't want to be seen

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.640
[Guest]: out there. But in a very subtle manner that

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.040
[Amit Varma]: you want people who are looking for it to know that

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that you're giving it. Yeah, that you're available.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.080
[Unknown]: Did you know any other gay boys in school?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.200
[Amit Varma]: No.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Which is weird, because just going by the percentages, there must have been a few.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.720
[Guest]: Of course, a more than few. I don't want to name my school, but notorious.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.320
[Guest]: Notorious in the sense that people say, Oh, a lot of homosexuals in your school.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.560
[Guest]: Oh, really? I didn't know anyone. I wish I did. But sometimes even the bullies, right?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.960
[Guest]: Could be. And they may not even have known that about themselves, unfortunately.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: Or some hidden kind of self loathing, which is expressing itself.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.160
[Guest]: And yeah, so a lot of psychological drama. So yeah, thank God it wasn't a boarding school.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.720
[Guest]: Because I wouldn't have been able to survive that.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Are you in touch with any of your school friends?

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.320
[Amit Varma]: No, not at all.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.280
[Guest]: I don't have school friends. So yeah, I think I put a stop to that very clearly.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.320
[Guest]: Once I was out of there.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And how was college? Where did you go to college?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.880
[Guest]: Right here in Bombay.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.720
[Guest]: Okay. How was college?

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.240
[Guest]: College was a lot of fun in the sense, I studied literature. And it was great.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.200
[Guest]: I was immersed in books. My professors were very, very kind.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.680
[Guest]: And I went to St. Xavier's. So yeah, so it was a lot of fun.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.640
[Guest]: It was something that was so different. It was, yeah, but again, in college, right?

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.920
[Guest]: The friends that were there were very far and few.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.680
[Guest]: I never made friends in school and college, which was very strange.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.880
[Guest]: I don't know why. I thought I was popular.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.920
[Guest]: But of course, I wasn't. Because I was very quiet.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.880
[Guest]: And I wouldn't mingle.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.760
[Guest]: And later when I decided that, okay, now it's the time to meet people, to make a friend.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:06.240
[Guest]: I think I found people who thought in a similar fashion or who, you know, were there for me.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.200
[Guest]: And they continue to be there. So yeah.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.640
[Amit Varma]: So was that sort of initial not making friends or whatever?

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Was it because you were generally a quiet introverted person?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.320
[Amit Varma]: Or did your own sense of your gayness also have a part to play in it?

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: So I think in college, I was very, very inhibited.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.760
[Guest]: I think it was just, like I said, right, when you can't,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.720
[Guest]: when you just wait to speak to someone who is like you, and that's not there,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.320
[Guest]: then you feel a sense of loss.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:41.440
[Guest]: I mean, for how long could I just speak with friends who were women and not be able to tell them?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.160
[Guest]: Like I also mentioned a very close friend of mine, Em, and how she,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.680
[Guest]: how I fell in love with her, because I was so in denial for the longest time.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.000
[Guest]: You've written about your yearning to be straight. Yeah.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.480
[Guest]: And I watched City of Angels with her.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.000
[Guest]: And then I proposed, for some strange reason, I just proposed.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.400
[Guest]: And, and then when she found out that I was gay,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.520
[Guest]: she broke down because she thought that I had a thing for her,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.680
[Guest]: when though she wasn't really interested.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.840
[Guest]: So there's a very, very complex situation that played itself out.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.240
[Guest]: And I don't know why I did what I did, but I did.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.040
[Guest]: Maybe because we are spending so much time together that I thought

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.920
[Guest]: that I could, you know, veer in that direction.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.400
[Guest]: And, and that never came to be.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.200
[Guest]: So, yeah, I mean, I used to look at, I, like I said, right,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.800
[Guest]: and I keep saying I wanted the straight life because it felt so complete.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.600
[Guest]: But, but thank God that didn't happen in my life.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.400
[Guest]: I'm very happy for the, for the lack of it.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.800
[Amit Varma]: And like a related question that comes up is that because being gay in India is so difficult,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.680
[Amit Varma]: so difficult, how much does going through that experience, right,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.960
[Amit Varma]: difficulty rather than being a difficulty in being gay in India,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.000
[Amit Varma]: go on to define who you are as a person or shape who you are as a person.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.360
[Amit Varma]: For example, in my case, I know that my sexual orientation

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.360
[Amit Varma]: has absolutely nothing to do with who I am.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:05.920
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, it hasn't shaped me in any way.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't have to modify my behavior because of it.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.240
[Amit Varma]: I don't have to be wary of what I say to people or,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:20.160
[Amit Varma]: or, you know, consider carefully the signals that I send out.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.800
[Amit Varma]: So my orientation hasn't shaped me because I can just take it for granted.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.920
[Amit Varma]: How has it worked for you?

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.560
[Guest]: So I think my orientation shaped me in a very positive way in the sense that

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.480
[Guest]: the cultural references and the pop culture impact

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.800
[Guest]: or the impact of arts when it came to my life was just something else.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.800
[Guest]: And when I discovered Giovanni's room, or when I discovered Madonna on MTV,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800
[Guest]: and that was a revelation.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.680
[Guest]: That was, I was like, wow.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.960
[Guest]: But why a revelation for you?

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.680
[Guest]: Because for me, I'll tell you why.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: Because when I would watch someone like her with such unabashed confidence

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.320
[Guest]: and with such glory in the performance and speaking what she did about,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:12.400
[Guest]: which is of sex and love and, you know, being who you are and accepting yourself the way you are,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.600
[Guest]: that hit a chord.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:20.080
[Guest]: And that hit such a strong nerve that you feel that confidence in some way.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.440
[Guest]: You feel that there's an ally, even though you don't know her,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.480
[Guest]: and you still know her so well, just like Sridevi.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.720
[Guest]: You just feel that these people or these celebrities are just allies.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.520
[Guest]: They are your friends.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.520
[Guest]: You could perhaps have a conversation with them in your head and be so comfortable about it.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.680
[Guest]: You know, and the same thing when it came to books, like Tennessee Williams,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.040
[Guest]: when I discovered A Streetcar Named Desire, or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.480
[Guest]: or a movie like Gone with the Wind, which was something so empowering about that film,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.840
[Guest]: even though it has its problems, the book and the movie.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.840
[Guest]: But just to see Scarlett O'Hara pick a pound of earth in her hand and say,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.880
[Guest]: I'm never going to go hungry again, instilled something in me that just shook me out of my wits.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.040
[Guest]: And I was like, you know, it's okay.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.960
[Guest]: I mean, if these people can do what they are doing and living the life, so can you.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.560
[Guest]: And that impact on the orientation was so strong that the rest didn't matter, really.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.560
[Guest]: Like when I first watched Maury's, back then when star movies was the good old star movies.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Early 90s, I think, yeah.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.320
[Guest]: And post 1130, they would show movies with a lot of graphic content,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.360
[Guest]: and a lot of nudity.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.600
[Guest]: And Maury's was one of them, produced by Merchant Ivory Productions.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.360
[Guest]: And I fell in love.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.240
[Guest]: And it wasn't because of the lust, but I think just the fact that this is possible.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.720
[Guest]: And it spoke to me on so many levels, talking to me about, you know,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.400
[Guest]: being who you are in a world that probably will take time to accept you.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.240
[Guest]: And then acceptance didn't become a matter of concern at all.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.480
[Guest]: It was there, of course, in a very latent manner, it was there.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.560
[Guest]: But that wasn't the agenda at all.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:06.480
[Guest]: The agenda was perhaps just to live and navigate and figure and meet more people like you

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.400
[Guest]: and understand and share stories and figure it out and make your mistakes.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.560
[Guest]: I have made so many mistakes with the men that I've met, the choices, but it's okay.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.440
[Amit Varma]: It's been a great journey so far.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.200
[Amit Varma]: Almost counterintuitive, what you just told me in the sense that you're saying that it kind of

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.760
[Amit Varma]: made you stronger and more comfortable in your own skin, you know, and helped you get past sort

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.800
[Amit Varma]: of the anxieties that humans feel.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.920
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Maury's, so like, what are the sort of early works of art,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.400
[Amit Varma]: like books or films or whatever, which showed normal gay relationships,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.840
[Amit Varma]: and not in that whole Bollywood caricature-ish, maskalander kind of thing?

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.800
[Guest]: So I think even, so when, you know, I read this book by Raj Rao called The Boyfriend,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.240
[Guest]: and The Boyfriend, to me, felt a little maudlin in the sense that,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.480
[Guest]: again, it spoke about the cruising culture, it spoke about people from different classes

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.520
[Guest]: coming together, and then trying to make sense of what they were feeling towards each other.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.480
[Guest]: I think the sense of attraction, and the sense of desire was so strong in these works,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:18.080
[Guest]: that you start relating on a very different level, like you read books written by

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.640
[Guest]: heterosexual men and women trying to find gay characters in it.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.120
[Guest]: And you can't, because they are not equipped to perhaps write about it.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.360
[Guest]: But when you see Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar, and you then tend to

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.280
[Guest]: find homosexual authors or writers who happened to be gay,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.920
[Guest]: and you can't ask the librarian in your college, because she'd be mighty scandalized.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.040
[Guest]: And there's no Google back in the day.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.240
[Guest]: And there's no Google. So what do you do? You just figure, you just find,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.600
[Guest]: you read synopsis after synopsis, and try and see that, you know, will you find gay literature?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.160
[Guest]: Will you find good, solid gay literature to tide you through?

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.120
[Guest]: Like when I thought, when somebody told me, a friend, that a suitable boy has

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.640
[Guest]: some, you know, gay sex, or gay intimacy, I knew I had to read it.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.680
[Guest]: And that might have been the driving force.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.880
[Guest]: But of course, ultimately, I loved the book, or that the Golden Gate has a bisexual character.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.480
[Guest]: So you only want to read because you want to find out that, you know, what it is about me.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.680
[Guest]: What is it about me that, that makes me different or, or what I don't care about anymore?

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.240
[Guest]: Or I give up caring about because it doesn't make sense anymore.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:42.640
[Guest]: So I think these works of art and these books and movies and, and perhaps lives of people,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.560
[Guest]: just instilled this confidence layer by layer, which had, of course,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.280
[Guest]: shattered over a period of time because of the bullying and all of that.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.840
[Guest]: And I was like, okay, let's pick up and see where we go from here.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.800
[Amit Varma]: No, it's interesting, because I've read and loved a suitable boy many, many, many years,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, when it came out, basically, and I cannot remember a gay scene, which

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.800
[Guest]: It wasn't a gay scene, it was just intimacy between two characters.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.320
[Amit Varma]: I can't remember that either. And that's very interesting, because like I recorded an episode

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.160
[Amit Varma]: few weeks back with Ira Mukherjee, which will probably release after this about women in

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:23.600
[Amit Varma]: history. And she talks about how, when she reads a lot of history, because she her gaze is open to

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.400
[Amit Varma]: it, she will find interesting women characters and interesting things happening to women,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.000
[Amit Varma]: which men reading the same history simply won't even notice it's like something happening on the

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.120
[Amit Varma]: side. And it's not interesting, but she's looking for it. And so she can see it. And so it's

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.720
[Amit Varma]: interesting that there's that added layer to the way that you're sort of reading this stuff.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:49.760
[Guest]: Yeah. So I think I think when you when you want to look for things, they make them

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:56.400
[Guest]: themselves shown in a way to you that, that perhaps other readers, every reader is different,

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.920
[Guest]: right? So another reader might catch on to something and I might catch on to something else.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.200
[Amit Varma]: So yeah,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.520
[Amit Varma]: We'll, we'll talk about books a little later in the show, but sort of going back to

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.240
[Amit Varma]: sort of your growing up years, you know, you've described how it was with school,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.000
[Amit Varma]: where you're basically you're getting bullied, and you're trying to be unobtrusive. And then

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.960
[Amit Varma]: in college, you gradually open up a little bit, but how was it like at home? Like,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.280
[Amit Varma]: as far as your family is concerned, you mentioned how, you know, your uncle, for example,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:33.760
[Amit Varma]: slapped you once when you did those the dialogues of Maharani and when did they start getting a

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.680
[Guest]: sense of it? And how did they react?

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:42.720
[Guest]: So I think after that incident, I stopped doing a lot of things. And I've also mentioned in the

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: book that growing up in a household of women, for the longest time, I was a part of the kitchen,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.240
[Guest]: I would go and sit over there. And like I mentioned, listen to songs on the radio with them

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.960
[Guest]: and be a part of them, see how they were cooking, how they were cutting, what was going on in that

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.400
[Guest]: world, how they would gossip. And it was very interesting. I loved just growing up in the

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.840
[Amit Varma]: kitchen. In fact, I'll quote the passage from there, because I kind of liked it. So I,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.920
[Amit Varma]: I have the book open to that page. Now, before you mentioned the kitchen,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.920
[Amit Varma]: start quote, I think from there, I learned the art of being the other gender,

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:21.760
[Amit Varma]: I learned of grace of the subtleties of not expressing everything harshly, or not confining

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.320
[Amit Varma]: oneself to what the world expects of you because you happen to be a man. The songs that would be

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.960
[Amit Varma]: played on the tape recorder in the kitchen would be only by women singers. There was no intrusion

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:36.320
[Amit Varma]: of male voices in that domain. I was a part of that world till I was about 11 or 12. As soon as

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.680
[Amit Varma]: I turned 13, I knew I wasn't welcome in that space, stop quote. And that's obviously because you're

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.400
[Guest]: deepening of your voice. Yeah, deepening of my voice, also the fact that they understood

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:53.040
[Guest]: that now he's a teenage boy, his body is growing in ways that they couldn't fathom,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.560
[Guest]: or they didn't want to, because there's always this distinction in a household. Okay, these are

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:05.280
[Guest]: the men and you roam with the men when you become a sort of a man. And these are the women and you

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.200
[Guest]: go with and the girls are supposed to become women, when perhaps they have their first period

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:17.760
[Guest]: or they experience life from there on in the next stage, and so on and so forth. So those very, very

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.640
[Guest]: silly boxing of roles is what took place. And then I just kept quiet. I was like, you know,

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:31.280
[Guest]: okay, this is what it is. And this is how it will be. Like, you know, even when we used to go to

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.880
[Guest]: watch movies together, the boys and the men would sit separately, the women and the girls would sit

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.960
[Guest]: separately. Yeah, except for of course, just exchanging, okay, what do you want in the

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:47.040
[Guest]: interview? Shall we get popcorn and so on and so forth. Otherwise, opinions and thoughts weren't

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:54.320
[Guest]: shared or expressed. So I think that was a big, it was a big lack over there when growing up

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:01.760
[Guest]: of expression. So I think, when I started expressing myself, out of anger, it was so

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.000
[Guest]: different, because nobody expected that out of me. Everybody thought I was this sort of

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.600
[Guest]: adarsh balak, I would do as told. And they had sort of charted a road map for me that he would

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.760
[Guest]: do this, he would become this and he would have a girlfriend and you'd get him married and so on and

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:29.520
[Amit Varma]: and so forth. But that never happened. And did this experience also sort of open your eyes to

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:35.200
[Amit Varma]: the cruelty of men, so to say, in a way that would not otherwise have happened if you weren't gay?

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think a lot of men like I'm talking not about sort of being straight or being gay here,

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.280
[Amit Varma]: but just in the terms of gender, the cruelty of men is something that is ubiquitous and normalized

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.080
[Amit Varma]: and taken for granted in the way that they treat their women. And just this your sense of identifying

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:56.720
[Amit Varma]: with the women more of, you know, not understanding why this distinction and why these different roles

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.160
[Amit Varma]: did that open? I mean, did you also then sense that ubiquitous cruelty of men?

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:08.160
[Guest]: Oh, yeah. From the word go, I mean, men generally that I was surrounded by,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.320
[Guest]: I expected a certain sort of decorum, so to say, walk this way, you know, chest out,

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: shoulders up. Why are you drooping? Why this? Why that? You know, why do you want to wear this?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.600
[Guest]: Why do you want to talk like this? Deepen your voice and you know, let it be a little gruff

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:36.800
[Guest]: and abuses, abuses were flying in my house like no one's business. And that's when I realized that,

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:44.480
[Guest]: you know, for all the books that I read and for everything, I just couldn't communicate anything

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:50.560
[Guest]: with them because they wouldn't get it. They just wouldn't understand. Like, I couldn't discuss an

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.600
[Guest]: Agatha Christie book, I couldn't discuss Marquez with them. Because in my head, I was way above all

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.040
[Guest]: of this. So in a very flighty sense, also, I was like, these people are just beneath me to discuss

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:08.880
[Amit Varma]: anything with them, or they won't understand. But did they also read? No, no. And an unrelated

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.160
[Amit Varma]: question before we get back to the family is that, would you feel that people who read more are also

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:22.480
[Guest]: more empathetic? Not necessarily, not all the time, but most of the time. Yes. I think people

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:30.480
[Guest]: who read more, I think people who read diversely are more empathetic. People who, like my uncle

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.680
[Guest]: only at some point, he read, but he would only read Alasdair Maclean. I don't know what kind of

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:42.240
[Guest]: empathy you can get by reading an Alasdair Maclean novel, or a James Hadley Chase novel. But yeah,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.680
[Guest]: that's what he read. But maybe I guess if you read literature, you'd be... Perhaps,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.120
[Guest]: I don't want to sound like a literature snob, but yes, why not? We are sounding immensely,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.600
[Guest]: immensely snobbish. But I think it's fine. It's okay. Because I don't expect them to get it.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:04.800
[Guest]: But I think just the idea of not only being gay, but just the fluidity of life, I don't think

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:11.760
[Guest]: they would, they would get it. It would take a lot of years, and which it has. Which it has. Yeah.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the experience of coming out to your family. Like, how was that? I mean,

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:23.600
[Guest]: I know it happened in steps. Yeah. I mean, I told my cousin, and she went and blurted it.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.840
[Guest]: She blurted it? Yeah, to someone in the family. And then I just got all of them together one fine

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:36.640
[Guest]: day. Everyone. And I just said, Hey, Well, not your parents. My mom, my dad wasn't there around

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.480
[Guest]: at that time. He had gone somewhere and they didn't tell him. Because he had a cardiac problem,

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.120
[Guest]: and they didn't want to shock him, so to say. So I don't know what sort of shock it would be that

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.600
[Guest]: would lead to his death. But but apparently, he knew that's what my mother told me later.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.920
[Guest]: Yeah. So and when they and when I came out to them, the first thing was, let's go,

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:02.000
[Guest]: now let's take him to a psychiatrist. And then she showed me some Rorschach paintings,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.080
[Guest]: and she said, Oh, determine whether he's gay or straight. And I'm like, how can you determine

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.680
[Guest]: that? I'm telling you what I like. I'm telling you who I am. And then she's like, Oh, there's a hint

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:18.320
[Guest]: of gay. Hint of gay, it's not a color, you know, it's not a hint of purple or hint of orange.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.760
[Amit Varma]: She's only a little pregnant. Yeah, you can't. How do you how do you define that? And,

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.000
[Guest]: and then she's like, I can, I can be solved with medication. I'm like your Baba Ramdev,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.880
[Amit Varma]: before Baba Ramdev was Baba Ramdev. Did they try to give you medication? Yeah. Did you take it?

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:40.800
[Guest]: No. I'm like, this is not going to help anyone. You're fighting a lost cause. I mean,

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:47.520
[Guest]: I know exactly who I am. And, and that made it even more sure, made me even more sure.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Now that there was any doubt. But by this time that yearning to be straight had completely gone.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:00.800
[Guest]: Now, I just wanted to experience sex. Now, the next level of growing up was just to have

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.400
[Guest]: unbashful sex, just go for it. I mean, and that was very difficult for me initially,

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:16.240
[Guest]: to engage in that act. Because it just felt very dirty. It, I don't, I never think of it as

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:23.200
[Guest]: as a very enriching or spiritual experience. I don't know what is so spiritual about sex,

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:30.400
[Guest]: or having sex, I think it's just very messy. And so that I think this has been instilled,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest]: because of a certain idea of having early sex when you when you're growing up at 17.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.600
[Guest]: And then you wonder that, oh, my God, I can't deal with this.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.920
[Guest]: Hmm. And that's, that's a, that's a, again, a very contradictory statement only because

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.360
[Guest]: primarily in our country, gay people are identified by the amount of sex they have,

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.600
[Guest]: they're meant to be really promiscuous and, and, you know, like sort of

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.560
[Guest]: fawning and falling all over men. And that's when the homophobia steps in.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.520
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I've known homophobic men who almost behave as if being in contact with a gay person

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.160
[Amit Varma]: will mean, you know, the gay guy will try to rape them or whatever.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And you also mentioned that you've been asked in your book about, you know, how,

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, how did you become gay?

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:30.000
[Guest]: I woke up and I'm like, no, the transformation is the key to life. Let's do this.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.480
[Guest]: It's a ridiculous question. Till date, I get asked, how was your first time? I'm like,

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.600
[Guest]: well, why do you need to know? I mean, now I can just tell them read the book.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.240
[Guest]: But yeah, I'm like, buy karo, just buy the book.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.120
[Amit Varma]: And how did your family react when you had this gathering and you told them?

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.880
[Guest]: First, it was just denial. My mother was like, oh, but you always love Sridevi,

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.600
[Unknown]: you want to marry her and this and that. I'm like, get the hint mom, I always love Sridevi.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.200
[Guest]: She was one of the and she still is the biggest gay icon there is in the country.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I didn't know this. You don't tell her in your book. Why?

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:15.360
[Guest]: I don't know. I think it's just her zest for life, to put it very, for lack of a better word or

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:23.760
[Guest]: phrase. So infectious. So this voracious appetite to be who she wants to be on screen.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.280
[Guest]: To express herself without fear.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:31.360
[Guest]: And very, I think there's this entire, how do I put it like when you watch Chalbaaz and you

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:38.080
[Guest]: watch her dancing in the rain and you watch Lamhe and you see her falling for a much older man.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.120
[Guest]: And you watch Chandni and you want her to succeed in whatever she does in her life

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.600
[Guest]: after breaking from a lover. I think it's just very empowering.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.360
[Guest]: Yeah, and I also know that it has a lot of toxicity attached to it in the movie.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.600
[Guest]: But just to remove her character and to see how the character is, she was a hero in Chalbaaz.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.000
[Guest]: Sunny Deol and Rajnikanth were not needed.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.400
[Guest]: And it was just lovely to watch her and watch her being so empowered.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.120
[Guest]: I think it's also the minority connect. When a gay man and women meet,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.720
[Guest]: when gay men and women meet, it's a minority connect. You understand the pain of being the

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:24.160
[Guest]: other. You understand the feeling of being alienated. So I think there that's when you

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.840
[Guest]: connect. And people then terms silly terms like fag hag, which I hate. And

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.280
[Guest]: What does it mean?

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.120
[Guest]: It means a faggot hag, that you are a fags hag.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.600
[Guest]: Oh, okay.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.280
[Guest]: You are like their beard or you are like, or you, or you're the confidante and you're all of that.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.960
[Guest]: And, and, you know, they will stick to you when you will stick to them.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.200
[Guest]: But I think it's just nothing. It's beautiful. It's a friend.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.480
[Unknown]: And I think that's where the connect comes.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.880
[Amit Varma]: And also, I guess, because, you know, they also perhaps sense that other dichotomy that you've

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.040
[Amit Varma]: mentioned between, say, lust and love. For example, in your book, you've written at one

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.680
[Amit Varma]: point, quote, I would wonder if two men could really fall in love. Was it about lust or was

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.000
[Amit Varma]: there more to it? Stop quote. And a little later, you write, after your first experience, you write

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.360
[Amit Varma]: quote, so that was my first time and I was too young to realize how overrated sex was and still

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:25.360
[Amit Varma]: sex was and still is. What surprised me was the sadness of sex that would follow with many other

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.360
[Amit Varma]: one night stands. Stop quote. And as you also mentioned earlier, a lot of the sex is very

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.600
[Amit Varma]: transactional. How does that play with you, especially because you've sort of, you're

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.800
[Amit Varma]: exposed to popular cultures such as Bollywood with this fantastical visions of romance and

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.920
[Amit Varma]: live happily forever after and eternal love and so on. How does one navigate that?

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:53.600
[Guest]: See, you know, so it was so funny, because I remember after so many encounters, I watched

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.720
[Guest]: Dil Toh Pagal Hai when it came out and Dil Toh Pagal Hai just made me believe, oh, there's

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:04.000
[Guest]: everyone, someone for everyone, which is again, I don't know if I still believe in it or not. I do,

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:11.200
[Guest]: but in a very strange way. But, you know, yeah, I mean, transactional to such an extent,

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.880
[Guest]: when you're chatting with someone online, it is all about likes, question mark, place,

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:23.600
[Guest]: question mark. There's nothing about meeting or having a conversation, or sitting and getting to

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.680
[Guest]: know each other. I think they're just scared that if we get to know each other, there'll be no room

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:34.240
[Guest]: for sex. You're instantly friend zoned. So they don't want that to happen. You can be friend

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:41.440
[Guest]: zoned after the sex, because it's okay, now we can be friends. Maybe it'll happen again,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:48.720
[Guest]: or maybe not. So I think that, in that sense, the promiscuity is valid. When people say that

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:54.240
[Guest]: we are promiscuous, I take it with a pinch of salt, because perhaps there's some truth to it.

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And what's wrong with it?

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.920
[Guest]: No, there's nothing wrong with it. I don't mean it as something wrong with it. But I think...

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.640
[Guest]: But people do.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.320
[Guest]: But people have known of gay men who don't like to be called promiscuous. But I don't

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.160
[Guest]: have a problem with that at all. But I think it's just that, like I said, right, when two men meet,

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:21.920
[Guest]: and there's sort of a very easy initiation into having sex. You just ask each other,

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.520
[Guest]: and you get it done and over with. And that's about it. There's no room for getting to know

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:33.440
[Guest]: each other, most of the time. Sometimes, yes, if you're lucky, the person will stay after sex and

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.720
[Guest]: will have a conversation with you. But most of the time, there's no chance of that.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.600
[Amit Varma]: And not to push a stereotype, but would it also be the case that women, that men are generally,

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.360
[Amit Varma]: men are more often looking for just sex and women want something more. So a lot of that,

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.600
[Amit Varma]: the courtship between a straight man and a straight woman is really a sort of, it's this

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:02.240
[Amit Varma]: dance. It's also, and it's also transactional. But with this whole veneer of what culturally

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.680
[Amit Varma]: you're supposed to do, take someone out for a movie or blah, blah, or even put a ring on the

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:11.200
[Amit Varma]: finger. Yeah. And with gay men, there's no need for that pretense. You know what you want you.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:16.240
[Guest]: It's Yeah. And in a way, that's very sad. Because sad in the literal sense of sad,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:23.120
[Guest]: that you're overwhelmed, that you're only that the person only wants you for your perhaps,

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:29.920
[Guest]: for the time your body can serve a need. Yeah. You know, to put it as transparent and to put

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:35.760
[Guest]: it as crudely, and to put it as crudely and crudely at the same time. And in fact, people

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:45.120
[Guest]: write in their profiles, no chubs, no aged men, no oldies. What are chubs? Fat people, no fatties,

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:51.200
[Guest]: they actually say all that. In a Grindr profile, you can actually read this. And then you begin to

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.760
[Guest]: then you begin to wonder that do I even really want to meet this person, no matter how good

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:03.680
[Guest]: looking he is, or no matter, there's no charm, anyway, there's zero charm, then it's just very,

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.960
[Guest]: very transactional. And of course, as any other human being, you have desires, you have that

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:18.160
[Guest]: the need to have sex. And so you give in sometimes to all of this. And then people are also not very

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:26.080
[Guest]: kind in reciprocating what they take from you, in terms of giving to you, or in and out of bed,

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.520
[Guest]: they will not. Like I know so many men who say I'm not going to kiss. I'm like, oh, you're not Julia

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:38.960
[Guest]: Roberts from Pretty Woman. So you know, for me, no kissing is a deal breaker. It just doesn't and

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:47.280
[Guest]: I don't take it forward, to be so honest. So I think the boundaries or the dynamics even of sex,

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:53.760
[Guest]: or when it's a transaction, they need to be seeped in a little bit of personal getting to

00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:00.880
[Guest]: know each other, or some intimacy beyond the bedroom, which I would like, but it doesn't

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.000
[Guest]: happen. And there's a need to have sex, then I give in like, okay, let's just have sex and get

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.680
[Amit Varma]: done with this, if that's what you want. Why pretend? And before we move on, you know, since

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.520
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned Sridevi, you also said something to me before the recording, which is not in your book,

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.280
[Amit Varma]: which is that there are two kinds of gay men, those who like Sridevi, and those who like Madhuri

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.520
[Guest]: Dixit. Kindly explain. No, I think if gay men are hearing this, they know exactly what I'm talking

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:32.960
[Amit Varma]: about. Yeah, but I don't. Enlighten, enlighten your ignorant. No, no, no, I think I think it's,

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.800
[Guest]: I don't know, I don't know if it is about the position in bed, as some people claim for it to

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.880
[Guest]: be. Tops and bottom. Yeah, yeah. So they're like, oh, if you like Sridevi, you're a bottom.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:48.560
[Guest]: Oh, if you like Madhuri, you're a top. That's interesting. No, no, I've heard this a lot of

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:54.560
[Guest]: times. I don't think there's any truth to it. Honestly, I think it's just stupid. But I just

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.680
[Guest]: meant it in a in a lighter vein, that there are always these scams of Sridevi lovers and Madhuri

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:06.800
[Guest]: lovers. And I know exactly where I fall. So there you go. And, you know, going back to the subject,

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.720
[Amit Varma]: we touched on right at the start of your episode that, yeah, you're, you know, you're a gay person,

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.520
[Amit Varma]: growing up in India in these times. And obviously, it's not easy. But at the same time, you're from a

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.720
[Amit Varma]: position of, you know, you're in a family of extreme privilege. And even if your family

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:28.320
[Amit Varma]: isn't liberal enough to immediately be welcoming the matter with open arms, they are still liberal

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.760
[Amit Varma]: enough that you are not sort of cast out. And, you know, you're still part of the family. And

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.960
[Amit Varma]: the just the privilege and all of that makes it far easier for you to kind of cope with it,

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:45.120
[Guest]: isn't it? No, I wouldn't put it that way. The only reason, yeah, privilege, sure. Living in

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:51.200
[Guest]: South Bombay, sure, while growing up and all of that. But there were times when my aunt is like,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:56.320
[Guest]: oh, in a very dramatic way. Oh, I wish I'd never known you. Oh, we should never been born in this

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.240
[Guest]: family. So all of that drama happened. And your aunt also once wished that you were lesbian.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:08.880
[Guest]: Yeah, one of the other aunts who didn't realize the difference between being gay and lesbian.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.880
[Guest]: It's like, oh, it'd be so nice if you're a lesbian. What will two girls do with each other?

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.200
[Guest]: And I'm like, okay, you don't know what they can do with each other. So let's not go there.

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:24.640
[Guest]: So I think it's just, I think time helps. And time heals like for a long, when I came out to

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.840
[Guest]: my mother, my mother like, oh, my upbringing is so wrong. And I'm like, what is wrong with your

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:36.400
[Guest]: upbringing? You did what you did. And I'm doing what I'm doing as a consequence of who I am.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.600
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, you know, oh, but you can definitely try being straight.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.640
[Guest]: And I couldn't even try being straight. Why don't you try being gay? You know, and see whether you

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.280
[Guest]: can fall for another woman and have sex with a woman. You also try now. If you're telling me to

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:58.800
[Guest]: try, you also try. You actually said this to her? I did. Okay. And she was flabbergasted. She didn't

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:05.760
[Guest]: know how to react. So she just reacted the way mothers would anger. So and even I just banged

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:12.320
[Guest]: my bedroom door. And I didn't want to engage in any conversation. And all of this, my dad never

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:19.520
[Guest]: spoke to me about this. So I don't know that it was so close to the idea of even approaching and

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:27.280
[Guest]: talking to me. So it was very strange thing that was going on in the household. Where people were

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:32.800
[Guest]: like, how do we treat this? How do we look at him? Is he still the same person? Would he get up in

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:39.920
[Guest]: the morning and be the same Vivek that we know him to be? Or Vicky, so to say? But, but yeah,

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.160
[Amit Varma]: I think things changed. Things did change. Because I guess there is that dissonance,

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.280
[Amit Varma]: where they have a mental image of you, the son, and then suddenly that mental image is completely

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.520
[Amit Varma]: shattered, because you're not now going to get married and have a family and all of those things.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:58.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's like, okay, so I mean, that I guess it takes and it took your mother a long time to deal

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.680
[Guest]: with that. Oh, yeah, a lot. In fact, when she read the book, I don't know, she loved the book,

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.960
[Guest]: but I was very hesitant to give her the book to read. Because there are a couple of encounters

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.920
[Guest]: with men that I mentioned and spoken about in the book, which I didn't want her to read about,

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.160
[Amit Varma]: but she has now rather delicately, there's not much that is there's nothing that is graphic in

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.720
[Guest]: the book. Yeah, thank God for that. Because maybe I shouldn't have said that I'm reducing the sales.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:27.840
[Guest]: No, no, no. I don't think I don't think they care. There's too much. There's too much of gay

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.120
[Guest]: porn out there. If they want something graphic. If you don't want something graphic, go read the

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.720
[Amit Varma]: book. In fact, you mentioned something that again, struck a chord with me and reveals our

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.840
[Amit Varma]: respective ages where you, you know, wrote in your book about how you used to serve gay porn back in

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.280
[Amit Varma]: the day through a dial up connection. So just when you were about to sort of reach a pleasurable

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.800
[Guest]: climax, your you know, your mother would pick up the phone somewhere else and boom, it's all over.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.800
[Guest]: I don't have it in me to dial up now. So I'm going to let it be. But those fun times you would know

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.960
[Guest]: how to hack passwords, and friends would share passwords over the phone. And you would just use

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.000
[Guest]: those and start and surf the internet. It was crazy when there was just one site called gay.com

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.120
[Guest]: for the Indian gay boy to go online and interact with strangers. Scary, but good fun.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And your book, in a sense, is a coming of age story where you know, you're young,

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.760
[Amit Varma]: you discover that you're different from other people, and you're alarmed and scared by it,

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.760
[Amit Varma]: but then you come to terms with it. And then by the end of the book, we're in a happy place, you've

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of found what you call a family of choice. And you're in a nice place. And obviously,

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.040
[Amit Varma]: a lot of time has passed since then also to to now where you are, you know, how different is

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.160
[Guest]: the world today? I think the difference is that people are conversing. The fact that you and I

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.280
[Guest]: are sitting in a studio and talking about it, which wouldn't have happened as far as 10 years

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.960
[Guest]: ago, in 2009, or 2008, this would have been unheard of. Or even Naveen's podcast, in fact.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.240
[Guest]: Exactly. And all for the fact that he's out there doing stand up. Yeah, you have queer stand up

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.280
[Guest]: comedians you have. So you're owning spaces, which I think is so important. You're making

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.440
[Guest]: conversations happen. You are talking about it on Twitter, on Facebook, on every social media

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.320
[Guest]: platform, which would have never happened earlier. Earlier, there was this one magazine called

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.600
[Guest]: Bombay Dose, which nobody even looked at. As a gay man, I didn't know it was available. Till about

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:36.560
[Guest]: recently, somebody told me about it. It was that exclusive, so to say, or, or not sold that widely

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.280
[Amit Varma]: because of the fear. You might be from South Bombay, but you weren't exclusive enough. Yeah.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:47.040
[Guest]: So there you go. But which was so funny, right? That today, I'm so glad that today, people can

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.640
[Guest]: reach out to each other, their support groups in whatever form and manner, the individuals who've

01:02:52.640 --> 01:03:02.320
[Guest]: come out as solid sort of spokespeople of the LGBT, QA plus community. I think it's so important.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:10.080
[Guest]: There's GACI, there is a lot of other organizations that talk about it that are there to help

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.360
[Guest]: teenagers or young people navigate through the process. It's not that difficult. I mean,

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.200
[Guest]: today, people come out in college, and you know that there are support groups.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.840
[Guest]: I would have loved to come out in today's time.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And also, so much of popular culture has also changed. I mean, just the fact that

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.160
[Amit Varma]: like two of my favorite films of the last few years are Moonlight and Call Me By Your Name.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.200
[Amit Varma]: And in both of them, you know, straight people can look at these very moving love stories and

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.920
[Amit Varma]: feel moved by them themselves, because and it doesn't matter that these are gay people who are

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.760
[Amit Varma]: the protagonists. And that's amazing. And do you think that's happening in Bollywood also,

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.880
[Guest]: to some extent with like Kapoor and Sons and Made in Heaven?

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.320
[Guest]: Made in Heaven. Now there's another movie whose teaser just got released, Shubh Mangal Zyada

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:03.120
[Guest]: Saavdhan with Ayushman Khurrana. He's playing a queer character, which I think is fantastic. I

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.040
[Guest]: mean, he's, he's a guy who takes risks with his role that I love the confidence he has to be able

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:16.160
[Guest]: to do this. For me, it is so, so endearing to see that on it'll be so it'll be a lovely experience

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:22.720
[Guest]: to see it on big screen, without it being reduced to a caricature, or a matter of ridicule. And then

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.080
[Guest]: not to be ashamed of it, but to take pride in the fact that this movie exists, I hope so.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.080
[Guest]: I hope that when it releases, that's the sentiment. And that's the idea, because

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:39.200
[Guest]: it's so important to have such conversations. And not, you know, it being reduced to just a

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.400
[Amit Varma]: caricature. And sort of a final question about something from your book before we move on.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.200
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote another bit from your book. Quote, that's another thing that I get irritated about

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.720
[Amit Varma]: when people introduce me to others as their gay friend. Why can't I just be a person first and a

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.080
[Amit Varma]: gay man later? There's definitely more to me than just being gay. Some women always need that one

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.160
[Amit Varma]: token gay friend who they air kiss and call darling and sweetie and think other personal

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.640
[Amit Varma]: shoppers or something, which isn't the case. Stop quote. Is this still a problem that you

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.040
[Amit Varma]: faced it? You know, people say, oh, Vivek Tejuja that gay guy. I mean, is that?

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I think I think it comes from a place of an identification, which is okay. It's an identity.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.840
[Guest]: And that's fair. I wear it on my sleeve and that and I make no bones about it online or offline.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:34.000
[Guest]: But it'd be nice to, to not be known by orientation. Like we don't go around introducing

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.080
[Guest]: straight people. He's a straight friend. Exactly. He's a straight man or he's a straight friend.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:44.960
[Guest]: We don't do that, right? I've never done it. So why should that be stuck to me just because

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.680
[Guest]: the orientation is different, just because a particular need is different, which is only

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.240
[Guest]: limited to the bedroom. So I don't think I don't think there's anything else that's different.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.480
[Guest]: We are still the same people.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, for like much of the time that I've known you online, I didn't even know you were gay. I

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.800
[Guest]: just knew you as a guy who really loves books. Thank God for that. We have good conversations

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.000
[Guest]: about it. And it wouldn't have made a difference even if I didn't. And it shouldn't, right? I mean,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.920
[Guest]: yeah. So like, like, it does to like, I keep getting DMS from women who are like, Oh, I didn't

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.680
[Guest]: know you were gay. But this is so nice. Now that I know our relationship will be different. I'm like,

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.840
[Amit Varma]: how will it be different? Maybe it's different for them, because they can, they can be less

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.760
[Guest]: threatened by you. I could still be a toxic gay man. Like when people, people used to stay back

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:35.440
[Guest]: in the past that you know, that oh, you can go with Vivek or you can go with anyone who's gay,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.840
[Guest]: you'll be safe with them. Oh, I may not rape you, but I can be a serial killer. You know,

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.240
[Guest]: I don't understand this concept of safety with a gay man. I get enraged. I'm like, why are you

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:53.200
[Guest]: doing this? How is it any different? I can, I can still strangle, I can still be hurtful.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.600
[Guest]: I can still ensure that I drop you in the middle of the road and go my way. So what makes

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.000
[Amit Varma]: you think that you are safe? I think I think these hints at this darker serial killing side

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.160
[Amit Varma]: of yours are suddenly making it much more interesting to me. But what we are we're

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.080
[Amit Varma]: going to go in for a break now. And when we come out of the break, we are going to talk about

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.280
[Amit Varma]: our mutual love, which is books and literature. And we're just going to have a lot of fun talking

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.880
[Amit Varma]: about books we love and reading our poems we like. So that's what is waiting for you after

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.760
[Amit Varma]: the break. You've been warned don't complain later and do come back. Hey, everybody, welcome to another

01:09:50.080 --> 01:10:17.280
[Amit Varma]: news and its prevalence in today's time. And with that, let's get you on with your shows.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Because when I was growing up, I was surrounded by books. My father had thousands of books.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And one day at about the age of 10, he had this, I was just looking at a shelf for something

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
[Amit Varma]: exciting to read. Up till that point, I had only read, you know, normal things that children of

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.400
[Amit Varma]: that age read. And I came across a book with a very intriguing title, House of the Dead.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.600
[Guest]: Yeah, no, no, House of the Dead is Dostoevsky. Okay, sorry.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so I thought House of the Dead sounds really exciting. There'll be some adventure

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.640
[Amit Varma]: in it. And I picked it out. And it was an account of Dostoevsky's time in a Siberian prison.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And I was so hooked that I read all of that. And then I read all of Dostoevsky. And then I,

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.840
[Amit Varma]: for some strange reason, skip to Shakespeare and read all of Shakespeare at age 10. I read

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.920
[Amit Varma]: much more at that age than regrettably I do now. But tell me more about yourself. And in

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.560
[Amit Varma]: your case is also sort of the added angle that for you, it was also a refuge.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:23.440
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, completely. Like, I remember, I first discovered classics

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.960
[Guest]: through Wuthering Heights. And there was a pocket classic with pictures. And I was like, okay,

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.320
[Guest]: I was about 10, 11. I was like, I was intrigued. I was like, let me just pick this up. It was very,

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.000
[Guest]: it was a big book. And at that time, I didn't know about the concept of unabridged and abridged.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.760
[Guest]: So I picked it up, and I fell in love with it. It was written very simply,

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.440
[Guest]: because it was, of course, abridged. And I absolutely loved it. I didn't even realize

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.040
[Guest]: it was set in old England and the Moors and everything. I just love the idea of love in that.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.120
[Guest]: I maybe didn't even realize that it had the ghost element and so much had happened and this and that,

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.680
[Guest]: but just that. I think that there on I started. So then Pride and Prejudice happened.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.520
[Amit Varma]: And this time, I guess in the unabridged.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:16.960
[Guest]: Unabridged. Yes. And for all its flaws, I love Pride and Prejudice. I love Darcy.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.400
[Guest]: So that was another thing. And when college happened, I think around the same time, my

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.960
[Guest]: exposure to Hollywood, so to say, was with the bodyguard, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:36.560
[Guest]: And I loved Kevin Costner, absolutely charmed by that man. And from there on,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:42.240
[Guest]: again, it led to some more literature of a very different kind. Then I started reading a book

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.800
[Guest]: called The English Patient, which I love to date. Like what a book, what a book. And that time,

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.840
[Guest]: Booker, I think I came to know of the Booker because Arundhati Roy won it in 1997,

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:03.120
[Amit Varma]: when I was 14. An English patient won it the year before. Yes, 1996 or 1995. And that's how I got to

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.480
[Guest]: know of the existence of the English patient. And then I watched the movie. I insisted that my mother

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.760
[Guest]: take me to watch the film. And I fell in love with the movie. And it's one of those very interesting

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.600
[Guest]: instances where the film is also remarkably good. Yes. Which doesn't happen all the time.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:28.320
[Guest]: And from there on, from the movie and from the book, I wanted to read Hereditus, because that

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:34.560
[Guest]: book was mentioned so many times in the movie and the book, The English Patient, you just had to

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.320
[Guest]: read. So you know, I love book references in books. I love that when there's a reading list

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.480
[Guest]: that comes out of a book. When that happens, so that you already have that reading list.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.360
[Amit Varma]: When I read nonfiction, something I keep doing is I just go to the back very often, I go to the foot

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.280
[Amit Varma]: notes or the end notes very often. So inevitably, if I read a good book, I'll end up reading five

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.720
[Guest]: other books that I picked up because of the end notes. Yeah. Happens to you? Oh, yeah, yeah,

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:05.440
[Guest]: completely. And when it's fiction, I love when when a character is talking about a book, like

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.600
[Guest]: I just finished reading a book by Ann Patchett, the new one called The Dutch House. And in that

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:16.080
[Guest]: she's mentioning the Makioka Sisters by Tanezaki. And I love that book. So I'm like, I smile to

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.960
[Guest]: myself and I'm like, hey, there's a camaraderie of sorts between me and the author. You share

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.080
[Guest]: that secret. Yeah, you share that secret book. Or you know that, you know, she also loves it.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.960
[Guest]: So I think that that is very, very uplifting in the world of books and reading. And when you start

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.280
[Guest]: doing when you when you look out for these red herrings, and you look out for these clues,

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.720
[Guest]: whether it's a sentence or a reference in a TV show, when people talk about books,

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.400
[Guest]: I love that. Like Lost, one of my favorite TV series had so many books mentioned in it.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.760
[Guest]: So yeah, it just it's just lovely to see that.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And your mother also read you mentioned?

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, a lot. A lot.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.840
[Amit Varma]: So you had books at home?

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.800
[Guest]: I had books at home, I had access to them. And my parents, we had a membership library,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:11.040
[Guest]: family membership to British Council. So every weekend, or every week after college,

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.880
[Guest]: I would go to British Library and borrow books. There was I, Claudius, and Claudius the God,

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.400
[Guest]: and Claudius the God, which also had a BBC television series.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.960
[Amit Varma]: I've seen the I, Claudius BBC television series.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.880
[Guest]: Yes, it is intense. Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, his grandmother in that show,

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.440
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if you remember, she was so good. But what a character and then what,

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.200
[Guest]: what a book by Robert Graves. I mean, to think that historical fiction was written

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.160
[Guest]: way back. And of course, in a very, very...

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I never actually read that particular book, I just saw the series. But, you know,

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.160
[Amit Varma]: while we are on that, and we mentioned the English patient, to take a brief digression,

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.120
[Amit Varma]: what are the instances where you have loved both the book and the movie?

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.160
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's a very difficult question.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Like my standard answer to that while you think about yours is James Joyce's The Dead,

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.120
[Guest]: which was made into a film by John Huston.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm not, I'm not watched the film.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a lovely film. And remarkably, it's not on your Netflix, Prime and all that it the full

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.680
[Amit Varma]: thing is on YouTube. In a slightly bad print, as they would say.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.800
[Unknown]: I'll watch it for sure.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Back in the old days, and I put up a tweet thread on it as well at one point.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to look at the show notes. And that was memorably lovely, especially because

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.720
[Amit Varma]: like there is one scene in it, which I love where you've read the story, right?

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So there's one scene where they're leaving the party and

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.280
[Amit Varma]: the male protagonist is at the bottom of the stairs and his wife is coming down. And at one

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.320
[Amit Varma]: point, someone starts singing this song called The Last of Ogrim. And you cut into her face,

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:47.440
[Amit Varma]: and she has just stopped and he is staring at her riveted. And she is lost in another world.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:53.200
[Amit Varma]: And you see that sadness and longing in her face. And she's looking down and Angelica Huston

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.680
[Amit Varma]: just acts beautifully there. And the inside story of that also of that particular scene

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.080
[Amit Varma]: is that this film was John Huston's last film, her father, Angelica's father,

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.240
[Amit Varma]: he was dying, he died before the film was released, but after it was made.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.720
[Amit Varma]: So when she looked down from the stairs, she saw him on a wheelchair with oxygen pipes.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Oh, that's why the sadness.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's where the sadness came from. And it's a mind blowing scene. And of course,

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.680
[Amit Varma]: the scene itself alone is on YouTube. But that's that's one book.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.280
[Guest]: But I must tell you, sorry to interrupt, but there's this one other story to

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.640
[Guest]: The Last of Ogrim is that James and his wife Nora used to share the song.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:32.960
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.680
[Guest]: And they loved this song. And it was part of their song,

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:42.080
[Guest]: right from their marriage to their death, one of the deaths or so. So yeah, that's the story to

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.840
[Guest]: that. I mean, there's a movie called Nora, which is based on

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.400
[Guest]: Which has a beautiful scene where Susan Lynch is singing this song with

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.080
[Guest]: Even Juan McGregor.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:52.880
[Guest]: Yeah, and he's playing

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.800
[Guest]: Which is beautiful. I mean, and that also I saw, courtesy British Library.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.680
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that that incident, the Michael Fury incident was inspired by

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.120
[Amit Varma]: something which actually happened to Nora.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:03.360
[Guest]: Yes.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.560
[Guest]: There was a Michael Fury in her life.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.120
[Guest]: Yes.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.120
[Guest]: And which I hadn't known till recently.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:14.480
[Guest]: Yeah, because I read the biography of Nora Joyce by a lady called Brenda Wex or something

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.240
[Unknown]: to that effect. But what a biography. You must pick it up if you ever get a chance.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Sorry, books to movies.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.080
[Guest]: Books to movies.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.920
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you were saying.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.120
[Amit Varma]: You were saying I'm done. I wanted to just jog.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.800
[Guest]: I love Gone with the Wind. I think, like I said, people may find it problematic today.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.560
[Guest]: But going by the time it was made and how it was made. I absolutely loved it.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.960
[Guest]: Though at that time also, it was problematic in the sense that Clark, there was another actor

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:50.560
[Guest]: supposed to play the role of Fred Butler, but was replaced because he was known to be a homosexual.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.920
[Guest]: I can't remember the name of the actor. And the director just didn't want that.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.480
[Guest]: Who was this?

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.240
[Amit Varma]: I can't remember. But there's a story you can google it.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.200
[Amit Varma]: You can google it.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.840
[Guest]: And how they then got Clark Gable to play Fred Butler, which was really sad.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.720
[Guest]: Clark Gable benefiting from the homophobia of others.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.560
[Guest]: There you go, of Hollywood. So that was that. I love The Postman Always Rings Twice by James

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:20.400
[Guest]: M. Cain. And I love the movie also, only because of John Garfield. Absolutely find him so stunningly

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.600
[Guest]: hot. I was like, I was just glued to Turner classic movies at one time in my life. I mentioned

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:31.760
[Guest]: in the book as well. And Cat on a Hot Tin Roof with Paul Newman, looking the way he did.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.760
[Guest]: And the play by Tennessee Williams, which I again love, because Tennessee Williams,

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:45.680
[Guest]: this latent homosexuality in all his plays, does a wonderful job of projecting that into either his

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:52.960
[Guest]: women or his men, but mostly women. His angst and everything comes out through the women characters,

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.160
[Guest]: which I think is a brilliant job that he did as a playwright.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, I read him when I was a teenager, like decades ago. So I've probably got to reread

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.400
[Amit Varma]: him in that light. I mean, another great translation of story to film I thought was

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Brokeback Mountain.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.080
[Guest]: I love that.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.920
[Amit Varma]: The story, of course, came out in, I think, 98 or 99 in New York.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.080
[Guest]: Annie Proulx, I don't know.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.520
[Guest]: Annie Proulx, yeah, neither do I.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.120
[Guest]: Yeah, but what a story.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And have you seen that film called In the Bedroom?

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.800
[Amit Varma]: No.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Okay, In the Bedroom is based on a short story by Andre Dubu.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.960
[Guest]: I think that's how you pronounce it. Dubu is just a glorious, glorious short story.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And the story was called something else. I think it came in either New York or Paris

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Review or one of these. And the story basically is about these parents whose son is killed by

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:42.000
[Amit Varma]: someone and then they want to take revenge. Son is killed in the sense, maybe it's an accident.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.480
[Amit Varma]: I don't even remember now. But it's a very nice short story. And it's a beautiful film.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Classic film, one of my favorites, but they're very different from each other,

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:57.680
[Amit Varma]: which is also sort of very interesting on how you take a story which is much more compressed.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.200
[Guest]: And then you just build this dramatic thing out of it.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:06.400
[Guest]: Which is great because I love him as a short story writer. And I wish there were more,

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:14.320
[Guest]: more, you know, movies based on books in India. I've seen so many. I love Gumna

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.320
[Guest]: based on And Then There Were None. I love because it's so bad. It's so hammy that I love it.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.920
[Guest]: Like for the longest time, when I got my tribe of gay men as friends and all of that,

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.960
[Guest]: we would play the song that Helen dances to in that movie Kitty Kelly on the beach,

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.680
[Guest]: and we would dance to it as well at a friend's house, because it was so funny,

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:44.880
[Guest]: the song and the way it was done. And then we used to copy steps of the song and it was very

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:50.320
[Guest]: interesting. So I think Indian literature has a lot. I mean, I love Devdas for all its,

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.320
[Guest]: again, such a badly made movie by Bansali. It's a horrendously bad film. It's a horrendously bad

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.240
[Guest]: film. But I just love it. I don't know why because of Madhuri and Aishwarya, I guess.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:06.480
[Guest]: But I love some, I love their interaction in the film. I don't like the book at all. But yeah.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.280
[Amit Varma]: This is a completely, by the way, diversion. But my father once used to be director of the

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Film and Television Institute of India in the late 80s. And he expelled Sanjay Leela Bansali.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.000
[Guest]: Excellent. Good choice.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.200
[Amit Varma]: Not for the right reasons. It was, I think, more to do with misbehavior. But I would have expelled

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.320
[Guest]: him for aesthetic reasons. You know, there's this one movie that I don't know if you watched it,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:39.760
[Guest]: based on Madame Bovary by Flaubert. I really enjoyed the film. I love the book. But I enjoyed

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:46.800
[Guest]: the film because I thought Deepa Saini did such a good job. And it was a Doordarshan film. I think,

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:52.640
[Guest]: yeah. So that I really liked. And a lot of movies that time on Doordarshan that were made

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.400
[Guest]: were from books like Party, right? By Mahesh, I can't pronounce his last name.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.040
[Unknown]: Elkunchwar.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.440
[Unknown]: Elkunchwar, yeah. Party is Mahesh.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.440
[Guest]: I think he wrote the play and Govind Nilani made the film.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, Govind Nilani made the film.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.640
[Amit Varma]: By the way, I don't think I've told you this. But since you had mentioned before we recorded that

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.160
[Amit Varma]: you had liked the book I released 10 years ago. That was almost made into a film by Govind Nilani.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.560
[Amit Varma]: In the sense, he got in touch with me and he said, I'd like to make the film. And I even worked on a

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:26.720
[Amit Varma]: script treatment for him, but he could never raise funding for it. At which point he said that Marathi

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.000
[Amit Varma]: film industry is like, Hindi film industry was in the early 80s, and he still couldn't get funding.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.040
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of flabbergasted that a guy of his stature who's made the kind of movies he has

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.200
[Guest]: is not being able to fund it. It's crazy.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.160
[Guest]: Maybe you want to pitch it to Netflix?

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.480
[Amit Varma]: No, I don't want to pitch it at all. It was a terrible book. I don't know.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.640
[Guest]: It wasn't, not at all, please. Now you're just fishing.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.880
[Amit Varma]: No, and I have an interesting Mayam Aimsaab story also. So I was in college when I was

01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.960
[Amit Varma]: a hostelite in Ferguson College, Pune when Mayam Aimsaab was released. And if any of my

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.200
[Amit Varma]: hostel mates are listening to this, I, after all these years, I apologize for what I did.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.360
[Amit Varma]: So what I did was I went and watched the first day first show. And then I went back to the

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.240
[Amit Varma]: hostel and I gathered everyone around and I described in detail a number of lurid scenes,

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:19.200
[Amit Varma]: which were not in the film. Right. So then all of them go to watch first day third show.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And they're disappointed.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:27.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And then they come back out saying, Amit, the censors cut it for the third show.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:37.520
[Guest]: No, so I got to watch the uncensored version through a library VHS tape. And even then,

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.600
[Guest]: I mean, Shah Rukh did nothing for me, but I just liked the way the movie was,

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.120
[Guest]: except for the horrendous Raj Babbar in it. Like, why is he there in the film? But,

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.200
[Guest]: but yeah, it was a good movie. I quite enjoyed it.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.280
[Amit Varma]: I kind of felt it was a little bit of a sort of random movie.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, very, very self indulgent, no doubt.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Let us now take a poem break. I think both of us have got about three,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.400
[Guest]: four poems that we are happy to talk about and read. Let's begin with you.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.720
[Guest]: Okay, so this is one of my favorite poems, one of my favorite people, Eunice, Eunice D'Souza.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:23.840
[Guest]: The poem is advice to women. And very strangely, this always reminds me of 36 Chaurangi Lane,

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.160
[Guest]: which I love. And I wish somebody would write a book out of that movie. That's

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.680
[Guest]: a movie that I want to read. One of my all time favorite films. So I think that's also got to do

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:44.160
[Guest]: with the idea of gay man aging, old alone, which is very scary. We'll talk about that some other

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:50.400
[Guest]: time. But here's a poem called advice to women. Keep cats if you want to learn to cope with the

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:57.520
[Guest]: otherness of lovers. Otherness is not always neglect. Cats return to their litter trays

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:04.560
[Guest]: when they need to. Don't cuss out of the window at their enemies. That stare of perpetual surprise

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.560
[Guest]: in those great green eyes will teach you to die alone.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Lovely. And I love all this stuff. And it's very interesting. I mean, how do you feel about this,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:22.080
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, I feel very awkward reading poetry aloud or listening to spoken poetry,

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact, because, you know, it seems to me that I read it one way in a page.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And then when you hear it, it's a completely different beast. Even though the sound matters

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.520
[Amit Varma]: so much. But so you know, these poetry readings just seem to me like, what?

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.040
[Guest]: I think they are very pretentious. And there are a lot of them today,

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.520
[Guest]: spoken word performances and all, which is, see, I'm not taking away from the beauty of the poem.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.840
[Guest]: But just by being read aloud, I don't know. I think the entire drama and performance attached

01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.400
[Guest]: to it. So that's something that maybe I don't know how I'll react to in person when this happens.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.720
[Guest]: So I don't attend them anyway. But it's fun to know that there are voices, it's good to know that

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.120
[Guest]: there are so many voices that are emerging or emerge because of this practice.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.160
[Amit Varma]: And as a sort of a book critic, do you also find expectations of what a critic must do,

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.160
[Amit Varma]: especially from the more academic sorts, that the critics have to have a particular way of

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.040
[Amit Varma]: doing their criticism? I'm not a critic.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:23.920
[Guest]: But you write about books.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.880
[Guest]: I write about books, but I don't care what people have to say. Because people say a lot of things of

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:38.640
[Guest]: how things should be written about or viewed or said or listened to. But I think it's okay. I mean,

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.000
[Guest]: you can't make them all happy, right? So why bother? Your poem?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.120
[Amit Varma]: Okay, let me read out something. Have you read Mark Strand?

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.880
[Guest]: Yes. You had mentioned it online, I remember on Twitter, and I replied to you as well.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Saying how much I love Mark Strand.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.760
[Amit Varma]: I love Mark Strand. In particular, I like his later work. His last book of poems before he

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.280
[Amit Varma]: died was called Almost Invisible. And it's a book of prose poems. So if someone who is not into that

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.240
[Amit Varma]: stuff looks at it, they'll just see one paragraph and they'll say, how is this poem? But and even

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.640
[Amit Varma]: I can't really answer that question. Can you?

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:22.560
[Guest]: No, Anne Carson does a beautiful job of prose poetry. A lot of people do that.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.240
[Guest]: A prose poetry.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Mark Strand's book is pretty spectacular. So the first poem I'll read out is actually a prose poem.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:35.200
[Amit Varma]: It's called You Can Always Get There From Here. And in a sense, you know, this poem before I read

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.160
[Amit Varma]: it out, in a sense, this is a little poignant, because it feels to me that this might be a

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: direction in which we might be going in India. You know, the overall sense of it. And that's,

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.680
[Amit Varma]: but maybe that's just my take.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.080
[Amit Varma]: You Can Always Get There From Here by Mark Strand.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.560
[Amit Varma]: A traveler returned to the country from where he had started many years before.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.560
[Amit Varma]: When he stepped from the boat, he noticed how different everything was.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.960
[Amit Varma]: There were once many buildings, but now there were few and each of them needed repair.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.600
[Amit Varma]: In the park where he played as a child,

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.400
[Amit Varma]: dust filled shafts of sunlight struck the tawny leaves of trees and withered hedges.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Empty trash bags littered the grass. The air was heavy.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.040
[Amit Varma]: He sat on one of the benches and explained to the woman next to him that he'd been away a long time,

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.440
[Amit Varma]: then asked her what season had he come back to.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
[Amit Varma]: She replied that it was the only one left, the one they had all agreed on.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.240
[Amit Varma]: And in this poem, I don't mean literally that India is going to look like the Soviet dystopian

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:32.560
[Guest]: thing.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.640
[Guest]: The imagery is so powerful when you're talking about the sunlight or you're talking about

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.520
[Guest]: the leaves and the hedges and you're talking about how he steps out of that.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And I don't mean this literal sense of decay or everything looks the same or whatever,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.680
[Amit Varma]: but just a sense that this is a season that everyone has agreed upon.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.920
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of, you know,

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.960
[Guest]: The season of loss.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.440
[Amit Varma]: I think he might well have had the Soviet Union in mind, for example,

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.440
[Guest]: when he wrote this, which was pretty much where it was, you had a totalitarian regime

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.000
[Guest]: insisting on its own vision of the world.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.200
[Guest]: We are not very far from it.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.760
[Amit Varma]: But that's, well, I mean,

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Scary, but yeah, well.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.960
[Amit Varma]: That's kind of, so do you ever get snobbery from book people that, you know, why do you like this?

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, are there writers who are supposed to be cool to read and not so cool to read?

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Like you mentioned earlier in the episode that you had liked Shobhadeh's sisters.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.680
[Amit Varma]: But that, of course, was when you were first given it.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.760
[Unknown]: And that's not necessarily what you like today.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.240
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.720
[Amit Varma]: But is there somehow that, I mean, you know, I, for example,

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.680
[Amit Varma]: I discovered Haruki Murakami in the late 90s.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.640
[Amit Varma]: I think when I read him in Playboy, of all things, I read Playboy for the stories.

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.120
[Guest]: Yeah, there were some fantastic stories right there.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:45.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And I was a fan of Murakami from then.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And it was kind of disconcerting that about a decade or a decade and a half ago,

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.600
[Amit Varma]: it suddenly became cool to like Murakami when the rest of the world caught on.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.400
[Amit Varma]: And now to hate it.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.880
[Guest]: And now to hate it.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:00.320
[Guest]: Like I discovered him in 2001 with Sputnik Sweetheart.

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:00.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.800
[Guest]: And that was the time I lost my father.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.200
[Guest]: So that book has always been very special.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:10.640
[Guest]: You know, it's somehow, it's not the loss of my dad that would make me stop reading that book.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.840
[Unknown]: In fact, I read it every year.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.320
[Guest]: I love that book so much.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.800
[Guest]: There's something maybe because it speaks of loss.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.280
[Guest]: And it speaks of, again, love not being found.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:26.080
[Guest]: So I think it just connected at a very, very deeper level.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:31.120
[Guest]: But I get what you mean about authors being dissed and being loved later.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.400
[Guest]: And then you're like, I have been reading him, you discovered him right now.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.760
[Guest]: So you shut up kind of a thing.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.640
[Guest]: That kind of book snobbery is there in my head.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.080
[Guest]: I don't say it out loud.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.600
[Guest]: But now I have said it out loud.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.240
[Guest]: So sometimes it's there.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.200
[Guest]: I'm like, why can't you get what the author is trying to tell you?

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.360
[Guest]: But then I also see that there are different things that people take from the same book.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.840
[Amit Varma]: And then also you see people making that effort because it's cool to like Murakami.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.240
[Amit Varma]: You buy Murakami and you read him and you're making the effort to like Murakami to be cool

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.840
[Amit Varma]: rather than just take joy in the book itself as the case may be.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:10.640
[Guest]: I mean, the short story of his I read, in fact, was one called The Second Bakery Attack.

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.560
[Guest]: Yes, it was in The Elephant Vanishes.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.680
[Guest]: It was in The Elephant Vanishes.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.320
[Amit Varma]: Yes, it had come second or third story in The Elephant Vanishes, a beautiful story.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.040
[Amit Varma]: Lovely story.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.440
[Guest]: One of my favorite Murakami stories is in After the Quake.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.520
[Guest]: I don't know if you've read it.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.720
[Unknown]: I've read it but I may not remember.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.640
[Guest]: There's a last story called, I can't remember what it's called, Honey something, Honey Bun

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:40.560
[Guest]: or something to that effect about a girl and her single mother and a friend who loves the

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.800
[Guest]: girl's mother and how they make this strange family unit beautifully written.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:55.760
[Guest]: One of his more life-affirming stories and not so pessimistic, but a great one.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.800
[Amit Varma]: I've got to kind of revisit that.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.800
[Amit Varma]: Speaking of stories for a moment, like another writer I've loved for many, many years and

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.840
[Amit Varma]: we've actually discussed her.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So I know you love her also, Alice Munro.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Yes, oh my God.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.720
[Amit Varma]: And she suddenly became very cool for the Hoi Poloi to said they've read her when she

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.080
[Amit Varma]: won the Nobel Prize and all that.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.120
[Amit Varma]: But like just such an amazing.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.600
[Guest]: I think she can never write a bad sentence.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.480
[Guest]: It's not possible.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.360
[Guest]: Just not possible.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.200
[Guest]: Like anything, anything that we've read of hers.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.280
[Guest]: I think she's just brilliant.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And what strikes me about Alice Munro is that she does with the short story.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:35.600
[Amit Varma]: I haven't seen anyone else do to this extent in the sense that in a very short space, she

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.760
[Amit Varma]: will compress such a deep, lovely novelistic world almost.

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.840
[Amit Varma]: It's like she doesn't need to write novels because she can say it all in a short story.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And the one, my favorite short story of hers is called The Bear Came Over The Mountain.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, about amnesia.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:50.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.120
[Amit Varma]: About this old man.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Alzheimer's rather.

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Alzheimer's, yeah.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.600
[Unknown]: And amnesia.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.800
[Unknown]: Yeah, I don't know about Alzheimer's.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.600
[Unknown]: You're correct.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.440
[Guest]: I, but what a beautiful, beautiful story.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.400
[Guest]: You know, talking about that, the movie is also really very good.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.280
[Guest]: Okay.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Based on the short story.

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.480
[Amit Varma]: I saw the movie far from her or something like that.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.800
[Guest]: Away from her, far from her.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.440
[Guest]: Away from her.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.760
[Guest]: Yeah, but I kind of found it, perhaps compared to the story, because I'm just such a fan.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.240
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.360
[Amit Varma]: We will link the story from the show notes.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.280
[Guest]: Kindly read her.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.240
[Guest]: Yeah, you must.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.760
[Guest]: I mean, Monroe is someone who's so close to my heart.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.600
[Guest]: Because again, I think, I think when, when authors and books come to you at a time when

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:35.520
[Guest]: you need them the most, I think they just change the way you are as a person.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.880
[Guest]: Was that the case with Monroe?

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.920
[Guest]: Yeah, completely.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.800
[Guest]: She just landed in my lap just like that.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.840
[Guest]: Like literally, I just went to Lotus bookstore.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.680
[Guest]: And I love Joyce Carol Oates.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.080
[Guest]: And, and I was like, okay, time to read something different.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.120
[Guest]: And I just chanced upon this book called Hateship, Friendship, Loveship.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:55.920
[Guest]: Courtship Marriage.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.720
[Guest]: Courtship Marriage.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.200
[Guest]: And I was like, okay, let's just pick this up.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.080
[Guest]: And I never looked back since then.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.520
[Guest]: I just have to read her.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.920
[Guest]: And, and even though you've read her, you want to go back to her and read her again.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.640
[Amit Varma]: And, and often just from the point of view as a writer, like I have gone to her stories

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.080
[Amit Varma]: trying to figure out the craft, like how the hell does she do this?

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.120
[Amit Varma]: To keep a story moving so fluidly and yet pack in so much and pack in a whole universe

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:23.520
[Guest]: into a story.

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.160
[Guest]: And so many emotions, she'll wring them all out of you.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:26.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.360
[Guest]: Like when she writes a sentence, it's a central just keep playing in your head over and over

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.080
[Guest]: again.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.440
[Guest]: It just won't let go.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Just lovely.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And if some of you are aspiring writers, it might be interesting to note that her writing

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.960
[Amit Varma]: really happened very late.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.840
[Unknown]: She really blossomed in her 50s and 60s.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.480
[Amit Varma]: And her best work is like now in her old age.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:49.120
[Amit Varma]: I think in the last 20 years, she's just kind of been knocking it out of the park one story

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.000
[Guest]: at a time.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.560
[Guest]: There's this other writer who I absolutely adore, this Australian writer called Christina

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.200
[Guest]: Stead.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.000
[Guest]: Okay, I've never read her.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:56.240
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.880
[Guest]: There's this book called The Man Who Loved Children about how a father, you know, treats

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.560
[Guest]: his children really badly.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.880
[Guest]: And not, not abuse in the sense, but about their family unit.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.480
[Guest]: And it's so dysfunctional.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.680
[Guest]: It's a brilliant book.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.160
[Guest]: Franzen recommends it a lot.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:12.960
[Guest]: Ah, okay.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.240
[Guest]: And that's how I got to know of it.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:21.600
[Guest]: And that's when I read it, way back in 2009, when I think Freedom came out, 2009, 2010.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:24.240
[Guest]: And Oprah selected Freedom for her book club.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.680
[Guest]: And then I read Freedom.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.280
[Guest]: And I already read Corrections.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.400
[Guest]: But I love Freedom more.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.640
[Guest]: And then he spoke about Christina Stead.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.920
[Guest]: And that's how I got to know of her.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.600
[Amit Varma]: That's interesting.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.120
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of brings on a lament about how my reading habit fell a little bit through

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:39.920
[Amit Varma]: many of those years.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Like I read Corrections and absolutely loved it.

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:42.560
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.680
[Amit Varma]: And I haven't read Freedom.

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.880
[Amit Varma]: You must read Freedom.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.360
[Guest]: You'll love it.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360
[Guest]: And it's a rock and roll.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.000
[Guest]: Yeah, okay.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.600
[Guest]: And it's got, it's got music.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.520
[Guest]: And of course, he loves birds.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.960
[Guest]: So there's a lot of bird watching.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.680
[Guest]: And it's again about a dysfunctional family.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.880
[Guest]: And I don't think anybody else that dysfunctional family better than Franzen does it.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.160
[Amit Varma]: So the great American writers are very good at dysfunctional family.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.680
[Guest]: Updike is all dysfunctional.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.400
[Guest]: Yates also, which he had a very short span.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:18.720
[Unknown]: Achiever does a brilliant job in short stories, again, does a brilliant job of the dysfunctionality.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.120
[Guest]: Ford also does a very good job.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.440
[Amit Varma]: It's right up the American.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.400
[Guest]: Yeah, completely.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:29.120
[Guest]: I think even the Indian scene, a lot of Bengali writers do that really well.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.760
[Guest]: I know Asha Poornadevi, who I love, as a short story writer, I was just thinking about her

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:38.160
[Guest]: when you mentioned Monroe, because she is brilliant.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.760
[Guest]: I wish more of her works.

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:40.880
[Guest]: I've never read her.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.320
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, she was the one who wrote her novels and stories without stepping foot

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.040
[Guest]: out of home.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:47.600
[Guest]: Wow.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.160
[Guest]: Okay.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.640
[Guest]: And she was this Bengali lady, very unassuming.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:57.680
[Guest]: And she wrote about close to 3000 short stories, and about 152 novels.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.880
[Amit Varma]: 152 novels.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, all in Bengali.

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.880
[Guest]: And some of it has been translated, very few.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:09.200
[Guest]: But I keep telling Arunabha on Twitter, Arunabha Sinha, that, you know, please translate more

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.440
[Guest]: of her because we need to read more of her.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and he's an outstanding translator.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.920
[Guest]: And he also translates very prolifically, three, four books.

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.040
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, a year, I think.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.640
[Guest]: But what a book, you must read Asha Poornadevi.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.440
[Amit Varma]: She's so good.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, speaking of book to film, another one which struck my mind when you said Bengali

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.240
[Amit Varma]: was Days and Nights.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.680
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.200
[Guest]: I just finished rereading it last night.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.720
[Guest]: And Robi and all these characters are still so fresh in my mind, as we speak now.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.240
[Guest]: I love the movie.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.120
[Guest]: Love the movie.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely love the movie.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And I guess if you want any filmmaker to make a film of your book and therefore to be part

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.840
[Guest]: of this list, it's obviously Shottu Jitra.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.600
[Guest]: Yeah, of course, of course.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.240
[Guest]: Hands down.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.040
[Guest]: Like, I can't think of anyone else.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:58.240
[Guest]: And I loved how Choker Bali was done by Ritu Panna Ghosh as well.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.200
[Guest]: Oh, I haven't seen it.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I love the treatment of the film and how he got the essence of the book pat on.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:12.720
[Guest]: So I think, yeah, another movie I would love to be read as a book is Doshar, again by him.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.760
[Guest]: I don't know if you watched it.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.560
[Guest]: No.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.920
[Guest]: Konkona, Sen Sharma and Prasanjit is there.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.840
[Amit Varma]: Brilliant, brilliant movie.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:20.880
[Amit Varma]: So yeah.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.960
[Amit Varma]: That's something to look out for.

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.080
[Amit Varma]: Let's have your next poem.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:24.580
[Guest]: Okay.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.320
[Guest]: Since we're talking about Sputnik, should I give you a quote from that?

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.120
[Guest]: Sure, please.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:29.620
[Guest]: All right.

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:36.480
[Guest]: And it came to me then that we were wonderful traveling companions, but in the end, no more

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.320
[Guest]: than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits.

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.000
[Guest]: From far off, they look like beautiful shooting stars.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.680
[Guest]: But in reality, they are nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone,

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.200
[Guest]: going nowhere.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.800
[Guest]: When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.000
[Guest]: together, maybe even open our hearts to each other.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.720
[Guest]: But that was only for the briefest moment.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.840
[Guest]: In the next instant, we'd be in absolute solitude, until we burned up and became nothing.

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.440
[Guest]: Lovely.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.520
[Guest]: I think he just hits a spot.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.520
[Guest]: And I don't expect him to in any of his books.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.840
[Guest]: In any of his books, he just, they just come out of the pages and grabs you.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:25.600
[Amit Varma]: And you're like, okay, I have to pay attention to what he's writing.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Which books do you wish were made into movies?

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.920
[Guest]: No, those I don't wish.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.680
[Guest]: Like, I'm very skeptical.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.360
[Guest]: I love 100 Years of Solitude.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.280
[Guest]: For example, it was very hard to make something.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but they are, right?

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.040
[Amit Varma]: They've tried.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.640
[Guest]: Yeah, making a series.

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.960
[Guest]: I just hope somebody has understood the book to be able to make it into a series.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.360
[Guest]: And a suitable boy, which I never wanted them to make into a series, but they are.

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.680
[Guest]: So that's something that I don't want.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.320
[Guest]: I wish they would leave some books alone.

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Well, you're not forced to watch it.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.960
[Amit Varma]: And you never know, sometimes they can surprise you in a good way, like with The Dead.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, who would have thought it to make the kind of film?

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.760
[Guest]: Yeah, that's true.

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.280
[Guest]: But like, you know, Bel Canto, they made by Ann Patchett, starring Julianne Moore.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.480
[Guest]: And I haven't watched the movie because I'm scared.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.960
[Guest]: I love the book way too much.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.760
[Amit Varma]: The fear of the cinema hall.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.800
[Guest]: Yeah, like I watched Midnight's Children.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.960
[Guest]: I wanted to puke into a bucket.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.680
[Guest]: It disappointed me so much.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.960
[Guest]: And no, I'm not saying that for the director or the way it is, but it's a big book.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.320
[Guest]: You cannot compress it into two and a half hours of movie.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.760
[Guest]: You have to tell it the way the author meant it to be written.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.360
[Amit Varma]: And to be interpreted.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.520
[Amit Varma]: If you think about it, even with the English patient, the film made that cinematic choice

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.600
[Amit Varma]: of focusing on sort of one particular strand of the book, like the Indian characters, for

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.960
[Guest]: example, very major in the book.

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:55.360
[Guest]: But yes, but not there in the movie.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.560
[Guest]: You know, one book to movie, which I absolutely love is The Namesake.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:08.560
[Guest]: I absolutely love Jhumpa Lahiri's adaptation, as in Miranayar's adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.440
[Guest]: book, which is stunning.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.280
[Guest]: I mean, Tabu and Irrfan Khan and everybody's acted so well.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.240
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah, that's again one of my favorites.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Great writer, great director.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.520
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, a writer I discovered.

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.120
[Amit Varma]: So Jhumpa Lahiri was on this podcast called Conversations with Tyler, with Tyler Cowen.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And in that, she mentioned she was going through this phase where she was learning a new language

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.520
[Amit Varma]: and writing in it, in her case, Italian.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.560
[Amit Varma]: And she spoke about another author called Agatha Kristoff.

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.320
[Amit Varma]: At first, I thought it's a typo of Agatha Christie.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.600
[Guest]: But for a moment, it seemed that way.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.160
[Amit Varma]: So she spoke about an author called Agatha Kristoff, who basically, I think, moved during

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.680
[Amit Varma]: the war to France, if I'm not mistaken, learned a new language and then wrote books in that

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.880
[Amit Varma]: language from scratch.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.760
[Amit Varma]: In her new language, which she learned in her adult life.

01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:01.600
[Amit Varma]: It's a trilogy, I forget what it's called, but it's magnificent, very sort of bare, sparse,

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.560
[Unknown]: minimal language.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.040
[Guest]: You've read it?

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:05.520
[Guest]: I've read it.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.080
[Guest]: Yeah, obviously.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.920
[Guest]: I think the Notebook is the first book.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.880
[Guest]: The Notebook is the first one.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.240
[Guest]: Yes, I remember this one now.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.520
[Guest]: Yes, it just struck me.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.160
[Guest]: Yes.

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:12.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.600
[Guest]: Agatha Kristoff.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.080
[Guest]: Yes.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.200
[Guest]: It's a lovely trilogy.

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.280
[Amit Varma]: And I recommend everyone.

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I have the omnibus copy with all three books.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.840
[Guest]: I think Strand used to sell this one a lot.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.480
[Guest]: Oh, really?

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.440
[Guest]: Strand Fort, man.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I got mine from Amazon.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they used to sell a lot.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.520
[Amit Varma]: And Mr. Shanbhag knew what he was doing after all.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is...

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.240
[Guest]: He knew it right down to the pad.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a lovely... and speaking of a bare, sparse language, do you sort of have specific literary

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.560
[Amit Varma]: tastes which stop you from enjoying certain writers?

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:50.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, in my case, I simply don't like the sort of flamboyant, over-stylized kind

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.040
[Amit Varma]: of writing that say Rushdie and Arundhati Roy do.

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:57.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so I'm much more a kind of person who'll read Vikram Seth or Amitav Ghosh or,

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, and all the Japanese writers, because it might be some

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.000
[Amit Varma]: intrinsic quality in their language, which lends itself to simplicity and minimalism.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.200
[Amit Varma]: But the more flamboyant a writer gets, the harder, even if I can appreciate some of the

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.200
[Amit Varma]: flamboyance, and interestingly, Rushdie's flamboyance is only there in his fiction.

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.800
[Amit Varma]: I find his nonfiction much more readable.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.840
[Guest]: Yeah, his nonfiction, in fact, is very interesting.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.960
[Guest]: But I think for me, nothing of that sort, really.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:30.640
[Guest]: Not really. But I think some writers I just don't veer towards, like I'll never,

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.240
[Guest]: thrillers, I can't stand them.

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.400
[Unknown]: I just don't, just the way it's written.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.280
[Guest]: Just, and not about, I have to wait till the end to figure things out.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.960
[Guest]: But I just can't read a thriller, no matter how hard I try.

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.320
[Guest]: Or horror, for the longest time I couldn't.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.040
[Guest]: But King makes it palpable, so I'll read it.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.200
[Guest]: But otherwise, I won't read horror at all.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Oh, do you read any science fiction?

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.320
[Guest]: Um, yeah, I mean, no, not really.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.640
[Guest]: Science fiction cloaked as fantasy, yeah, sure.

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.640
[Guest]: I'll read, I love that.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.760
[Guest]: But not science fiction, like I can't read Asimov.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.400
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.160
[Unknown]: Just cannot.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.760
[Guest]: But I love Philip K. Dick.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.360
[Guest]: I don't know why.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.240
[Guest]: But, but yeah, I can't answer that.

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:16.080
[Guest]: But I love Philip K. Dick.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.080
[Amit Varma]: If you read someone, like some of the newer guys aren't even, I mean, it's hard to even

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.760
[Amit Varma]: call them science fiction because they're not like how you imagine cliched, hard science

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:24.800
[Guest]: fiction to be.

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.320
[Guest]: People like Ken Liu, have you read him?

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.600
[Guest]: Yeah, Ken Liu, I like a lot.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Paper Menagerie.

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.000
[Guest]: I love that collection of short stories.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.800
[Guest]: Lovely collection.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:31.360
[Guest]: Love that.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.680
[Guest]: Or that three-body problem writer.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Sissin Liu, I don't know how to pronounce it.

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Sissin Liu.

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.880
[Amit Varma]: I've read two books, I have to read the third one.

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.000
[Guest]: Or N.K. Jemisin, who I absolutely adore.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:42.960
[Guest]: Ted Chiang.

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, Ted Chiang, N.K. Jemisin.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.600
[Amit Varma]: On whom Short Story Arrival was made.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.120
[Guest]: He's come up with a new collection, Exhalation.

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which I've got, but I haven't started.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Neither have I, I have to read it yet.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Actually, wait, I've read, I think the title story from it, which is very interesting.

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And the good thing about a lot of these so-called science fiction writers and even a lot of the

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.240
[Amit Varma]: so-called science fiction films that come is that this quote unquote genre is going

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:14.160
[Amit Varma]: to places which other literature doesn't seem to be rushing into so eagerly and asking these

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.840
[Amit Varma]: big existential questions.

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, like even with, say, a film like Blade Runner, you know, the new Blade Runner.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.000
[Guest]: Even Minority Report for that matter.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Even Minority Report or, you know, there's a film called Durs Machina.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.680
[Guest]: Yeah, I've heard of it, but I haven't watched it.

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.320
[Amit Varma]: It's made by Alex Garland.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.920
[Amit Varma]: The guy who wrote The Beach.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.560
[Amit Varma]: The guy who wrote The Beach and Tesseract, which I like more than The Beach.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.240
[Guest]: Yes, Tesseract is a better novel than The Beach, yes, I agree, completely.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.280
[Amit Varma]: So it's a very interesting film.

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:45.520
[Amit Varma]: So like Durs Machina will, for example, go into areas like, you know, how the moral values

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.360
[Amit Varma]: you attach to AI, should you kill an artificial being and so on.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, Blade Runner looked at things like how identity is constructed or the fallibility

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:55.600
[Amit Varma]: of memory.

01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And all of these really big questions are questions that I think science fiction is

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.760
[Amit Varma]: ideally placed to answer because it can take those sort of that one further step that you

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.320
[Guest]: need to take.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:12.400
[Guest]: Like Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness, about gender and about identity and politics

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.200
[Guest]: of gender.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.600
[Amit Varma]: So I'm sometimes like, I'm not a hard science fiction reader in that sense.

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm probably very ignorant about most of science fiction.

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.560
[Amit Varma]: But I do find that it's really unfair to sort of knock something as, oh, this is a genre,

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.600
[Unknown]: like this is sci-fi, or this is crime mystery, or this is whatever.

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.920
[Amit Varma]: When you are asking the big questions and you're doing everything literature should

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.160
[Guest]: do.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.600
[Guest]: That I think makes sense.

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.240
[Guest]: But other than that, I don't think I can read a thriller at least.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:47.280
[Guest]: I read it when I had to read Puzo and Sydney Sheldon, which I love.

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.640
[Guest]: And for the longest time, I thought it was a woman.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Then I figured no.

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Did your uncle pass on his love of Alastair Maclean to you?

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.720
[Guest]: No, I just cannot.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.360
[Guest]: All those guns and weapons and wars, I just cannot.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.680
[Amit Varma]: I find it extremely boring.

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.760
[Amit Varma]: Right now, I'll read out a poem now because we have to get to your next poem.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.120
[Amit Varma]: Before that, we'll have to.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Okay, this is by a poet called CP Savafi.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.080
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:21.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, of course, this particular poem is translated by Edmund Keeley and is called

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.240
[Amit Varma]: The City.

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And much of the first part is actually a quote.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'll say stop quote at the end of it, as I usually do.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.800
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't mean I have stopped.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.080
[Amit Varma]: It means a poem has moved on from the quote to the normal thing.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.800
[Amit Varma]: The City by Constantine Cavafy.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:40.080
[Amit Varma]: You said, quote, I'll go to another country, go to another shore, find another city better

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.040
[Amit Varma]: than this one.

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Whatever I try to do is fated to turn out wrong.

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And my heart lies buried like something dead.

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.360
[Amit Varma]: How long can I let my mind moulder in this place?

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Wherever I turn, wherever I look, I see the black ruins of my life here, where I've spent

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.680
[Amit Varma]: so many years, wasted them, destroyed them totally.

01:48:58.240 --> 01:48:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.240
[Amit Varma]: The poem continues.

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.600
[Amit Varma]: You won't find a new country, won't find another shore.

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Won't find another shore.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.720
[Amit Varma]: The city will always pursue you.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.680
[Amit Varma]: You'll walk the same streets, grow old in the same neighborhoods, turn gray in the same

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:12.400
[Amit Varma]: houses.

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.560
[Amit Varma]: You'll always end up in the city.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.320
[Amit Varma]: Don't hope for things elsewhere.

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.440
[Amit Varma]: There's no ship for you.

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.560
[Amit Varma]: There's no road.

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Now that you wasted your life here, in this small corner, you've destroyed it everywhere

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:23.520
[Amit Varma]: in the world.

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:24.580
[Guest]: Wow.

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.560
[Guest]: It's just something else.

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.280
[Guest]: Spectacular.

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.400
[Guest]: Indeed.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.760
[Guest]: Spectacular indeed.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.760
[Guest]: Reminds me of Ishiguro, for some strange reason, this poem took me to Ishiguro immediately

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.720
[Guest]: and never let me go.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.360
[Guest]: I don't know why.

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:38.960
[Guest]: It just happened.

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.440
[Guest]: I think something's just, and we have to go and reread.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting, you were mentioning how you would go to British Council every

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.120
[Amit Varma]: weekend.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.440
[Amit Varma]: I discovered Ishiguro in these summers in the early 90s, when I was in the hostel in

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Ferguson College, Pune, and I'd walk over for the air conditioning to the British Council

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.960
[Unknown]: library nearby.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.360
[Guest]: And so I read his early books, The Remains of the Day, A Pale View of Hills.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.240
[Guest]: I discovered Actwood also in the British Library.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:06.720
[Guest]: Oh, okay.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.520
[Guest]: There you go.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.360
[Guest]: So there you go.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:09.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.120
[Guest]: Otherwise, I didn't know of her.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.160
[Guest]: So very interesting.

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.560
[Guest]: I mean, you don't know of anyone till you know of them.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.040
[Guest]: Till you know of them, that's true.

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.600
[Guest]: I just, you know, there's this other quote, I'm sorry, I'm quoting.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:30.080
[Guest]: It's called Mother of Pearl by Melinda Haynes, which is about a black man falling in love

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:37.600
[Guest]: or taking care of a 16, 17 year old white trash girl, so to say, as it happens in the

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.120
[Guest]: book, and how the delicate tender relationship they share.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.360
[Guest]: So there's a quote from the book that just stands out completely.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.320
[Guest]: And I love it because it's so relevant to the book that I've written.

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.880
[Guest]: And so I want to...

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.600
[Guest]: Go ahead, please.

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.160
[Guest]: So going by what you do, start quote.

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.200
[Amit Varma]: Or just quote instead of quote, not start quote.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.840
[Guest]: Sometimes partial kindness kills a person as bad as partial knowing.

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:05.040
[Guest]: Judy said this while she hugged the dress.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.880
[Guest]: But then sometimes partial kindness and partial knowing is the two best things in the world.

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.920
[Guest]: Stop quote.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.200
[Guest]: So given that my book is about kindness in a way and knowing in a way.

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:19.840
[Guest]: So yeah.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:23.040
[Amit Varma]: How do you feel about your book now that it's kind of out there?

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:26.560
[Guest]: Like you've been a reader throughout and now this is actually your own book.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.880
[Guest]: I felt I want to disassociate myself from the book only because I feel I'm not done

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.240
[Guest]: justice in terms of writing.

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.000
[Guest]: And then when people quote to me from my book, or they tweet at me with lines from the book,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.280
[Guest]: I feel very awkward.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.120
[Amit Varma]: I am hereby going to make you feel awkward.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to interrupt you and I'm going to read out this very nice sentence from page

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.520
[Amit Varma]: three that early the good writing starts.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Quote, and she was like how the matriarch of a good South Bombay household should be

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.120
[Amit Varma]: honorable and relentless in putting others down, even if it was her own family.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.880
[Guest]: That's a very nice sentence.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.680
[Guest]: I like it.

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:05.200
[Guest]: Kerala matriarch actually came to mind when I was writing, but she was like that.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.800
[Guest]: From what I've also heard, my grandmother was extremely stern and staunch.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:14.560
[Guest]: I think people also to go in a different trajectory.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.040
[Guest]: When they came from Pakistan to India, I think they became hard in the process.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.080
[Guest]: They lost their softness, they lost their innocence.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:26.960
[Guest]: And she was married off really early to my grandfather as young as she was 11.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:36.240
[Guest]: And then when you are young and you experience such pain in leaving home and leaving family,

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.200
[Guest]: I think it just hardens you to a very large extent.

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.520
[Guest]: And then for you to show what you really feel and express yourself so difficult.

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:49.360
[Guest]: And now I understand this, of course, about a lot of people, which earlier I wouldn't.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.600
[Guest]: But back to this, I find it very awkward now that the book is out, honestly, because I

01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.720
[Guest]: don't know how to deal with it.

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.720
[Guest]: I don't know what to do with it.

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:05.280
[Guest]: And then I'm like, just like either I soak in what it has to offer or just rejected like

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.280
[Guest]: a stepchild and not look at it ever again.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.000
[Guest]: But didn't that happen to you when your book came out?

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.800
[Amit Varma]: I think it, as I think I've told you, I wish it had never come out.

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.040
[Guest]: So there you go, it's the same thing.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.440
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, I think I let myself down.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:26.400
[Guest]: No, so when you read so much, Amit, I also feel that you want to, like, I want one perfect

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:26.880
[Guest]: sentence.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.040
[Guest]: I can't find a single perfect sentence in my book.

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:30.000
[Guest]: I just read one out.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:36.160
[Guest]: No, I just want to be like, when you read Munro and then you read Atwood, you read Murakami,

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:45.600
[Guest]: you read people from other languages, writing so beautifully, like Marquez or Isabel Allende

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:46.560
[Guest]: and all those people.

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.520
[Guest]: And you're like, wow, what writing.

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.040
[Guest]: Who are the Indian writers you like?

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.240
[Guest]: I love, I absolutely admire Shanta Gokhale.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.560
[Guest]: I love Shashidesh Pandey.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.120
[Guest]: I love Ghosh's earlier work.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:06.800
[Guest]: I absolutely adore Vikram Seth, Eunice, a big, big, big influence in my life, through

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.600
[Guest]: her writing and through the way she was as a person.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:10.400
[Guest]: She taught you?

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.080
[Guest]: Yeah, no, but, but, but, yeah, but great.

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.600
[Guest]: Just, just absolutely brilliant woman, who Indian, who else do I love?

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.040
[Guest]: I love Niranjana Roy's writing.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:29.840
[Guest]: When, when I read how she talks about cats and the love that she projects into her books

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.880
[Guest]: about them, it just makes my heart sing.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.720
[Amit Varma]: I absolutely love her writing.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:35.760
[Amit Varma]: Very good friend of mine.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.440
[Amit Varma]: And she's just finished her new book.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:37.760
[Guest]: Yes.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.040
[Guest]: But it's not about cats.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.200
[Guest]: I know, but still I can't wait for it.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.560
[Guest]: It's about crime in Haryana.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:43.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.000
[Guest]: So I like Annie Zehdi's work.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.640
[Guest]: I mean, it's like deceptively simple.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Her new novel's just out?

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Yes, Prelude to Arrive.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:51.840
[Amit Varma]: Have you read it?

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.480
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.840
[Unknown]: I enjoyed it a lot.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.400
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:54.720
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.640
[Guest]: So I also like Anita Nair, something magical about her writing.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:05.040
[Guest]: But, but yeah, I look at it from a distance and I love what she does.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.880
[Amit Varma]: And given that you're in Bombay, and I presume that you also do the Lit Festival circuit a

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.040
[Amit Varma]: little bit, you must be meeting writers that you've read and then you meet them.

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.400
[Amit Varma]: And how is that experience?

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:17.760
[Guest]: Is it like, does it change the way you look at it?

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:26.880
[Guest]: You know, I met Andar Jai in Jaipur, and like a fool, I told him to sign on a page of the

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:32.320
[Guest]: English patient that I loved so much, that one line, that if I give my heart to you,

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.120
[Guest]: will you break it?

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.680
[Guest]: Or something to that effect, if I give you my heart, I hope you get what I'm saying.

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.200
[Guest]: He refused to do that.

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:41.840
[Guest]: Why?

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.160
[Guest]: Because he's like, oh, I don't want to sign in the middle of a book.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.840
[Guest]: And I made him and he gave me the dirty look.

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:52.160
[Guest]: And then right after he signed, he didn't sign for me, he didn't say for Vivek, he just

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:55.120
[Guest]: said, whatever, scribbled something, his initials or whatever.

01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.720
[Guest]: In a very dramatic moment, I just gave the book to somebody else and I walked out from

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.000
[Guest]: there in front of him.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:04.480
[Guest]: Ouch.

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.200
[Guest]: But I didn't expect that from him.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.440
[Guest]: I love the guy and I still will always love what he writes and I will pick up what he

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.000
[Guest]: writes.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.320
[Amit Varma]: That's churlish of him.

01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.560
[Guest]: Yeah, but I didn't like the way he behaved.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:20.480
[Amit Varma]: So I think never meet your heroes, never meet your heroes.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.560
[Amit Varma]: You've met Alice Munro, you once told me.

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.640
[Guest]: Yes, I have, it was beautiful.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.640
[Unknown]: It was in Canada.

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.560
[Guest]: I had gone there for something else and I just happened to be in the bookshop where

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.280
[Unknown]: she was reading.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:33.840
[Guest]: I'm very rare that she does this.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.840
[Guest]: But I was just very honored to do that.

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:43.360
[Guest]: I got my copy signed and she was very gracious about the meeting and it was something else

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.080
[Guest]: altogether.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.560
[Amit Varma]: You should have given her the English patient and asked her to sign on that line to see

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.520
[Guest]: if she does it.

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.080
[Guest]: Yeah, she even liked the book.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.520
[Unknown]: I know I loved it.

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:57.920
[Guest]: I still like Andarje a lot, his writing, but I don't think I want to meet him.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:00.880
[Guest]: We all have feet of clay and it's very scary.

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.160
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.040
[Guest]: So I don't want to.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.000
[Guest]: Yeah, but I still want to idealize them.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.360
[Guest]: And that I'll never stop doing.

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.120
[Amit Varma]: Your turn to read a poem.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.560
[Guest]: Yeah, sorry.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:19.840
[Guest]: And last I have with me, it's called Possibilities by this writer called, I don't know how to

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:24.800
[Guest]: pronounce her name, Vistlava Simborska.

01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.200
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I don't know how to pronounce her name either.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.320
[Amit Varma]: It's called Possibilities.

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.240
[Guest]: I'll be very quick with it.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.400
[Guest]: I prefer movies.

01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.440
[Guest]: I prefer cats.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.000
[Guest]: I prefer the oaks along the water.

01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.560
[Guest]: I prefer Dickens to Dostoevsky.

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.200
[Guest]: I prefer myself liking people to myself loving mankind.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.200
[Guest]: I prefer keeping a needle and thread on hand just in case.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.120
[Guest]: I prefer the color green.

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:52.960
[Guest]: I prefer not to maintain that reason is to blame for everything.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:54.880
[Guest]: I prefer exceptions.

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.160
[Guest]: I prefer to leave early.

01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.000
[Guest]: I prefer the old fine line illustrations.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.640
[Guest]: I prefer the absurdity of writing poems to the absurdity of not writing poems.

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:10.880
[Guest]: I prefer where love's concerned, non-specific anniversaries that can be celebrated every day.

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.200
[Guest]: I prefer cunning kindness to the over-trustful kind.

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:18.720
[Guest]: I prefer conquered to conquering countries.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.200
[Guest]: I prefer having some reservations.

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.120
[Guest]: I prefer Grimm's fairy tales to the newspaper's front pages.

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:29.360
[Guest]: I prefer leaves without flowers to flowers without leaves.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:32.480
[Guest]: I prefer dogs with uncropped tails.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.760
[Guest]: I prefer light eyes since mine are dark.

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:41.600
[Guest]: I prefer many things that I haven't mentioned here to many things I've also left unsaid.

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:47.040
[Guest]: I prefer zeros on the loose to those lined up behind a cipher.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.800
[Guest]: I prefer the time of insects to the time of stars.

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.040
[Guest]: I prefer to knock on wood.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.920
[Guest]: I prefer not to ask how much longer and when.

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:02.000
[Guest]: I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility that existence has its own reason for being.

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.000
[Guest]: Just stunning.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.120
[Guest]: She's so good.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:05.920
[Guest]: That's just stunning.

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.640
[Guest]: She's so good.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.960
[Guest]: And to think that she writes in Polish.

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.920
[Guest]: And the translation is wonderful.

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And translation is another fine art by itself because the languages are just so inherently

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.120
[Amit Varma]: different.

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Just thought of, you know.

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.240
[Amit Varma]: And to find that word.

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:23.120
[Guest]: Yeah, and that phrase that will connect with the reader.

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Or more so just the essence of something like, and that's something I've often wondered about

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.960
[Amit Varma]: that languages have their own inherent qualities.

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:35.600
[Amit Varma]: For example, like I mentioned earlier, I think most Japanese writers I read tend to be quite

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.240
[Amit Varma]: minimal and sparse and perhaps that's a quality in the language.

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:44.880
[Amit Varma]: But equally, a lot of the Urdu shairi I love is so overflown and, you know, expressionistic.

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, if you translate them literally, they read like shit.

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.960
[Unknown]: That's true.

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:55.280
[Amit Varma]: In English, they're like shit, because we are attaching a different set, not a better

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.280
[Amit Varma]: set, but a different set of values to it.

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:57.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:58.480
[Guest]: A different set of heuristics.

01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.280
[Guest]: Completely agree.

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.960
[Guest]: Like, I never want fairs to be translated in English ever.

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because it'll be like, what just kind of...

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.920
[Guest]: I'll never read him in English.

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:10.000
[Guest]: Can never think of it in English.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:10.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:12.800
[Guest]: Or Mir or anyone for that matter.

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:13.600
[Unknown]: Amrita Pritam.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.120
[Guest]: Never, can never.

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:18.160
[Guest]: From Punjabi to English, it just wouldn't make sense.

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:18.960
[Unknown]: Yeah.

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:22.480
[Guest]: If somebody tried to translate meh tenu phir milangi, it was a disaster.

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:25.200
[Amit Varma]: I was like, don't, don't even bother.

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.400
[Amit Varma]: I shall meet you again.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.520
[Amit Varma]: I'll be back.

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.400
[Guest]: That was, I mean, that's basically Schwarzenegger saying meh tenu phir milangi milanga.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.640
[Guest]: Now there's a new Terminator movie.

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.160
[Amit Varma]: The Punjabi dubbed version should kindly have these.

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, very true.

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.760
[Guest]: I think we've reached the two hour mark.

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.920
[Amit Varma]: So I'll finish off a poem and then we'll have some final words.

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:50.720
[Amit Varma]: This one is a traditional rhyming type poetry.

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:52.880
[Amit Varma]: So if you guys are wondering what the hell is happening here.

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Rhyme kyu nahi karda?

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:54.640
[Amit Varma]: This one.

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:55.360
[Amit Varma]: Rhyme karda.

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.600
[Amit Varma]: This is called A Long Distance Too by Tony Harrison.

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.160
[Unknown]: Have you?

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:00.880
[Unknown]: No.

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Long Distance Too by Tony Harrison.

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:08.960
[Amit Varma]: Though my mother was already two years dead, dad kept her slippers warming by the gas,

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:13.280
[Amit Varma]: put hot water bottles aside of the bed and still went to renew her transport pass.

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.240
[Amit Varma]: You couldn't just drop in, you had to phone.

02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:21.120
[Amit Varma]: He'd put you off an hour to give him time to clear away her things and look alone,

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: as though his still raw love was such a crime.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: He couldn't risk my blight of disbelief, though sure that very soon he'd hear her key,

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:31.360
[Amit Varma]: scrape in the rusted lock and end his grief.

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:34.320
[Amit Varma]: He knew she'd just popped out to get the tea.

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.600
[Amit Varma]: I believe life ends with death and that is all.

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.200
[Amit Varma]: You haven't both gone shopping.

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:39.840
[Amit Varma]: Just the same.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.960
[Amit Varma]: In my new black leather phone book, there's your name and the disconnected number I still call.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.520
[Amit Varma]: Wow, lovely.

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.320
[Unknown]: It's so good.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And if you see it on the page, it's very interesting what he's done here.

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.720
[Amit Varma]: If you see it on the page, it's got four stanzas.

02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.600
[Amit Varma]: The first three have this rhyme scheme of ABAB and the last one is ABBA.

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And that actually makes a sort of difference in just the effect that the poem has.

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.400
[Guest]: It just touches, that's all.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.680
[Guest]: Yeah, very moving.

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:13.360
[Guest]: I don't know if you, Brian Patton, I don't know if you've heard of him.

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Wasn't he?

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.920
[Amit Varma]: No, no, Chris Patton was in charge of Hong Kong when they handed over.

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.600
[Guest]: Brian Patton writes poetry just like this.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:22.400
[Guest]: It's just beautiful.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.560
[Guest]: Very, very touching.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:25.920
[Guest]: Very soft.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:34.000
[Guest]: I find, you know, in poetry, which is so strange, I find male poets also to have that sense of

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.720
[Guest]: softness sometimes, most of the time.

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:38.080
[Guest]: They're not harsh.

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:44.000
[Guest]: Like when that happens a lot, I find that in prose, when it comes to men who write,

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:50.160
[Guest]: I find that prose sometimes very jarring, like Richard Ford.

02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.640
[Guest]: I don't find him making a point softly, like Murakami will make a point softly.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.480
[Guest]: So I think maybe because of the culture, maybe, I don't know, it'll be very interesting to

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.280
[Guest]: find out why.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.520
[Amit Varma]: But have you read Mary Oliver's poetry?

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:10.160
[Amit Varma]: And have you read this wonderful book, which I recommend all my listeners go out and just

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.920
[Amit Varma]: buy right now, blindly, just trust me.

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.480
[Amit Varma]: But it is called a Poetry Handbook.

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.200
[Amit Varma]: By her only.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.000
[Guest]: By Mary Oliver.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:16.480
[Guest]: Yes.

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.600
[Amit Varma]: Where she talks about, I mean, that got me to appreciate poetry so much more just in

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.720
[Amit Varma]: terms of how poets do their thing and.

02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:26.960
[Guest]: The style and the craft more than anything.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.440
[Guest]: Even this lady, Anne Lamott, if I'm not mistaken.

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.760
[Guest]: Isn't it the lady who wrote the book called One Bird at a Time?

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:36.400
[Guest]: Bird by Bird.

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.560
[Guest]: Just Bird by Bird.

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:40.000
[Guest]: That's on the craft of writing.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.360
[Amit Varma]: Which is on the craft of writing, which is a lovely story.

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:50.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the story that from which the book gets its title is that when they were kids,

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:53.440
[Amit Varma]: she and her little brother, they were with the family at a summer cabin.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And by the time the vacation got over, the kid had to do this sort of homework project

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.080
[Amit Varma]: where he had to, I think, describe birds or paste pictures of birds on a scrapbook or

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.360
[Amit Varma]: whatever by the end of the holiday, and they had ample time to do it.

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.560
[Amit Varma]: But like all of us who face deadlines and react to them the same way as they go, Wu Xing Bai,

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.880
[Amit Varma]: he basically left it for the very last day.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And then the little kid had a near panic attack on the last day because there were so many

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.360
[Amit Varma]: birds.

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And her dad told him just do it, Bird by Bird.

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:23.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.440
[Amit Varma]: And that was it.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.200
[Amit Varma]: And in that vein, I hope that Bird by Bird, you shall also get to your next book and to

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.000
[Amit Varma]: many more books.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:32.880
[Guest]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.160
[Guest]: Thank you so much for inviting me.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.120
[Guest]: It was a pleasure.

02:04:35.120 --> 02:05:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Thanks a lot.

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:15.120
