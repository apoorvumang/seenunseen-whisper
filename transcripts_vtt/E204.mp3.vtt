00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
[Amit Varma]: How do we learn something?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.940
[Amit Varma]: One way is to do what Indians call Rattamaro, rote learning.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.960
[Amit Varma]: Learn some instructions by heart and then hope that works out.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.500
[Amit Varma]: But that's a horrible way to learn anything.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.520
[Amit Varma]: If you want to figure out how to play chess, for example, a good coach won't make you

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.800
[Amit Varma]: memorize theory on day one, E4-C5 is a Sicilian defense, D4-D5-C4 is a Queen's Gambit and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800
[Amit Varma]: so on.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Instead, you should first be taught the basic principles of the game, the importance of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.880
[Amit Varma]: space, of occupying the center, developing your pieces, the importance of initiative

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.440
[Amit Varma]: This way, whenever you encounter an unfamiliar position, you can just apply these principles

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.920
[Amit Varma]: and figure out what to do.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.820
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, a good poker coach won't begin by making you mug up ranges in different spots.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.800
[Amit Varma]: This is your 15 BB shoving range from the hijack.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.480
[Amit Varma]: This is your 22 BB reshove range from the big blind and so on.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Again, you're better off learning broad principles first.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
[Amit Varma]: This should be common sense.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
[Amit Varma]: But it isn't.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.080
[Amit Varma]: So many of us, me included, try to learn about cooking and food by reading and trying out

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.280
[Amit Varma]: recipes.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.320
[Amit Varma]: But to understand the subject, we don't just need to know what to do.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:34.240
[Unknown]: We need to understand why we are doing it.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.480
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is polymath thinker and unassuming artist Krish Ashok.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.200
[Amit Varma]: There has never been a guest on the show who is such a perfect blend of the artistic and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.360
[Amit Varma]: the analytical.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Ashok has been an internet legend in India for over a decade now.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.220
[Amit Varma]: He's known as a brilliant humorist and musician, but he's also a systematic thinker about any

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.280
[Amit Varma]: subject that interests him.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.940
[Amit Varma]: And in this episode, we are going to discuss his brilliant book, Masala Lab.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.240
[Amit Varma]: This is a book that gets meta about cooking.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.720
[Amit Varma]: It takes a step back from the world of recipes and looks into the science behind cooking.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.660
[Amit Varma]: It approaches everything from first principles.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.520
[Amit Varma]: In the process, it shows us why so much of the traditional wisdom about food that we

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.460
[Amit Varma]: get from our grandmothers is bang on.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.320
[Amit Varma]: The book also contains an immense number of TIL revelations, even jaw dropping ones.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.240
[Amit Varma]: I love books that get meta like this, that go back to first principles.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.960
[Amit Varma]: I'd done an episode almost a year ago with Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah on their book in

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.240
[Amit Varma]: service of the Republic, which looked at public policy from a similar meta lens.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.800
[Amit Varma]: And I am now writing a book called Hacking Cricket, which takes a similar approach to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.640
[Amit Varma]: cricket strategy.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.860
[Amit Varma]: That made me warm to Masala Lab right away, as I love books that take this kind of approach.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.480
[Amit Varma]: And Ashok's book is spectacular.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.860
[Amit Varma]: It's accessible, insightful, and inspiring.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, after reading this intro, I'm probably going to head on over to my kitchen.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And I should probably say this in a whisker, but I might just end up making Maggie.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.160
[Amit Varma]: A quick note before we begin, though, we used a specific software I won't name or use again

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.480
[Amit Varma]: for the remote recording of this episode.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And while the sound seemed fine to me through my monitor headphones, my audio file, not

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Ashok's, my audio file got all messed up and distorted.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.480
[Amit Varma]: The conversation was so wonderful that I was pretty upset.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.900
[Amit Varma]: But my editor Vijay managed to salvage it enough for us to be able to release this.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.640
[Amit Varma]: So kindly excuse the quality of my audio.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.240
[Amit Varma]: I hope the quality of the conversation will make up for it.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Before we start, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.600
[Amit Varma]: By the time this episode ends, you'll be dying to dive into the rabbit hole that is food

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.400
[Amit Varma]: and learn more about cooking and cuisines.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.240
[Amit Varma]: The links in the show notes should help you.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.300
[Amit Varma]: But I have one more resource for you.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.400
[Amit Varma]: This episode is sponsored by The Great Courses Plus at thegreatcoursesplus.com.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.300
[Amit Varma]: And I've spent the last couple of days lost inside one of their courses called Cooking

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Across the Ages by Ken Albala.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.800
[Amit Varma]: This course is divided into 24 lectures and discusses cooking and food science and the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.320
[Amit Varma]: various cuisines of ancient Rome, imperial China, medieval France, Renaissance, Italy,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.960
[Amit Varma]: and it takes us into the kitchens of the Vikings and the Aztecs, the Germans and the Brazilians,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.600
[Amit Varma]: mouthwatering stuff.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.520

[Amit Varma]: you listen to podcasts.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.040

[Amit Varma]: Go for it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Ashok, welcome to the Seen and the Unseen.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Amit.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.640
[Amit Varma]: It's been a long time coming.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.960
[Amit Varma]: I have to, by the way, tell my listeners that before the show started, I figured that there

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.680
[Amit Varma]: was an awkward question I had to ask.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.760
[Amit Varma]: So I did not make an awkward mistake through the show, which was to ask Ashok what I should

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760
[Amit Varma]: call him, Krish or Ashok.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.560
[Amit Varma]: And he told me that the correct name to use is Ashok.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.400
[Amit Varma]: So I have saved myself from committing what Ashok would call an Amit mistake.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.320
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to first of all say that how glad I am that you are here.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.160
[Amit Varma]: We have never met in person, but I have been following you all the way since the blogging

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.520
[Amit Varma]: days and all of that.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.840
[Amit Varma]: And when I started the show, I thought it would be great to have you one day on the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840
[Amit Varma]: show.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.400
[Amit Varma]: And we spoke about it a couple of years back and you said, yeah, when you're in Bangalore,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.680
[Amit Varma]: just give me a buzz if I happen to be making a business trip there, we'll kind of do it.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And that never happened.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, who has to leave their city in these crazy times.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to start off with my podcast version of, you know, chop some onions and

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.200
[Amit Varma]: saute them in oil till they get translucent, which is, you know, the cliched way in which

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.280
[Amit Varma]: so many Indian recipes start.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And I like to kind of start my podcast by not talking about whatever the subject in

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.240
[Amit Varma]: question is, but rather by asking my guests about their personal journey, which is specifically

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.280
[Amit Varma]: interesting to me in your case, because even though we'll speak much of this episode talking

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.440
[Amit Varma]: about your wonderful eye-opening book, you're a man of many parts.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I did not know you as a food person back in the day, I knew you as a humorist

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.640
[Amit Varma]: and then a music person.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about your journey.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.360
[Amit Varma]: What's your journey been like so far?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.440
[Guest]: It's been, I mean, nothing tremendously unique about it, except that I was born in Chennai.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.720
[Guest]: And then, but my father had one of those rare Tambaram jobs that involved him getting transferred

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720
[Guest]: all over.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720
[Guest]: And it was actually in business, right?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.120
[Guest]: A very rare thing for a Tambaram family to be in.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.680
[Guest]: And my mother worked in a bank.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.440
[Guest]: And then we literally lived all over India.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.360
[Guest]: So we changed schools every few years and so on.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.960
[Guest]: And so I grew up everywhere.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.440
[Guest]: And my father's side of the family is slightly odd in that his father was an atheist, an

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.160
[Guest]: avowed atheist, which is very strange to be someone like that in the 1930s or 40s, in

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.960
[Guest]: the deep south of Tamil Nadu, a very, very religious place and so on, right?

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.400
[Guest]: I mean, so atheist to the point that he did not allow, you know, idols or any kind of

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400
[Guest]: religious worship in the house.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.400
[Guest]: I mean, he was quite militant about it, right?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.720
[Guest]: And so my father grew up in a very interesting environment.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.080
[Guest]: He later in life, he became pretty religious.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.200
[Guest]: But I think he had that sense that his children should have the freedom to, you know, do what

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.520
[Guest]: they please, in the sense that I think, normally, when you kind of question religious tradition

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.240
[Guest]: and all of that, you know, you'll get a very stern put down, right?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.880
[Guest]: If you're one of these traditional sort of religious families, which I wasn't.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.440
[Guest]: My mother's side of the family is mostly priests.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.560
[Guest]: I mean, what two generations ago, they were just all priests.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.640
[Guest]: And so you can see sort of the contrast, they were just, my mother tried very hard to get

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.840
[Guest]: us to be religious and so on.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.840
[Guest]: So from what you can see on my blog and other things, clearly, that didn't work on any of

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840
[Guest]: us.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840
[Guest]: I mean, there were three of us.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.880
[Guest]: There was me, my middle sibling, who works in Microsoft, and the youngest guy, who's

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.280
[Guest]: a graphic novelist and illustrator and works in China, right?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.760
[Guest]: So you know, I think the mother's side of the family is also predominantly musical,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.400
[Guest]: in the sense that a ton of her female relatives are all professional musicians.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.080
[Guest]: And so obviously, I think music was something that I had to learn the violin.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.240
[Guest]: I had no choice.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.360
[Guest]: It wasn't very enjoyable when I was eight or nine years old.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.680
[Guest]: It's a painful instrument to play.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.840
[Guest]: It takes six or seven years before you like the sound of what you're playing.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.520
[Guest]: In fact, you know, later in life, I tend to rate musical instruments by an acronym called

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.380
[Guest]: mean time to sonic palatability, which is that, you know, a keyboard is that you pick

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.200
[Guest]: it up, and it'll sound decent, you know, in about five minutes, right?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.720
[Guest]: But a violin takes, you know, six or seven years, and it's quite painful.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.960
[Guest]: But I think once I kind of got the hang of it, I became reasonably good.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.240
[Guest]: And I was actually, through my college, I was actually learning under a very famous

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.480
[Guest]: violinist who recently passed away, Padma Bhushan TN Krishnan, right?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.360
[Guest]: And he was one of those serious guys who said, you know, you need to quit your engineering

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.800
[Guest]: and come join me, you know, become a professional musician and so on.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.320
[Guest]: And you know, my father said, not quite sure, right?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.160
[Guest]: So he kind of, he was smart enough to realize that this is a very long day, in that very

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.840
[Guest]: few people become very successful and the rest is, you know, we didn't have quite have

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840
[Guest]: the connections as well.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.440
[Guest]: And this is one of those very insular, Carnatic music is one of those kinds of places, right?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.600
[Guest]: You still needed connections, you know, you still had to be reasonably rich and so on.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.680
[Guest]: So I think, you know, that's how my musical journey kind of began.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.800
[Guest]: I was, till my mid-20s, I was still thinking, should I do a full-time career in Carnatic

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.720
[Guest]: music or not, right?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.000
[Guest]: And then, you know, one thing led to another, I essentially picked up a profession that

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.360
[Guest]: I felt at that time was the, you know, in the late 90s, was the most amount of money

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.920
[Guest]: for the least amount of effort, which is software, right?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.680
[Guest]: And also the one that kind of gave me the most amount of free time to pursue other things,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680
[Guest]: right?

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.640
[Guest]: I mean, in 1999 to 2000, having Saturday and Sunday off was a rarity, right?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.760
[Guest]: And the IT industry was literally the only, you know, one that actually had this sort

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.760
[Guest]: of thing.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.600
[Guest]: So I joined TCS straight out of college.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.240
[Guest]: I went to, so what is now called Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology used to be called

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.680
[Guest]: DIT, part of the Delhi College of Engineering, sort of this thing, right?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.760
[Guest]: And I, you know, I worked in software and I, every five years, every time I would get

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.880
[Guest]: bored, I mean, I just had the fortune of having a boss who said, yeah, I'll give you something

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880
[Guest]: interesting to do.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.880
[Guest]: And so it's good.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.480
[Guest]: So, you know, the sense that I've been with my job for almost 21 years and I absolutely

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
[Guest]: love it.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.680
[Guest]: I mean, it is, although it's my livelihood and it pays for all of the fancy stuff that

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.520
[Guest]: I have at my studio, but it's a job that I would not think of giving up, despite the

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.680
[Guest]: fact that I have all these other hobbies.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.360
[Guest]: And hobbies is something that I kind of continuously picked up.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.520
[Guest]: I was living in the US for about seven years.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.120
[Guest]: That was when I started seriously getting into Western music, kind of learned composition,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.200
[Guest]: went to a conservatory and learned to play the keyboard, started learning the guitar

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.080
[Guest]: from YouTube, the first generation of YouTube and so on.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.000
[Guest]: And I think I've watched more YouTube bars than most people.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.840
[Guest]: So I watch it at, you know, two to three X.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.680
[Guest]: So I, you know, so I get through a lot of it.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.240
[Guest]: So I think, so that is how I started getting into a lot of these hobbies.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.480
[Guest]: I was always into writing or human writing since school, it was mostly cheesy stuff,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.240
[Guest]: but it was, I think it was around 2008 when the financial crisis happened and my father's

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.720
[Guest]: business kind of went under and it was actually a bad time.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.200
[Guest]: And so he was terribly under debt and, you know, we were all sort of struggling to stay

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.300
[Guest]: afloat and I had to sort of use every little bit of my sort of financial resources to sort

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.700
[Guest]: of, you know, bring things back under control.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.320
[Guest]: That was actually when I decided, fine, you know what, as an outlet, let me sort of, you

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.000
[Guest]: know, go on to social media and start expressing those and get that kind of feedback.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.880
[Guest]: Before that, I was a very private person, I still am in the sense that I don't, I don't

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880
[Guest]: go to parties.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.440
[Guest]: I don't sort of, I don't like small talk and so on, but I enjoyed, you know, putting out

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.040
[Guest]: crazy creative stuff and, you know, engaging with people online.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.360
[Guest]: And that's when, you know, I ran into you.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.720
[Guest]: You were one of the superstars of the Indian blogging environment already when I just started

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720
[Guest]: blogging and so on.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.080
[Guest]: And I think that that generation of people who kind of, you know, started expressing

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.560
[Guest]: these interesting ideas and had the feedback from people.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.800
[Guest]: So that is how I started blogging and then I used that medium as a, I was always into

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.440
[Guest]: sort of more visual creativity.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.800
[Guest]: So I like making a lot of pictures and Photoshop memes and, and also mixing music and visuals

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800
[Guest]: and so on.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.640
[Guest]: Amidst all of this, I mean, I was always cooking, right?

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.480
[Guest]: So I was always someone who learned to cook very young when I was a teenage boy, my mother

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
[Guest]: was working.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.320
[Guest]: So when she was either away or on travel, I would be the one to cook at home.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.840
[Guest]: So I was always there.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.480
[Guest]: It's just that I started sort of taking the science part a lot more seriously, I guess

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.840
[Guest]: about seven or eight years ago, which is when I started, I would say writing down pieces

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.520
[Guest]: that ultimately went with this book didn't come together in like, you know, just the

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.520
[Guest]: first three months of the pandemic.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.520
[Guest]: I noted down a lot of things that ultimately, you know, I did a lot of experiments at home

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.280
[Guest]: to be able to over time sort of write this book, right?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.560
[Guest]: So that's, that's been my journey.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I found fascinating about the book, in fact, the thing that I

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.160
[Amit Varma]: really liked about it, particularly is that this is not about, you're not giving us gyan

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.640
[Amit Varma]: about food or giving us recipes or whatever, you're taking a step back getting meta, just

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.400
[Amit Varma]: talking about, you know, the sort of the first principles that animate the art and craft

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
[Amit Varma]: of cooking.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And I was drawn to that, because that's something that I tried to do in some of the various

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.360
[Amit Varma]: things that I've done, whether it was, you know, playing poker, or whether you know,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.580
[Amit Varma]: the first thing I tell people who do my writing course is that, listen, I'm not going to give

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.680
[Amit Varma]: you a bunch of guidelines, like I'm some kind of Sri Sri writing Shankar and these are the

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680
[Amit Varma]: 10 commandments.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.080
[Amit Varma]: But let's get back to first principles.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, build our own frame.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, is this way of thinking something that is inherent to how you approach everything?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, even learning music, where first you start the violin as a kid, and I guess

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.640
[Amit Varma]: it's in the Carnatic tradition, where as you have pointed out, not much is codified, a

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.240
[Amit Varma]: lot of it is just like passed on from guru to shishya and so on you, you know, you wrote

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.760
[Amit Varma]: in your book about how Indian cooking is so much like Indian music in that sense, that

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.760
[Amit Varma]: there is no codification.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.080
[Amit Varma]: It's almost treated as a mystical art that has to be passed on, whether it is from a

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.080
[Amit Varma]: grandmother in the kitchen, or from an ustad with whom you sort of go and learn.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.640
[Amit Varma]: So did you always have that kind of mindset that you're trying to break things down, you're

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.640
[Guest]: taking a step back and thinking of stuff?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.920
[Guest]: I mean, I've always greatly enjoyed science, right from when I was very young, especially

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.600
[Guest]: physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, all of it, I think the one caveat being that

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.560
[Guest]: I was not such a big fan of speed, right, in the sense that a lot of your entrance exams

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.920
[Guest]: really test for speed, right?

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.480
[Guest]: I mean, I like solving very complex physics problems over a day, as opposed to 50 problems

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.120
[Guest]: in 90 minutes, which I was very bad at.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.400
[Guest]: And in that sense, so when I attempted to do that, it was almost always since I was

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.760
[Guest]: very bad at memorization.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:09.080
[Guest]: So very early, I really had sort of picked up this habit of trying to kind of derive

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.040
[Guest]: first principles so that I could derive anything I wanted rather than memorize.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.880
[Guest]: So this was something that was always there.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.040
[Guest]: In a sense, it also served me well in my software career, because that's basically it, right?

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.920
[Guest]: At the end of the day, you're trying to solve a very, very hard and complex problem with

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.120
[Guest]: people who are largely very young, inexperienced, are going to write terrible code.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.760
[Guest]: So therefore, you need to really get down to first principles, and you need to let the

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.240
[Guest]: process be documented to the point where you don't blame the person.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.280
[Guest]: But your software is still, you know, does what it needs to do, right?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.200
[Guest]: So I think, you know, a lot of the approach of the book, in some sense, is also that.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.960
[Guest]: So it's algorithmic, it's really, you know, rather than memorize or learn, you know, recipes,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.040
[Guest]: is there a more simpler way to break it down or to teach people?

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.840
[Guest]: And in a sense, this is the reason I saw that this was an opportunity in the Indian cooking

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840
[Guest]: space.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.840
[Guest]: Because there's a fair number of food science books in the West, you know, Kenji Alt Lopez

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.240
[Guest]: and Harold McGee and others, and have really broken down a lot of Western cooking, largely

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.340
[Guest]: European cooking, if you will, into into very, very granular, easy to understand principles

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.320
[Guest]: with a great amount of precision.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.120
[Guest]: And for some reason, that's not there for Indian cooking, and you know, it's not surprising.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.960
[Guest]: Most cooking is and was largely done by women with little choice in the matter at home.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.640
[Guest]: And you know, till about 50-60 years back, they did not have access to education either.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.320
[Guest]: So and we are largely an oral tradition, you know, kind of culture, and so very little.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.640
[Guest]: So it's literally think about this, right?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.360
[Guest]: So this, you can, you can literally name just one, you know, famous cookbook called the

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.840
[Guest]: Manasolasa written like in the 12th century, in Sanskrit by the Chalukyan Empire.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.440
[Guest]: And even that really doesn't get into the specifics, it doesn't get into clearly the

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.280
[Guest]: guy writing it, probably never cooked, right?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.960
[Guest]: I mean, it was, you know, apparently written by the emperor himself.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.780
[Guest]: So clearly he didn't cook, right?

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.920
[Guest]: But what's interesting is that there seems to be a complete lack of craft, if you will.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.240
[Guest]: So that's the distinction I make, right?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.440
[Guest]: So art is something it's crutable, it's exotic, you know, it's, you just need to get it, it's,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.720
[Guest]: you have a new intuitive sense, and so on.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.780
[Guest]: But craft is, craft needs documentation, craft needs precision, craft needs explanations

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.440
[Guest]: for why you're doing what you're doing, right, as opposed to, and also a sense of a lot of

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.120
[Guest]: the grandmother's wisdom, tacit wisdom ends up being right, it works, but you know, we

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.040
[Guest]: don't know why it works.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: And in the internet misinformation universe that we have, it's now becoming increasingly

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.440
[Guest]: hard to figure out, you know, what is actually verified and what is unverified.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, like turmeric curing COVID and so on and so forth.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.160
[Amit Varma]: A tangential question, since you mentioned art and craft, is that my sense of art and

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.800
[Amit Varma]: craft has increasingly come to be that, that is really not much of a difference.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.240
[Amit Varma]: The key difference is that art is that part of the craft, which you haven't thought about

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.440
[Amit Varma]: consciously or can't articulate, but they amount to the same thing.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, since you're a musician as well, I'll ask your opinion in that context, that,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, in music, also, I am sure you can sort of take a step back and get back to first

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.660
[Amit Varma]: principles that these combination of notes, spark of, you know, these effects in the brain,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.280
[Amit Varma]: and that is why we find them pleasant, and we find something else noisy, and blah, blah,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280
[Amit Varma]: blah.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And I think part of the art of coming up with something that sounds pleasant, is actually

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.320
[Amit Varma]: using this internalized knowledge, which you haven't yet put into words or articulated.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And whatever you can articulate automatically becomes craft, because you can, you know,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.080
[Amit Varma]: and I'm just kind of thinking aloud, but what's your sense of this?

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.240
[Guest]: I think it's, you know, I would say music, and other sort of traditional arts, if you

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.280
[Guest]: will, be a drama or film or anything, right?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280
[Guest]: Works slightly different.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.760
[Guest]: Definitely, I think, you know, if yes, culinary arts is there, but I would, we're really talking

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.600
[Guest]: about a Michelin star or a famous chef who's creating something that you simply cannot

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.200
[Guest]: reduce down to just the technique and so on.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.240
[Guest]: There is clearly something magical about that inspiration, just like, you know, you can

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.280
[Guest]: analyze jazz music all you want, right?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.800
[Guest]: But the reality is that when jazz music came out onto the stage in the 20s, and so on,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.840
[Guest]: a lot of Western classical musicians and critics were like, this is just atonal, this is violating

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.800
[Guest]: every bit of harmony theory that we knew.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.640
[Guest]: But yet, I mean, it really just went on to become the predominant popular form of music,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.200
[Guest]: and it actually influenced classical music.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.000
[Guest]: You know, the last stage of Western classical musicians, the Shostakovich, you know, a lot

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.840
[Guest]: of the Russian composers and so on, Mahler and others, really stopped doing the usual

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.840
[Guest]: formulaic harmony arrangements and started doing things that sounded a lot more jarring

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840
[Guest]: and so on.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.320
[Guest]: And if you will really set the stage for, you know, the kind of cinematic music that

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.560
[Guest]: you hear from say Hans Zimmer, or anyone or John Williams, so that you kind of set the

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.840
[Guest]: mood in a way, because you need a wider range, you need to be a lot more experimental beyond

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.080
[Guest]: just what the rules of harmony tell you, right?

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.120
[Guest]: And that in a sense, that's true for, you know, a painting or sculpture, so on.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.040
[Guest]: It's hard to break down, say, the David in Florence, just down to the fact that it's

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.680
[Guest]: about these are the proportions and that the distance between the eyes and so and so, there's

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.080
[Guest]: a golden ratio involved in all of this.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.160
[Guest]: So there's, you know, all that post-facto analysis to try to make craft out of an art

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.680
[Guest]: is definitely is a very common phenomenon in other kind of arts.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.960
[Guest]: In this case, the only distinction I want to make is that I think cooking at home should

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.520
[Guest]: not be that, because at the end of the day, it's a high pressure daily thing that you

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.780
[Guest]: do three times.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.780
[Guest]: It should not be art.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:29.080
[Guest]: It should not be something that you need to be mentored by a seasoned person for many

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080
[Guest]: years to learn.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.160
[Guest]: It should be something that you can just pick up quickly, because at the end of the day,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.760
[Guest]: you know, cooking by yourself, fixing your nutrition is one of the single most important

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.680
[Guest]: things that you will do from a health standpoint, right?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.120
[Guest]: And so in that sense, I think that's the distinction I'm trying to make.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.880
[Guest]: As I clearly say, the book is not aimed at making you a great chef.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: It's aimed at making you a better home cook.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.540
[Guest]: And home cooking is an engineering discipline.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.240
[Guest]: It should not be like art.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.840
[Guest]: It should not be this inscrutable thing.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.760
[Guest]: Yes, of course, right?

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.680
[Guest]: Even in home cooking, you know, you sometimes have these, you'll remember your grandmother

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.320
[Guest]: or your mother or some relatives, fantastic, you know, a chicken biryani or a dal or something

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.320
[Guest]: like that.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.280
[Guest]: But remember that a lot of that has to do with nostalgia.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.960
[Guest]: Our perception of flavor is done in the same part of the brain that processes nostalgia

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960
[Guest]: and memories.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.840
[Guest]: And this is something that I call out in that flavor chapter.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.760
[Guest]: So that's why your restaurant dal can't compete with your grandmother's dal, not because it's

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.960
[Guest]: objectively better, because you simply have better memories of it.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.840
[Guest]: And once it's tied into those memories and memories are formed, that's what, you know,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.920
[Guest]: that's what enhances the experience of food itself.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:36.920
[Guest]: So it is very much, you basically, for the most part, that's the sort of magical experience

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920
[Guest]: you're thinking about.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.920
[Guest]: It's not art.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.240
[Guest]: That's really just, you know, neurology, if you will, right?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.320
[Guest]: The craft essentially is fundamentally about saying, look, you know, there is a documentation

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
[Guest]: problem.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.000
[Guest]: People tell you things like cook, you know, tamarind till the raw smell goes away.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.480
[Guest]: Those are terrible instructions.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.080
[Guest]: You know, how does that translate into writing?

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.160
[Guest]: How does that translate into knowledge that you can actually pass on to someone else?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.120
[Guest]: Because you can't literally describe smells in that.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.100
[Guest]: But you can say, you know, cook the tamarind till it tastes as sour or as less sour as

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.100
[Guest]: you like it.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
[Guest]: That's a better instruction, right?

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.800
[Guest]: I mean, if you want to be really precise, if you're in the food industry, you will say

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.360
[Guest]: use a pH strip and measure to see if the pH is between 4 or 4.5, because all great food

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.280
[Guest]: is typically in the range of 4 to 4.5 pH.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.560
[Guest]: I mean, that's what, you know, chefs and Western food scientists have said.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.920
[Guest]: But yeah, so that's the idea is to bring some basic level of craft and engineering and better

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.840
[Guest]: knowledge if you will, to what is essentially a very daily laborious activity.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840
[Guest]: And so that's, that was the point.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.640
[Amit Varma]: No, what I was kind of getting at is that craft is underrated, you know, people will

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.660
[Amit Varma]: often have this hierarchy where art is up there and is mystical and blah, blah, blah.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.040
[Amit Varma]: And craft is below that you're just going through the motions.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.440
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that's really unfair that ultimately, you know, the finest art is what

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.400
[Amit Varma]: will eventually one day perhaps become craft when people understand it well enough.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the book, a sort of a final question that is not to do with the book or

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:01.360
[Amit Varma]: not to do with food, which is, I'm very curious about your methods of knowledge management

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.640
[Amit Varma]: and how you organize all of that, like, and also a tangential question that how do you

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640
[Amit Varma]: listen at 3x?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.840
[Amit Varma]: You once mentioned that you listen to my podcast at 3x.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when I tell others that I myself listen in between 2 and 2.5, they're like,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960
[Amit Varma]: how can you do that?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, no, the brain normalizes everything.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And I listen to all YouTube at 2x, by the way, except that you, you mentioned you listen

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.640
[Amit Varma]: to YouTube at higher, but there is no higher setting in my YouTube thing.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640
[Guest]: Sure.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.520
[Guest]: So essentially, I think, you know, knowledge management is something that I've paid a lot

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
[Guest]: of attention to.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.520
[Guest]: So again, something that I've learned from one of my bosses at TCS, who's now the chief

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520
[Guest]: technology officer.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.360
[Guest]: And he was, he was big on what he called personal project management.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.440
[Guest]: He said that people are great at, you know, following other people's project plans, but

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.680
[Guest]: they don't have a project plan of their own.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.640
[Guest]: Do you know how much time you spend on reading?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.440
[Guest]: Do you know how much time you spend on, you know, talking to others, right?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440
[Guest]: Do you have the right balance?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440
[Guest]: Right.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.520
[Guest]: So I think in a sense that I kind of got serious about efficiency of learning, if you will,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520
[Guest]: as an individual.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.160
[Guest]: And I, you know, let me be absolutely clear here.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.280
[Guest]: I don't recommend that other people simply blindly follow this at all.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
[Guest]: It works for me.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.320
[Guest]: And you know, it's, it's something I like doing.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320
[Guest]: I have multiple interests.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.080
[Guest]: It's not for everyone, but in general.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.360
[Guest]: So one of the things I do is that there's this Edgar Dale sort of pyramid of learning,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.480
[Guest]: which is something that, you know, pedagogy teachers tend to use, right?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.240
[Guest]: So if you read something, apparently you remember about 10% of it.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.080
[Guest]: And if you watch a video, you remember 20% and if there's a live demonstration, you remember

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080
[Guest]: 30%.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.160
[Guest]: And ultimately go on to, if you teach someone else, you remember 90%.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.040
[Guest]: So it's sort of, it's this sort of pyramid, and even within that, what you read on screen,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.120
[Guest]: you retain a lot less than if you read on paper.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.960
[Guest]: So there's this sort of big pyramid, right?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.720
[Guest]: So I'm always sort of, I'm very wary of the fact that I don't want to only consume content.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.600
[Guest]: So it is important that if I watch a video on say, some kind of, you know, illustrations

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.480
[Guest]: and digital illustrations, which I did, you know, because I drew a fair bit of the illustrations

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480
[Guest]: in the book itself.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.680
[Guest]: I had to learn it, right?

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.960
[Guest]: And so it's just watching hours and hours of videos not help.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.120
[Guest]: So I'd have to sort of break it down into saying that, look, I'm going to pick the top

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.560
[Guest]: videos and then I'm going to basically in increasing order of difficulty, draw illustrations

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.080
[Guest]: that are more and more difficult.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.160
[Guest]: So similar to how you learn music, you learn Papa Kehta Hit on the guitar as the first

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.080
[Guest]: song and then you kind of get into, you know, Pink Floyd or something more sophisticated

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.320
[Guest]: later, right?

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.600
[Guest]: So it's essentially the same.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.920
[Guest]: So the second thing is around, I had a colleague who was visually challenged and he was one

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.160
[Guest]: of my colleagues who used to work on some of the applications that we used to build

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.400
[Guest]: some years back.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.200
[Guest]: And he was working with us to test for accessibility, right?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.880
[Guest]: So are these web applications accessible to people, you know, with visual disabilities

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880
[Guest]: and so on.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.080
[Guest]: And that's when I learned that how they actually use the web is use something called a screen

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.280
[Guest]: reader, right?

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.920
[Guest]: It's this thing that they wear, headphones that they wear, and literally it reads out

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.840
[Guest]: the HTML code on the page.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.920
[Guest]: And so one, so you need really clean HTML code or it'll be a mess.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.080
[Guest]: And two, so that the navigation and the menu and all of that is there.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.920
[Guest]: And by the way, because you know, and they do not have any other distractions, it reads

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.280
[Guest]: it at six to seven X, the normal voice to me, it was just complete gibberish.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.720
[Guest]: And he said, yeah, he was able to get it.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.200
[Guest]: And he said something rather mind blowing.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.920
[Guest]: He said that at six X, right, he can listen to an audio book faster than a sighted person

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.920
[Guest]: can read.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.920
[Guest]: And above average sighted person can read, they said, look, if blind people can read

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.840
[Guest]: books faster than me, then clearly I think there's some improvements to be made.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.040
[Guest]: I wasn't aiming for six X, but I said, okay, you know, let's start with two X.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.160
[Guest]: Yours was one of the harder podcasts, because I think as Indians, we tend to speak faster.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.640
[Guest]: The American podcast, you know, the NPR stuff, et cetera, is what I started, you know, increasing

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: the speed to 1.5 and slowly, gradually, you kind of get used to it.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Guest]: In fact, when I came into the podcast, I realized that I've never heard your voice this slow

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.320
[Guest]: ever, right?

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.720
[Guest]: Because I've heard your voice for the last two years, and I've only heard it at three

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720
[Guest]: X, right?

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.280
[Guest]: So that was a funny moment there.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.520
[Guest]: So obviously I kind of, you know, therefore I realized that, you know, I could consume,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.640
[Guest]: I could learn more, but I also have to do stuff.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.120
[Guest]: And then I also have a, I have a very specific style of documenting or noting down things

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.120
[Guest]: in a way that I'll remember that, right?

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.680
[Guest]: I've tried all kinds of tools and ultimately just decided on, I mean, I've used a Mac,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.000
[Guest]: so I just use notes there.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: It's not great.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
[Guest]: It can sometimes be buggy.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: I've tried Evernote.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.920
[Guest]: I've brought all those kinds of Google Keep and all of that, just settle down on, just

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.080
[Guest]: take down notes under different topic areas in terms of, you know, facts that I think

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.440
[Guest]: that I want to remember because they would be useful to sort of share when I talk to

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440
[Guest]: someone, right?

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.440
[Guest]: Or learning journeys.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.600
[Guest]: So if I find, so I use the Watch Later functionality really well.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.160
[Guest]: So I say, hey, it's a one-hour lecture by, say, Daniel Kahneman, okay, I'm going to watch

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.960
[Guest]: it at some point of time, or David Graeber or someone else, right?

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.120
[Guest]: And so the other is also in a sense of figuring out the time of the day so that I'm not sitting

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.300
[Guest]: and doing this like all day, right?

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.300
[Guest]: So I need that balance.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:45.360
[Guest]: So there's work and since the pandemic, so, you know, I have childcare duties, you know,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.600
[Guest]: I have to spend, you know, two to three days of the week shepherding my son through his

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.680
[Guest]: online classes, otherwise he'll kind of get distracted and so on, and cooking and all

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.920
[Guest]: of that so that, you know, I time box it so that, you know, there's a, I have that constraint

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.920
[Guest]: as well, right?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:04.400
[Guest]: And in a sense, there's a lot of synesthesia, I constantly kind of think about what, I hear

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.040
[Guest]: some music and try and see what it reminds me of visually and so on.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.640
[Guest]: So I kind of note those things down because I have a terrible memory, right?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.040
[Guest]: So now a lot of it, a lot of management is foundationally about writing stuff now.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.840
[Guest]: So which is why it wasn't too hard to write this book, because I had like a ton of thoughts

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.840
[Amit Varma]: for the most part.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, that's completely fascinating.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.560
[Amit Varma]: I like these days, I'm using something I find pretty useful called Rome Research.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.560
[Guest]: Have you tried it?

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560
[Guest]: I was told.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.000
[Guest]: One of my, one of the designers I worked with did recommend, I did see, I have not given

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.400
[Guest]: it a try yet, sort of mind mapping and not taking kind of tool or?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.440
[Amit Varma]: Mind mapping is one part of it, but it does a couple of things.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.560
[Amit Varma]: The first of which many other apps will also probably provide, the first of which is, you

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.200
[Amit Varma]: can have these nested little sections, which is a good way of organizing stuff.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.400
[Amit Varma]: But the second is bi-directional linking, which is useful to me, because then it seems

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.320
[Amit Varma]: that over a period of time, as you input more and more, all of these connections form between

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.320
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.320
[Amit Varma]: And I just find that a much bit like earlier, I used to take notes for my episodes on Microsoft

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.320
[Amit Varma]: Word.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's just a mess.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And you use Scrivener while writing your book.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320
[Amit Varma]: How did that help?

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320
[Guest]: That was actually fantastic.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.840
[Guest]: So Scrivener is, before I set out to write, I was like, okay, you know, what tool should

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840
[Guest]: I use?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840
[Guest]: I had used Scrivener in the past.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.480
[Guest]: In fact, I used to use Scrivener when I was still actively writing my blog.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.080
[Guest]: So I used to jot down these ideas, interrelated ideas, because there were several themes that

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.640
[Guest]: used to repeat across posts and so on.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.180
[Guest]: So I used to kind of use Scrivener.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.640
[Guest]: So essentially, I think what I liked about Scrivener is that it really focuses your thought

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.920
[Guest]: on structuring how you want to think about the narrative, as opposed to the visual.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.120
[Guest]: One of my everlasting gripes with Microsoft Word or, you know, PowerPoint, right, it's

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.160
[Guest]: that it forces you, in a way, to constantly think about the visual representation of something

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.480
[Guest]: as opposed to purely the flow and the narrative, right, which is actually why academics tend

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.760
[Guest]: to use, you know, the tools of, it's called Latex and so on, right?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:04.000
[Guest]: So it separates it out into two tools, one for writing content, which has no visual representation

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: at all.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.560
[Guest]: You just get your white paper down, and then you do formatting and typesetting only at

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560
[Guest]: the end, right?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.440
[Guest]: So in a sense that I think, you know, Scrivener really sort of forces that mindset.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.280
[Guest]: So it first allows you to lay down the layout of the book, you dump all your research, lay

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.800
[Guest]: down the chapters.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.760
[Guest]: And I think my favorite part of the fact was the fact that it gamified the entire process

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.160
[Guest]: of saying that, hey, set a target.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.600
[Guest]: You want to write 3,000 words a day, set it, right, and I'll tell you how you're doing.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.320
[Guest]: And then it sort of kept me motivated to really just quickly get through to about 60,000 pages.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.920
[Guest]: And I think it tremendously helped.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.600
[Guest]: In fact, I had to do very little restructuring after I moved out of Scrivener into Word,

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.080
[Guest]: because that's how Penguin or any other publisher really works.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.360
[Guest]: They work on Microsoft Word, but track changes and so on, right?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.720
[Guest]: So that's how the industry works.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.920
[Guest]: But I think we never really had to do anything major, you know, once I came out of Scrivener,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.520
[Amit Varma]: I think it was fantastic.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.760
[Amit Varma]: And just in terms of sort of getting your style down, like, again, a final sort of question

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.800
[Amit Varma]: in writing, you know, and you've also said in another interview that you've thought fairly

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.400
[Amit Varma]: deeply about science writing, especially from and you were talking about the pyramid earlier

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.320
[Amit Varma]: where you know, your 90% of absorption happens when you teach it to someone.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.720
[Amit Varma]: I think the phrase you used in one of your earlier interviews was explain it to me like

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720
[Unknown]: in five.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, so how hard was it then to like, how hard was the process of writing, or, you

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.120
[Amit Varma]: know, just relentlessly practicing this kind of writing through the years, did it make

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.660
[Amit Varma]: it much easier than it would otherwise have been?

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:39.320
[Guest]: So there's, in a sense that my first drafts of some of the chapters, I did a fair amount

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320
[Guest]: of rewriting.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.080
[Guest]: And the reason for that was because I think the tone and the language and the style was

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.760
[Guest]: very similar to what you might find on my blog, right?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: So I was always thinking about two things.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.720
[Guest]: So there's, you know, there's, there's, there's a style of writing that I keep for the blog,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.160
[Guest]: which is sort of humorous, snarky, a lot of pop culture references, sarcastic and so on.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.760
[Guest]: And then there's, you know, the style of writing that I would often do either at work, when

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.080
[Guest]: I'm really putting down and explaining something to someone, and so on, or when I'm writing

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.040
[Guest]: a column, used to write columns for the Hindu and Indian Express back in the day, simple

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.280
[Guest]: science and technology columns.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.600
[Guest]: And clearly, I think the editor then and there said that, you know, don't show off your humor

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
[Guest]: here, right?

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.080
[Guest]: If you're aiming to educate, you know, focus on that, throw in the odd joke, but the explaining

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.720
[Guest]: part has to be the important part.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.880
[Guest]: And so in a sense, I ended up rewriting the first couple of chapters, because I felt that

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.800
[Guest]: it was more in my blog style, it was more snarky, more jokes.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.840
[Guest]: And then my editor also was like, over time, as I started rewriting, and my inspiration

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.480
[Guest]: was largely Bill Bryson, right?

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.200
[Guest]: Bill Bryson, in my opinion, is one of the absolute best writers of nonfiction, purely

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.280
[Guest]: for a couple of things.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.360
[Guest]: One is how he's able to explain complex scientific ideas to people who may not have a science

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.360
[Guest]: background.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: That's number one.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.120
[Guest]: And yet he does it with a tremendous amount of warmth and humor, in just the right amount,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120
[Guest]: right?

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.400
[Guest]: In a way that it doesn't get in the way of, you're not trying to show off your humor,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.400
[Guest]: right?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.520
[Guest]: I mean, so I, you know, in a way that, you know, if I, if I look and read back some of

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.240
[Guest]: my blog posts from, say, 2008 or 2009, it now feels like I was trying to show off that

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.040
[Guest]: I was funny, rather than it didn't come naturally, right?

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:15.040
[Guest]: So I was, so in a sense that I did a first couple of chapters, and then in reality, because

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.640
[Guest]: of my, you know, decade-long or multi-decades-long sort of experience of literally breaking,

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.640
[Guest]: understanding everything only by first principles, it actually came easier.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.760
[Guest]: So I ended up being far more productive.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.080
[Guest]: I didn't have to stop to think, okay, what joke can I make here, right?

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.320
[Guest]: It just came naturally in the sense of, you know what, it's easier for me to explain thermodynamics

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.600
[Guest]: to you without calculus, explained like M5, than with calculus, which, which implies that

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.120
[Guest]: I need to remember some of those things I remember at a higher level, right?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.240
[Guest]: I would rather just go right down to the fact that, look, you know, there's, there's heat,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.040
[Guest]: there's, there's electrons and these particles, they're colliding with each other, they transfer

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.640
[Guest]: heat and they transfer energy and so on.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.640
[Guest]: That's a far more intuitive way, if you will.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.880
[Guest]: And I think some of my inspirations were obviously, you know, people like Feynman and others who

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.760
[Guest]: really had a way of explaining things without expecting that you had a science degree, right?

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.720
[Amit Varma]: So I think that was the general style.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.560
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I'm glad you didn't cut all the humor out because, you know, the book has

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.200
[Amit Varma]: these delightful light touches throughout and just to give the listeners a taste of

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.440
[Amit Varma]: that, I'm going to read out a couple of lines, which I absolutely love.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.320
[Amit Varma]: And here Ashok writes, quote, learning to cook by reading recipes is like trying to

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.680
[Amit Varma]: learn chemistry by only reading equations or the biographies of chemists.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.200
[Amit Varma]: Imagine walking into a chemistry lab and finding an instruction textbook that says, quote,

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.320
[Amit Varma]: bring to a gentle simmer the exotic melange of oxalic acid and the righteous colors of

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.840
[Amit Varma]: potassium peranganate, stop quote.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.240
[Amit Varma]: You would probably respond with, quote, can we do a little easy on the adjectives and

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.480
[Amit Varma]: stick to explaining how and why things work, stop quote, which is almost like, I think,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.880
[Amit Varma]: a representative summary of the entire book.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880
[Amit Varma]: So you don't.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.360
[Amit Varma]: So at what point did you actually then start thinking that, like, was there a moment where

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you felt that there should be a book like this and there isn't?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.440
[Amit Varma]: So why don't I write it?

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Or was it rather people coming to you and saying, hey, you write so wonderfully about

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.520
[Amit Varma]: food, why don't you do it?

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.840
[Guest]: How did the book kind of take concrete shape?

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.920
[Guest]: Funnily enough, I sent Penguin two proposals.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.080
[Guest]: So you know, Mansi Subramaniam has been sort of pursuing me for a while, right?

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.080
[Guest]: So I was, I was busy at work, I somehow kind of didn't get into the frame of mind to say

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.680
[Guest]: commit to this and say, let me do this, right.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.480
[Guest]: And actually, to be honest, let's say three or four years back, I still had this sort

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.280
[Guest]: of weird post digital notion that books are dead and you know, self publishing and I'm

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.520
[Guest]: not a fan of how the publishing industry treats artists, you know, authors and so on.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.640
[Guest]: So I had this idea that if at all I do something, I'll do something very unique, it'd be an

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: interactive book, it'll be somewhere halfway between a book and a video game.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.880
[Guest]: So those are the kinds of crazy ideas that I had.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.160
[Guest]: I mean, not that I had time to actually, you know, put it down and so on.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: Obviously, I mean, those youthful ideas gave way to the fact that ultimately realized that

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.320
[Guest]: look at the end of the day, books are books, books have been around, books have been the

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.120
[Guest]: predominant preeminent form of transferring knowledge for mankind.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.560
[Guest]: I mean, at least widely for the last 500, 600 years, but you know, since the dawn of

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.080
[Guest]: you know, writing and so on, right.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.320
[Guest]: So clearly, I think my first proposal was not for the food science book.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.840
[Guest]: It was actually an afterthought.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.960
[Guest]: So she basically said, send me some ideas, and I'll tell you which ones which I think

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.120
[Guest]: might work, right.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.880
[Guest]: So my first proposal was a speculative science fiction, sort of set in India, you know, six

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.280
[Guest]: or seven stories whose synopsis I had already written a while back.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.600
[Guest]: So I kind of said, hey, sort of speculative fiction, near future science fiction, addressing

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.680
[Guest]: a lot of these very typical Indian themes about how caste might intersect with sci fi

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.080
[Guest]: themes and so on, right, those kinds of things, right.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.920
[Guest]: And I wrote that.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.160
[Guest]: And then after that, as an afterthought, she said, yes, I sent me a nonfiction one also,

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160
[Guest]: right?

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160
[Guest]: I said, Okay, what do I write in nonfiction?

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.440
[Guest]: You know, what, what are my areas of expertise, if you write, I didn't want to write about

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440
[Guest]: software or anything like that.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.320
[Guest]: So I said, Okay, I mean, the next I could either write about music, which, which I've

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.400
[Guest]: always found is very hard to write about.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.840
[Guest]: Music is, is, you know, Tim Krishna is a fantastic writer, which is why I enjoy it.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.880
[Guest]: Because I think he's, he's not only talking about the music, right?

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.720
[Guest]: He's also talking about the social and the cultural and the wider historical aspects

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720
[Guest]: of it.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.720
[Guest]: And I said, No, I don't have that background.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.920
[Guest]: I mean, I can't write about music in the same way he does, right?

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.240
[Guest]: So I said, you know, hey, you know what, I let me combine two of my other favorite passions,

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.600
[Guest]: science writing and cooking and let me put together a, that was the time when I had bought,

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.800
[Guest]: you know, Kenji Lopez's Food Lab and, you know, the Lord of the Kitchen, I think Harold

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.800
[Guest]: McGee and so on.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.040
[Guest]: And I was so I was blown away by the fact that they had really reduced a lot of these

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.920
[Guest]: cooking principles into very simple, explain like in five sort of explanations.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.160
[Guest]: And I said, Okay, fine, you know what, I'm going to do this.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.040
[Guest]: And I quickly put together a proposal as an afterthought.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.260
[Guest]: And, and she got back immediately said, I want the food book, we'll do the fiction later.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.760
[Guest]: So so that that's how the whole thing actually kind of started.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.360
[Amit Varma]: I'd love to read the fiction also as well.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.600
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, so kindly get down to it at some point in time.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've started this book about this really charming story about how you ask your grandmother

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.920
[Amit Varma]: for a recipe, and she gives you the recipe.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And then she says, there's one ingredient, I kind of forgot to tell you about, and that

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:17.480
[Amit Varma]: is patience, you know, which is both deeply true and also indicative of the way, you know,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.200
[Amit Varma]: there's almost this kind of mystical aura about this art of cooking that later in the

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.720
[Amit Varma]: book, you're right, quote, Indian cooking in particular is supposed to be an art wrapped

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.800
[Amit Varma]: in oriental mystique, soaked in exotic history and deep fried in tradition and culture.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Western food is supposed to be scientific and bland, while Indian cooking, we are told

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.800
[Amit Varma]: is all about tradition and flavor, stop code.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.960
[Amit Varma]: So what was your process of kind of, like, you know, I imagine that you are, again, as

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.440
[Amit Varma]: in music, someone who's first exposure to food would be Indian food, but then you you're

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.280
[Amit Varma]: eating everything else.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, can you tell me about, like, is there an aha moment where you start thinking

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.120
[Amit Varma]: about food in a different way?

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Or when do you sort of start taking that step back and looking at these first principles

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.920
[Amit Varma]: and looking at it in a meta way and deciding that you need to figure this out?

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.200
[Guest]: I think so for me, that moment, obviously, first is it has to be the fact that exposure

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.360
[Guest]: to other kinds of cooking, clearly one, I mean, I, I grew up in a strictly vegetarian

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.200
[Guest]: no garlic household.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.800
[Guest]: But my father and my grandmother were like, you know, make sure that you eat everything

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.640
[Guest]: outside so that, you know, you don't suffer by being too restrictive, right?

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.440
[Guest]: And so obviously, by exposure to food outside, my home was pretty much during my high school

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.480
[Guest]: and college days, eating at Kareem's, you know, kebabs and so on.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.040
[Guest]: So that was obviously the first exposure to food outside.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.520
[Guest]: And obviously the realization that so there are styles of cooking that can actually bring

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.680
[Guest]: about so many other different kinds of flavors beyond just the narrow confines of cuisine

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680
[Guest]: at home.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.680
[Guest]: And that's fascinatingly enough.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.120
[Guest]: And I often tell this to people that Indian vegetarian cooking is not an afterthought.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.040
[Guest]: It's not like meat dishes minus meat.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:40:00.240
[Guest]: It is an entirely original, ultra rich cuisine that has evolved over thousands of years in

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:07.120
[Guest]: really extracting flavors without the advantages of the umami advantages of meat from vegetables

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.280
[Guest]: and all these ingredients.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.760
[Guest]: So it's by no means, you know, the flavor profile of food at home was, was less.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.000
[Guest]: My mother was a fantastic cook and as well as my grandmother, I mean, it was a fantastic

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Guest]: cook again.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.400
[Guest]: So one was obviously exposure to food outside.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.680
[Guest]: And then I lived seven years in the US and then that obviously opened up, you know, the,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.760
[Guest]: uh, a lot more avenues and, you know, had an opportunity to obviously eat Thai food

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.040
[Guest]: and Chinese food and Mexican food and a lot other, you know, and pizza whenever I wanted

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040
[Guest]: it and so on.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.300
[Guest]: Um, and, and share, uh, and also over time, the realization that trouble that my grandmother

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.400
[Guest]: was having writing down recipe, it kind of stayed with me for a while.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.280
[Guest]: She was finding it hard to kind of say how much exactly you said, well, I just, you know,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.200
[Guest]: I just use a sense of, you know, just salt to taste, you know, or, uh, so a lot of the,

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.840
[Guest]: the Tamil expressions for, of ingredient sizes are not in spoons because people didn't have

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840
[Guest]: spoons.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.880
[Guest]: So they're all based on the configuration of your fingers, right?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.240
[Guest]: Well, paddy is actually sort of your, what you can hold in your fist, right?

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.240
[Guest]: Um, and then other words to describe what you can hold in two fingers, other, you can

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.700
[Guest]: hold a small pinch and so on.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.680
[Guest]: So there's very specific, there's a language that kind of describes how much you put based

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.360
[Guest]: on that, and she would essentially use that kind of thing.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:21.200
[Guest]: And I realized one that if, if she's able to cook without this kind of broad adherence

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.480
[Guest]: to authenticity or recipe and so on, maybe there's nothing to that, right?

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:30.480
[Guest]: So the fact that all food writing is just all recipes, and if you read it, you kind

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.280
[Guest]: of get a sense that if you put more than that, one fourth teaspoon of the powder, it will

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.920
[Guest]: taste different is fallacious, but a lot of beginners think it is important that a lot

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.100
[Guest]: of beginners think that the sequence is important and so on.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:46.040
[Guest]: So I think the aha moment, I think happened over a period of time when I essentially realized

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.920
[Guest]: that a lot of Indian cooking and I contrasted to specifically baking, which is a lot more

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920
[Guest]: precise.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.160
[Guest]: And if you don't get the proportions, right, you know, and there's no undo button for a

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.520
[Guest]: cake or a bread, a lot of Indian cooking is in a sense that you, you can fix stuff, right?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.040
[Guest]: You can get to the same kind of rich flavor in a million different ways with different

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.280
[Guest]: ingredients where you can replace a ton of things, right?

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280
[Guest]: And it'll still be fine.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.280
[Guest]: Right?

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.000
[Guest]: And so, and the recognition that no two homes have the same recipe for a biryani or the

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.880
[Guest]: same recipe for a sambar, and yet people are still crazy about this is the authentic, oh,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.360
[Guest]: you add, somebody actually said to me that you add ginger and rasam, we never add ginger

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360
[Guest]: and rasam.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.360
[Guest]: I said, that's fine.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360
[Guest]: What's wrong with adding ginger and rasam?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360
[Guest]: I mean, many people do.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360
[Guest]: Right?

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.540
[Guest]: In my home, for example, my mother would not add garlic in rasam, right?

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.600
[Guest]: And yet in Tamil Nadu, garlic and rasam is quintessential.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.420
[Guest]: I mean, that's really what really gives out that kind of taste and so on.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:45.200
[Guest]: So therefore the realization that a lot of these recipes are not quite capturing the

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.320
[Guest]: kind of better knowledge that is actually useful.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.900
[Guest]: They are kind of painting a picture of authenticity and specificity where none existed.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.040
[Guest]: And so, which is why I said, do you know what?

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.000
[Guest]: I think there's a way to step back and think, okay, can I instead think of a generic way

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
[Guest]: of making rice, a generic way of making a gravy, a generic way of making a cooking meat

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Guest]: and so on.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.240
[Guest]: So that felt like a far more useful thing to really aspire.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, I had done an episode ages back with Vikram Doctor about Indian food.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the things I've realized by reading Vikram's columns in your book also

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.240
[Amit Varma]: has a lot of that is that pretty much everything we cook with came from outside, whether it

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.960
[Amit Varma]: is a tomato or the chilies or the potatoes or whatever.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.080
[Amit Varma]: So what even is authentic?

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.560
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and that seems to be a pet peeve of yours, because you've come back to it a

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.880
[Amit Varma]: couple of times in your book about this snobbery about authenticness.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your time as a cook.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Because at one point in your book, you write, quote, cooking is essentially chemical engineering

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:50.280
[Amit Varma]: in a home laboratory, known as a kitchen with an optional lab coat, known as an apron, stop

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280
[Amit Varma]: quote.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And elsewhere, you speak about the importance of if you want to learn how to cook of doing

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.080
[Amit Varma]: A-B testing, where you cook a particular thing one way, and then you cook it another way.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.320
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes, you know, in the same session, you divide it into two.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And you also kind of pointed out that how when a recipe talks about, you know, how many

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.320
[Amit Varma]: whistles there should be in a pressure cooker, that's basically nonsense, because it depends

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.520
[Amit Varma]: on what kind of gas you're cooking with, and the whistles will be differently spaced in,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.100
[Amit Varma]: say, an induction cooker and all of that.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.800
[Amit Varma]: So as a cook, were you someone who, perhaps when you started going abroad, just started

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.080
[Amit Varma]: it in a utilitarian way of like, we just fix something for myself, so I can have something

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.080
[Amit Varma]: hot now?

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Or did you then get curious, and were you always kind of experimenting around and doing

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.080
[Amit Varma]: A-B testing with every meal?

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.080
[Guest]: Well, no.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.640
[Guest]: So I think the A-B testing part probably started a little bit later.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.560
[Guest]: I mean, in the early days, it was just, just functional as utilitarian, as you said, I

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.800
[Guest]: just wanted to make sure that I just eating, you know, outside or eating pizza, or burgers

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.240
[Guest]: every day in the US was not going to be a healthy lifestyle.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.160
[Guest]: So and by the way, those are designed to be so addictive, that it's incredible.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.980
[Guest]: I mean, it is really hard to not, you know, eat pizza every day or want to eat pizza.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.720
[Guest]: So it started out that way.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.200
[Guest]: And obviously, it also started out and remember that this was the year, you know, 2000-2001.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.520
[Guest]: The way I lived in Texas, there was just one Indian grocery store, which was tremendously

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.920
[Guest]: expensive and you wouldn't get all the ingredients that you needed, particularly, you wouldn't

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.400
[Guest]: get South Indian ingredients, right?

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.280
[Guest]: So shop was run by a Punjabi gentleman and you know, and he would get curry leaves once

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.440
[Guest]: in like two months, and he would charge like some $8 for this tiny dried a bit of curry

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440
[Guest]: leaves.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.280
[Guest]: And I kind of, you know, got to thinking about, look, I need to be able to replace these ingredients.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.640
[Guest]: It's obvious that if someone says that I cannot make sambar, because I don't have this dal

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.200
[Guest]: or I cannot make sambar because I don't have curry leaves, or if I don't have a specific

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200
[Guest]: ingredient.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:43.440
[Guest]: So clearly, I think it started out that way, which over time, essentially became this wider

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.560
[Guest]: principle that look in the best recipe for your dish is, is what you make with the ingredients

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.440
[Guest]: you have on a given day.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.760
[Guest]: It's the technique that matters.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.560
[Guest]: It's to an extent, maybe there are some dominant ingredients, I do agree that the flavor of

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.680
[Guest]: curry leaf is very hard to replicate, although, you know, I subsequently did discover that

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:08.440
[Guest]: if you have grated lime zest and basil, and Italian basil, you can kind of approximate

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.120
[Guest]: some of the flavor profile of a curry leaf and so on.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.160
[Guest]: But yeah, I mean, that's like much later.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:19.120
[Guest]: So in a sense, I think a lot of this was started out utilitarian, and then later reached a

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.000
[Guest]: point where I would say about a decade or so ago, I started writing down every day what

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: I was cooking, right?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.240
[Guest]: So broadly, nothing too much, I would just say, hey, you know, I made this, and just

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.760
[Guest]: note down the things that I kind of observed, like for instance, for example, not entirely

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.560
[Guest]: not necessarily the entire recipe, right?

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.240
[Guest]: So if I'm making chapati, I would say, look, I used about 80% water, and it turned out

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.240
[Guest]: to be quite dry.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.240
[Guest]: Right?

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.640
[Guest]: So the next day, therefore, you know, the next time I would try 90% and say, hey, it's

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.000
[Guest]: turned out to be slightly better.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.040
[Guest]: So same thing with dal and so on.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.040
[Guest]: And then I would try replacements, right?

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.000
[Guest]: Like for example, if you don't have tamarind, you can use vinegar, I mean, at the end of

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
[Guest]: the day, it's an acid.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
[Guest]: And vinegar is actually fantastic.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.240
[Guest]: And in fact, coconut vinegar and other vinegars are actually fantastically, you know, very

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.240
[Guest]: flavorful.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.200
[Guest]: You can actually make a rasam with vinegar if you don't have tamarind, right?

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.720
[Guest]: So in a sense that also over this time, I started documenting replacements, right, saying

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.000
[Guest]: that if you don't have this, you can obviously use this at the end of the day, this is the

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
[Guest]: function it plays.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.560
[Guest]: So, you know, you can do it, right?

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:17.200
[Guest]: You don't have curd to marinate your meat, no worries, marination does very little.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.680
[Guest]: Just use your lime juice and spices and then focus on brining the meat, which adds a lot

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.680
[Guest]: more flavor.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.600
[Guest]: And that way, you know, you can focus.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.600
[Guest]: So it was essentially a lot of daily documentation.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.280
[Guest]: I kind of also talk about it in the methodology section saying that, look, I don't want people

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.160
[Guest]: to read this book and go, oh, this is the exact way to cook rice.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.200
[Guest]: And this is the absolute precise, if I do this exactly in 10 minutes, it will happen.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.280
[Guest]: Remember that, you know, it's as much as I say, it's a laboratory, it's not, right?

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.400
[Guest]: A laboratory has standardized conditions.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.040
[Guest]: They use like standardized equipment, standardized conditions, standardized temperature.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.760
[Guest]: It things that work for me in a Chennai climate, you know, 30 Celsius indoor, humid all through

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.800
[Guest]: the year will work very differently in other climates and with other ingredients and so

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800
[Guest]: on.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.680
[Guest]: So, but it's better you learn kind of like the method of how you test for different ingredients

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.080
[Guest]: on different days, do that AB testing, and then figure out, okay, this is the way I like

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080
[Guest]: it.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.080
[Guest]: And then sort of, you know, tick mark.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.600
[Amit Varma]: So as I said, it's, it's a lot of data.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's completely fascinating.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And even what you just said about, you know, one of the myths that you busted in the book

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.200
[Amit Varma]: is that marination is important and actually, you know, nothing seeps through the meat and

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.480
[Amit Varma]: gives it flavor, even if you keep it for 24 hours and you pointed out why grinding is

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.180
[Amit Varma]: much more effective and what's more important is you pointed it out in chemical terms.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.800
[Amit Varma]: So one can imagine the dance of elements and protons and all of that and come to the taste

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:33.080
[Amit Varma]: that one comes to, let's kind of start talking about the book and I found the first chapter

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:38.400
[Amit Varma]: very fascinating because, and it seemed to me that it must have been kind of the toughest

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.880
[Amit Varma]: to write because, you know, that's where there is so much science happening.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's all about energy and heat and conduction and convection.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Then you talk about the four major chemical reactions and all of that.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about, you know, why you decided to start with this subject in your first chapter

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.640
[Amit Varma]: to begin with and how you tackled the difficulties that arose while you were writing about it.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.720
[Guest]: I would say about 30% of the time that I took to write the book was, went to the, went to

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.720
[Guest]: the first chapter.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.880
[Guest]: The other ones were relatively simpler because they were focused on very specific things.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:13.520
[Guest]: And the first chapter was important because it was, I had to kind of decide how far back

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.640
[Guest]: do I go in terms of the basics, right?

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.040
[Guest]: You know, and at the same time, I didn't want it to be gratuitous just to show that I understood

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.280
[Guest]: thermodynamics, right?

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.640
[Guest]: The usefulness of understanding conduction and convection in the kitchen is only in the

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.640
[Guest]: context of you understanding how a stainless steel pan works differently from a cast iron

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.280
[Guest]: works differently from an aluminum or something else, right?

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.640
[Guest]: And knowing that is useful because you, it's less likely that you'll burn your food, right?

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.320
[Guest]: It's less likely that you'll be able to estimate how much time to cook something.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.760
[Guest]: So again, part of the problem is that recipes will tell you cook for eight minutes or whatever

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760
[Guest]: it is.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.200
[Guest]: They don't necessarily tell you exactly at what levels of heat and in what material and

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.180
[Guest]: all of these, all of these actually impact, right?

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.520
[Guest]: So one, I knew that I wanted to talk about basics of materials and basics of heat transfer,

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:04.320
[Guest]: just so people know that in a sense, I really wanted to kind of highlight to people that

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.760
[Guest]: if there's one skill worth mastering to make you a better cook, forget all the rest of

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760
[Guest]: the stuff.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.840
[Guest]: It's master temperature.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.280
[Guest]: Get a good sense of what happens when, and trust me, you'll become a better cook without

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.400
[Guest]: even learning anything else, right?

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.840
[Guest]: Just understand when eggs cook, when meat cooks, when vegetables cook, starches cook,

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.560
[Guest]: when water boils, when Bayard reaction happens, and when deep frying happens, and that's,

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.160
[Guest]: that's really it, right?

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.960
[Guest]: And if you understand this and you can see visually, because I don't expect everyone

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.320
[Guest]: to have a thermometer, although I recommend that you buy a thermometer, but it's not necessary.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.200
[Guest]: You can kind of see, you know, when starch gelatinizes, it kind of becomes softer and

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200
[Guest]: so on.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.280
[Guest]: When meat, proteins denature, they become hard, right?

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.200
[Guest]: Which is why chicken is so easily overcooked all the time, right?

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.680
[Guest]: And so that's the reason why I sequenced the first chapter, roughly the order of what I

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.520
[Guest]: think was the most important skills you needed in the context of the Indian kitchen.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.720
[Guest]: So, which is why it starts with heat and materials and pressure cooking, and then goes into rice,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.200
[Guest]: because, you know, more people eat, you know, rice is the single most consumed grain, a

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.260
[Guest]: staple food in the Indian subcontinent.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:12.640
[Guest]: So rice, and then wheat, and then, you know, vegetables, and then meat and eggs and fat,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640
[Guest]: right?

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.880
[Guest]: Because these are things you're going to encounter almost every other day, right?

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.920
[Guest]: So you kind of get those basics, right?

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.520
[Guest]: And then, of course, I can then talk to you about spices and acids and, and browning and

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.400
[Guest]: all the other fancy umami and all the other things much.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.000
[Guest]: So that's how I kind of sequenced the first chapter.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, it was, it was quite fascinating.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you, you know, later in the book, I was struck by this pithy quote,

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.840
[Amit Varma]: cooking is a strategic application of heat to transform an ingredient into a narrow range

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:44.360
[Amit Varma]: of acceptable flavors, and more importantly, textures, stop quote, and I was struck here

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.960
[Amit Varma]: by the phrase acceptable flavors.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the things that again, where you've taken that sort of meta step

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.240
[Amit Varma]: back and you looked at is that we tend to assume that, you know, there is something

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:01.360
[Amit Varma]: absolute in terms of judgment about x tasting good and y tasting bad and all of that.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is that all of these are kind of contingent on the circumstances in which

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.560
[Amit Varma]: we evolved.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, for example, like you've pointed out that we don't like, you know, alkaline

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of tastes and substances, whereas it's the other way around with acidic and there

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.800
[Amit Varma]: is an evolutionary reason for why we are the way we are.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So there's no sort of, we are basically catering to the way that we are wired in terms of taste.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Whenever we kind of make food, you want to talk a little bit about this, because this

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.640
[Amit Varma]: is sort of a very interesting aspect to me, because then what it implies is that figuring

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.720
[Amit Varma]: out food begins with figuring out human beings, who we are and how, you know, how we evolve

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720
[Guest]: and so on.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.400
[Guest]: I think, you know, one of my all time favorite books is this book called Neuro Gastronomy.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.520
[Guest]: In fact, I read it much after I wrote the book, but I was just obviously struck by,

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.400
[Guest]: because I'd read a lot of the kind of white papers that he cites in the book when I did

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400
[Guest]: the research for my book.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.080
[Guest]: But clearly, when I read the book, I think it kind of, you know, it's a fantastic book.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:09.320
[Guest]: So essentially, he talks about how we perceive flavor and it is, there are just so many layers,

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.320
[Guest]: right?

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:16.800
[Guest]: So for starters, the fact that flavor is 80% smell, it's only 20% taste, you know, from

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.160
[Guest]: a pure contribution standpoint, and you can only taste five things, right?

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.800
[Guest]: You know, salt, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.560
[Guest]: And then, but you can taste, you can smell apparently close to 10,000 different odors,

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560
[Guest]: right?

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:34.400
[Guest]: And so your olfactory cortex plays a tremendous role in how you combine both taste and smell,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400
[Guest]: right?

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.000
[Guest]: So for example, something like a cardamom actually tastes bitter.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.560
[Guest]: So if you have a cold, if you have a bad cold, right, but you can't smell it, cardamom will

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.520
[Guest]: just taste bitter.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.200
[Guest]: But it's a combination of the taste, the mouthfeel, and the aroma that really sort of makes the

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200
[Guest]: whole thing.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.640
[Guest]: So things like, say, how saltiness and sweetness amplify other tastes, right?

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.160
[Guest]: So if you actually have cardamom with a pinch of salt or a pinch of sugar, it'll taste,

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.980
[Guest]: it'll smell more cardamom-y, right?

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.960
[Guest]: So there's a tremendous one, a lot of the tasting actually happens in your brain.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960
[Guest]: So that's the fun part, right?

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.520
[Guest]: And the amazing thing is that it's one of those weird senses where all the experience

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.720
[Guest]: is happening in your brain, right?

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.320
[Guest]: And with sensors mostly in your nose, but the brain needs to fool you into thinking

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.240
[Guest]: that it's all happening in your mouth, because otherwise it'd be very odd, right?

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.640
[Guest]: Because it's one of those very bizarre senses.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.520
[Guest]: So when you touch something, you know, it's your hand that is touching it.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.120
[Guest]: And you know, so that's how other senses work.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.480
[Guest]: You see it, you see it with your eyes, right?

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.440
[Guest]: So it's not, your brain doesn't perceive that you're seeing it with the back of your head

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.440
[Guest]: or something.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.440
[Guest]: But taste is bizarre.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.960
[Guest]: Taste is bizarre, flavor is bizarre, because you eat with your mouth, and when you break

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:42.320
[Guest]: down these molecules, they go through the back of your mouth into the retronasal sort

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.960
[Guest]: of olfaction, as it's called, because most of the taste of food comes from not you smelling

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.720
[Guest]: inside, but from the molecules actually going from behind your mouth up to those same receptors.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.200
[Guest]: And then the brain has to combine taste, this mouthfeel, and everything else, and give you

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.800
[Guest]: the illusion that all of it's happening in your mouth.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.960
[Guest]: So it's a very, so one, it's very, very individual.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.800
[Guest]: There are gender variations.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.400
[Guest]: Women have more olfactory receptors.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.280
[Guest]: Women have higher density of taste buds on average.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.960
[Guest]: Again, there are exceptions, but on average, right?

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.760
[Guest]: There are sometimes cultural variations, which also account for things like salt, for example.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.720
[Guest]: So one of the common questions that beginner cooks have is, how do I estimate salt?

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.640
[Guest]: It's very hard, because salt is one of the things that you cannot undo, right?

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.320
[Guest]: All those tricks that they tell you that, you know, hey, if I've over-salted something,

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.840
[Guest]: other than add water, more water, you can't actually fix it, right?

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.960
[Guest]: So the amount of salt is always a tricky thing, right?

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.520
[Guest]: But Western food scientists have actually figured out that for American tastes, between

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.760
[Guest]: one and 1.5% by weight of the food is a good place to start for precision, right?

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.840
[Guest]: I mean, if you, but you're not going to weigh everything in your kitchen all the time.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.720
[Guest]: But then again, if you really think about it, right, most of the weight of everything

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.240
[Guest]: in your cooking pan is the weight of water.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.120
[Guest]: Water is the heaviest thing, and it's most of food is water, okay?

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.640
[Guest]: And so therefore, if you have a mental heuristic of being able to estimate volume and therefore

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.840
[Guest]: weight of water, you can actually get very, very good at estimating salt and things like

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840
[Guest]: that.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.800
[Guest]: If you kind of know that, you know, hey, this, by the way, this cup is 200 ml, that's 200

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.480
[Guest]: grams of water, because water's density is one, right?

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.960
[Guest]: Likewise, you know, if you have a pot that has about, say, half a liter of water, then

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.320
[Guest]: you know a gravy that's about three-fourths is about, say, 350 grams of water.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.960
[Guest]: Even if it's a dish or sambar, you can literally just assume that it's mostly just the weight

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.560
[Guest]: of water, right?

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.000
[Guest]: So therefore, you can actually, therefore, use that kind of mental heuristic to estimate

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.680
[Guest]: salt and so on, and this varies by culture, by the way, right?

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.240
[Guest]: So Indians clearly like food a lot more saltier, and we are also okay with food that is a lot

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:49.040
[Guest]: hotter, right, in terms of chilies.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.440
[Guest]: Other people may not have that sensitivity, and likewise, a lot of the aroma, because

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.240
[Guest]: it's related to nostalgia and so on, some of these things are very hard to fix.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.040
[Guest]: Like, for example, a lot of Indians find it very tough to deal with the smell of, say,

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:08.040
[Guest]: fish sauce in Southeast Asia, or the smell of certain kinds of meat in China and so on,

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.400
[Guest]: because a lot of those smells, let me take another example, right?

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.680
[Guest]: So you take dried fish, which is a quintessential smell in Chennai, if you're near the seacoast

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.680
[Guest]: and so on.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.360
[Guest]: Dried, tiny fish are essentially the only fish that the fisher folk can afford, right?

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.360
[Guest]: Because the larger fish tend to be sold to the rich people.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:28.120
[Guest]: The larger, less tastier, largely useless fish, they get the umami bomb, tiny, you know,

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.080
[Guest]: the dried fish and so on, that one of those sulfurous molecules in fish can be detected

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.920
[Guest]: in like one molecule in a quadrillion.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.200
[Guest]: I mean, that's how sensitive we are, right?

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:43.360
[Guest]: But if you are someone from the seaside, you're used to eating fish all the time, your sense

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.440
[Guest]: of detecting that is going to be at a much weaker level, in the sense that you'll need

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.960
[Guest]: much, much more for you to be able to detect.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.360
[Guest]: But people who don't eat fish can smell it from a mile away, and they don't like it,

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.360
[Guest]: right?

00:57:54.360 --> 00:58:00.640
[Guest]: So there's such a tremendous sort of individual variation, your own state of mind itself.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.960
[Guest]: I think, you know, people taste food differently when they're stressed, people taste food differently,

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.000
[Guest]: depending on their moods and many other things.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.280
[Guest]: And now, you know, famously, with COVID, you can also get anosmia, which is that you lose

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.120
[Guest]: the ability to smell for a long time.

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.160
[Guest]: In fact, it has actually affected the careers of some chefs who have taken months to get

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.800
[Guest]: their sense of smell back and they can't cook without their sense of smell and so on.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.320
[Guest]: So in a sense that this is such a, the reason I say that this is a, is that acceptable is

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.120
[Guest]: because it is acceptable to you as an individual.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.280
[Guest]: And why is it acceptable to you for many reasons, history, nostalgia, your own making, your

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.440
[Guest]: gender, your conditioning, your culture, a ton of other things, right?

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.640
[Guest]: So that's what, so some people will like brinjal really mashed up and some people find it very

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.800
[Guest]: slimy and they need it crunchier and some people will find that very raw, right?

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.800
[Guest]: It's just that there's such a tremendous variation individually that it's, it's just completely

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.920
[Guest]: pointless being possessive about food in general, because all you're ultimately saying is that

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:04.320
[Guest]: I like this food in a very specific taste that I experienced 30 years ago and every

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.960
[Guest]: other way it tastes is invalid.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.160
[Guest]: I mean, that's essentially what you're saying, which is what is silly.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.600
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I think humans in some respect must be wired to think of their preferences

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.040
[Amit Varma]: as being universal in the sense of I like this, this must be good.

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.120
[Amit Varma]: If I think this, this must be right.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, so many things to unpack here.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.240
[Amit Varma]: One is you're talking about, you know, the sense of smell being so important.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.480
[Amit Varma]: I was just chatting with a friend of mine who's recovered from COVID and he had lost

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.240
[Amit Varma]: his sense of smell.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And he offered to, I think, sent me some prawn balchao that his mom had made.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.800
[Amit Varma]: And I said, aren't you having some?

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.280
[Amit Varma]: And he said, yeah, I can't taste anything right now.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.200
[Amit Varma]: So that kind of drives it home.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.920
[Amit Varma]: For the sake of my listeners, I'll just give a quick elaboration on the kind of scientific

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.280
[Amit Varma]: explanation that can form TIL moments in your book.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.920
[Amit Varma]: Like when he was speaking about salt, you spoke about how 0.4% of our saliva is salt.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And therefore anything less than that, it'll seem bland to us that there is a problem.

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.440
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, beyond that, Indians can go to 1.5%.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, in the West, it'll largely be around the 1% mark.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.320
[Amit Varma]: You also busted that myth that if there is too much salt, put some potato or rice.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.720
[Amit Varma]: And what Ashok points out in his book is that no, all that will do is absorb the gravy.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:19.120
[Amit Varma]: It does nothing about, you know, the essential saltiness.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sort of also struck by sort of, you know, one of the delightful things about your

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.880
[Amit Varma]: first chapter, which, you know, I love things which make me look at what is otherwise mundane

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.800
[Amit Varma]: and see it as spectacular.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's what you do with water in the first chapter where I was just filled with a sense

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.800
[Amit Varma]: of awe at what, you know, what is this freakish thing that we drink every day.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about why it is so remarkable.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.360
[Guest]: I mean, this was something that actually sort of, it's inspired by something that I heard

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.680
[Guest]: Carl Sagan say many years ago, I think in the original Cosmos that used to air on Doordarshan,

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.320
[Guest]: which I used to watch, you know, religiously every Sunday morning.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320
[Guest]: And it stayed with me.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.840
[Guest]: He stayed with me when he basically said that water is just magical, right?

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.240
[Guest]: There is no reason for water to behave the way it does.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.240
[Guest]: And if it didn't behave the way it does, there would be no life, right?

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.840
[Guest]: I mean, we are mostly water, what we eat is mostly water, our planet is mostly water,

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840
[Guest]: right?

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.080
[Guest]: In fact, so much so that even, you know, people who search for extraterrestrial life, there

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.120
[Guest]: is, it's not like they open their minds and say, let's look for hydrogen sulfide based

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.120
[Guest]: life.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.920
[Guest]: No, for the most part, it has to be carbon based and it has to be water based.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.800
[Guest]: So therefore, the variety of life per se cannot be beyond the fact that it's carbon based

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.080
[Guest]: and it is water based because both of these are just magical in their own way, right?

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.000
[Guest]: And water particularly, right?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
[Guest]: So you think about oxygen is a smaller atom than sulfur, which is a heavier atom.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.560
[Guest]: In general, if you look at the periodic table, larger atoms in general, you know, tend to

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.640
[Guest]: be solids and smaller atoms tend to be gases, broad rule, but there are exceptions and so

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.640
[Guest]: on.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.640
[Guest]: Right?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:57.120
[Guest]: So you would expect that H2O would also be a gas like H2S, which is just right below,

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.120
[Guest]: right?

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.480
[Guest]: And sulfur is also like oxygen, but hydrogen sulfide is a gas and water alone, because

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.680
[Guest]: if just the way is just a, it's one of those, you know, Stephen Hawking's, you know, anthropic

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.200
[Guest]: principles, you know, it's like, if it was any different, we wouldn't be here to talk

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200
[Guest]: about it.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.320
[Guest]: So there is no debating why it's just the way it is, right?

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.720
[Guest]: It's just that liquid water's ability to form bonds outside of just its own hydrogen and

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.200
[Guest]: oxygen and so on, gives it the property where it is actually denser than ice, which is remarkable

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.240
[Guest]: because all solids tend to be denser than liquids, but water alone is denser than its

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.160
[Guest]: solid form, right?

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.000
[Guest]: And then the fact that it can keep forming these bonds also means that it can form these

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.640
[Guest]: bonds with the proteins and other things that, that make up our body, which is how the spectacular

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.880
[Guest]: diversity of all our biochemistry literally comes from water being involved in every single

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:57.360
[Guest]: reaction, every protein synthesis, everything that keeps you alive, right?

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.440
[Guest]: There is water involved in those reactions without water not happening, right?

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.320
[Guest]: So in a sense, it is essentially that, right?

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:09.640
[Guest]: And in fact, the fact that we use it in cooking, right, is in a bizarre way, also a slightly

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.400
[Guest]: limiting thing, and I'll tell you why, right?

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.280
[Guest]: Water boils at 100, but the tastiest flavors and food come after 110 Celsius, which is

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.560
[Guest]: where Maillard reaction happens.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.760
[Guest]: So you can't have Maillard reaction as long as water is around, right?

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.240
[Guest]: So a lot of cooking is about getting that balance right, right?

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.080
[Guest]: So if it, you can't have it all dry without water either, but at the same time, so which

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.520
[Guest]: is why restaurants and so on, almost always deep fry or sauté ingredients separately,

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.360
[Guest]: brown it, and then add it to the gravy, which is mostly water, because once you add it to

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.160
[Guest]: the gravy, it will never get the brown color.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160
[Guest]: So you do it ahead of time.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.200
[Guest]: At home, you know, you normally won't do that.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.800
[Guest]: You will kind of, you're making them aloo gobi, you're going to put the aloo and the

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.200
[Guest]: gobi and put the gravy and kind of cook it.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.640
[Guest]: It's not going to taste like the restaurant one, because the restaurant one will involve

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.080
[Guest]: that being deep fried in oil, which is sort of brings me to another aha moment, which

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:03.800
[Guest]: I kind of realized later, which is that oil in the context of frying plays the same role

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
[Guest]: that water does.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.680
[Guest]: And this seems odd.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.060
[Guest]: The only difference is that what water does is that it transfers heat evenly to your food.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.160
[Guest]: It's a medium for convection, it's for heat transfer, right?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.160
[Guest]: Because if you put something directly on a pan, only the bottom is going to get hot and

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.040
[Guest]: the top won't get cooked and all of that.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.760
[Guest]: Whereas if it's in water, water has this property where it will all get to the same temperature

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.160
[Guest]: and it will transfer heat to your food evenly, right?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.400
[Guest]: So that's the reason we use water in cooking.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.840
[Guest]: We use oil for exactly the same reason, because you want to transfer heat, but at 170 Celsius,

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.220
[Guest]: which is when it browns, right?

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:40.160
[Guest]: So literally fats play the role of water, except at a higher temperature.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.480
[Guest]: Fats don't chemically react with the food at all.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.080
[Guest]: So you think they do, they don't, right?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.200
[Guest]: So it's the amino acids and sugars that react.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.080
[Guest]: Fat goes in directly.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.880
[Guest]: They get broken down only by our intestine and nowhere else.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.320
[Guest]: I mean, they start breaking down in your mouth.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.720
[Guest]: And because we're mostly water and fats don't mix with water, your body turns it into a

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720
[Guest]: mayonnaise, basically.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.160
[Guest]: I mean, imagine that picture, right?

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.520
[Guest]: So your liver literally uses bile to emulsify all the fat that you eat.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.320
[Guest]: So what's actually going down through is like an emulsion.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.840
[Guest]: It's like mayonnaise, where it's ultimately broken down only your small intestine and

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.320
[Guest]: the fats are absorbed, right?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.360
[Guest]: And the water as well.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:20.080
[Guest]: So water for me has always been this, if you can understand water, if you can understand

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.680
[Guest]: one, what contains, most things contain water, right?

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.960
[Guest]: Cucumber, for instance, cucumber is 95% water.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.720
[Guest]: Cucumber contains more water than some really hard water that comes straight out of your

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.320
[Guest]: tap, which is probably has tons of dissolved minerals, right?

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.640
[Guest]: This is a very non-intuitive thing.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.080
[Guest]: Carrot contains more water than milk, right?

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.800
[Guest]: But we don't intuitively think about it.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.760
[Guest]: And understanding that can also mean that, by the way, you could pressure cook carrots,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.160
[Guest]: you can pressure cook some of these root vegetables without adding water, just add butter.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.800
[Guest]: And that way you can actually pressure cook at a higher temperature, you can caramelize

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
[Guest]: them.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.960
[Guest]: And you get fantastic carrot soups.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.240
[Guest]: If you actually pressure cook carrot without water, I mean, yes, you have to be careful,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.040
[Guest]: you have to add a fair bit of butter and all that, but you don't need anything else.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.280
[Guest]: Just salt, carrots and butter will get you an amazing soup because caramelized or Mayard

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.840
[Guest]: reaction based carrot is just so tasty, right?

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.080
[Amit Varma]: What I also found interesting is how you, you know, you'll talk about these principles

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.680
[Amit Varma]: in the context of cooking, and then suddenly you'll take a step out and go somewhere else.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Like another quote from the chapter, quote, it's because we have so much water on the

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.560
[Amit Varma]: surface that a place like Mumbai has mostly predictable temperatures, while Bhopal can

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.280
[Amit Varma]: swing wildly, not just across seasons, but in a single day, stop quote.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And one more TIL moment for me was how microwaves work, like, of course they are safe and they

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.320
[Amit Varma]: don't cause cancer and all of that nonsense, but they actually work just by heating water.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:44.080
[Amit Varma]: And because all food contains water, it kind of works very, no question, kindly don't laugh

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.400
[Amit Varma]: at this, but you know, sometimes I'll put a dish inside the microwave and the dish will

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.480
[Amit Varma]: get hot before the food does, but the dish has no water.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480
[Amit Varma]: So how does that happen?

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
[Guest]: It is.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.000
[Guest]: So there are some materials.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.040
[Guest]: So microwave mostly heats water.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.160
[Guest]: There are some materials, bakelite, melamine is one of them, which is why not all melamine

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.040
[Guest]: is, is microwave safe, right?

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.880
[Guest]: Some fats for instance.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.560
[Guest]: So if you think about the principles of how a microwave works, right?

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.480
[Guest]: So the funny thing is that it's actually a fair bit of complex quantum physics, right?

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.480
[Guest]: So it's like microwave as radiation is incredibly weaker than even visible light, right?

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.880
[Guest]: It's actually between radio and infrared.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.240
[Guest]: So what's actually happening there is that it just so happens microwave at the frequency

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240
[Guest]: we tend to use it.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.560
[Guest]: I think it's some 2,800 some megahertz, I forgot what it is.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:41.480
[Guest]: That specific frequency has just the right amount of energy to heat, to in some sense,

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.760
[Guest]: flip a water molecule, right?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.280
[Guest]: And because they keep changing the direction of the microwave, it'll keep flipping back

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280
[Guest]: and forth.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280
[Guest]: So the water heats up, right?

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.480
[Guest]: It's a magnetic pole because water again, hydrogen bond, it's polarized.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.200
[Guest]: So it has a, you know, it'll align itself to an electromagnetic field and so it's flipping

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.000
[Guest]: and so that's how it's getting hot, right?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.760
[Guest]: Some materials end up having very similar properties sometimes, which is why some materials

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.320
[Guest]: can suddenly get very hot.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.840
[Guest]: Otherwise, in all other situations, the material gets hot because the water gets hot and then

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.720
[Guest]: it transfers the heat to the material, which is why, you know, metals, you don't use metals

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.920
[Guest]: because you know, they will start sparking, right?

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.600
[Guest]: And so that is, so which is why you use microwave safe sort of materials are not great conductors

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.600
[Guest]: of heat so that all the heat of the water is not transferred to the material, but it's

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.520
[Guest]: just mostly transferred to the food around it, so.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.160
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, before we go on to a commercial break, after which we continue our sort of

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.360
[Amit Varma]: deep dive into your book, a couple of broad questions, which kind of came up from what

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.840
[Amit Varma]: you were saying earlier, one, you spoke about how certain Western foods are designed to

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.040
[Amit Varma]: be addictive.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.720
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like you to elaborate on what you mean by this and also whether there are Indian

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.360
[Amit Varma]: foods which are also like this, like elsewhere in the book, you've pointed out, you pointed

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.360
[Amit Varma]: to a swiggy statistic about how biryani is the most ordered food, like every second there

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.680
[Amit Varma]: are 8,000 biryanis being ordered or some nonsense like that, you know, so what is this sort

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.640
[Amit Varma]: of addictiveness in food, which obviously then, you know, the food industry would want

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640
[Amit Varma]: to exploit.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.080
[Guest]: So, can you elaborate on that?

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.720
[Guest]: So obviously, I think, you know, as animals who evolved at a time when the availability

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.640
[Guest]: of sugars, which are the most, you know, easy, you know, energy currency for the body, right,

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.400
[Guest]: was always historically hard, right?

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.480
[Guest]: You know, the availability of, easy availability of sugar is a very modern phenomenon, right?

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:33.160
[Guest]: So our wiring is essentially built on being starved of carbohydrates in general, right?

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:38.880
[Guest]: You remember, before, most of our evolution happened in the pre-agricultural era, right?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.200
[Guest]: So a lot of our brain wiring is still from that pre-agricultural era.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.400
[Guest]: Agriculture is only some 5-6,000 years old, so we haven't actually adapted to the fact

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.640
[Guest]: that we are eating a high-grain, high-carbohydrate diet at all, right?

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.640
[Guest]: Evolution works on a much longer timescale.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:59.120
[Guest]: But we were largely just, we were on a diet that was almost entirely meat and the odd

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.160
[Guest]: fruit, right, during some season, some berries, like, you know, like any other apes or monkeys,

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160
[Guest]: right?

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160
[Guest]: I mean, they're omnivores, right?

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.280
[Guest]: We are omnivores as well.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.040
[Guest]: And it is essentially that we have not had time to adapt our wiring to the fact that

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.480
[Guest]: we now have an unlimited supply of carbohydrates.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.080
[Guest]: And so the way we've evolved is that, one, evolution selected for people who were just

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.320
[Guest]: crazily addicted to sugar, right?

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.280
[Guest]: And the brain rewards you instantly the moment you eat sugar, right?

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.000
[Guest]: The dopamine and all of that, right?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.360
[Guest]: Because you want, that kind of person is more likely to have eaten any kind of fruit, any

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.320
[Guest]: ripe fruit, overripe fruit.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.020
[Guest]: Even if it is marginally rotten, he would have still eaten it and survived, as opposed

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.880
[Guest]: to someone who did not like the smell, did not eat and therefore starved, right?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.800
[Guest]: So therefore, in a sense that we ended up selecting for people who are naturally, we're

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.480
[Guest]: all naturally addicted to sugar, right?

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480
[Guest]: So that's the first natural thing.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.760
[Guest]: So therefore, the food industry's first thing is anything with sugar is going to be addictive,

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.760
[Guest]: right?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.000
[Guest]: So cookies, what have you.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.140
[Guest]: Incidentally, even your namkeen is addictive because it has sugar.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.520
[Guest]: If it did not have any sugar, it wouldn't be as tasty.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.520
[Guest]: So there's that as well, right?

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:12.840
[Guest]: Likewise, I think we're also kind of adapted to want a certain amount of salt, not over

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.080
[Guest]: salt, but a certain amount of salt is absolutely important.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.680
[Guest]: We don't like food that is not salty, right?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.560
[Guest]: And it is fascinating because the reason we need food with salt, and by the way, if you

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.960
[Guest]: notice like animals, carnivores and so on, who don't get access to salt naturally, enough

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.240
[Guest]: salt in their diet because all they're eating is meat, they will in fact go find places

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.920
[Guest]: where rocks have salt and lick to actually get enough salt for themselves.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.280
[Guest]: And the reason all animals, including us, need that salt is because all of us evolved

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.720
[Guest]: from ocean going creatures, all of us came from fishes, right?

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.560
[Guest]: And so all our organs are evolved to deal with a certain amount of salt.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.160
[Guest]: And that's why all our cells need a certain amount of salt.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.440
[Guest]: And that's why we need to eat salt, right?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.280
[Guest]: So it's just that although we are now land going and you know, we don't, you know, there's

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.320
[Guest]: no salt all around, it is basically remembering our fish ancestors, the fact that we are used

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.640
[Guest]: to that sort of thing.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.920
[Guest]: So salt again is something that we are all wired to want, right?

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.240
[Guest]: So both sweet and salt.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:19.800
[Guest]: A couple of other things that the food industry obviously uses is obviously umami.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:25.880
[Guest]: Umami is one of those, although we understand it technically more recently, but you know,

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.120
[Guest]: humans have understood it for a long way, right?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.920
[Guest]: The reason tomato is such a tremendously common base in so many dishes is because it's very

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.200
[Guest]: high on glutamates, right?

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.880
[Guest]: The very same glutamates found in MSG, by the way.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.680
[Guest]: So our Parmesan cheese, cheese, for example, is another one, meat in general has a lot

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.120
[Guest]: of glutamates and so on, right?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.320
[Guest]: Mushrooms and so on.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.080
[Guest]: So umami's advantage is the fact that it actually amplifies other tastes and makes it linger

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.080
[Guest]: for longer.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.100
[Guest]: So when you eat like ramen, right?

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.240
[Guest]: You get that, that savory feeling lingers in your mouth for a longer time.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.120
[Guest]: So umami is one of those things that amplifies other things and makes it linger, right?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.960
[Guest]: So which is why Japanese food can actually be very minimalist.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.760
[Guest]: So if you're, if it's umami based, you can actually simply just go with a very few other,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.000
[Guest]: you know, spices and other ingredients.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.320
[Guest]: It can be very minimalist because it's still going to taste really, really good, right?

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.240
[Guest]: It's still an acquired taste, but so, so there's umami as well, right?

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.960
[Guest]: And then the food industry has figured out a couple of other tricks, right?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.120
[Guest]: Fat is another one.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.800
[Guest]: We absolutely are also like fat for no reason other than the fact that it is the densest

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.520
[Guest]: nutrient available, right?

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.640
[Guest]: So if carbohydrates are like, I think four calories a gram, I think fat is like nine

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640
[Guest]: calories a gram.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.240
[Guest]: It's, it's the densest food, you know, we can eat, very, very nutrient dense.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.560
[Guest]: And so therefore, you know, we have evolved a taste for fatty textures and fatty foods

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.140
[Guest]: in general, right?

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:50.240
[Guest]: So if you combine all of this, the food industry also uses tricks with acids, right?

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.560
[Guest]: So for example, a Coca-Cola or any carbonated beverage, right, is tremendously acidic because

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.640
[Guest]: of the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide and also a couple of phosphoric acid, a bunch

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640
[Guest]: of other things.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.640
[Guest]: It's very, very acidic.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640
[Guest]: It is more acidic.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.760
[Guest]: A Coca-Cola is more acidic than vinegar, but you can't drink vinegar, but you can drink

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.760
[Guest]: a Coca-Cola.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.840
[Guest]: Why?

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.200
[Guest]: Because they add nine teaspoons of sugar into it.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.520
[Guest]: So the nine teaspoons of sugar actually mutes your experience of sourness.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.480
[Guest]: And in a sense that restaurant food essentially does the same thing.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.880
[Guest]: So they add extra salt, but since you'll perceive the extra salt, they'll add extra sugar.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.200
[Guest]: And because they add extra sugar, they can add more acid.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.120
[Guest]: And because they add more acid, the acids will make you salivate more.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.040
[Guest]: They're able to add a lot more of other things, right?

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.120
[Guest]: So in a sense, it's, it's just ultimately about picking your reward circuits for essentially

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.760
[Guest]: sugar is the primary thing and then salt and a bunch of these other things.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.360
[Guest]: But that's largely how a lot of this addiction works and how food companies take advantage.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, in your book, I think you described it as taking the volume dial to 11, what the

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.520
[Amit Varma]: restaurants do with the kind of sugar and salt that to balance one, they use the other

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.480
[Amit Varma]: and they keep, they take it all the way to up and the flavors are so accentuated in restaurant

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.720
[Amit Varma]: food for that reason.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.600
[Amit Varma]: So kindly eat more at home people, etc.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.920
[Amit Varma]: And but why biryani in particular?

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.240
[Guest]: And I'm asking because I'm also trying to understand my own regular cravings.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:17.400
[Guest]: So biryani, again, I think it's one of obviously one of the subcontinents, great dishes.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.560
[Guest]: I mean, you know, if we do a voyage of three, you know, I think definitely, you know, recipe

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.560
[Guest]: for biryani ought to be sent out to deep space, if you will, it's one of mankind's.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.600
[Amit Varma]: It's not just one of our best dishes, there's many of our best dishes, because there are

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.440
[Guest]: so many, there are so many varieties, but the broad principle of essentially being a

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.040
[Guest]: so for starters, it is actually a in a utilitarian fashion.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.960
[Guest]: It is an absolutely dead simple, basic one pot dish, right?

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.360
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, you can make, of course, there are sophisticated variants where you can,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.000
[Guest]: you know, but at the basic level, if you're a poor guy with this giant in, you know, your,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.360
[Guest]: your, your, your, your audiences, you know, construction labor and so on, I could just

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.920
[Guest]: take rice, you could take meat, you could take spices, and just slow cook it.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.680
[Guest]: And you can't go wrong with it, right?

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.640
[Guest]: So you got carbohydrates, you got proteins, there's nothing more you need, right?

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.120
[Guest]: I mean, it is, it is a one shot meal, you don't need anything else.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.280
[Guest]: Anything else is primarily I mean, if it turns out to be too dry, you have a raita or whatever

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280
[Guest]: it is.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.680
[Guest]: But, you know, your average construction labor guy is not like eating it with raita or anything,

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.940
[Guest]: he's just eating the rice, the meat for him.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:24.760
[Guest]: It is the quickest, the high dense, nutritious meal in that sense, right?

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.400
[Guest]: So if you leave aside that utilitarian aspect, for why it is so ubiquitous, like literally

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.800
[Guest]: every Chennai, for instance, every street corner has a has a biryani out there.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:38.520
[Guest]: I think it is, Chennai is probably one of the largest consumers of biryani per capita

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.200
[Guest]: and also chicken, I think.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.200
[Guest]: So one is that.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.400
[Guest]: The second thing is the fact that, look, you know, one, it's an aromatic kind of rice.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.600
[Guest]: So the better the rice, you get that, right?

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.480
[Guest]: And meat, right?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.800
[Guest]: Meat has, slow cooked meat has a ton of all those meat juices, all that umami actually

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.280
[Guest]: suffuses the entire dish, for starters, right?

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.120
[Guest]: And then you're using all of the subcontinent's famous spices, I mean, it could be ginger

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.760
[Guest]: garlic, you know, cardamom, you know, and all the things that kind of go into a biryani

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:07.880
[Guest]: masala and so on.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.520
[Guest]: All of these are tremendously sophisticated spices and in some of the most fancy biryanis

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.000
[Guest]: that you have, the top note is actually things like saffron, which again is tremendously

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.200
[Guest]: complex, right?

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.160
[Guest]: Just saffron apparently has some 3,000 or 4,000 different unique aroma molecules, which

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.800
[Guest]: is why it is nearly impossible to synthetically synthesize a saffron, but you can synthetically

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.160
[Guest]: synthesize, you know, vanilla, for example.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.720
[Guest]: And so it is in a sense that, and there are so many variations, the sequencing, the kind

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.840
[Guest]: of rice you use, the kind of meat you use, the kinds of spices you use, how you marinate

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.840
[Guest]: the meat.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.320
[Guest]: So there's just so many varieties and it is also at home, so also it's obviously, it's

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
[Guest]: a special day dish, right?

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.240
[Guest]: I mean, it's something that you cook on a special day, like, you know, imagine having

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.360
[Guest]: to make chapatis or 20 side dishes for a family gathering, when you want to make one biryani,

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.680
[Guest]: I mean, it'll feed everyone, right?

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.900
[Guest]: I mean, there's that practical nature to it as well.

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:04.280
[Guest]: So for me, I mean, I've always been fascinated by, I like biryani, I'm not like obsessively,

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.600
[Guest]: I don't tend to crave it because I tend to, I don't tend to eat too much rice in general.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.400
[Guest]: I tend to sort of eat.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.880
[Guest]: So I have a rice day and then a wheat day and a millet day and things like that.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.200
[Guest]: So I tend to kind of do that.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.840
[Guest]: So, but, you know, on rice day, biryani is almost always welcome.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.640
[Guest]: I mean, because it's perfect, it's umami, it is high in carbohydrates.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.520
[Guest]: It's got a ton of that flavor from the meat, that kind of the meat juices that are not

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.000
[Guest]: lost anywhere, because you know, you're sealing the whole thing.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.720
[Guest]: And if it's cooked well, you're not going to overcook the meat.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:39.040
[Guest]: If it's brined or marinated well, then you know, it's going to be succulent and the spices,

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.120
[Guest]: because you're doing the dum, all of the aroma is not lost, right?

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.960
[Guest]: So it's all getting sort of amplified.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.360
[Guest]: So I think it's one of the great dishes.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.280
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, I shouldn't have asked you the question because now I'm craving a biryani

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.840
[Amit Varma]: I had a couple of years back, I went with a bunch of friends on something we call the

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.120
[Amit Varma]: spice trail, where we went on this long food trip, and one of the places we went to was

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Mysore.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And there we went to a joint where we had pork biryani.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And that was the first time in my life I had pork biryani, I've had, you know, all other

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.560
[Amit Varma]: kinds and it was just so mind blowing, you know, the fat and the succulent flavor and

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
[Guest]: all that.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.600
[Guest]: Which reminds me, right, so the fat is actually quite important.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:22.040
[Guest]: So aromas, as I get to talk about the flavor chapter, is that are not soluble in water.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.120
[Guest]: Most of those volatile flavor molecules are not soluble in water, they're soluble in fat,

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.120
[Guest]: right?

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.740
[Guest]: Which is why almost all cooking starts with oil spices.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:33.640
[Guest]: So first you do it before all the spice flavor escapes to the air, you kind of get it into

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640
[Guest]: the oil.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.360
[Guest]: And it's that oil that flavors your dish, essentially, that's the bulk of the flavor

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360
[Guest]: that you get in the dish.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:44.240
[Guest]: In a biryani, it's amazing because there's going to be, that's why almost a biryani cut

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.080
[Guest]: even if you're making like chicken biryani, right?

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.280
[Guest]: You're almost always going to ask for lean skin, right?

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.880
[Guest]: You want that fat, you don't want lean meat.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.200
[Guest]: Because that fat, when it renders, is first and foremost going to absorb all the saffron

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:01.000
[Guest]: and the cumin and the star anise and all the rest of that.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.600
[Guest]: And just that fat is going to be so flavorful, right?

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.520
[Guest]: So I think that plays a huge role in why a biryani is amazing.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Massive role.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Now for the other question before we go into the break, which again came from something

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.760
[Amit Varma]: you said in passing a while back where you said that, you know, the taste buds of women,

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.000
[Amit Varma]: so to say, are developed differently, they taste food differently.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, why do you think that is?

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, are there evolutionary reasons for that, that in a sense, continue into the

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.040
[Amit Varma]: culture?

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.720
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, men and women respond differently to temperature, you know, which

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.880
[Amit Varma]: is why, you know, our modern air conditioning is designed in the 50s and 60s, where offices

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.000
[Amit Varma]: were full of men.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.480
[Amit Varma]: So they were designed for the optimal sort of male capacity, while, you know, women feel

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.920
[Amit Varma]: colder much sooner.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you could say that that's an example of sort of a world design for men,

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.480
[Amit Varma]: so to say.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'm very intrigued by this because typically, and I'm sure, and it's obviously not just

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.160
[Amit Varma]: in India where, but in India, especially where men expect fresh food three times a day, like

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.480
[Amit Varma]: you said, as women who are doing it, it's a very functional thing.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:11.560
[Amit Varma]: So why do you think the taste buds have evolved separately, are there sort of deeper insights

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.160
[Guest]: into humanity here?

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.640
[Guest]: So I think, you know, if you think about evolution itself, right, nothing much has evolved in

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.240
[Guest]: the last five to 6,000 years, or very little has, right, that's very short a time frame.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:27.320
[Guest]: So most of our changes, most of the differences that we see, you know, go back much longer,

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.320
[Guest]: right.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.360
[Guest]: And in a sense that, you know, because of the traditional gender role, you know, distinctions

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.480
[Guest]: between, you know, men go out and hunt, and women kind of, you know, sort of, you know,

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.360
[Guest]: take care of the cave and take care of etc, etc.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.240
[Guest]: One obviously, I think, closer environment, naturally, you have to be a lot more sensitive

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:51.400
[Guest]: to smells, to toxins, to things that could kill you, to food that could be rotten, and

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.880
[Guest]: spoiled, and so on.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.960
[Guest]: Whereas the great outdoors are different.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.000
[Guest]: So you end up building different muscles, more to do with hand-eye coordination, and

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.800
[Guest]: being able to triangulate, you know, where this thing is, you know, where you shoot your

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800
[Guest]: spear and so on.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.280
[Guest]: So in a sense that, on an average, a lot of our differences kind of come from there, right.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.680
[Guest]: So Professor, I think, Linda Bartow-Shook, who's sort of this professor, she's the one

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.400
[Guest]: who coined the term supertasters.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.440
[Guest]: So what she says is that the ability to sense flavor is a spectrum, right.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:27.080
[Guest]: In that, there's a bottom 14% of the population that have very low taste bud density.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.960
[Guest]: And they are terrible at, so they couldn't, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.220
[Guest]: between a very tannic wine and a, and like a reasonably decent one, right.

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.520
[Guest]: So they wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.640
[Guest]: And then you have the middle, which is essentially average people, mostly people like us.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.840
[Guest]: And then there's a 14 or 15% at the top end who are actually supertasters.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.040
[Guest]: Supertasters are, so Padma Lakshmi, for example, is an example of someone who underwent the

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.040
[Guest]: test.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.400
[Guest]: So there's a test you can go undergo for it, by the way.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:01.240
[Guest]: So there is apparently one specific molecule that you cannot smell unless you're a supertaster.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.560
[Guest]: You cannot taste it unless you're a supertaster.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.240
[Guest]: If you're a supertaster, it will taste bitter.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.160
[Guest]: If you're not a supertaster, you won't taste it, right.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.720
[Guest]: Some propyl thio-uracil, some sulfur-based molecule, right.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.800
[Guest]: And you can, so you can actually undergo this test.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:19.680
[Guest]: And there they found out that on an average, women tend to be supertasters more often than

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.200
[Guest]: men.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.440
[Guest]: And so, so there is that, right.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.920
[Guest]: So, I mean, but the fact that more men are chefs and all that has more to do with patriarchy

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.420
[Guest]: than anything else.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.760
[Guest]: But in general, you know, for example, I realized it pretty quickly at home as well, that my

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:39.460
[Guest]: wife would be earlier to detect that something is burning, minutes ahead before I sense it.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:45.400
[Guest]: She would sort of detect if, if something needs to, when you taste something, right.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:51.400
[Guest]: A common mistake that I would often make is that, so you have, your taste buds work ideally

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.720
[Guest]: between 20 and 30 Celsius.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.920
[Guest]: They work at a peak at that temperature.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.240
[Guest]: At higher temperatures, they don't work as well, and at lower temperatures, they don't

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.240
[Guest]: work as well.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.240
[Guest]: So, which is incidentally why hot coffee is acceptable.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.800
[Guest]: Room temperature coffee is atrociously bitter, right, because when it's that hot, you can

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.280
[Guest]: ignore the bitterness and enjoy the aroma.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.160
[Guest]: But the moment it's room temperature, then the coffee will only primarily taste bitter

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.280
[Guest]: and so on, right.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:22.920
[Guest]: So likewise, they also have more temperature sensors in their mouth, which also makes it

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.400
[Guest]: a lot more sensitive for them.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.920
[Guest]: So I will just take a spoon directly from the boiling pot, and then I will taste it.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.120
[Guest]: And then I will say, can you please taste it?

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.000
[Guest]: They'll say, wait, I've burnt my mouth several times.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.280
[Guest]: So obviously, they're more sensitive to higher temperatures, therefore more sensitive to

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280
[Guest]: heat.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280
[Guest]: Chilies, right?

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.160
[Guest]: So chilies essentially are basically fooling you into thinking that it's temperature, right?

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160
[Guest]: So and so on.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160
[Guest]: So it is, yeah.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.640
[Guest]: So this is just possibly why they're better tasters in general.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I want to discuss chilies in detail after the break, because it's absolutely mind

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.840
[Amit Varma]: blowing what chilies do.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.560
[Amit Varma]: It was like a TIL moment for me.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, oh, that is why I am being fooled by my own brain.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, oh, my God, this is grace and, you know, and since your wife is so much more

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:08.080
[Amit Varma]: sensitive about this, she should have written the book, why did you write the book, guy?

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.680
[Guest]: Well, you know, that's why I credit her right up front.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.600
[Guest]: She's one of those utilitarian bosses, I'm not going to sit and follow your methodical

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.760
[Guest]: scientific AB testing instructions, you know, she's somebody who cooks, you know, with her

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.760
[Guest]: gut.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.040
[Guest]: And, as I said, she makes a better rasam than I do, you know, I'm like measuring, you know,

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.000
[Guest]: testing sourness and doing all of that stuff.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.040
[Guest]: And she's like, yeah, that's also the, at the end of the day, it's also about recognition

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:40.800
[Guest]: that of the fact that for a lot of, I was very aware for a lot of women in India, cooking

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.200
[Guest]: is not some, I can't force you to think of it as some amazing adventure that you can,

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.800
[Guest]: you know, do all of this, understand all of the science, because you just want to feed

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.120
[Guest]: your family in as quick a time as possible.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.680
[Guest]: So you can actually get back to your career, you can get back to your studies and do other

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.680
[Guest]: things, right?

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.920
[Guest]: So in a sense, there was also this conscious mindset that this cannot be a gratuitous exercise

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.120
[Guest]: in saying, hey, you can do all these fancy things.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.600
[Guest]: I mean, I can't, I can't ask, I don't want to ask people to do something in a more elaborate

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.320
[Guest]: way because the flavor will be better if I don't give them a more efficient way to do

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.320
[Guest]: it as well, right?

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.440
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day, it has to be utilitarian in that sense.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.320
[Guest]: It can't be just for the sake of it.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, very true.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break in which time you will no doubt whip up something mind

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.160
[Amit Varma]: blowingly tasty and, you know, eat it in front of me on the camera and just drive me nuts.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:35.760
[Amit Varma]: So we'll be back after a minute.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.880
[Amit Varma]: As many of you know, I'll soon be coming out with a four volume anthology of the seen and

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.560
[Amit Varma]: the unseen books organized around the themes of politics, history, economics, and society

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560
[Amit Varma]: and culture.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.880
[Amit Varma]: These days, I'm wading through over 3 million words of conversation from all my episodes

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.400
[Amit Varma]: so far to curate the best bits.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And for this to happen, I needed transcripts.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.800
[Amit Varma]: And that was made possible by a remarkable young startup called TAPCHIEF.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.360
[Amit Varma]: TAPCHIEF at TAPCHIEF.com is a digital platform that allows companies to outsource work to

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.080
[Amit Varma]: their network of freelancers.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And TAPCHIEF's network includes more than 125,000 people as of now.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.480
[Amit Varma]: You want people to make you a webpage or design a logo or compose a jingle or do some digital

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.240
[Amit Varma]: marketing for you?

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:24.080
[Amit Varma]: TAPCHIEF gives you an easy way to reach out to freelancers competing for your work.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.200
[Amit Varma]: I can say from firsthand experience how valuable this has been for me and solve the problem

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.280
[Amit Varma]: I was actually a bit worried about.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So do go over to TAPCHIEF.com and check out all that TAPCHIEF has to offer.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they could solve your problem too.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the seen and the unseen.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Krish Ashok about his remarkable book Masala Lab and you know, I learned so

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.760
[Amit Varma]: much from that book about food and the way it works, especially about chilies where I

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.560
[Amit Varma]: felt kind of cheated and manipulated.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:57.400
[Amit Varma]: Let me, you know, in my own words, very briefly try to kind of explain what happens that you

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.640
[Amit Varma]: know, one of the things you've pointed out, which I will ask you to elaborate on later

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.200
[Amit Varma]: because it's endlessly fascinating to me is that all flavors are the defense mechanisms

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.760
[Amit Varma]: of plants which do not want to be eaten.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that's where chili also comes from, you know, where they release this substance

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.520
[Amit Varma]: that fools our brain into thinking that our mouth is literally on fire.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.540
[Amit Varma]: Now technically, this should be enough reason to stop eating anything, but our brain responds

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:26.640
[Amit Varma]: by releasing a flood of endorphins to counter the pain.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And these endorphins then make you know, the food that we are eating appear tastier than

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.120
[Amit Varma]: it is, which is why we keep on eating and it is eventually a vicious circle to the point

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.100
[Amit Varma]: where you're like putting both chilaquiles and everything or not exactly.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's why we kind of eat a lot of chili food.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.160
[Amit Varma]: And you had an amusing anecdote from Sri Lanka, in fact, about Coca-Cola.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.160
[Amit Varma]: So tell us a little bit about chilies and what it is, I mean, this is crazy, man.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:01.200
[Guest]: So I've been endlessly fascinated by chilies, obviously, as a South Indian, obviously, we're

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.280
[Guest]: generally eating above average, hotter food than most parts of the planet.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.000
[Guest]: And particularly, I think my mom's cooking was particularly spicier than normal.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.040
[Guest]: My father used to have mouth ulcers very regularly, but he wouldn't complain.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.480
[Guest]: So it was just quietly take, you know, a ripple flaming, you know, to deal with the ulcers.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.840
[Guest]: But you know, so she clearly had a, she had a taste for chilies.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.280
[Guest]: And I think all of us ended up sort of getting used to it.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.640
[Guest]: I don't think you inherit it, you just get used to it.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.520
[Guest]: So because the way this works is that it's basically a nerve receptor in the mouth, which

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.320
[Guest]: is why it's not a taste, it's a sensation.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.080
[Guest]: So heat is not a taste, heat is a sensation.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.620
[Guest]: So taste comes from the taste buds, right?

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:44.960
[Guest]: So taste buds essentially work by very specific sensors that detect for something, right?

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.560
[Guest]: So salt sensors detect sodium.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.800
[Guest]: So anything with sodium will taste salty.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:55.280
[Guest]: So that's just why salt is salty, sodium chloride is salty, monosodium glutamate is also salt,

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.080
[Guest]: not as salty, but you know, still salt, right?

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.440
[Guest]: And other things in these, that family, even potassium chloride, it will taste mildly salty,

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.440
[Guest]: and so on, right?

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.840
[Guest]: And so, so there is, so heat is actually a sensation.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.440
[Guest]: So the distinction is that the taste buds are actually very specifically detecting for

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.720
[Guest]: this.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.080
[Guest]: Sensations are actually primarily to warn you against things like something, you're

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.960
[Guest]: eating something too acidic, you're eating something that is too hot, right?

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:27.520
[Guest]: So obviously, I think we needed warning because, you know, your entire digestive tract is very

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.520
[Guest]: sensitive, right?

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.800
[Guest]: So if you're putting something that's really hot, or very acidic, like a concentrated sulfuric

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.440
[Guest]: acid or something, it's going to burn you all the way down.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.480
[Guest]: And so it's a warning mechanism that has evolved to prevent us from eating the things that

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.480
[Guest]: are too hot, right?

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:48.400
[Guest]: And so the entirety of our digestive tract has those sensors that detect for temperature,

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.400
[Guest]: right?

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:56.680
[Guest]: And so plants are basically nature's absolutely biochemical magicians, in the sense that,

01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:03.000
[Guest]: forget animals, in terms of the sheer diversity of molecules that plants can synthesize, nothing

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:09.040
[Guest]: comes anywhere close, right, which is why there's still a ton of drugs that you cannot

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.400
[Guest]: simply use a simple laboratory chemical process to synthesize them because they're just too

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400
[Guest]: complicated.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.040
[Guest]: You need to genetically modify a bacteria or something else or a fungi to be able to

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:24.080
[Guest]: generate what you need, because you need the kind of protein synthesis apparatus that plants

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.400
[Guest]: have is just otherworldly.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.160
[Guest]: And obviously, they've been around for billions of years longer than we have.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:34.440
[Guest]: And so they have amassed an arsenal of variety of tricks, right?

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:40.300
[Guest]: So chilies in this entire thing have figured out a trick by which they produce a family

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:46.720
[Guest]: of chemicals called capsaicinoids, which happen to fit into the heat receptors that are there

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.880
[Guest]: in your mouth, right, and in your digestive tract, right?

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.920
[Guest]: And so the moment they fit in, the signal goes to the brain saying that yeah, this thing

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.680
[Guest]: is on and the brain is like, oh, your mouth must be on fire.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.200
[Guest]: So let me take action.

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:01.680
[Guest]: So immediately it'll start sending more blood because it wants to cool down your face, so

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:06.200
[Guest]: you get that flush, or you start sweating to cool your body down, that all the things

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.800
[Guest]: that you get when you bite into a chili, right?

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.760
[Guest]: So it's basically all of that.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.040
[Guest]: And because you have now, the body thinks you will now be in pain, although the whole

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.240
[Guest]: thing is completely phantom, right?

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.440
[Guest]: The brain also thinks that let me start the reward circuits so that the guy is not incapacitated.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.280
[Guest]: So that's important because, you know, so the slightest amount of pain cannot incapacitate

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.040
[Guest]: you, because then otherwise, you know, a moderately injured human being would have been eaten

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.760
[Guest]: by a predator.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.600
[Guest]: So you need to be able to actually operate better under a slight amount of pain.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.640
[Guest]: So the endorphins and all of that actually give you that sort of second wind and you

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.680
[Guest]: are, you know, enthused to sort of sit and run, right, or get up and run, right?

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:49.040
[Guest]: So that's why when you eat chilies, those endorphins get released and that in turn makes

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.240
[Guest]: the whole eating process a lot more pleasurable within a certain margin, right?

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.320
[Guest]: But varies by individual.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.240
[Guest]: Some people are very sensitive, some people are not as sensitive.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.520
[Guest]: And also, you have these sensors all the way down your track to varying this thing, which

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:05.800
[Guest]: is why, you know, you feel the heat in your mouth and then a little bit later in your

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.440
[Guest]: stomach and the next day morning somewhere else, right?

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.400
[Guest]: Because it is, you know, so you're going to feel that all through, right?

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:17.640
[Guest]: And this is also why capsaicinoids in general are used in pepper sprays for women to protect

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640
[Guest]: themselves, right?

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.360
[Guest]: Because what you want is something that incapacitates you without permanently damaging.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.160
[Guest]: That you don't want a chemical that will make the guy go blind.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:30.000
[Guest]: You want something that fools the brain into thinking your eyes are on fire.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.440
[Guest]: So please shut everything down till everything is okay so that you can escape and then you'll

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440
[Guest]: be fine.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.560
[Guest]: So it does no long lasting damage to the person's eyes at all, right?

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.560
[Guest]: So you know, that's, so chilies have been endlessly fascinating, right?

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:49.000
[Guest]: So and the fact that we've, you know, agriculturists have managed to figure out how to make hotter

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.040
[Guest]: and hotter ones than just the natural ones.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.240
[Guest]: So there's the Bujalochia, which is one of the most hottest natural varieties.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:59.920
[Guest]: But you know, there are now competitions where, you know, there's a guy in North Carolina

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.400
[Guest]: who makes this variety called the Carolina Reaper, you know?

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.920
[Guest]: So the last time I went abroad, I did buy two of them.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.120
[Guest]: It's sitting in my freezer, you need to use gloves to handle them.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.540
[Guest]: So they're like 1.4 billion Scoville units.

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:16.280
[Guest]: So you can use one to flavor, you know, a big tub of food, right?

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.280
[Guest]: It is that hot, right?

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.080
[Guest]: And so yeah, chilies have been endlessly fascinating.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And you also point out how, you know, fat, you know, mitigates the effect of that kind

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.440
[Amit Varma]: of heat, which is why in something like gunpowder, you will also have some ghee or whatever along

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.440
[Amit Varma]: with it.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, alcohol mutes it as well, which is why when you're on a drinking binge, you'll

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:40.200
[Amit Varma]: have a lot of, you know, your snacks can get spicier and spicier, but acid amplifies heat.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.720
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, if you, you know, sort of have that heat and you drink some Coca Cola, you

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720
[Guest]: are basically screwed.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.800
[Guest]: I mean, which is right.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.920
[Guest]: So fat actually dissolves the capsaicin.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:50.920
[Guest]: So it washes it.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.640
[Guest]: So it's easier to wash it off, right?

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.800
[Guest]: Water, water does not.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.680
[Guest]: So which is why drinking water, although you, you think it helps, it doesn't help as much.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.440
[Guest]: So in fact, I think it's that there's that there's this famous YouTube show where this

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.560
[Guest]: guy gives people hot wings, increasingly hotter after each other, celebrities and ask them

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560
[Guest]: questions.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.680
[Guest]: And he saves the toughest questions when the guy's eating like the spiciest wings that

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.080
[Guest]: people give incredibly candid answers.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.700
[Guest]: So it's a fantastic show.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:18.000
[Guest]: And so he gives everyone a glass of milk.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.040
[Guest]: So if you feel very hot, you just drink milk, a kind of, you know, gargle it.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.520
[Guest]: And you could you could spit the milk out, right?

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.760
[Guest]: So that way, the milk will wash all of the milk fats will wash all the capsaicin from

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760
[Guest]: from your mouth.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.080
[Amit Varma]: And you can get rid of it.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.080
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:38.480
[Amit Varma]: And elaborate a bit on, you know, flavors being defense mechanisms of plants, like you've

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:43.640
[Amit Varma]: described this sort of apocryphal battle where plants come and they do all these processes

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.760
[Amit Varma]: over thousands of years, and they evolve a certain way to get energy from the sun and

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.800
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And then these lazy animals, you know, just come around and chomp them up and get their

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.960
[Amit Varma]: energy that way.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And then the plants have to fight back and all flavors of food arise from that.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.600
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about that.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:09.560
[Guest]: So rather quite fascinating aha moment for me was this realization that plants are biochemical

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560
[Guest]: superstars.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.960
[Guest]: Again, largely, again, because they don't move, they don't have the ability to move.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.600
[Guest]: And the reason they don't have the ability to move is because photosynthesis is ridiculously

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600
[Guest]: inefficient.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:26.680
[Guest]: And amazingly enough, I don't get into the details of this because it wasn't relevant,

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.880
[Guest]: but I did write a Twitter thread about it.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.600
[Guest]: Photosynthesis is inefficient for another really fascinating reason, which is that one

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.960
[Guest]: of the steps in photosynthesis, like one of hundreds of steps in converting sunlight into

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.760
[Guest]: glucose, right?

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.960
[Guest]: One of those steps apparently required a low oxygen atmosphere because plants were living

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.960
[Guest]: in a completely low oxygen atmosphere.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.280
[Guest]: Unfortunately, we live in a high oxygen atmosphere now.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.280
[Guest]: So which is why photosynthesis is the entirety of photosynthesis and the fact that we don't

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.040
[Guest]: have walking trees is because we have too much oxygen in the atmosphere, right?

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.040
[Guest]: So it's quite fascinating.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.440
[Guest]: So one, therefore, plants, their mechanism is fundamentally, therefore, to evolve chemical

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.480
[Guest]: defenses against predators.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.120
[Guest]: Plants on the other hand, their biggest trick is essentially their ability to move, right?

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.040
[Guest]: If you can move, then you can essentially eat other things.

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.460
[Guest]: And if you can eat other things, then you let that thing do all the hard work of turning

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.640
[Guest]: sunlight into energy over months.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:29.720
[Guest]: And you get those calories in literally, you know, in a matter of hours, right?

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.480
[Guest]: I mean, a potato takes months to grow, right?

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.000
[Guest]: I mean, you can eat that potato in literally a few seconds and you get a ton of energy

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
[Guest]: from that.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.400
[Guest]: We are tremendously more energy efficient, our metabolic rate is so much higher than

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.400
[Guest]: plants and so on, right?

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.360
[Guest]: So therefore, which is why we are not biochemistry superstars at all, we didn't need to.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.360
[Guest]: So a lot of the animal evolution has been different ways in which we could move, right?

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.840
[Guest]: Fly and, you know, and four legs and, you know, all kinds of swimming and all kinds

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:02.040
[Guest]: of other mechanics to move and then ultimately, obviously, brain development and so on, right?

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.120
[Guest]: But plants, therefore, over 3 billion years have evolved fantastic mechanisms, a variety

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.000
[Guest]: of mechanisms to prevent animals from eating it and it's a two-way battle, right?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.120
[Guest]: So like, for example, chilies, fantastic example is chilies itself.

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:21.720
[Guest]: Birds don't have that sensor, so in the sense that capsaicin doesn't affect them, right?

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.640
[Guest]: Which is actually quite fine because the way it's worked out is that they end up pollinating.

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.800
[Guest]: So it's just that this is not a one-way thing, right?

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.080
[Guest]: So it's just a very complex ecosystem thing that constantly happens and it's sometimes

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.080
[Guest]: very hard to kind of work it out after the fact also, right?

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.880
[Guest]: And sometimes you tell yourself one story and then five years later, you'll discover

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.560
[Guest]: some fossil record that says, no, no, this is actually completely different and this

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.200
[Guest]: is not what it was and so on.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.240
[Guest]: So fascinatingly, plants have evolved a bunch of defense mechanism, broadly from the point

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.600
[Guest]: of view of what is relevant to food.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.520
[Guest]: So there are two things, situations where the plant wants you to eat it because it wants

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.200
[Guest]: you to pollinate, spread the seeds somewhere else.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:54.200
[Guest]: That's a fruit.

01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:00.200
[Guest]: A fruit is basically, you know, the pinnacle of plant biochemistry in creating something

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.600
[Guest]: that requires no cooking.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.560
[Guest]: It is just you take it off the tree and you eat it and it does not get any more delicious

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560
[Guest]: than that, right?

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.720
[Guest]: And, you know, you take a perfectly ripe mango, right, or a perfectly crisp apple, I mean,

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.960
[Guest]: you can realize the fact that it's really billions of years of evolution of figuring

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.560
[Guest]: out exactly what it is that animals or others want to eat, right?

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.240
[Guest]: So likewise, defense mechanisms are again, one of many.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.200
[Guest]: Mostly they have to do with use of things like sulfurous, mostly sulfurous molecules,

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200
[Guest]: okay?

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:34.120
[Guest]: Which is actually why most of our tastiest spices have sulfurous molecules in them, right?

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:40.960
[Guest]: Onion, asafoetida, you name it, like curry leaves, all of these primarily have sulfurous

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.440
[Guest]: molecules because you try feeding that to a cow or a herbivore, they find it very nasty,

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440
[Guest]: right?

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.160
[Guest]: We, on the other hand, can tame that by cooking it, right?

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.560
[Guest]: It's hard for us to eat a raw onion or a garlic, but once you cook it, we're taming a lot of

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:58.280
[Guest]: those reactions so that we are able to actually eat it.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.720
[Guest]: So it's just that for us, we've managed to kind of figure out how to get past the defense

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.720
[Guest]: mechanisms.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.520
[Guest]: And now there's actually another, so I was reading Michael Pollan's book, I think it's

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.760
[Guest]: the Botany of Desire, right?

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.760
[Guest]: And he kind of says that, you know, I think we see it from a very anthropocentric view,

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760
[Guest]: right?

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.800
[Guest]: See, when you think of the fact that whether it's the humans who are, you know, growing

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.880
[Guest]: apples or growing corn all over the place, or is it that has the plant actually biochemically

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.360
[Guest]: got you addicted enough to the point where there's actually more biomass of corn today

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.280
[Guest]: than human beings?

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.480
[Guest]: So if aliens, there's this joke about aliens coming to planet and figuring out who's the

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.760
[Guest]: dominant species, will they go walk up to a stock of corn or rice, or will they walk

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.040
[Guest]: up to a human being is something that we'll have to figure out because purely from a pure

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.520
[Guest]: play of evolutionary success, they've been tremendously successful because they've convinced

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.920
[Guest]: us to grow them and also kill all their competition.

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.120
[Guest]: So we do monoculture by not letting any other plant grow for acres and acres.

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.280
[Guest]: And so in that sense, the plant is actually successful in that sense, right?

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.580
[Guest]: So there are many defense mechanisms, different spices.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.960
[Guest]: So the stronger the spice, the stronger the defense mechanism.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:05.560
[Guest]: So that's essentially how all of these, so you take a ginger, onion, garlic, all of these

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:12.400
[Guest]: are strong antibacterial or antifungal or anti sort of anti, you know, animal eating

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.160
[Guest]: kind of mechanisms.

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.200
[Guest]: And that's essentially how we got all our spices.

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.960
[Amit Varma]: So that's a, that's a lovely insight that you just quoted from Pauline as well.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:24.560
[Amit Varma]: Like there's a famous Douglas Adams quote, I think about imagine a puddle of water and

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.280
[Amit Varma]: one day the puddle of water wakes up and this is of course also an anthropocentric view

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.320
[Amit Varma]: of a puddle of water because puddles of water can't think.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.040
[Amit Varma]: But the puddle of water decides that, Hey, you know, this universe must be made for me

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.920
[Amit Varma]: because everything is such a perfect fit.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And it keeps sinking that gradually one day it is no longer there, you know?

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.000
[Amit Varma]: So now tell me a bit about spices.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.960
[Amit Varma]: We've basically, and this is obviously fortuitous.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:51.240
[Amit Varma]: I don't think it is that, you know, that there was any sense when these defense mechanisms

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.960
[Amit Varma]: were evolving that they will actually help, you know, spread this stuff about.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:00.760
[Amit Varma]: But before that, I just want to, I found that thought of, you know, walking trees in an

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.840
[Amit Varma]: atmosphere with less oxygen.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.160
[Amit Varma]: So utterly delightful.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.640
[Amit Varma]: So you have a lot of the rings, you have the ends.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.960
[Amit Varma]: So that's the, yeah, except the ends are there along with hobbits and humans, and that's

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:14.960
[Amit Varma]: obviously not possible.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.680
[Amit Varma]: It's one or the other.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And I think I prefer the walking trees.

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about spices.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Now you've elaborated on spices in great detail.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And to be honest, I am going to reread this and sort of take my time to process it.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, like I cook a little bit, but my cooking is all the kind of cooking that

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.800
[Amit Varma]: you would really frown upon.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.760
[Amit Varma]: It is basically, I'll have a recipe which I've mugged up and something has worked for

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.960
[Amit Varma]: me in the past and is very functional and I don't kind of think about it.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.780
[Amit Varma]: But you know, after I read your book, I figured that, listen, this is like so fascinating

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.120
[Amit Varma]: and I've got to kind of play around a bit.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Now you point out that, you know, you divide spices into four broad buckets.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:57.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously there are, there's a much subtler gradation, which you also describe,

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.720
[Amit Varma]: but tell me a bit about these four buckets and tell me how we should think about spices

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.720
[Amit Varma]: in general.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, especially all the people who are in India right now, and we cook here and we have

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.880
[Amit Varma]: kitchens and we have access to all of these spices.

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:10.880
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.880
[Amit Varma]: How should we think about them?

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.560
[Guest]: So, so first I think, you know, let me start by saying that first and foremost, there's

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.280
[Guest]: no such thing as a wrong way to cook or a wrong way to approach cooking.

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.520
[Guest]: I think that's a rule number zero, right, is that you cook, it feeds you, you like it,

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.880
[Guest]: you know, that's basically great.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.880
[Guest]: That's it.

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:25.880
[Guest]: Right.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.960
[Guest]: So I think the first and foremost thing is to get this whole sense of superiority about,

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:33.100
[Guest]: yes, it's actually, it's perfectly fine to learn from recipes and cook, you know, everyone

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.800
[Guest]: has their own mental model, if you will.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.280
[Guest]: So getting to spices, right?

01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.000
[Guest]: So spices are actually quite fascinating because they're rather central to Indian cooking,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
[Guest]: right?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.520
[Guest]: And there's also this other, there's this gentleman called Ganesh Bagler, who's I think

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.840
[Guest]: in the IIIT, and I read this talk of his, he's written a paper on how a lot of traditional

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:59.960
[Guest]: science about how flavors combine in the West, right, is predicated on what we call sharing

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960
[Guest]: flavor molecules, right?

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.040
[Guest]: So the things that share flavor molecules, like if something has three flavor molecules

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.640
[Guest]: and this one has four flavor molecules and two of them are common, then the general theory

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.120
[Guest]: is that if you combine both of them together, it will taste better because they'll kind

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.680
[Guest]: of, you know, harmoniously go together, right?

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.320
[Guest]: So they've worked out a lot of these combinations, which is why you kind of have this, you know,

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.560
[Guest]: there's a steak and butter sauce sort of thing, because there's some molecules that are similar.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.600
[Guest]: You can have cranberry sauce and ligandberry sauce and meatballs, because some, you know,

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.240
[Guest]: so you have these standard combinations in the West, which are all based on this idea.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.720
[Guest]: Now, what Ganesh Bagler actually says is that Southeast Asian and South Asian cooking actually

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.080
[Guest]: takes a fundamentally opposite approach.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:44.720
[Guest]: A lot of our cooking actually works by taking things that you would not believe should work

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.680
[Guest]: together by that original sort of Western idea, and they work together fantastically,

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680
[Guest]: right?

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.200
[Guest]: And that thinking is now going back into the West.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.280
[Guest]: So there is now, there's actually, there's a book called Art of Flavor, I think.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.880
[Guest]: It's actually written by a perfumier, which again, goes back to the fact that a lot of

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.520
[Guest]: taste, a lot of flavor is actually aroma, right?

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:05.600
[Guest]: It's a guy who makes perfumes and a chef, and they've kind of got together and tried

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.440
[Guest]: to concoct these completely new contrasting combinations.

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.280
[Guest]: I'll give you one odd example before we get to spices, right?

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.240
[Guest]: One of the fascinating examples he says is that if you take some coffee beans, like whole

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.080
[Guest]: coffee beans, and put them in a baking tray and put cut, chopped, cut carrots, and then

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.000
[Guest]: drizzle some olive oil and let it bake for like, you know, 30 minutes.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.680
[Guest]: He says that the, I mean, coffee is fantastically complex, right?

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.000
[Guest]: There are many of these flavor molecules that for some bizarre reason work fantastically

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.760
[Guest]: well with carrot, and that carrot will taste like nothing you've ever had.

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.240
[Guest]: And this is just literally just carrot and, you know, and coffee, coffee beans, and you

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.240
[Guest]: can just add some salt.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.240
[Guest]: Obviously you need some salt.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.740
[Guest]: Carrots anyway are sweet, right?

01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:45.840
[Guest]: So they have sugar.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.120
[Guest]: So kind of coming to spices, right?

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.760
[Guest]: Indian subcontinental cooking is, is, you know, so I often say that Japanese cooking

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:59.680
[Guest]: is umami centered, in that the basic principle is to create a umami laden broth, either by

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:03.720
[Guest]: use of seaweed and kombu and dashi, you know, tuna flakes and all these other things.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:07.620
[Guest]: You create a very umami laden broth, then all the other ingredients can be very minimalist.

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:12.880
[Guest]: You can literally just drop raw meat, raw, this thing's raw, just mildly cooked vegetables

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:13.880
[Guest]: and so on.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.600
[Guest]: The broth is going to be so flavorful that that's really what centers the whole thing.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.240
[Guest]: India has a fat and spice base in the sense that you, you basically all cooking starts

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.040
[Guest]: by eating fat and putting some spices into it.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.120
[Guest]: You can't say this for Western cooking, not all dishes start by eating oil and putting

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.120
[Guest]: some spices, right?

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.080
[Guest]: So you start either by baking, you make a batter or you roast vegetables or you sort

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.360
[Guest]: of, you rub something on meat and you oven grill it.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.320
[Guest]: So it's, it's not, it's not like that, right?

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.160
[Guest]: India, on the other hand, it is, it is very much a fat and spice driven world.

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.800
[Guest]: And I often sort of, I realized that a lot of Indians were kind of looking at spices

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.000
[Guest]: in the wrong way, right?

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.040
[Guest]: One is the fact that not realizing that spice flavor is volatile, that it is largely soluble

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.640
[Guest]: only in fat and or alcohol, right?

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.320
[Guest]: Very little in water, right?

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.960
[Guest]: So this should therefore tell you something, right?

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.360
[Guest]: Any spices after you've added water, right, you're, you're going to start to lose it to

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.640
[Guest]: the air.

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:15.800
[Guest]: So therefore, when you add powdered spices to a gravy, the earlier you add it, the more

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:21.080
[Guest]: flavor you're going to lose, which would therefore tell you that literally any recipe that basically

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.480
[Guest]: says that you heat the oil, you add some spices, you add your gravy, you add tomatoes or ginger,

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480
[Guest]: onion, garlic, et cetera.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.080
[Guest]: Then you add water, some kind of gravy, and then you put the new powder, jeera powder

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:32.720
[Guest]: and something like that.

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.440
[Guest]: The earlier you use it in the cooking process, the more flavor you're largely going to lose,

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.240
[Guest]: which is okay because how people adjust is by adding tons of it, right?

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.000
[Guest]: So people will say, add a tablespoon of teriya powder.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.400
[Guest]: On the other hand, I realize that, you know what, if you get freshly made teriya powder

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.040
[Guest]: and you add it right at the end, just like you would add garam masala, you'll get the

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.160
[Guest]: same effect and you just need to add a quarter teaspoon.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.640
[Guest]: So there's a simple economics thing here as well.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.560
[Guest]: If you understand why you're doing what you're doing, you can actually be much smarter about

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.560
[Guest]: it, right?

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.400
[Guest]: And the second thing is about the fact that because they're so volatile, a lot of these

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.320
[Guest]: spices, which are again expensive, you know, on a per gram basis, you don't want to buy

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.120
[Guest]: powders and just keep them at room temperature, right?

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.120
[Guest]: Indian climate is brutal.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.880
[Guest]: I mean, they're going to oxidize and they're going to taste like sand, right?

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.240
[Guest]: So you want to freeze or refrigerate powdered spices because, you know, you're buying chana

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.240
[Guest]: masala, right?

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.000
[Guest]: You're going to use like a tablespoon or so, and a hundred grams are going to sit around

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.720
[Guest]: becoming sand, right?

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.320
[Guest]: So you want to refrigerate or freeze, or what I tell people is that, look, get yourself

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.040
[Guest]: a cheap coffee grinder and make a ton of these things that you do otherwise very regularly,

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.040
[Guest]: right?

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.280
[Guest]: You can make relatively decent sized batches of say, then your powder or Jira powder, literally

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.600
[Guest]: in a coffee grinder.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.640
[Guest]: And that way that taste is just way better because the whole spice does not lose aroma,

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.400
[Guest]: whereas your powdered spices lose aroma, right?

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.600
[Guest]: So this is another kind of, you know, key insight in terms of, you know, how spices

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600
[Guest]: work, right?

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:06.640
[Guest]: And the distinction between, so how wet or fresh spices work, like your ginger, onion,

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.040
[Guest]: garlic, and those kinds of things, you know, and how herbs, leaves in general work, like

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040
[Guest]: garnishes, right?

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.040
[Guest]: So because you don't cook them a lot, right?

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.240
[Guest]: Because they lose a lot of the aroma very quickly, right?

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:23.160
[Guest]: Whole spices work in a, essentially by, you want to either powder them and add them later,

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.080
[Guest]: or you want to add them to your oil upfront so that you get all the flavor into the oil.

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.400
[Guest]: So that's basically the broad principles, right?

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:38.520
[Guest]: And also, remember that there are certain standard combinations that really work, right?

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.900
[Guest]: And they kind of evoke a very specific region, right?

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:49.640
[Guest]: So if you take Ajwain or Radhuni or Fenugreek and Nigella, mustard and cumin, and you fry

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:55.100
[Guest]: these in mustard oil, no matter what you do after that, it will evoke Bengal, right?

01:49:55.100 --> 01:50:00.040
[Guest]: If you take coconut oil, then you kind of put garlic and red chilies and curry leaves

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.040
[Guest]: and mustard and so on.

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.480
[Guest]: It will evoke Kerala, you know, no matter what you do after that, right?

01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.400
[Guest]: So in a sense, the realization ultimately, therefore, is that this spice, flavor, and

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:14.480
[Guest]: the fat combination pretty much really just determines the regional flavor profile of

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.000
[Guest]: all Indian cuisines, right?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.840
[Guest]: What you choose to do and what kind of mixes you choose to use, what whole spices you use

01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.320
[Guest]: and what powdered spices you use, it literally determines.

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.200
[Guest]: All the rest are actually, so therefore, you can mix and match, right?

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.600
[Guest]: Nothing stops you from making, taking, for example, a Shukto in Bengal is very similar

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.040
[Guest]: to an Aviyal in the way it's made, except that the fat is different, the spices are

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.120
[Guest]: different, right?

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.600
[Guest]: And the starch binder is different, right?

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.800
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know, you could mix and match and really.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:45.520
[Guest]: So I think in a sense, understanding spice as well will actually make you a more experimental

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.600
[Guest]: cook because then you're not worried about the other ingredients.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.200
[Guest]: You can make anything with anything.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you have a delightful video on the making of Shukto as well.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.640
[Amit Varma]: I'll link your channel from the notes so the listeners can discover that.

01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.040
[Amit Varma]: And I watched it at double speed, actually, I must confess, but that was enough for me.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:08.040
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, if I want to actually make it, I'll have to obviously watch it at regular speed

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.720
[Amit Varma]: and take notes and all that.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.800
[Amit Varma]: Another interesting thing you pointed out, like, you know, when you spoke about make

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.760
[Amit Varma]: your own spice mix, I was like, yes, I am going to do just that.

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.320
[Amit Varma]: But then you said that don't use a blender, use a mortar and pestle because the blender

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.840
[Amit Varma]: will, you know, the thing rotates so fast that it will actually start cooking the spices

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.480
[Amit Varma]: as it is grinding them.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And the lazy bong in me immediately responded to that and said, what I have to do so much

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:35.120
[Amit Varma]: work, you know, which is something in Indian cooking, right?

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Like Indian recipes seem so daunting to me sometimes because there are like 84,000 ingredients

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:45.080
[Amit Varma]: in every one of them and is that a bit of a stumbling block or is it not really as hard

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.080
[Guest]: as it seems?

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.140
[Guest]: It is not as hard.

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:53.560
[Guest]: If you understand the function, each one of those families of ingredients play in a dish

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.160
[Guest]: and therefore mentally you can kind of figure out what is absolutely mandatory and what

01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.840
[Guest]: is not.

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:02.960
[Guest]: And what you can replace with whatever you have with a common mistake is to take a recipe

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:03.960
[Guest]: which has like 20 ingredients.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.680
[Guest]: First thing you go, go to a store and buy like 200 grams and 250 grams of every one

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:11.560
[Guest]: of those things, which are going to use a tiny portion off and then the rest of it is

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.560
[Guest]: going to go waste.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.720
[Guest]: And I think the amount of waste generated in a country that is famously frugal in, in,

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:20.640
[Guest]: in how we waste spices is just quite crazy, right?

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:24.600
[Guest]: And that too comes from this, this traditional idea that some of the refrigerator is bad

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:28.360
[Guest]: and that the things that you keep in the refrigerator are not fresh, which is very counterproductive,

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.360
[Guest]: right?

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.920
[Guest]: I mean, actually things kept in the refrigerator stay fresh, right?

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.840
[Guest]: Because the very definition of freshness is, is, is the fact that if you stop biological

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:41.080
[Guest]: activity, which stops at, you know, a couple of Celsius below zero or really slowing down

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.760
[Guest]: biological activity, that's freshness, right?

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.160
[Guest]: So, which is why I kind of say that, you know, frozen vegetables are actually fresher than,

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.240
[Guest]: than actual fresh vegetables in cities, right?

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.320
[Guest]: Because the frozen vegetables were frozen very little after they were harvested.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.960
[Guest]: The actual fresh vegetables have been outside for a much longer time before they got to

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.640
[Guest]: your city, right?

01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:03.440
[Guest]: So therefore coming back to spices, right?

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.080
[Guest]: So the thought process was not to say that, you know, you must use a mortar and pestle,

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.480
[Guest]: but it's to understand one, why we use that, right?

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:14.960
[Guest]: One is that historically we use mortar and pestle because it is a gentler way of actually

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:22.160
[Guest]: breaking into and sort of extracting flavors out of these things without generating heat,

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.160
[Guest]: right?

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:27.360
[Guest]: Whereas the rapidly spinning blade is going to end up generating a ton of heat and heat

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.920
[Guest]: means that the volatile molecules are going to escape.

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.040
[Guest]: So you want to lose a little bit more of the aroma, right?

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.720
[Guest]: And some of that stuff at high temperature will also oxidize.

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.680
[Guest]: And so therefore that's going to lose a little bit of flavor.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:43.600
[Guest]: So which is why, for example, you know, my maternal grandfather was a notorious patriarch

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.720
[Guest]: in terms of, he would ask his, my grandmother was a fantastic cook, right?

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.760
[Guest]: The one who's quoted in the starting this thing.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.560
[Guest]: So she was a great cook obviously because he was very demanding.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.760
[Guest]: And he would say that chutney made for idli, right?

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.600
[Guest]: Not in a mixi, right?

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:03.240
[Guest]: He did not buy her a mixi for many years because he felt that the taste that you get from a

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.440
[Guest]: mortar and pestle is better than what you get from mixi.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.320
[Guest]: He was right about the fact that you get better taste.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.520
[Guest]: But obviously it's a terrible choice to make because you know, she was slaving at the kitchen

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.520
[Guest]: in a day in and day out.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.240
[Guest]: And sometimes you, you know, you have to make these compromises based on how much time you

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.280
[Guest]: have, right?

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.600
[Guest]: So therefore, if you think, if you don't want to mix your own spices, et cetera, by all

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.240
[Guest]: means buy spice powders, but freeze them, not refrigerate.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:30.200
[Guest]: Four or five Celsius is still has a ton of biological activity happens.

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.200
[Guest]: It's only under 15 or 16 Celsius below zero that you are genuinely keeping stuff for months

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.200
[Guest]: on it.

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.360
[Guest]: So you need to put them in the freezer, right?

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.360
[Guest]: But if you're fancy up to it, then, you know, get yourself a spice grinder, you'll save

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.520
[Guest]: money on the long run.

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:44.600
[Guest]: That's that.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.960
[Guest]: But if you're really artisanal and you have the time and effort, I do want to make say

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.920
[Guest]: the greatest chutney you possibly can, then you should use a mortar and pestle.

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:55.920
[Guest]: So it's just understanding why, what each of these things does.

01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And I guess some of it is psychological, like you've pointed out, I think you had a lovely,

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you talk about 80% of days being the nose, you had a lovely drawing alongside

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:08.840
[Amit Varma]: it, where you also talk about how site matters, you know, how the food is presented will matter,

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.240
[Amit Varma]: what you think about it will matter.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I remember reading long ago about some blind test involving wines, fine wines, and people

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:20.080
[Amit Varma]: couldn't make out the difference between thousand dollar wines and $10 wines when they were

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.080
[Amit Varma]: blind.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.080
[Guest]: So it's...

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.080
[Guest]: Very much.

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.080
[Guest]: Right.

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.160
[Guest]: So beyond, I mean, in fact, if you think about the role of nostalgia, the role of memories

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.840
[Guest]: and all of that is very, very, very important in how you perceive a flavor, and people mostly

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:38.280
[Guest]: fail, tend to fail blind taste tests when it comes to very specific things about, oh,

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.440
[Guest]: I can tell the difference between, like, for example, people actually fail a blind taste

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:48.440
[Guest]: test between synthetic vanilla, which is 25 rupees a bottle, and real vanilla, which is

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440
[Guest]: insanely expensive.

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:55.980
[Guest]: And this, in many cases, as part of cakes and desserts, people regularly choose the

01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:59.240
[Guest]: synthetic vanilla as tasting better and more natural.

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.240
[Guest]: So it is, it is just that, you know, people have these crazy notions.

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's insane.

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:09.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and the difference between the two is that, you know, the real vanilla is manufactured

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.720
[Amit Varma]: by a kind of random process through nature.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And this one is manufactured much more sort of directionally as it was, so, you know,

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:17.960
[Amit Varma]: which one is likely to be better.

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:22.560
[Guest]: Not to mention the sustainability of the fact that it grows only in Madagascar and all the

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.800
[Guest]: other attendant problems of that.

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:25.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you spoke of nostalgia and that's, you know, one of the sort of another

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:38.200
[Amit Varma]: of the TIL moments in there, for me, like it was when you were talking about Maggi masala,

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:42.720
[Amit Varma]: the instant noodle kind of mix where you point out that so many people like it so much because

01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.280
[Amit Varma]: it has such a combination that it will remind everybody of something of the spice mix they

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280
[Guest]: grew up with.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:49.280
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:50.280
[Guest]: Right.

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:54.520
[Guest]: It is actually so, you know, I spent a lot of time looking at the, analyzing the Maggi

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.520
[Guest]: masala.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.680
[Guest]: I mean, incidentally, it's not just an Indian thing, right?

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:05.680
[Guest]: So Nestle is basically kind of cracked the, this whole idea of this, some kind of umami

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.760
[Guest]: or a flavor sachet or a cube or whatever it is, or a sauce.

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:16.520
[Guest]: So this whole Maggi flavoring masala in India, cubes in the West and sauces in Southeast

01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.520
[Guest]: Asia.

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.520
[Guest]: So they have one for every, and they nailed down exactly what evokes that kind of, fantastic.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.360
[Guest]: I mean, somehow whoever came up with that.

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:29.920
[Guest]: And so, for example, there is a, there's an equivalent of this sort of cube or whatever

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:33.840
[Guest]: you get in, say, Nigeria, that Nigerians are absolutely addicted.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.060
[Guest]: And likewise, the Maggi seasoning sauce, Indonesia, you will not find, that's the last thing that

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:43.880
[Guest]: goes on any, you know, Mi Goreng or a Nasi Goreng is that Maggi seasoning sauce, which

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:47.920
[Guest]: is very high umami in soy sauce kind of mix, right?

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.780
[Guest]: So likewise, in India, clearly, what they've done is they've kind of taken a combination

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:59.520
[Guest]: broadly of garam masala, which is a very reasonably universal mix of some very common, you know,

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.800
[Guest]: fancy spices, you know, black cardamom, green cardamom, you know, cloves, pepper, the expensive

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.520
[Guest]: ones, right?

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:14.120
[Guest]: And basically sambar powder, which is essentially coriander, chilies, is what ultimately sort

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:20.000
[Guest]: of is the primary flavor profile of, and fenugreek is the primary flavor profile of sambar, right?

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.440
[Guest]: They kind of combine both together, and then you add the garlic powder and dried garlic

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.400
[Guest]: powder, dried onion powder, and dried ginger powder, which incidentally, you know, since

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:34.320
[Guest]: we spoke about the whole addiction thing, these are three of some of the most addictive

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:37.880
[Guest]: spice mixes that most Indians don't tend to have in the home kitchen.

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:42.320
[Guest]: Because one, they're very, very volatile, and so people don't think about storing them

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.320
[Guest]: in the refrigerator.

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:49.760
[Guest]: But trust me, consumer snacks are addictive because they use onion and garlic powder.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:54.760
[Guest]: These are actually dehydrated, so they're super concentrated umami bombs, right?

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.800
[Guest]: And they're, I mean, they just, so you bite into a chips and you get all that rich flavor

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:04.080
[Guest]: is not by frying real onions and getting that flavor, it's dehydrated onions, right?

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:09.080
[Guest]: And so dried onion, garlic, and ginger powder is generally tends to be there in all snacks,

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.080
[Guest]: right?

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.600
[Guest]: And then you need some element of sourness, it's typically a kind of an amchur, and then

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.960
[Guest]: you need some kind of a starch binder, so that, you know, if you make a mistake by adding

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:22.480
[Guest]: a little bit too much water to your Maggi, the Maggi masala will make sure that it thickens

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.920
[Guest]: a bit.

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.080
[Guest]: So they've really thought this through fantastically well.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.320
[Guest]: So I'm a huge fan of, I mean, you can literally take any ordinary dish, just sprinkle some

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:33.520
[Guest]: Maggi masala to it, and people will say, Oh, wow, how on earth did you make it?

01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:35.160
[Amit Varma]: I said, I just use Maggi masala.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Mind blowing.

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, what you should tell them is, I spent eight hours today with a mortar and

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:42.080
[Amit Varma]: pestle just getting this just right.

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of chips, you know, I'm reminded of another of the sort of revelations of your

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:52.360
[Amit Varma]: book, which is the reason we've evolved to like things which are crisp is because, you

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:56.480
[Amit Varma]: know, back in prehistoric times, when we lived in caves and all of that, you know, anything

01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:01.640
[Amit Varma]: which was fresh was crisp, and therefore, we associate that as, you know, good to eat

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.640
[Guest]: and you're...

02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:03.640
[Guest]: Yeah, crunch, right?

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:07.480
[Guest]: So crunch, the ability to distinguish crunch is the difference between eating a fresh fruit

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.720
[Guest]: versus a rotten fruit that could kill you.

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.960
[Guest]: And I think, you know, so clearly, we have a preference for, and the way we detect crunch

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:19.040
[Guest]: is a combination of actually sound, right?

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.480
[Guest]: And the other rather interesting thing is that a lot of that crunch that when you bite

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:27.200
[Guest]: into a potato chip, right, or a pani puri, for that matter, is essentially that a lot

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:29.000
[Guest]: of that sound is actually in the ultrasonic range.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
[Guest]: It's not in the audible range.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.680
[Guest]: There is some in the audible range, you hear it, but a fair amount of that sound is actually

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:37.520
[Guest]: in the ultrasonic range, which you can't hear, but you can feel it in your bones, right?

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.720
[Guest]: Which is why even congenitally deaf people can still experience the crunch of a potato

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:45.200
[Guest]: chip without any loss of taste.

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200
[Amit Varma]: Mind-blowing.

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.360
[Amit Varma]: So we are actually responding to food with our bones.

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:51.360
[Amit Varma]: Pretty amazing.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's now go on to, you know, the next chapter in your book, which is about the magic color

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.040
[Amit Varma]: brown.

02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And you begin this with this sort of beautiful quote by Sidney Smith, which I loved.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:06.080
[Amit Varma]: I love the quotes at the start of your chapters, by the way, and this one goes, quote, let

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: onion atoms lurk within the bowl and half suspected animate the whole, which is fantastic.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and then you of course have, you know, another quote shortly after by Julia

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Child talking about how it's hard to imagine a civilization without onions and, you know,

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.600
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about onions because after reading this chapter, I felt that, Hey,

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:30.600
[Guest]: what is this?

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.880
[Amit Varma]: I don't appreciate onions enough.

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:33.920
[Guest]: It is enough to make me cry.

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:37.280
[Guest]: You know, the other funny thing is that, you know, as I say in the book, India, we don't

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:39.440
[Guest]: even get the best tasting onions.

02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:43.960
[Guest]: The variety of onions we grow are actually great for salads in the West.

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.000
[Guest]: They're not considered to be cooking onions at all.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.520
[Guest]: So they use the more golden ones that actually are tremendously more flavorful, but slightly

02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:52.800
[Guest]: sweeter, which I think probably works for Indians.

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.720
[Guest]: But then, you know, one of the things about Indian cooking is the realization that you

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.080
[Guest]: can take subpar ingredients and make great food, right?

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.520
[Guest]: You know, unlike diametrically opposite Italian food, which if you don't have great quality

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:09.480
[Guest]: ingredients, you can't make great Italian food, right?

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:15.120
[Guest]: And so onions are very central and, you know, we know famously they're all over the news.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.320
[Guest]: The moment the onions prices rise, you know, there's chaos, there's riots, and there's,

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.560
[Guest]: you know, all kinds of, it's all over the news, right?

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.640
[Guest]: Because literally every part of India, you know, onions, first thing that goes into the

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:26.640
[Guest]: oil, right?

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.400
[Guest]: Pretty much, right?

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.840
[Guest]: Just despite the fact that on religious days, many Hindus will not eat onions.

02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.240
[Guest]: And there are obviously, you know, many Brahmins, orthodox Brahmins will not eat onions at all

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:39.520
[Guest]: as they grow older and so on, right?

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.880
[Guest]: And definitely not garlic, but definitely onions are also a part of that, that Tamasic

02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.480
[Guest]: list, if you will.

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:51.520
[Guest]: So onions, first and foremost, are mostly water and they have a ton of flavor without

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:53.020
[Guest]: adding calories.

02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.200
[Guest]: So it's a very unique package.

02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.360
[Guest]: And this is if a garlic, for instance, is quite dense, it has a lot less water, right?

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.000
[Guest]: Which is why a garlic is usually added after because it's more likely to burn in the pan

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
[Guest]: because it has less water.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.680
[Guest]: An onion, on the other hand, is just a lot of water, which is why it takes a ton of time

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.960
[Guest]: for it to actually brown, right?

02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.240
[Guest]: Because it has to lose a lot of that water.

02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:19.640
[Guest]: Only then will the sugars and the proteins in the onion combine to make those brown colors

02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.640
[Guest]: as part of the Bayard reaction and so on.

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:25.280
[Guest]: And most people don't have that patient, just get it to translucent stage, which is essentially

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.240
[Guest]: when the cell walls lose their structural integrity, that's when it becomes, so it loses

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.240
[Guest]: the crispness.

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.240
[Guest]: So that's when it becomes translucent.

02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:36.360
[Guest]: And then you leave it at that, which is mostly fine, you'll get a mild oniony flavor.

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:45.360
[Guest]: But if you take dishes like, say, a Bhuna, especially like mutton in onions, that onion

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.680
[Guest]: needs to be really, really, really brown.

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:50.480
[Guest]: And that, again, it's a classic combination, right?

02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:55.400
[Guest]: So there's one of the things I talk about in a subsequent chapter is this idea that

02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:00.400
[Guest]: although the Japanese kind of are focused on umami, intuitively, humans have known about

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.040
[Guest]: umami pairings globally, right?

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.040
[Guest]: Mutton and onions are actually a fantastic umami pairing.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.800
[Guest]: And the reason I call it a pairing is that they're glutamates, and there's another family

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.840
[Guest]: of molecules called inosinates.

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:15.600
[Guest]: When you combine glutamates and inosinates, the effect is double that of just one of them

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:16.800
[Guest]: being there.

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:24.600
[Guest]: So that's why people are just so crazy about a really dark, well-cooked mutton gravy, because

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:27.840
[Guest]: it has such that lingering kind of flavor profile.

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.680
[Guest]: And it largely, again, doesn't come as much from the mutton as it actually comes from

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.280
[Guest]: the completely browned onions there, right?

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.800
[Guest]: And so therefore, onions are very, very central.

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:42.640
[Guest]: And essentially, the longer you cook them, the better they taste.

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:43.760
[Guest]: But then you may not want that.

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:48.400
[Guest]: If you're making a very milder dish, by all means, cook it lightly.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.560
[Guest]: But the further you get, the browner it gets, the more tasty it is, but also dangerous,

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.920
[Guest]: because it will also burn pretty quickly.

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:59.360
[Guest]: And you can actually take it to the logical level, and you can almost make it a jam, like

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.360
[Guest]: an onion jam, right?

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:06.560
[Guest]: A caramelized onion jam, which, by the way, is a fantastic condiment, very underrated.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:10.760
[Guest]: I realized that when I was in Australia, I realized that they were just crazy about it.

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:16.280
[Guest]: So all burgers in Australia, one of the ingredients there will always be caramelized onion jam,

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.280
[Guest]: right?

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.800
[Guest]: Which just adds so much flavor to the burger.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:24.760
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, and you kind of did point out the technical distinction that what you call caramelized,

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:28.360
[Amit Varma]: what we call caramelized onion is actually maillarded onion.

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you had a lot to say about sort of the magical maillard reaction.

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:32.680
[Unknown]: Oh, yes, absolutely.

02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that and why it is so central to food.

02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:41.800
[Guest]: So basically, we've known for a while that if you cook food above the boiling point of

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:45.720
[Guest]: water, between a certain range, food becomes brown, right?

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:47.440
[Guest]: It takes on these brown colors, right?

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:49.560
[Guest]: For a long while, we didn't quite know what's exactly happening.

02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:54.280
[Guest]: We kind of knew that there are some, clearly some chemical reactions happening.

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:59.160
[Guest]: So you know, you have to realize that as long as you're cooking inside water, right, a lot

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.240
[Guest]: of the changes are not major chemical reactions at all.

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:06.840
[Guest]: In that, see, gelatinization is more a rearrangement of structure rather than a major chemical

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:07.840
[Guest]: change itself.

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:13.960
[Guest]: Maillard reaction is actually where things are breaking down into other bunch of families

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:17.160
[Guest]: of molecules, because that's when you have enough heat to actually break down stuff,

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.160
[Guest]: right?

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:20.080
[Guest]: So as long as water is there, none of that is happening.

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:25.360
[Guest]: So what happens between 110 and 170 Celsius is what this Louis Cabille Maillard, this

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:30.840
[Guest]: French chemist, he kind of started documenting that he found that a family of six or seven

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:37.240
[Guest]: families of molecules, which are fantastically aromatic and also lend that characteristic

02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:40.280
[Guest]: brown color to food, right?

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:45.280
[Guest]: And then depending on, and the fact that you can only do this if your food has both proteins

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:52.720
[Guest]: and sugars, which is why you can't deep fry just a raw piece of chicken, right?

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:54.080
[Guest]: Deep frying is also a Maillard reaction.

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.800
[Guest]: It's just that it's happening at the higher end.

02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:59.640
[Guest]: So you want to instantaneously dehydrate, but you're still browning, right?

02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.360
[Guest]: Fresh chicken does not have sugars.

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.160
[Guest]: So that's where you have to bread it.

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.680
[Guest]: So you have to take it and then you have to add it some kind of starch, which is again

02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:11.240
[Guest]: sugars, which therefore will then react with the protein and the meat.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.000
[Guest]: And then that's how you make fried chicken, right?

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.360
[Guest]: That's where we use batters in general.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:20.820
[Guest]: So anything that does not have enough of either proteins or starches will use a batter, right?

02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.400
[Guest]: So that, you know, you are able to, or egg for that matter, right?

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:26.840
[Guest]: So you can use egg plus breadcrumbs or whatever, right?

02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:31.160
[Guest]: So essentially the Maillard reaction produces a family of molecules that can take very,

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:36.480
[Guest]: very seemingly boring ingredients, like, you know, as I described, a cabbage, right?

02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:41.840
[Guest]: Which everyone hates, because if you steam a cabbage, it smells very bad because it generates

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.160
[Guest]: hydrogen sulfide gas and that's why you should not steam cabbage and it will naturally steam

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:49.840
[Guest]: if you have a small vessel and you're cutting a ton of cabbage, it will steam.

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.640
[Guest]: So unfortunately the only way to cook cabbage in a way that is not steam is to cook a small

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:57.360
[Guest]: amount in a big pan, which is usually impractical.

02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:00.320
[Guest]: So almost always cabbage is going to smell bad, right?

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:05.280
[Guest]: But on the other hand, if you actually cook cabbage to well past 110 Celsius, right, as

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:09.760
[Guest]: it starts to get caramelized, caramelized or, you know, Maillard, you know, cabbage,

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.320
[Guest]: if you will, is just insanely tasty, right?

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.160
[Guest]: So in fact, I learned this from a Russian recipe where they actually say the way they

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:22.080
[Guest]: eat cabbage is by caramelizing it for like half an hour, 45 minutes it takes in just

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:26.880
[Guest]: olive oil or some oil and just let it slow cook and then it'll slowly lose all the water,

02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:31.760
[Guest]: get really brown and it'll produce fantastic flavors all by itself, right?

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:37.600
[Guest]: So this is definitely, this is essentially the realization here is that you can simply

02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:42.480
[Guest]: become a better cook by learning something that restaurants tend to do, right?

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:46.080
[Guest]: If you're making a gravy, realizing that you can't get the Maillard reaction going because

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.960
[Guest]: it's a gravy.

02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:53.360
[Guest]: So to get the advantages of all of the flavors, the core ingredients are sauteed or fried

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.880
[Guest]: separately and then added because they're brown.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:58.240
[Guest]: And so they bring all that flavor and then you add it to the gravy.

02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:02.840
[Guest]: So aloo gobi made in a restaurant is aloo and gobi separately deep fried and then added

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.600
[Guest]: to the gravy, right?

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:06.720
[Guest]: So likewise, pretty much anything else, right?

02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.360
[Guest]: So I think, so that's one, you know, key thing and also the realization that deep frying

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:16.040
[Guest]: is also the Maillard reaction, except very rapid with the intent of actually dehydrating

02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.200
[Guest]: the surface so that it becomes crisp and prevents oil from getting inside.

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:22.080
[Guest]: Otherwise it will be greasy, right?

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:27.280
[Guest]: So, which is why if you're making puri and the temperature is well below 170 Celsius,

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.760
[Guest]: the outside is not going to dehydrate fast enough.

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.760
[Guest]: So the oil is going to get inside.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.440
[Guest]: So you get greasy puri.

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:36.960
[Guest]: But if you precisely keep the temperature at between 175 and 180 Celsius, it will just

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:39.180
[Guest]: get perfectly crisp on the outside.

02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:42.600
[Guest]: And so that the inside does not undergo the Maillard reaction, it's only undergoing steaming,

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:43.600
[Guest]: right?

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.600
[Guest]: So that's exactly what you want.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.680
[Guest]: So deep frying is Maillard reaction only on the outside and starch gelatinization inside.

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.320
[Amit Varma]: So that's basically what the principles of Maillard reaction.

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Pretty stunning.

02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about cabbages, I mean, I totally empathize with that because I've

02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:02.280
[Amit Varma]: hated cabbages all my life, though if I ever have the patience, I might attempt them this

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.520
[Amit Varma]: way or maybe not, but I was kind of struck.

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:08.120
[Amit Varma]: And the reason we've hated it obviously is that one, you know, we cook it the wrong way

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.800
[Amit Varma]: and often we overcook it.

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And there's a quote from this chapter, which is a little bit of a tangent, but I did want

02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:18.680
[Amit Varma]: to ask you about that, which is, quote, we overcook vegetables, cook meat till it's drier

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:20.280
[Amit Varma]: than the surface of the moon.

02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And we like our eggs boiled harder than Pantera's music.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.040
[Amit Varma]: However, we compensate for all of that with a flavor-bombing strategy that has no parallel

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.600
[Amit Varma]: anywhere else in the world, stop quote.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.240
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me when I read this that this flavor-bombing strategy as such, though we've

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.760
[Amit Varma]: made a feature out of it and not a bug, may be a jugaadu way of covering up for bad cooking.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.200
[Amit Varma]: But are we kind of stuck here?

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Because now because of nostalgia, I won't say our tastes have evolved because I mean,

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.000
[Amit Varma]: I obviously don't mean the technical sense of the term, but we have grown to like certain

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.160
[Amit Varma]: kinds of food, certain kinds of food have, which are flavor-bombed food, have become

02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:59.840
[Amit Varma]: our comfort food, so to say.

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:03.840
[Amit Varma]: Is Indian cuisine therefore stuck in this equilibrium where it doesn't matter how you

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.120
[Amit Varma]: cook something as long as you get the spices right?

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:07.560
[Guest]: Yeah, I think so.

02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:13.720
[Guest]: One is that it's important to note that this strategy per se made perfect sense in a pre-refrigeration

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:19.280
[Guest]: India, which is essentially 30 years ago, till 30 years ago, for the most part, refrigerators

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.280
[Guest]: were not common.

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.360
[Guest]: And so, and refrigeration was not common, not just in your home, it wasn't even common

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.880
[Guest]: in stores.

02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:33.040
[Guest]: So in general, if you're in urban India, you have absolutely no guarantee how fresh the

02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:40.840
[Guest]: vegetables are, how fresh the meat is, how salmonella laden the eggs are, and what pesticides

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:46.200
[Guest]: were used to cover the palak or the vegetables to prevent them from being completely mauled

02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:50.640
[Guest]: by those insects, so that they survive till they actually get to your table in a city.

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:54.080
[Guest]: And the nearest place where they're growing the crops from your city is several hundred

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:55.080
[Guest]: kilometers away.

02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:00.560
[Guest]: So in that kind of world, urban Indian middle class kind of cooking, since all of these

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:04.280
[Guest]: are unknown, and you have no control over all of these, I think the strategy makes sense,

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.280
[Guest]: right?

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.320
[Guest]: So you do not want underboiled eggs.

02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:13.120
[Guest]: You absolutely want to make sure till it's green between the yolk and the whites.

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.120
[Guest]: So likewise, you do not want to undercook vegetables, you do not want to eat salads,

02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:20.800
[Guest]: because you don't know what pesticides went in, there's no controls.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:27.240
[Guest]: And again, there's a theme from your podcast that I've heard so many times, look, state

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:30.080
[Guest]: doesn't have the capacity to ensure these kinds of things, right?

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:33.520
[Guest]: And in a sense that so, and we're a very low trust society.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.760
[Guest]: So we don't trust any of this.

02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.800
[Guest]: So the only way to, so it might seem jugaadu, but it makes perfect sense in that sense.

02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.640
[Guest]: You're right, in the sense that it ends up building a memory, and a fondness and a nostalgia

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:46.920
[Guest]: for a specific kind of cooking, if you will, right?

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:52.160
[Guest]: But that's not too different from, say, the Chinese idea of stir frying food, right?

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.600
[Guest]: I mean, you know, you heard the fact that the reason they end up stir frying food is

02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:00.560
[Guest]: because they had a fuel shortage, cooking fuel was short, and so all cooking had to

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:05.160
[Guest]: happen at ultra high temperatures in very short amount of time, you know, they didn't

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:08.880
[Guest]: sit and do, you know, broths, like the Japanese did, you know, and so on.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.680
[Guest]: So a lot of that cooking had to happen in a flash, right?

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.680
[Guest]: And so, but you would argue that, you know, a lot of Chinese cooking has in some sense

02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.160
[Guest]: taken that constraint and evolved that way, although they have no such shortage, no.

02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:26.000
[Guest]: So I think that it's possible to take this strategy, and still make great, adventurous,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.440
[Guest]: creative new Indian food, by perhaps using great fresh organic ingredients, but toning

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.480
[Guest]: down the spices, and really, over time, building the taste.

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:38.720
[Guest]: And I can already see this in some of the experimental restaurants that are definitely

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.360
[Guest]: coming up outside of India, definitely in the likes of London and Toronto, where tons

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.080
[Guest]: of Indians, the Bay Area, New York, and so on, Australia and others, Singapore, for that

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.920
[Guest]: matter, but also in the likes of Bombay and Delhi, at least catering to the uber rich,

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:57.920
[Guest]: you're starting to see this wave of, I don't want it, you know, this oily and this high

02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:58.920
[Guest]: on masala, right?

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:05.320
[Guest]: In fact, a lot of home, the common complaint about restaurant food, it's too spicy, and

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.320
[Guest]: it's too oily.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:11.800
[Guest]: They're both that way, because one, you know, anything less would have been unhealthy, would

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.640
[Guest]: have killed you, could cause you food poisoning, and so on, right?

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:19.720
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think we can still evolve over time, definitely as people are more conscious

02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.440
[Guest]: about it, and perhaps people move towards hopefully trying to see if they have the privilege

02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:29.160
[Guest]: enough to be able to source fresher ingredients, you know, local, all of these, you know, you

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.840
[Guest]: have urban farms are now a common thing, Chennai has a ton of these places, that literally

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:38.040
[Guest]: just 10 kilometers away, there are people growing stuff in greenhouses, and shipping

02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.600
[Guest]: it to you, you know, weekly subscription, and I get a bunch of these leaves and small

02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.480
[Guest]: cucumbers and carrots, which are tastier than the giant carrots that I get in the supermarket.

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:50.240
[Guest]: I think as slowly as we develop a taste for that, we'll do that.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.040
[Guest]: But I would also say that, if you look at rural India, that's not the case.

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.560
[Guest]: I mean, you know, a lot of rural styles of cooking, one of my favorite, I often follow

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.940
[Guest]: a lot of these YouTube channels, these rural, this is 90 year old grandmother cooking, say

02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:07.520
[Guest]: this sort of a goat in rural Andhra and so on.

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.120
[Guest]: And you're struck by the fact that they don't overcook at all, right?

02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.920
[Guest]: They're actually they use absolutely literally, they walk over, you know, grab the coriander,

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.080
[Guest]: they grab the gongura, literally fresh of spring onion from the ground and so on.

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.080
[Guest]: And they wash it and it's literally made, they don't overcook in that situation.

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.400
[Guest]: So I would think that this is a very urban phenomenon, but I'm sure we can probably get

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:28.400
[Guest]: past it over time.

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:31.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and also, I didn't mean to come across as too judgmental when I spoke about it as

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:35.660
[Amit Varma]: being Jugaru, because another way of looking at it, like you spoke about how all Chinese

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:41.760
[Amit Varma]: cuisine might have evolved from this original set of constraints and this delightful diversity

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:48.400
[Amit Varma]: of cuisines that we have across the world is in a sense, comes about as a response to

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.080
[Amit Varma]: the different kinds of constraints that operate everywhere.

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:56.200
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you know, would we have learned to use spices in such subtle and delightful

02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.040
[Amit Varma]: ways if not for these constraints?

02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:59.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.040
[Guest]: Who knows?

02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:04.120
[Guest]: Plus the fact that, you know, almost all of the spices in the world grow in a very tiny

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.520
[Guest]: part of the world, right?

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.440
[Guest]: Literally the Malabar coast and a few islands in Indonesia.

02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:09.440
[Guest]: That's it, right?

02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:14.200
[Guest]: And maybe now Vietnam and Thailand are also starting to grow pepper and a few other things.

02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:20.080
[Guest]: But so in a sense that the very fact that they are now, the fact that pepper is now

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.720
[Guest]: a common ingredient literally everywhere in the world is by itself a fascinating story.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:31.840
[Guest]: And the fact that it is the the expensiveness and the impracticality of growing pepper all

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:37.040
[Guest]: over India is apparently one of the reasons why chilies became popular, right?

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:42.520
[Guest]: So, you know, so one of the things I often am fascinated about is that once a year we

02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:47.880
[Guest]: have this, so it's one day, one religious festival in my family where it's pretty common

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:50.560
[Guest]: here where you kind of remember your ancestors, right?

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.800
[Guest]: So three generations of ancestors, you remember them.

02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:55.840
[Guest]: So there's a, there's a, there's a haven that's done and so on.

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:59.080
[Guest]: And the food that is cooked on that day is very special.

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:02.080
[Guest]: There's a very specific set of recipes, which they say is that, you know, there's been,

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:06.080
[Guest]: we've been doing this on this day, always this is cooked and the recipes are quite fascinating

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.840
[Guest]: because they don't have tomatoes, chilies, in fact, they actually don't have any ingredients

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:12.400
[Guest]: that were not available in India 300 years ago, right?

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:18.920
[Guest]: So it's very yam based, it's colocasia, it's ginger and pepper, turmeric, heavy kind of

02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:19.920
[Guest]: food.

02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.640
[Guest]: It tastes, the flavor profile is just entirely different, right?

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:26.720
[Guest]: It's actually quite, kind of burns your throat because it's mostly ginger and pepper, right?

02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.400
[Guest]: No garlic, no onion, no, none of the, you know, new world spices, you know, chilies

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.480
[Guest]: and tomatoes and so on, right?

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:34.480
[Guest]: And no potatoes, right?

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:38.240
[Guest]: So they use a raw banana and these other native yams and starches.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.600
[Guest]: So what is fascinating is that, when I go to my wife's hometown, their houses actually

02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:46.560
[Guest]: have these big jackfruit trees and other trees.

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.300
[Guest]: So some of them actually have the pepper vines growing around those trees.

02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:50.480
[Guest]: So pepper is actually vine, right?

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.280
[Guest]: So it doesn't like, you can't just cultivate like that.

02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:55.720
[Guest]: So it literally has to grow around a tree.

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:59.680
[Guest]: And the green pepper, which comes straight out of the vine, is actually pretty sharply

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:00.680
[Guest]: hot.

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:03.840
[Guest]: I mean, it has that little bit of the heat that you would associate with the green chili,

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:04.840
[Guest]: right?

02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:05.840
[Guest]: But then you sun dry it.

02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:10.720
[Guest]: And then what you ultimately get is that shriveled black thing that has a different flavor profile.

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.720
[Guest]: It has a slightly more smokier, different flavor profile, but the fresh green pepper

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:22.480
[Guest]: is actually a way to add actual heat to food, except that it was, you know, out of, it was

02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.480
[Guest]: very expensive.

02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:26.800
[Guest]: It only grow in a specific season, not available unless you're living in that part of India

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:27.800
[Guest]: and so on.

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:32.040
[Guest]: Chilies, on the other hand, can grow anywhere in India, right?

02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:33.040
[Guest]: It's a plant from Mexico.

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:38.440
[Guest]: You, you essentially plant it and one chili plant will give one household more chilies

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.440
[Guest]: than they will eat, right?

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:44.520
[Guest]: You know, I'm growing chilies in the terrace and we don't know what to do with those chilies.

02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:48.920
[Guest]: It is just incredibly sort of productive plant as well.

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:52.480
[Guest]: So it's, it's, it's actually quite fascinating how sometimes these plants also, right, I

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.000
[Guest]: mean, having traveled all the way from here, they find this new home and they completely

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.520
[Guest]: dominate and change the cuisine over time, right?

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:03.840
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, I'm thinking of a Corona virus, like I would imagine that chilies have a very

02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:10.280
[Amit Varma]: high R as it were, let's move on to your next chapter, which is about acid and sourness

02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:11.280
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And here again, I was struck by this sort of delightful metaphor of music that you use,

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.760
[Amit Varma]: where you spoke about salt being like a volume knob and sourness being like the bass guitarist

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:26.440
[Amit Varma]: in a band that before that you have maybe salt and sweet and you have singer and your

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:30.240
[Amit Varma]: regular guitar, but it's not fun and then suddenly you have a bass guitar and the mix

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:33.400
[Amit Varma]: and the whole thing just goes wide open.

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:40.240
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about, you know, acid, about sourness, how we evolve to kind of like

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.680
[Amit Varma]: it and, you know, how we should think of acid in fact.

02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.480
[Guest]: So obviously, I think the one inspiration obviously for this particular chapter was

02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:51.600
[Guest]: Samin Nosrat's fantastic Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, which kind of explains the four key

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:56.760
[Guest]: things that you need to understand about good cooking and so on.

02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:01.640
[Guest]: Acid is, often people tend to understand salt, people tend to understand fat, people tend

02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:03.280
[Guest]: to understand heat.

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:07.800
[Guest]: Often don't think of sourness, the average person does not associate sourness with acid

02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:08.800
[Guest]: at all, right?

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:14.360
[Guest]: Because acid is always that dangerous sulphuric acid and it has that sort of image, right?

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:18.400
[Guest]: So obviously what I wanted to sort of say that actually it is one of the single most

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:23.800
[Guest]: important things in cooking simply because if your food does not have that slight amount

02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:28.640
[Guest]: of sourness, you know, in three scientific terms, if the pH is not less than seven, it's

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:31.040
[Guest]: actually going to taste bland, right?

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:35.560
[Guest]: Your grandmother knew this because she would make dal, which is notoriously bland, then

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.760
[Guest]: she would squeeze lime juice right at the end and that will just elevate the whole thing.

02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:42.920
[Guest]: You make a pulao, which is just rice, then you would squeeze lime juice at the end and

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.400
[Guest]: it just, you know, magically changes the whole thing, right?

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:52.280
[Guest]: Even when you marinate meat, for instance, the acid acts as a tenderizer, right?

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:57.120
[Guest]: So it sort of, you know, breaks the structures on the skin of the meat that makes it easier

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:00.640
[Guest]: for the flavor molecules to stick to it, right, on the surface, right?

02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:04.760
[Guest]: That's why we squeeze, that's why we use yogurt, which is an acid, right?

02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:07.760
[Guest]: And I think, you know, so part of what I wanted to do is to first and foremost kind of get

02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:10.960
[Guest]: into people's heads that look, many of the things that you commonly use, everything from

02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:16.080
[Guest]: tea to coffee to yogurt to tamarind to lime juice to vinegar, they're all acids, right?

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:20.520
[Guest]: In varying strengths, your sulfuric acid is the one, the extreme end of the spectrum,

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:21.520
[Guest]: right?

02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:27.360
[Guest]: And the reason why we have such a tremendous bias towards acids is because the base or

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:32.480
[Guest]: the alkaline side of it is associated with poisons, is associated with bitterness, right?

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:35.120
[Guest]: So sour and bitter are opposite tastes, right?

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:40.160
[Guest]: And because we have evolved taste buds to detect alkaloids, which is essentially what

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:45.360
[Guest]: bitterness is, because they're poisonous, we therefore have evolved a bias against most

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:46.800
[Guest]: alkaline food, right?

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:51.360
[Guest]: Which is why, you know, baking soda, if you overuse baking soda in something, you get

02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:56.640
[Guest]: that nasty metallic feeling because it's the kind of taste your body is not used to liking,

02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:57.640
[Guest]: right?

02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:00.680
[Guest]: Also why people have this thing against baking soda as well, right?

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.000
[Guest]: But if you use it in the right amount, it's quite useful.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.480
[Guest]: But yeah, so therefore acids essentially is about adding sourness, right?

02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:13.360
[Guest]: And sourness has a fantastic, the reason I use bass guitar as a metaphor is actually

02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.360
[Guest]: an interesting story.

02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:18.600
[Guest]: I mean, I grew up in the, in the nineties, like you did, and you know, I, as someone

02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.000
[Guest]: who sort of, I was living in North India.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.320
[Guest]: So I was listening to Anu Malik on the one hand, and I was listening to A. R. Rahman

02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:26.520
[Guest]: and L. A. Raja on the other end.

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:32.000
[Guest]: And it struck me, no one refused to frustrate me that Bollywood music in the nineties had

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.400
[Guest]: no bass guitar, right?

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:35.840
[Guest]: Or it was inaudible for most part.

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:40.240
[Guest]: If at all they were using a bass guitar, it was a synth and you couldn't really hear it.

02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:44.400
[Guest]: And music without a bass guitar is, is just, is, is missing the meat, if you will, right?

02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.720
[Guest]: It's, it's somehow you don't get those bass notes.

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.720
[Guest]: That's what really anchors you.

02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:52.080
[Guest]: Bass is what is the bridge between your melody and the percussion.

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:56.280
[Guest]: And if you don't have it, the drums sound tinny and cheap, and then your melody just

02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:57.280
[Guest]: stands out.

02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:58.280
[Guest]: You know, it doesn't really mix together.

02:22:58.280 --> 02:22:59.280
[Guest]: Right.

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:03.720
[Guest]: And given the fact that L. A. Raja was like a God of using bass and particularly bass

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:04.960
[Guest]: guitar, he would never use synth bass.

02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:07.240
[Guest]: He would almost always use a actual bass guitar.

02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:12.840
[Guest]: And again, mind you that it was at a time when cassette players and so on, um, what

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:13.960
[Guest]: tiny, right.

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:16.640
[Guest]: And to hear bass, you need large speakers, right?

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:17.640
[Guest]: It's a size thing, right?

02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:21.800
[Guest]: So you need the larger tweeter or subwoofer to be able to hear bass.

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:25.440
[Guest]: And so it was quite natural that a lot of musicians would compensate by using a higher

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:29.080
[Guest]: frequency so that you can actually at least hear it.

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.560
[Guest]: And Bollywood music directors just skipped it saying that you can't hear it anyway.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:33.560
[Guest]: I'm not going to, I'm going to skip it.

02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:38.040
[Guest]: L. A. Raja, on the other hand, would use bass tuned one octave higher so that you could

02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.040
[Guest]: still hear it.

02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:44.120
[Guest]: Um, even on your Walkman or, or a Shady transistor radio, you could still hear that thing that

02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:46.600
[Guest]: kind of connected between the melody and, and the percussion.

02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:47.600
[Guest]: Right.

02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:50.400
[Guest]: Um, and so in that sense, for me, the reason I'm particularly attached to that sort of

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.520
[Guest]: metaphor is because sourness is exactly that, right?

02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:57.640
[Guest]: Because sweetness and saltiness are very one dimensional, right?

02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:01.280
[Guest]: They, something that's just sweet is just cloyingly sweet.

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:05.660
[Guest]: Something that's just salt is, is, you know, it's a one dimensional taste, but something

02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:10.600
[Guest]: with these two and a bit of acid is just something else altogether.

02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:11.600
[Guest]: Right.

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:15.360
[Guest]: And often I think, you know, the best example I often like to give is that when it comes

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:19.640
[Guest]: to Indian cooking, we are an absolute, we understand acids better than most cuisines.

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:23.520
[Guest]: We use more variety of acids than most other cuisines, right?

02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:29.280
[Guest]: And nothing represents the pinnacle of the youth creative use of acids than chart, right?

02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:34.160
[Guest]: I mean, chart, chart, in fact, not just acids, there's the heat as well, which sort of gives

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.520
[Guest]: you the dopamine because chart is spicy for that reason.

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.160
[Guest]: Um, the crunchiness, the texture variations, right?

02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:42.320
[Guest]: So you have soft aloo and those kinds of things, and you have the crunch of the papadi and

02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.320
[Guest]: all these other things.

02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:46.760
[Guest]: So you have the textural variations and you have like four kinds of acids, right?

02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:48.520
[Guest]: The tomatoes are mildly acidic.

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.000
[Guest]: Uh, the tamarind is sort of like the base strong acid.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.320
[Guest]: Then the lime juice squeezed at the end is the top note, if you will think of it like

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.320
[Guest]: an orchestra, right?

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:59.000
[Guest]: And then the amchur is the more sophisticated acid.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.320
[Guest]: So that again, added kind of bridges everything together.

02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.460
[Guest]: So literally four kinds of acids used in a, in a single dish, right?

02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:07.160
[Guest]: So that's why chart is delicious and we're kind of addicted to it as well.

02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:08.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.760
[Amit Varma]: No, my favorite objective in the book was this objectivated compound you use for the

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.640
[Amit Varma]: flavor of chart, where you referred to as disco party in the mouth flavor, which is

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:17.640
[Amit Varma]: fabulous.

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:22.720
[Amit Varma]: And again, you, you spoke about tamarind as drummer plus bass, amchur as lead guitar,

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:26.040
[Amit Varma]: citrus, like lead vocalist, which I absolutely love.

02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:31.640
[Amit Varma]: I want you to elaborate on this very intriguing, uh, sentence, which, uh, uh, I love, but didn't

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:32.640
[Amit Varma]: fully understand.

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'd ask you to kind of explain it to me now, which is good when recipes call for tomato

02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:44.640
[Amit Varma]: puree, noobs at tomato puree, experts at tomato paste and legends at tomato ketchup, stop

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:45.880
[Guest]: good.

02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:51.160
[Guest]: So this is, you know, so this is again, stems from the fact that, um, uh, tomatoes are notoriously

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.160
[Guest]: temperamental.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.120
[Guest]: Um, I mean, they're very seasonal.

02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:56.160
[Guest]: So the flavor of the tomato varies by season.

02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:00.080
[Guest]: Um, the tastiest tomatoes come with summer, winter tomatoes are bland.

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.080
[Guest]: Okay.

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.640
[Guest]: Uh, so the, the summer tomatoes are a much sour, right?

02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:06.440
[Guest]: And again, depending on the variety.

02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:09.760
[Guest]: So there are tomatoes that are also sweet and strongly sweet.

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.360
[Guest]: What's sweet and sour is the ideal one, um, uh, and so on, right?

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:19.120
[Guest]: So therefore, if, if, if you're looking to get a certain level of sourness in your dish

02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.420
[Guest]: and you're relying on tomatoes for it, it's almost always going to be a tricky thing.

02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:26.560
[Guest]: So almost always most Indian dishes don't rely only on tomatoes, which is why they'll

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.560
[Guest]: always either add tamarind, they'll add other kinds of acids because you can't rely just

02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:32.160
[Guest]: on tomatoes for sourness.

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.160
[Guest]: Right.

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:38.560
[Guest]: Um, and so, but tomatoes on the other hand, have a ton of umami flavor, right?

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.520
[Guest]: And you get that out and tomatoes are mostly water and you're not going to get much unless

02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:47.320
[Guest]: you're able to reduce the tomatoes down to lose as much water as possible.

02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:51.160
[Guest]: So if you find some of the best cooks on YouTube and so on, right, like I give some examples

02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.640
[Guest]: like Nisha Madhulika is another one, right, so she almost always, you cook that, you cut

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:59.920
[Guest]: tomatoes and you cook it down till it loses, they'll tell you that till it loses so much

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:02.760
[Guest]: water that you can see the oil come through the sides, right?

02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.600
[Guest]: So that's usually a visual aid at understanding that you've not make, make, make it.

02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:10.400
[Guest]: So the more concentrated the tomato is, the tastier it's going to be.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.640
[Guest]: In fact, you can take it to the logical extreme.

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:16.180
[Guest]: Some of the pasta sauces in Italy are cooked for 28, 24 to 48 hours.

02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:20.520
[Guest]: You can endlessly cook tomatoes that the longer you cook, the tastier it becomes, right?

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.680
[Guest]: As long as you stop short of burning it and so on, right?

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.320
[Guest]: And so therefore, so obviously tomato puree means you are just, you know, taking the tomatoes,

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:31.320
[Guest]: putting it in a, in a mixie, making it into a liquid and then using it.

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:33.560
[Guest]: That's tomato puree, but it's going to be not really tasty.

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.940
[Guest]: You're not going to make it lose a lot of the water.

02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:38.440
[Guest]: On the other hand, tomato paste is concentrated.

02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:42.920
[Guest]: It's already lost a lot of the, it's already been dehydrated and a little bit of tomato

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.000
[Guest]: paste is the equivalent of four or five tomatoes, which otherwise is painful for you to sit

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.420
[Guest]: and cut and add, right?

02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:53.760
[Guest]: So adding tomato paste is a much, much reliable way to get the core tomato flavor.

02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.720
[Guest]: So if you're making like tomato soup, if you're trying to make this just with actual fresh

02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:59.820
[Guest]: tomatoes, you're going to get a very disappointing soup.

02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:03.320
[Guest]: So you will need a tomato paste kind of thing.

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:09.800
[Guest]: Tomato ketchup on the other hand is tomato paste plus garlic powder, onion powder, and

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:14.640
[Guest]: all those other magically addictive and vinegar, which is also acid, a stronger acid.

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.480
[Guest]: All of that put together, onion powder, garlic powder, and tomato paste, and a bunch of other

02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.080
[Guest]: spices and salt and sugar.

02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:26.720
[Guest]: And so it is really, it's designed to be addictive, which is why people like eating anything with

02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:27.720
[Guest]: the tomato ketchup, right?

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:30.840
[Guest]: It's the most popular condiment around the world, right?

02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:36.240
[Guest]: And so, and the reason I say legend is because look, if you're like me or like anyone else

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.240
[Guest]: ordering from Swiggy three or four days of the week during the pandemic, you're going

02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:43.720
[Guest]: to have a ton of sachets sitting around with every one of those orders.

02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:46.640
[Guest]: And trust me, if you're throwing them away, you're wasting some of them.

02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.880
[Guest]: It's the most fantastic condiment, any recipe that calls for tomatoes, just open up one

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:54.280
[Guest]: of those sachets and trust me, it'll just elevate your cooking.

02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I remember some very old essay by I think Malcolm Gladwell on tomato ketchup where

02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:03.480
[Amit Varma]: he spoke about how one of the reasons it's so popular is it's a combination of all the

02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:06.080
[Amit Varma]: different flavor profiles, including umami.

02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.240
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk a bit about umami.

02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:14.280
[Amit Varma]: You've already kind of mentioned that, you know, it not just accentuates the flavor of

02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:19.200
[Amit Varma]: anything else, but it lingers for a longer time and how, you know, Japanese cooking can

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.800
[Amit Varma]: be minimal with few ingredients because, you know, whatever flavor is there is given that

02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:27.000
[Amit Varma]: much more depth by umami.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of, you know, another myth which you sort of busted here, which so many

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:35.240
[Amit Varma]: people believe is that MSG is bad and all of that.

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:39.260
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, I'll quote you again, quote, there is no chemical difference between

02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:44.200
[Amit Varma]: the glutamates in cabbage, mushrooms and tomato and the half teaspoon of ajinomoto that you

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:46.720
[Amit Varma]: sprinkle on fried rice, stop quote.

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, as you said, parmesan itself has more glutamates and an equivalent amount

02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:58.160
[Amit Varma]: of ajinomoto and, you know, which among us westernized elites can resist sprinkling of

02:29:58.160 --> 02:29:59.400
[Amit Varma]: parmesan.

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:04.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about kind of umami and what's the big deal about it?

02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:07.880
[Amit Varma]: And what is still the lingering mystery around it because, you know, it's.

02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:12.000
[Guest]: So we kind of, you know, so the lingering mystery is fundamentally coming from the fact

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.920
[Guest]: that as a, as a taste bud, we've only known it for about a hundred years or so, right?

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:19.640
[Guest]: I mean, we didn't know that we had a taste bud for umami specifically.

02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:24.880
[Guest]: And the mystery is also the fact that we still don't know for absolutely sure why we have

02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:25.880
[Guest]: it, right?

02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:29.680
[Guest]: There are some very popular theories, which I'll talk about, but it's not like, it's not

02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:32.440
[Guest]: like done and dusted, you know, science, right?

02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:35.440
[Guest]: Because you know, like we explained, we, we know why we need sugar.

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:37.080
[Guest]: It's just, we need it to live, right?

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:41.800
[Guest]: We know why we need salt and we know why we need the ability to detect acids or bitterness

02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:43.120
[Guest]: and alkalis and so on.

02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:47.400
[Guest]: So, you know, we've been wondering why is there a taste bud for umami?

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.600
[Guest]: And exactly what is umami?

02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:56.280
[Guest]: It's a set of sensors, taste buds, that detect a very specific amino acid in food.

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:59.880
[Guest]: Not all amino acids, only one amino acid, which is why it's odd, right?

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:05.800
[Guest]: So one of the right now most explained, I mean, right now it's a partially accepted

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.880
[Guest]: theory is the fact that it is ultimately a taste for protein.

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:12.200
[Guest]: So you have to remember that protein is not very tasty.

02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:14.000
[Guest]: Protein is actually, it doesn't taste like sugar, right?

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
[Guest]: It doesn't taste like fat.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.600
[Guest]: It doesn't taste like sugar.

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:18.520
[Guest]: Protein is the least tasty of the foods.

02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:22.160
[Guest]: And it's possibly one of the most important because you know, all the rest of your body,

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:25.200
[Guest]: your growth and muscular growth and everything else requires proteins, right?

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:28.920
[Guest]: And your body can't synthesize all amino acids.

02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:32.400
[Guest]: Make it only synthesize some and some amino acids are essential, which means that they

02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.080
[Guest]: have to come as part of your diet, right?

02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:39.560
[Guest]: And this is also why, so, and some of these essential amino acids are available only in

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:45.520
[Guest]: animal sources, which is why even vegetarian or most people who don't eat meat still will

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:49.920
[Guest]: eat dairy and others because that's where you get the other amino acids from.

02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:55.280
[Guest]: Although technically vegan diets now, there's apparently soy does have some of these essential

02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:57.160
[Guest]: amino acids, one of the few plants that does.

02:31:57.160 --> 02:32:00.200
[Guest]: So if you make soy protein, you're mostly okay.

02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:03.080
[Guest]: But if you are vegan and do not eat soy, then I think there's a serious problem.

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:07.000
[Guest]: And again, if you're a child on a vegan diet, it's a serious problem because it's not going

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
[Guest]: to be enough.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.960
[Guest]: So anyway, so that's the nutrition which we would skip.

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:17.360
[Guest]: But essentially the prevailing theory is that because meat is raw meat, the taste of raw

02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:21.080
[Guest]: meat is, evokes disgust, right?

02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:26.000
[Guest]: So we've developed taste as we were like, you know, cavemen and so on, the ability to

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.520
[Guest]: eat raw meat, right?

02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:30.840
[Guest]: And to do that, apparently our tongue has a way of detecting this particular amino acid.

02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:34.600
[Guest]: Obviously, the gap in the story is the fact that why not other amino acids?

02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:35.600
[Guest]: Why only this?

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:39.280
[Guest]: And that too, glutamic acid as an amino acid is not an essential amino acid.

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:40.280
[Guest]: So that's also there.

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:42.160
[Guest]: So it must be said, right?

02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:48.160
[Guest]: So therefore, we seem to have this ability to detect glutamates, glutamic acid, in food,

02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:49.160
[Guest]: right?

02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:52.440
[Guest]: And at the moment we detected, it has that sort of lingering.

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:58.320
[Guest]: So the way it works is that the umami receptors amp up the salt and sweet sourness receptors,

02:32:58.320 --> 02:32:59.320
[Guest]: right?

02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:06.800
[Guest]: So a tiny amount of sourness in a umami laden broth will taste a lot more sour than a non-umami

02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:08.880
[Guest]: based one, which has a ton more acid.

02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:11.360
[Guest]: So this is where you can get away with adding less.

02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:12.360
[Guest]: So this is that.

02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:16.760
[Guest]: So second is the fact that your body, because we are made up of the same set of amino acids,

02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:19.400
[Guest]: I think I don't know the number, I think 14 or something.

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:24.360
[Guest]: So we have about two kgs of glutamates in our body, our muscles and our body.

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:29.800
[Guest]: If you take, you know, if you take a 70 kg person, two kgs of glutamates are there.

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:34.120
[Guest]: So that one quarter teaspoon of MSG is not going to kill you, because it's just simple

02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:35.120
[Guest]: statistics.

02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:36.120
[Guest]: Okay.

02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:40.880
[Guest]: And the fact that natural umami is really no different from the synthetic one.

02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:45.760
[Guest]: That said, there are a tiny proportion of people who are allergic to synthetic ajinomoto,

02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:47.920
[Guest]: a tiny, tiny number.

02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:52.320
[Guest]: But that's much, much tinier than people who are actually say gluten allergic or have celiac

02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:53.320
[Guest]: disease and so on.

02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:55.480
[Guest]: So, so therefore, that's the thing about umami.

02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:59.080
[Guest]: And as I said, I think Indian cuisine is not focused as much on it.

02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:05.440
[Guest]: But again, even there, there is an urban bias and I kind of point this out in the book.

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:10.480
[Guest]: A lot of coastal, poorer fisher folk, etc, a lot of their cuisine is pretty umami heavy.

02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:11.480
[Guest]: Right?

02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.600
[Guest]: Because the tinier the fish, the more umami heavy it is going to be.

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.600
[Guest]: Right?

02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:21.960
[Guest]: So they eat the bigger, less tasty fish, but they eat the tiny dried fish and so on.

02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:27.280
[Guest]: Second thing that adds umami to food is fermentation.

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:33.200
[Guest]: And the northeast of India has a lot, a bigger fermentation tradition of using actually fermented

02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:36.360
[Guest]: foods than the rest of India.

02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:37.360
[Guest]: Right?

02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:43.480
[Guest]: I think at some point of time, certain kinds of fermentation began to be considered unacceptable

02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:47.400
[Guest]: from a caste system purity standpoint, because obviously, because, you know, production of

02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:48.400
[Guest]: alcohol is also fermentation.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.400
[Guest]: So on.

02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.840
[Guest]: So there is that, you know, which is why most of India does not have a vinegar tradition

02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:54.960
[Guest]: because we don't like alcohol.

02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.720
[Guest]: So we will ban all of those kinds of things.

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.320
[Guest]: And you can't have vinegar without an alcohol, you know, being produced first.

02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:02.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:04.680
[Guest]: So vinegar is literally just sour wine, right?

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:09.880
[Guest]: But you do in Goa and you do in the coast of India where there is amongst non-Hindu

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:11.400
[Guest]: populations amongst Christians and others.

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.800
[Guest]: So vinegar is a very big thing in Goa.

02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:18.600
[Guest]: Also coconut vinegar, also in coastal Karnataka and Kerala as well.

02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:19.600
[Guest]: So that's essentially umami.

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:20.600
[Guest]: They've always done it.

02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.320
[Guest]: So mutton and onions is another fantastic pairing.

02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.160
[Guest]: Tomatoes in anything is concentrated.

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:28.920
[Guest]: Tomato is very, very high on umami.

02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.240
[Guest]: Any kind of concentrated base gravy that has tomato is going to be very umami and so on.

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:35.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm kind of reminded of this old cartoon.

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:39.280
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know if it was a cartoon or an anecdote or whatever, but it basically features

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:45.560
[Amit Varma]: this aristocratic English lady telling her companion and talking about, you know, the

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.120
[Amit Varma]: domestic health and saying, do these people also have sex?

02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:51.200
[Amit Varma]: It is entirely too good for them.

02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in an Indian context, it would seem that the lower you go down the class

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:58.280
[Amit Varma]: or the caste chain, you're actually getting more umami.

02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, they're actually better off in that sense.

02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's also fascinating that we are 2kg glutamates.

02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:06.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, after reading your book, it seems to me that human beings are basically

02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:07.880
[Amit Varma]: water plus MSG.

02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:16.840
[Guest]: So we're mostly water, but you know, so the other, you know, since you brought up that

02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.080
[Guest]: aristocratic lady, right?

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:22.960
[Guest]: So there's actually a, even in England, right, or even in Europe, right?

02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:26.960
[Guest]: If you, if you think about this modern day phenomenon of sourdough baking and that kind

02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:32.600
[Guest]: of crusty artisanal brown whole wheat kind of breads, which are now what hipsters eat

02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:33.600
[Guest]: now, right?

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:37.320
[Guest]: You know, three, 400 years ago, that was considered to be peasant food.

02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:41.640
[Guest]: That bleached white, perfect sandwich loaf was what the rich people ate.

02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:44.480
[Guest]: And you know, obviously it's the same thing, right?

02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:48.640
[Guest]: They've realized that that's actually that crusty artisanal long fermented natural sourdough

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:54.200
[Guest]: bread is tastier than that fast fermented bleached white flour bread is a realization

02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:56.440
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, we've, we've come too much later.

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Mind blowing.

02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:01.840
[Amit Varma]: And, and another sort of, uh, another great villain of, uh, you know, in Indian culture,

02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.000
[Amit Varma]: which should not be a villain, uh, at all is a baking soda, as you point out.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And this is a misconception that I held as well.

02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.200
[Amit Varma]: I always knew MSG was perfectly fine, but I always thought that, Hey, you know, restaurants

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.200
[Amit Varma]: mess up our food.

02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.240
[Amit Varma]: They put too much baking soda and blah, blah, blah.

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:18.240
[Amit Varma]: They're taking shortcuts.

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But, uh, you know, after reading your book, I have looked at baking soda with new eyes.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.400
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about, you know, why that misconception exists and why it is actually

02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.840
[Amit Varma]: such an incredibly useful ingredient.

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:35.560
[Guest]: See, I think there's a, there's a certain, uh, the bias against baking soda is no different

02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:41.600
[Guest]: from the wider, slightly more fallacious, uh, bias in Indian culture in general against

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.080
[Guest]: anything chemical, which is a very odd thing.

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:45.080
[Guest]: Right?

02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:49.080
[Guest]: So, so apparently sodium chloride is not chemical, but sodium bicarbonate is chemical, right?

02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:52.280
[Guest]: But, uh, but then, you know, so, so the whole, so there is that, right?

02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:53.280
[Guest]: Because obviously it is.

02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:57.120
[Guest]: Uh, and the other thing is that, you know, you can collect salt by, you can make salt

02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:02.360
[Guest]: by evaporating seawater and you get a sense that it's, it's natural, although salt is

02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.440
[Guest]: the only thing that is not of organic origin that we eat.

02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.200
[Guest]: It is literally the only thing of non-organic origin that we eat.

02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:11.200
[Guest]: Okay.

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:12.320
[Guest]: Um, so because it comes from the oceans and so on.

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.440
[Guest]: So the other thing is baking soda, so there is that larger chemical thing.

02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:21.920
[Guest]: The second thing is that, uh, obviously, you know, as a historically predominantly poor

02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.760
[Guest]: country and so on, you know, your, uh, your low end restaurants, your, your low end food

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:27.760
[Guest]: outlets and so on.

02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:31.440
[Guest]: I mean, they, they need to find ways to save on fuel.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:32.440
[Guest]: There's just no getting around.

02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:33.440
[Guest]: Right.

02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:36.880
[Guest]: Um, and by the way, you know, we know how those guys operate, you know, they figured

02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.720
[Guest]: out some guys, they get a domestic cylinder and that's how all the, all the cooking happens.

02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:44.560
[Guest]: So none of those guys are paying like commercial cylinder rates and so on.

02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.760
[Guest]: It's somebody's a cylinder that they're using and so on.

02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.640
[Guest]: So the Jugaad is there everywhere in that industry.

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:52.920
[Guest]: And so it is not surprising, therefore, that they would have figured out that using baking

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.760
[Guest]: soda is a fantastic way to reduce fuel costs because baking soda will reduce the amount

02:38:57.760 --> 02:38:59.960
[Guest]: of time that it takes dal to cook.

02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:00.960
[Guest]: Right.

02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:05.600
[Guest]: Especially legumes, uh, grains to an extent, but legumes definitely, right.

02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:09.500
[Guest]: If you are cooking China, a pot of China, right.

02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:13.200
[Guest]: Using a pinch of baking soda will cut the cooking time by 50%.

02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:14.800
[Guest]: That is a lot of money over time.

02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:15.800
[Guest]: Right.

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.520
[Guest]: And obviously, I mean, the only thing is that over time, we've also figured out that you

02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.800
[Guest]: can balance that out by adding tea, right.

02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:24.640
[Guest]: I didn't tea bags, which is why when you make China masala, you add both little bit of baking

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:26.680
[Guest]: soda and you add tea.

02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:29.800
[Guest]: People only remember the fact that I'm adding tea because it gives the brown color.

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:30.800
[Guest]: That's not what it is for.

02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:31.800
[Guest]: Tea is an acid.

02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:32.800
[Guest]: Right.

02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:37.880
[Guest]: And more importantly, it's an acid that only becomes acidic at high temperatures.

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:38.880
[Guest]: Right.

02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:41.080
[Guest]: So, which is why just the tea bag is not acidic.

02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.000
[Guest]: Only once the temperature goes above a certain level is when, you know, tea becomes acidic

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.640
[Guest]: and so on.

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:47.640
[Guest]: Right.

02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:51.240
[Guest]: So the reason it exists is because in the early part of the cooking process, you want

02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.480
[Guest]: the baking soda to break all of the walls of the China so that it actually cooks it

02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:59.160
[Guest]: faster because baking soda breaks down pectin, which is, which is part of the cell walls

02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:02.440
[Guest]: of all plants.

02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:07.040
[Guest]: And what happens is that then the tea kicks in and neutralizes any leftover baking soda

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:12.400
[Guest]: because acids and bases react and you get, you know, carbon dioxide and water.

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:18.520
[Guest]: So therefore, that's why we use this and restaurants will use it pretty liberally in most things

02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:22.480
[Guest]: that they're cooking because it's also common that they don't quite know all of these reactions.

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:25.840
[Guest]: So there's a good chance that they're probably using it when cooking rice, when cooking literally

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.640
[Guest]: anything because they think that if it works for China, it'll work for anything.

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:30.400
[Guest]: They'll add it when cooking meat, they'll add it.

02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.400
[Guest]: So it's, it's also that, right?

02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:34.720
[Guest]: So it's not that because they, it's not like, you know, they have a craft and they have

02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:37.560
[Guest]: documentation, they have knowledge and they've been trained, right?

02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:39.880
[Guest]: It's quite common for people to kind of try these things everywhere.

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:41.400
[Guest]: If it works here, it works everywhere.

02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:42.400
[Guest]: Right?

02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.480
[Guest]: So unless you know how it actually works, right?

02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:49.160
[Guest]: And so, which is why a lot of low-end restaurants, food ends up being slightly heavy on baking

02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:50.440
[Guest]: soda.

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:54.760
[Guest]: And therefore it has that bad rap of, oh, and then people come up with all kinds of

02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:59.760
[Guest]: fancy theories saying that no, no, they add baking soda to make you eat less at buffets,

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:02.320
[Guest]: which is a strange theory.

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:03.320
[Guest]: That's not why he would do that.

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:04.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.040
[Guest]: So if he's, somebody is adding something to food to physically make it taste metallic

02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:08.040
[Guest]: and so on.

02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:09.040
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:10.040
[Guest]: That makes no sense.

02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:13.360
[Guest]: But if he's using it to save on fuel, that makes better sense.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:14.360
[Guest]: So in a sense, that is really it.

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:15.360
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.040
[Guest]: I mean, and then the fact that it is a fantastic, it's also a great tenderizer of beet.

02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.280
[Guest]: In fact, your Chinese style of marinating meat, like if you go to a Chinese restaurant,

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:27.360
[Guest]: you get that glazed kind of feel.

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:28.360
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:33.600
[Guest]: So you get that silky finish to meat and it's incredibly succulent inside.

02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:37.720
[Guest]: It's because they use baking soda in the marinade, a tiny bit.

02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:39.040
[Guest]: And that's why you kind of get that effect.

02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:40.040
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.640
[Guest]: So in fact, Indian marination uses acid, Chinese marination uses base.

02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.640
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:44.640
[Guest]: So it's quite fascinating.

02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:45.640
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:47.880
[Guest]: And once you're done cooking, by the way, it can also help you clean.

02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:48.880
[Guest]: It's a fantastic deodorizer.

02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:49.880
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.320
[Guest]: So if you put a small plate of baking soda in your fridge, it'll absorb all the other

02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:55.320
[Guest]: odors.

02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:59.160
[Guest]: Especially if you have like fish, et cetera, in the fridge and you don't want everything

02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:02.240
[Guest]: to smell of fish, you know, is one way of doing this.

02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.240
[Guest]: Right?

02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:05.120
[Guest]: And it also accelerates the Maillard reaction.

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:09.360
[Guest]: So if you want a brown onions and you're too lazy and you don't want to spend 20 minutes,

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:14.160
[Guest]: a pinch of baking soda will get your onions evenly brown in no time.

02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:15.160
[Amit Varma]: So yeah.

02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:18.400
[Amit Varma]: So do you use more baking soda and MSG in your own cooking?

02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And would you advise that Indians in general warm to MSG because that'll actually, you

02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.200
[Amit Varma]: know, you spoke earlier about the wastage of spices and all of that, and, you know,

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.320
[Amit Varma]: using MSG would certainly cause it to, right, let's kind of move on to the other sort of

02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:38.720
[Amit Varma]: ingredient which should be used more in Indian cooking, but isn't, which is alcohol.

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And again, I love the starting quote, you know, which begins the chapter, which is from

02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Julia Child, where she says, quote, I enjoy cooking with wine.

02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes I even put it in the food I'm cooking, stop quote.

02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:55.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about alcohol and why you call it the silver medal winner in

02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:57.720
[Amit Varma]: the hundred meter flavor extraction race.

02:42:57.720 --> 02:42:58.720
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.240
[Guest]: So fat is the absolute winner in what is able to do.

02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:06.200
[Guest]: Hot fat, right, is able to extract as much flavor, but clearly alcohol is the second,

02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:07.200
[Guest]: right?

02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:11.560
[Guest]: And then with the added advantage that in the cooking process, a lot of the alcohol

02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:12.880
[Guest]: actually burns off.

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.840
[Guest]: So it's not like you're going to get like drunk by adding a tiny amount of rum or brandy

02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.840
[Guest]: and so on.

02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:25.600
[Guest]: And also remember that, you know, beer is not alcoholic enough for it to be used as

02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:31.640
[Guest]: an alcohol for its purposes, but beer is used as an acid because beer is acidic, right?

02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:33.960
[Guest]: Because it has, it's carbonated.

02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:38.720
[Guest]: So beer battered, whatever, or, you know, beer is used as a, as, as like a lemon juice

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:41.320
[Guest]: or something like that, but to add an acidic flavor profile, right?

02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:45.520
[Guest]: And a complex, you know, all the complex, slightly bitter flavors of the hop also add

02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:46.800
[Guest]: to that.

02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:52.200
[Guest]: So you have, uh, alcohol again, you know, uh, not very common in India because of the

02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:55.800
[Guest]: historical taboos against alcohol and brewing.

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:01.460
[Guest]: And the fact that the British largely got rid of a ton of, uh, local low cost brewing

02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:05.800
[Guest]: cultures, you know, in collaboration with, with upcast Hindus, as they kind of elevated

02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:10.160
[Guest]: them to positions of power, made them officers and, uh, you know, in the, in the original

02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:13.560
[Guest]: civil servant, uh, and, and sort of British administration, right?

02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:16.760
[Guest]: Uh, so there's a ton of, you know, if you look at, if you read, and I was reading some

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:22.080
[Guest]: of these older Tamil novels set in the pre-British era or during the British era, Perumal Murugan

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:26.880
[Guest]: actually talks about how the, the British guy and the Brahmins, if you will, were coming

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.880
[Guest]: after their brewing of Kaldur, right?

02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:31.480
[Guest]: I mean, uh, so this is, this is something that he kind of mentioned.

02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:36.040
[Guest]: So there's always been, uh, so if you have human beings, microbes and starches, you're

02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:37.040
[Guest]: going to get alcohol.

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:38.040
[Guest]: Okay.

02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:39.040
[Guest]: It's just, there's no escaping it.

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:40.040
[Guest]: Right.

02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:44.360
[Guest]: So, um, and especially in a hot and humid part of this world where microbes work like

02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:47.760
[Guest]: they're on steroids, you're going to get alcohol all the time, right?

02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:50.320
[Guest]: So in the sense that it's, it's quite surprising, but I think, hopefully I think we'll kind

02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.440
[Guest]: of start learning about this, um, and as at least amongst urban Indians, and if you don't

02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.200
[Guest]: have like any religious strictures against the use of alcohol, I think definitely use

02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:03.000
[Guest]: of some of the cheap wine that you get in my local Tasmac store, I think it's good only

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
[Guest]: for cooking.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.160
[Guest]: I wouldn't drink it at all.

02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:07.160
[Guest]: So, uh, so that's the good thing.

02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:10.320
[Guest]: I mean, you use, use up cheap wine for cooking and it adds a ton of taste.

02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:11.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:16.160
[Guest]: So again, fermentation is one of those magical biochemical processes that take something

02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:21.160
[Guest]: one dimensional and adds a ton of additional dimensions of flavor, right?

02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:26.280
[Guest]: Fermented grape, uh, it loses sweetness, but it gains a ton of other flavor profiles simply

02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.680
[Guest]: by the action of yeast.

02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:28.680
[Guest]: Right?

02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:33.320
[Guest]: So, so you take something like, imagine something like your flour or maida, which is tasteless

02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:35.960
[Guest]: odorless powder, right?

02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.160
[Guest]: You add water and you just let it sit.

02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:41.640
[Guest]: You don't even need to add yeast because there's yeast already, you know, in the, in, in, in

02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:42.640
[Guest]: the maida already.

02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:43.640
[Guest]: Right?

02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:44.640
[Guest]: It will smell delicious.

02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:45.640
[Guest]: It will smell alcoholic.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.640
[Guest]: It'll smell boozy.

02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:47.640
[Guest]: It'll smell nutty.

02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:52.640
[Guest]: It'll, you know, so the smell of fermented dough, uh, and then once you bake it, the

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:55.960
[Guest]: Bayard reaction just makes it all the more magic, which is why bread is so magical, right?

02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:57.480
[Guest]: So you just take four things.

02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:02.120
[Guest]: You take a floor, uh, water, salt, and yeast.

02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:03.120
[Guest]: That's it.

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:08.320
[Guest]: And you can turn it into this universe of the most astonishing flavors by just applying

02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:09.320
[Guest]: heat.

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:10.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.520
[Guest]: And so that way, um, so alcohol is a part of the production of any kind of fermentation

02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:15.520
[Guest]: process, right?

02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:21.960
[Guest]: Uh, at least yeast that's, uh, aerobic fermentation produces alcohol and aerobic fermentation

02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:29.400
[Guest]: sort of produces, uh, you have, uh, uh, lactobacteria like your idli dosa and all of those are lactobacteria

02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:30.400
[Guest]: yogurt.

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:31.600
[Guest]: So yeast is not involved.

02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:32.600
[Guest]: It's usually bacteria.

02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:35.000
[Guest]: Bacteria produce lactic acid, which is sour, right?

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.200
[Guest]: So the fermentation that produces sourness yeast fermentation produces alcohol.

02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:42.160
[Guest]: So that's the, that's the basic principle here, right?

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:48.600
[Guest]: And alcohol is a fantastic additive, especially grapes, especially even hard liquor is a fantastic

02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:53.600
[Guest]: brandy, cognac, and these things actually are fantastic for deglazing the pan.

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.640
[Guest]: So especially if you're like, you know, using a, not a nonstick, but a stainless steel,

02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:58.680
[Guest]: a lot of things will stick to the bottom.

02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:01.480
[Guest]: Those things that stick to the bottom of the vessel are tremendously tasty because they

02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:04.760
[Guest]: have all those Mayard, you know, byproducts, right?

02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:09.240
[Guest]: So once you're done with your fat and onions, kind of getting there, adding a little bit

02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:15.200
[Guest]: of this sort of brandy or something else will unlock a lot more flavor and also remove all

02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:19.560
[Guest]: the sticky bits from the bottom and get it into the gravy that an overtime, most of the

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:23.760
[Guest]: alcohol will also sort of, uh, uh, burn away and it release a lot of those other aroma

02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.240
[Guest]: molecules that then get end up getting, you know, dissolved in the, uh, in the fat.

02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:31.440
[Guest]: And so, so alcohol is a, is, is definitely a fantastic, you know, even if you don't

02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:32.440
[Guest]: drink it yourself.

02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:37.280
[Guest]: Um, I think it's worthwhile keeping a bottle or two in the kitchen, um, as, as a cooking

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:38.280
[Amit Varma]: aid.

02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:43.160
[Amit Varma]: My favorite cooking video of all time on YouTube, and it may not be because of the, uh, this

02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:48.120
[Amit Varma]: thing is this famous vareva video called, uh, of toddy chicken, where the chef is making

02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.520
[Amit Varma]: a toddy chicken and, uh, you know, every once in a while when he has to have toddy, he'll

02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:55.640
[Amit Varma]: say one sip for me, one sip for the chicken.

02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:00.640
[Amit Varma]: And just, it's a fantastic, legendary, legendary, absolutely legendary video.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:08.120
[Guest]: Cooking with toddy is a, is, is a traditional thing, uh, definitely smaller town, uh, definitely

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:12.160
[Guest]: more common amongst the lower down and the, the cost hierarchy you go, uh, definitely.

02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:17.040
[Guest]: But because toddy is up, you know, uh, uh, so for example, you know, uh, uh, mallus when

02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:19.200
[Guest]: they make appam, right?

02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:23.600
[Guest]: The traditional way of fermenting an appam was to actually add toddy, right?

02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:26.680
[Guest]: Because a toddy is basically is a life thing.

02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:28.200
[Guest]: It's because it's got that culture, right?

02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:32.040
[Guest]: So it's got the yeast culture that is going to then ferment the rest of your, these things

02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:33.040
[Guest]: as well, right?

02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:36.000
[Guest]: Uh, this is before we are baking soda was invented, right?

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:41.200
[Guest]: So then obviously nowadays, uh, people just add baking soda to the, to just before they

02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:42.200
[Guest]: bake it.

02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.880
[Guest]: So you get that soft, fluffy in the center.

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.920
[Amit Varma]: Historically, it used to be done with toddy.

02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Can you speak about a couple of counterintuitive ways in which you, you use alcohol and you

02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:53.680
[Amit Varma]: know, most people wouldn't have thought of alcohol in that context.

02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.560
[Amit Varma]: Like you spoke in your book, of course, of game-changing pakoras and, uh, you know, what's

02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:02.600
[Amit Varma]: the last time you used alcohol in your cooking and, uh, you know, if you had to give a couple

02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.840
[Amit Varma]: of tips to our listeners, if they are cooking on, you know, when they can use alcohol while

02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:07.840
[Amit Varma]: cooking Indian food.

02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:13.080
[Guest]: So the last time I actually, so I think some people did get a bit angry that I used, uh,

02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:14.760
[Guest]: some rum when I was making dal makhani.

02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:19.360
[Guest]: Uh, and again, dal makhani is one of those dishes where you actually don't want to add

02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:22.780
[Guest]: a ton of spice powders and things like that because it's the intrinsic flavor of that

02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:26.320
[Guest]: actually comes from slow cooking the urad dal, which is an absolute, you know, rockstar

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.320
[Guest]: legume in that it is the greatest legume.

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:30.320
[Guest]: You give it enough time.

02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:31.320
[Guest]: It is painfully hard to cook.

02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:34.860
[Guest]: You have to soak it for hours and hours and cook it for several hours and so on.

02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:38.640
[Guest]: But the longer you cook, the more amazing the texture and the flavor gets.

02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:41.640
[Guest]: And a lot of this, you know, people don't realize that the makhani part of the dal makhani

02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:44.660
[Guest]: doesn't come from actually adding makhani, which is very little.

02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:49.040
[Guest]: It comes from the fact that the dal itself has a silky buttery texture, uh, the longer

02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:50.040
[Guest]: you cook it.

02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:51.040
[Guest]: Right.

02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:54.080
[Guest]: So it's not something like that it's, you don't need a ton of jeera powder, that powder,

02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:56.280
[Guest]: this powder, and all these other spices and so on.

02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:01.120
[Guest]: You want it to be minimal, just the sort of onion, ginger, garlic, the primary base sort

02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.960
[Guest]: of flavors that you're likely to find in a Punjabi field.

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.300
[Guest]: And then you're going to, what I essentially do is add a little bit of that rum to deglaze

02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:14.480
[Guest]: the pan before I add the tomatoes so that it really just amplifies the garlic and onion

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:16.920
[Guest]: flavors in the dish, which is exactly what you want.

02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:17.920
[Guest]: So that is definitely one.

02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.600
[Guest]: And I think the, the pakoda trick is actually something that I learned from this British

02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:25.800
[Guest]: molecular gastronomy guy, Heston Blumenthal, right?

02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:29.960
[Guest]: So basically this idea that one of the things alcohol does, right?

02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:34.920
[Guest]: And one of the reasons why it's therefore used when you bake cakes, um, rum and things

02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:35.920
[Guest]: like that, right?

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:38.600
[Guest]: Is that alcohol actually prevents gluten formation.

02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.720
[Guest]: So gluten is essentially when you, when you add water to any kind of wheat flour, the

02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.840
[Guest]: gluten and gliadin proteins kind of, you know, form this sort of structure, stretchy structure

02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:51.880
[Guest]: which therefore allows, if you had any leavening agent, it allows it to rise, which you can't

02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:54.720
[Guest]: get in a rice or anything, right?

02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:59.520
[Guest]: And so the thing is that you, in a bread or a chapati, you want that, but you don't want

02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:04.200
[Guest]: stretchy gluten kind of a texture when you're making cakes or when you're making like a

02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:05.200
[Guest]: pakoda.

02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:08.960
[Guest]: Especially if you're using maida as the, like a tempura state, right?

02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:12.080
[Guest]: Not because some people not don't necessarily like using basin.

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:16.040
[Guest]: They also use a mix of basin and maida to get better crispiness, right?

02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:23.000
[Guest]: So if you add a mix of maida and basin, and instead of using just water to make the batter,

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:27.760
[Guest]: add a little bit of vodka, the vodka will prevent the maida from forming a stretchy

02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:28.760
[Guest]: this thing.

02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:29.760
[Guest]: So you get an ultra crisp.

02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:30.760
[Guest]: This thing.

02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:35.760
[Guest]: The other thing, the trick here is to, instead of using water, if you use soda, right, that

02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:40.480
[Guest]: will aerate the batter so that the exterior of the pakoda will be the most astonishingly

02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:41.480
[Guest]: crisp, right?

02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:44.480
[Guest]: So I mean, this is something that I've tried and it is like, Oh wow.

02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:49.240
[Guest]: I mean, especially I've made a Mirchi Bhaji and it is just, this is amazing, right?

02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:52.800
[Guest]: One the crispness outside, and then you bite into the chili and the chili is really hot

02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:56.160
[Guest]: and then you get the dopamine high and it's quite a perfect experience.

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.000
[Amit Varma]: So see dear listeners, if you've reached the three hour mark of the show, your big revelation

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.960
[Amit Varma]: is that the recipe for great pakodas includes vodka and soda.

02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:05.960
[Amit Varma]: That's quite superb.

02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:09.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, I've taken a lot of your time, so I'm going to get to closing questions now.

02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:14.040
[Amit Varma]: But in between, I'm going to say that we haven't finished all the chapters of your book yet.

02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:19.600
[Amit Varma]: I particularly enjoyed this penultimate chapter called Burn the Recipe, where you kind of

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.560
[Amit Varma]: talk about models and meta models.

02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you give sort of different algorithms, gravy algorithm, rice dish algorithm, Indian

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.520
[Amit Varma]: bread algorithm, chutney and raita generators, salad generator, talk about base gravy, spice

02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:37.800
[Amit Varma]: mixes, absolutely eye opening and I'm really going to take my time and, you know, process

02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:43.360
[Amit Varma]: it over a period of time and not try to do it at 2x or 3x speed.

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:50.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'll kind of get to sort of my closing questions that I had for you.

02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And while writing this book, what did you learn?

02:52:52.880 --> 02:52:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Like I understand that a lot of this is your accumulated knowledge over the years, and

02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:59.120
[Amit Varma]: you actually had a structure in Scrivener.

02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've mentioned in another interview where you had your chapter and headings

02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:06.040
[Amit Varma]: and then your subheadings and all of that.

02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:07.160
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of it was there.

02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:11.440
[Amit Varma]: But I've often found that when you try to write about something in detail, you end up

02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:14.680
[Amit Varma]: learning a lot more about it and sometimes surprising yourself.

02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:19.280
[Amit Varma]: So what are your sort of learning moments from this book?

02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:24.840
[Guest]: So one is clearly the more I research to write this book, the more I realized that there

02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:30.400
[Guest]: are fewer strict and rigid rules about how to make delicious food, that you can get to

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:36.280
[Guest]: a great product in a bunch of ways, and in a sense that minimalism is a great way to

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:37.280
[Guest]: get to the same thing, right?

02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:42.080
[Guest]: I think we tend to overdo recipes with too many ingredients.

02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:46.240
[Guest]: Sometimes realizing that the quarter teaspoon of jeera powder that they ask you to add actually

02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:47.240
[Guest]: makes no difference.

02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:50.280
[Guest]: If you have 15 other spices, you're not going to taste it, right?

02:53:50.280 --> 02:53:53.900
[Guest]: Sometimes people don't realize that sometimes, you know, store-bought garam masala already

02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:56.740
[Guest]: has dhania and jeera powder in it.

02:53:56.740 --> 02:53:59.280
[Guest]: So you're not adding anything by adding that as well.

02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:02.760
[Guest]: But recipes will say add garam masala, add jeera powder, add dhania powder, like it is

02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:04.120
[Guest]: some kind of, you know.

02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:06.120
[Guest]: So definitely that was definitely one learning.

02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:12.200
[Guest]: I think the second thing I kind of learned is that clearly, I think, I taught myself

02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:15.920
[Guest]: to, in a sense, I mean, I had this habit, but I mean, obviously, definitely sort of

02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:21.080
[Guest]: improved during the course of this, is that reading academic papers in food science is

02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:25.960
[Guest]: often a great way to discover food science tricks that you could apply at home.

02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:31.000
[Guest]: And as I said, people the likes of Kenji Lopez-Alt and others have essentially done that for Western

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:32.000
[Guest]: cooking, right?

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:33.680
[Guest]: Give me an example.

02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:38.400
[Guest]: So for instance, so there was actually this paper from, I think, Indian Institute of Science,

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.840
[Guest]: I think it was in the 1980s, right?

02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:46.640
[Guest]: On the some 20 page white paper on idli batter fermentation, right down to what is the impact

02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:52.360
[Guest]: of the variety of rice, the amount of amylose and amylopectin in the variety of rice, the

02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:56.960
[Guest]: kinds of microbes involved, the common family of lactobacteria, staphylococcus, and yeast

02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:02.440
[Guest]: involved in fermentation, and so on, and the impact of temperature, salt concentration,

02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.920
[Guest]: the impact of whether you use a 2 is to 1 ratio, 3 is to 1 ratio, 4 is to 1 ratio, and

02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:10.720
[Guest]: the variations in texture, final properties of idli, and so on.

02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:16.000
[Guest]: I'm like, wow, I mean, I was not able to accurately get my mother to accurately describe how is

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.080
[Guest]: it that you can reliably ferment idli dough and get soft idli.

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:21.280
[Guest]: It's very hard to do, right?

02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:23.200
[Guest]: Because fermentation is a wild thing.

02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:27.600
[Guest]: I mean, you can only use your natural cues, you can kind of get a sense when something

02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:30.320
[Guest]: is over fermented, under fermented, and so on.

02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:35.560
[Guest]: And then once in a while, your idli is going to end up slightly hard or over sour and so

02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:36.560
[Guest]: on.

02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:37.560
[Guest]: It's just the way fermentation is like that, right?

02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:44.280
[Guest]: And I'm like, wow, this is one of those things where I could genuinely get the right down.

02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:49.560
[Guest]: So one example is that, right, the reason you add salt when you ferment something, right,

02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:51.040
[Guest]: is quite fascinating.

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:55.200
[Guest]: Salt normally kills bacteria and yeast and so on.

02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:02.680
[Guest]: But the magic of evolution, lactobacteria have evolved the ability to live in slightly

02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:04.760
[Guest]: salty conditions, right?

02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:10.380
[Guest]: And the reason they do that is that, and by adding that salt, you are preventing the millions

02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:13.680
[Guest]: of other families of bacteria and fungi that want to colonize the same food.

02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.320
[Guest]: It's free food, right?

02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:17.980
[Guest]: And so that's where you are basically helping it along.

02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:21.080
[Guest]: So it multiplies, it is able to dominate.

02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.960
[Guest]: And once it reaches a certain, you know, enough amount of a population, then lactobacteria

02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:27.280
[Guest]: is another trick up its sleeve.

02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:29.480
[Guest]: It produces lactic acid.

02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:34.560
[Guest]: And that acidic environment again, closes the door for a ton of other things that again

02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:35.560
[Guest]: will spoil your...

02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:37.040
[Guest]: So at the end of the day, you're leaving food outside.

02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:38.040
[Guest]: That's what it is, right?

02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:40.840
[Guest]: And there are literally millions of microbes out there, right?

02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:45.120
[Guest]: And so therefore, it is just that understanding this and why you add salt and therefore when

02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:48.920
[Guest]: you should add salt, et cetera, et cetera, is I think one of those things.

02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:51.920
[Guest]: So therefore, I think I learned a lot from reading actual academic papers.

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:53.200
[Guest]: They're very hard to read.

02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:58.160
[Guest]: They're obviously aimed at a food scientist working for a consumer food company.

02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:02.400
[Guest]: Somebody wearing lab coats and, you know, making chips or producing, you know, freeze-dried

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.880
[Guest]: idli or freeze-dried dal makhani and so on.

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:08.160
[Guest]: But clearly, but I think there's tons to be learned from actually going right down to

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:10.720
[Guest]: the scientific publications is definitely one.

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:19.240
[Guest]: And I think the third realization was that Indian cooking can actually be phenomenally

02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:26.700
[Guest]: a lot more diverse if people actually stop being tethered by recipes, right?

02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:29.120
[Guest]: And this whole notion of authenticity, right?

02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:33.720
[Guest]: I used to feel strongly about it, but I began to feel even more strongly about it, right?

02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:36.840
[Guest]: I think the fact that there's a Szechuan dosa is, I think, glorious.

02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:39.760
[Guest]: It's not a matter for, oh, no, kill me now, you know, why?

02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.200
[Guest]: I mean, somebody enjoys that, and it's a fantastic fusion of cuisines.

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:49.120
[Guest]: And literally anything you eat today was also considered fusion cuisine when one of those

02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:54.280
[Guest]: ingredients came from Mexico or came from somewhere else, right, or a technique that

02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:55.280
[Guest]: you borrowed from somewhere else, right?

02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:00.680
[Guest]: I mean, I take the example of how my grandmother would make sambar when she was in a village.

02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:05.040
[Guest]: You know, things like carrots and beans were called English vegetables because, you know,

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:08.320
[Guest]: they were not available in India, and they used to grow only in the colder climates of

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:09.320
[Guest]: Ooty and so on, right?

02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:12.960
[Guest]: So if you're in the hotter parts, you're going to use the native, local string beans and

02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:14.560
[Guest]: those kinds of things.

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:18.000
[Guest]: But the moment she got to Chennai, she would use carrot and sambar, and, you know, who's

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.800
[Guest]: to say that's not an authentic sambar because it doesn't have carrot?

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:23.600
[Guest]: Literally any sambar in Chennai will now have carrot, right?

02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:28.720
[Guest]: So I think in that sense, the whole, in some sense, the chapter seven, if you will, right,

02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:34.000
[Guest]: is fundamentally saying that, look, you know what, I think, given the amount of variety

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.200
[Guest]: we already have, I think there's an opportunity to do even more, right?

02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:43.120
[Guest]: There's no reason why you can't make a Thai spiced chutney for your idli, right?

02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:45.200
[Guest]: Why would you not do that, right?

02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:49.360
[Guest]: Or a Bengali flavored chutney for your dosa, right?

02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:53.800
[Guest]: Or eat your dosa with a kosha mangso or something like that, which is fantastic.

02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:57.240
[Guest]: You go to rural Tabernado, I mean, dosa is always eaten with meat gravies.

02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:03.160
[Guest]: It's a perfect canvas, if you will, for really well-spiced meat gravies, right?

02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:06.920
[Guest]: So I think, you know, in that sense, I think that's what I learned, in the sense that we're

02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:12.440
[Guest]: doing ourselves a disservice by thinking in these very insular terms of, this is authentic,

02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:16.120
[Guest]: this is my home's recipe, and therefore it is authentic, and these are the only way to

02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:18.680
[Guest]: make this, and these are the spices you need to use.

02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:23.360
[Guest]: I think if we mix and match, I think it will probably be a more vibrant, richer, I expect

02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:30.840
[Guest]: to see a lot more innovation, if you will, on, I think, if people are more open to some

02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:35.600
[Guest]: of these things, I expect to see food startups and others inventing new snacks, rather than

02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:37.560
[Guest]: just the same old things, right?

02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:41.000
[Guest]: Essentially, if you look at Indian snacks, right, either the traditional ones, namkeens

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:44.480
[Guest]: and you know, those kinds of things, or you have the Western canvas of the potato chip,

02:59:44.480 --> 02:59:45.480
[Guest]: but with desi flavors.

02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:47.760
[Guest]: Yeah, that's really about it.

02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:52.800
[Guest]: There's just an ocean of Indian snacks made from millets and a ton of other things, which

02:59:52.800 --> 02:59:56.000
[Guest]: by the way, if you can apply a little bit of food science, mix a few flavors and so

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:00.840
[Guest]: on, why couldn't you take a murukku from, say, South India, and flavor it with mustard

03:00:00.840 --> 03:00:02.280
[Guest]: oil and others and sell it in Bengal, right?

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:04.440
[Guest]: There's nothing to stop you from doing that, right?

03:00:04.440 --> 03:00:07.000
[Guest]: But yeah, people will say, no, no, no, that's not authentic.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:08.000
[Guest]: And so on.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:09.960
[Amit Varma]: But I think, you know, there's a great opportunity to do that.

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:14.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, in the last couple of minutes, you've just made a bunch of cravings explode in me

03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:19.720
[Amit Varma]: one, I'm thinking of koshamangshu, two, I've realized that, you know, the dosa cart outside

03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:23.840
[Amit Varma]: Mithibhai is like a five minute drive away from where I live, and I can have some schezwan

03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:27.920
[Amit Varma]: dosa there, which by the way, I love and they have some 40-50 kinds of dosas, which are

03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:29.000
[Amit Varma]: mind blowing.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And three, you know, you mentioned new kinds of snacks.

03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:34.560
[Guest]: Have you ever had dosa khakras?

03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:35.960
[Guest]: No, not yet.

03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:36.960
[Amit Varma]: I need to try that.

03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they're absolutely delicious.

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:43.000
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, I'm sure they'll reach Chennai at some point in time.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:47.520
[Amit Varma]: And again, I share your feelings about authenticity and this food snobbery that people have.

03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:48.880
[Amit Varma]: I don't know where the hell it comes from.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:53.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you think about it, you know, tomatoes, potatoes, chilies, onions, none of them are

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:55.440
[Guest]: sanskari in that sense.

03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:00.480
[Amit Varma]: They're all relatively recent and still, you know, we are so incredibly snobbish.

03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:06.240
[Guest]: It is not surprising in a sense, because I think food is, unlike many other places, I

03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:11.680
[Guest]: think food is a stronger part of community and caste and religious identity in this part

03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:14.680
[Guest]: of the world than many other places, right?

03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:18.720
[Guest]: So people sometimes define themselves on what they don't eat.

03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.040
[Guest]: So I don't eat garlic, I don't eat mushrooms.

03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:26.360
[Guest]: I mean, it's just that we've carved ourselves into, you know, in so many sort of these things

03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:33.680
[Guest]: that, you know, if you're not experimental enough, the system, the culture actually makes

03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:37.640
[Guest]: it harder for you to go to a stranger's house and eat their food, right?

03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:44.320
[Guest]: The average Indian is hard for, you take someone, you know, from, say, a vegetarian family,

03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:48.120
[Guest]: what would he eat if he goes to a Muslim friend's house or if he goes to a lower-caste friend's

03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:49.120
[Guest]: house?

03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:53.040
[Guest]: I mean, it's just that we have created these walls based on food as well, right?

03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:58.200
[Guest]: Which is changing, thankfully, because of urban India and the fact that, you know, people

03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:01.480
[Guest]: are open to these things and people order these things regularly now on Swiggy and they're

03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:02.480
[Guest]: able to experiment, et cetera.

03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:07.040
[Guest]: But if you only go by just home cooking and so on, we're very insular in the fact that

03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.200
[Guest]: this food and this way of cooking, this is our food.

03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:15.000
[Guest]: And in a way, I think food serves as a way of, in some way, the smaller divisions in

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:21.560
[Guest]: cuisine and exclusions and so on, make it easy for people to be homogeneously only among

03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:24.840
[Guest]: their own selves and not marry someone else because they'll cook something you can't eat

03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:25.840
[Guest]: and so on, right?

03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:27.960
[Guest]: I mean, I think food is a very, very important part of that entire thing.

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:28.960
[Guest]: We sometimes don't give it credit.

03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:33.320
[Guest]: You know, people in my family will sometimes say, oh, you bring caste into everything.

03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:34.320
[Guest]: It's not like that.

03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:35.320
[Guest]: India has changed, et cetera.

03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:39.680
[Guest]: I'm like, no, the reality is that you cannot walk into the house of this friend I have

03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:41.320
[Guest]: and eat what they cook.

03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:44.320
[Guest]: You have to call well ahead of time and say, I will not eat this.

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:45.520
[Guest]: It's not just enough to say vegetarian.

03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:47.680
[Guest]: You have to say, it has to be no mushroom.

03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:49.360
[Guest]: It has to be no garlic.

03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:52.720
[Guest]: If it's Tuesday, it has to be no, you know, something else and so on.

03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:56.840
[Guest]: So it is just that I think it is, that's just the nature of this part of the world.

03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:00.320
[Guest]: But hopefully, I think amongst urban India, this is hopefully changing and people will

03:03:00.320 --> 03:03:05.080
[Guest]: be open to really experimenting a lot more and not treat food as a, as something that's

03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.080
[Guest]: part of your identity.

03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:09.080
[Guest]: I think, or at least it should be the part, that part of your identity that you're happy

03:03:09.080 --> 03:03:12.720
[Guest]: to share and happy to have it, you know, be fused with others.

03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:17.160
[Amit Varma]: So that's both insightful and inspiring and maybe our dream of an India in the future

03:03:17.160 --> 03:03:20.920
[Amit Varma]: is actually a food dream when everybody eats everything.

03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:25.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'll ask you my closing question now and it is not one about hope or despair

03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:28.860
[Amit Varma]: because what despair can we have when we are talking about food?

03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:33.640
[Amit Varma]: So my question really is that, you know, listeners of this podcast are always looking to dive

03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:35.000
[Amit Varma]: deeper.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.880
[Amit Varma]: So give me a, give me a set of recommendations for people who really care about food, books,

03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:45.360
[Amit Varma]: YouTube channels, movies, absolutely anything if you want to dive deeper into food.

03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:50.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my number one recommendation in that regard will obviously be your superb eye-opening

03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:54.800
[Amit Varma]: book, which I'll, you know, read again at leisure because there are parts of it I want

03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:56.680
[Amit Varma]: to take time and process.

03:03:56.680 --> 03:03:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's a must read.

03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:02.420
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, what are the books that kind of opened your mind about food and besides

03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:06.120
[Amit Varma]: your excellent YouTube channels and we, you know, we haven't spoken much about your music.

03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:08.280
[Amit Varma]: So someday I hope you'll come on again.

03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:13.640
[Amit Varma]: We can kind of tackle that because I just fucking love your work.

03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:14.640
[Amit Varma]: It's incredible.

03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And we always thought that, you know, if we have an episode together, we'll talk mainly

03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.160
[Amit Varma]: about music, which we haven't gotten down to doing, but someday in the future, but yeah,

03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:24.680
[Amit Varma]: so you know, books, videos, whatever.

03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:27.480
[Guest]: So I think one, I'll start sort of simple, right?

03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:31.400
[Guest]: So if you want to get a little bit more into, so, you know, I had enough material to write

03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:33.240
[Guest]: like 500 pages, right?

03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:36.560
[Guest]: But clearly I said, no, that's, you know, that's automatically going to reduce the potential

03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:37.560
[Guest]: audience.

03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:42.120
[Guest]: I think 240 or 250, under 300 pages seems to be the sweet spot for someone to pick up

03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:44.480
[Guest]: a book and say, you know what, I'm going to finish this, right?

03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:48.080
[Guest]: So obviously I had to make a lot of choices on what I'm going to leave out, how detail

03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:49.240
[Guest]: am I going to get in?

03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:54.400
[Guest]: So I think a Food Lab by Kenji Alt-Lopez is, is the, you know, is fantastic.

03:04:54.400 --> 03:05:00.040
[Guest]: It's like 700 pages might be slightly hard to source in India, hardcover and can be slightly

03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:03.040
[Guest]: expensive, but I think you could perhaps buy the Kindle edition or, you know, something

03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:04.040
[Guest]: like that.

03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:08.000
[Guest]: So that's definitely, I think really a lot of the principles I talk about, but they're

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:11.160
[Guest]: still applicable in, in Western cooking in, in those dishes, it's going to be the dishes

03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:16.560
[Guest]: focused on a lot of meat and, you know, roasted vegetables and seafood and pasta, those kinds

03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:21.200
[Guest]: of pizza and those kinds of dishes, but it's still learned tons of things from, and also

03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:24.640
[Guest]: I think his approach to his methodology, right?

03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:29.240
[Guest]: And literally, whereas I kind of talk about the methodology at the end, he talks about

03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:33.480
[Guest]: the methodology while he actually describes the science of why it is very literally say,

03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:37.080
[Guest]: I tried seven batches and this batch, I tried this, this batch, and this is the table of

03:05:37.080 --> 03:05:38.400
[Guest]: what I found and so on.

03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:43.840
[Guest]: So it's, I mean, remarkably sort of, I mean, it is, it is a treatise in that sense.

03:05:43.840 --> 03:05:47.320
[Guest]: Definitely I think I would say that's the immediate next step for someone who's interested

03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:48.320
[Guest]: in, in the depth.

03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:49.960
[Guest]: This is the second book is a very recent read.

03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:57.200
[Guest]: I would strongly recommend is slightly, slightly hard, but neuro gastronomy will open your

03:05:57.200 --> 03:06:01.240
[Guest]: eyes in terms of the, how your brain perceives food.

03:06:01.240 --> 03:06:03.600
[Guest]: It may be slightly harder to read, but just stick with it.

03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:05.440
[Guest]: It is fantastic.

03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:12.760
[Guest]: Actually I think there are also some, if you have a little bit of money and you have money

03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:17.680
[Guest]: to blow, there's something called Modernist Cuisine, which is by Nathan Mirvold, the ex

03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:19.320
[Guest]: Microsoft CTO.

03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:21.760
[Guest]: He's become like this food science guy.

03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:26.040
[Guest]: I think Modernist Cuisine at home, actually the original thing is actually a set of six

03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:30.440
[Guest]: books which costs $600, therefore impractical for anyone.

03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:34.620
[Guest]: There is a concise version called the Modernist Cuisine at home, right?

03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:40.000
[Guest]: It is a fantastically ground up, fresh way of thinking about food.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:45.040
[Guest]: Some of which, I mean, I do refer to this in, I think in chapter six or something, right?

03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:48.840
[Guest]: Sous vide and many of these other newer techniques where ground up, he said, no, I'm going to

03:06:48.840 --> 03:06:53.080
[Guest]: ignore all of the tradition, ancient wisdom, ground up if I really think about the chemistry

03:06:53.080 --> 03:06:57.600
[Guest]: of it, how would I, and if I had no budgetary constraints in terms of, you know, he uses

03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:02.600
[Guest]: like chromatographs that spin stuff and extract stuff from carrot juice at like 10,000 RPM.

03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:07.160
[Guest]: Obviously a lot of that stuff is impractical, but it's a gorgeous book that I think you'll

03:07:07.160 --> 03:07:09.000
[Guest]: still learn a ton about the science.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:10.120
[Guest]: You're not going to be able to cook.

03:07:10.120 --> 03:07:12.720
[Guest]: I don't think that's the intent of that book at all, right?

03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:16.760
[Guest]: The equipment he uses is not practical at all, but it's still an amazing book if you

03:07:16.760 --> 03:07:19.940
[Guest]: really, really want to get deep into food science.

03:07:19.940 --> 03:07:22.720
[Guest]: This is obviously on the book side.

03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:26.880
[Guest]: I think there are several YouTube channels that I absolutely adore.

03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:30.480
[Guest]: I think my all time favorite has to be Bong Eats.

03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:34.480
[Guest]: Bong Eats is just, I mean, even if you don't like cooking and if you don't like watching

03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:39.720
[Guest]: cooking videos, I think, you know, my wife watches Bong Eats videos to just relax and

03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:42.960
[Guest]: unwind at night because it's just gorgeously shot.

03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:48.360
[Guest]: It's the aesthetics of it right down to the cutting, to the cooking and the ASMR nature

03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:49.360
[Guest]: of the sounds.

03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:50.600
[Guest]: So they pay a ton of attention.

03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:56.680
[Guest]: They're amongst the most beautiful cooking videos ever shot anywhere in the world, right?

03:07:56.680 --> 03:08:01.800
[Guest]: And I think, you know, single-handedly, you know, they've made me cook more Bengali dishes

03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:03.560
[Guest]: in my kitchen than anyone else.

03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:05.800
[Guest]: I think Bong Eats definitely.

03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:11.840
[Guest]: When it comes to vegetarian cooking, Nisha Madhulika and Nandita Iyer are fantastic.

03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:16.080
[Guest]: Nisha Madhulika on YouTube and Nandita Iyer on actually very well-researched recipes.

03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:20.720
[Guest]: So it's often, you know, we don't, you know, I dunk on recipes, but it's very rare to find

03:08:20.720 --> 03:08:22.560
[Guest]: well-researched, well-tested recipes.

03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:27.600
[Guest]: People do it once and they document the recipe, rarely do people like, do it like, you know,

03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:30.840
[Guest]: four or five times and then really pay close attention to actually documenting.

03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:35.680
[Guest]: And if you like really well-researched recipes, I think Saffron Trail is a good choice there.

03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:39.160
[Guest]: Nisha Madhulika is a fantastic source for vegetarian cooking.

03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:43.080
[Guest]: I mean, her channel is one of the most watched in the world, I think.

03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:45.320
[Guest]: And she's obviously fantastic.

03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:50.640
[Guest]: And I think there are some very specific channels that I follow for other specific cuisines

03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:57.240
[Guest]: that are just Shalu's Kitchen for Mallu cooking, especially if you like beef and pork dishes,

03:08:57.240 --> 03:08:58.960
[Guest]: you know, that is the channel.

03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:04.840
[Guest]: And I think there's also Madras Samayal for, so the more meat-based Tamil dishes and so

03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:05.840
[Guest]: on.

03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:06.840
[Guest]: There are several others.

03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:09.800
[Guest]: I think I'd probably, you know, I can share a list and, you know, you can probably, you

03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:11.400
[Guest]: know, look at the show notes and so on.

03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:14.160
[Guest]: So this is on the YouTube site.

03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:19.440
[Guest]: And I am, unfortunately, there's a ton of cooking video, cooking content innovation

03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:22.440
[Guest]: happens on Instagram, that's it's a platform that I don't use.

03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:26.840
[Guest]: So I'm not really aware of what's happening on Instagram, but I'm sure there are probably

03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:30.000
[Guest]: tons of interesting things that happen on that space as well.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:33.160
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, thanks so much for your time today.

03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:38.200
[Amit Varma]: And also for providing us this rabbit hole for listeners and me to go down on, you know,

03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:41.600
[Amit Varma]: if you have additional links, I'll put them in the show notes as well.

03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:45.320
[Amit Varma]: By the way, as far as modernist cuisine is concerned, you know, after reading about it

03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:50.700
[Amit Varma]: in your book, I went looking for it and right now on Amazon, it is $60,999.

03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:55.240
[Amit Varma]: But I managed to find pirated PDFs, which, you know, raises that old question of what

03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:56.240
[Amit Varma]: do you do?

03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And my ethic about piracy is absolutely never except when the book is not available.

03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:04.500
[Amit Varma]: But I would say being available at $60,000 is like being not available.

03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So kindly forgive me, Mr. Murthy.

03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:12.840
[Guest]: So I bought my copy in Singapore when I traveled, Modernist Cuisine at Home, which is about

03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:13.840
[Guest]: $130.

03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:18.600
[Guest]: So yeah, it's still quite expensive, but I really loved the book and so on.

03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:23.160
[Guest]: So it's, I mean, it's a work of art just for the photographs and so on.

03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:24.160
[Guest]: Wow.

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.800
[Guest]: So thanks so much for coming on the show.

03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:26.800
