00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
[Amit Varma]: We want tales of lust and carnage, greed and conquest, love and madness.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: We want romance and betrayal and violence and murder.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And frankly history is full of all of this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Our present times are relatively sane.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: The stories that should fill our history books make all the most colourful story books seem so tame by comparison.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I read a book recently that had people getting trampled by mad elephants,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Amit Varma]: that had a father trying to burn his son in his bedroom,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: but instead getting killed by his son in his shower.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: We had a sultan behead his assassin and carry his head around on a horse,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: while kingdoms went to war because a ruler developed a crush on a girl

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and decided he had to abduct her and have her in his harem.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a mad story book and it makes the Game of Thrones look like a children's book.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a book you won't put down when you start reading it,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
[Amit Varma]: especially if you're reading it on your smartphone,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: because hey, who puts down their smartphones these days?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural science.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadwa.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Today's subject is the history of the Deccan.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Now for most people the Deccan is all about Shivaji versus the Mughals,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: but actually the Deccan has an incredibly colourful history

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and the book I referred to a few moments ago is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Rebel Sultans by the young historian Manu Pillay.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Manu is only 28 years old and has already written two books,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: The Ivory Throne and Rebel Sultans,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and his writing is exactly what good history should be.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Lucid, easy to read, witty and very, very entertaining.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: This is clearly a man in love with his subject.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And why would he not be?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: He committed his first homicide at the age of 13.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: This is something he casually revealed to me in a conversation before we recorded the podcast

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and since it was confidential, I shall say no more on it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: But do ask him about it if you run into him.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And now for our conversation, but before we get to that, let's take a quick emotional break.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
[Amit Varma]: but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColours.com.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
[Guest]: Manu, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Guest]: Thank you for having me. I've been hearing for a few months now, but it's good to be on the program finally.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Great to hear.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'm very curious about how you became a historian.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, first of all, you're like 28 years old, and you've already written two acclaimed books of history.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So how did you sort of get drawn towards writing history?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Guest]: Well, it began with stories, because more than history as such, it was the stories in my own family.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
[Guest]: Because every now and then, you know, I grew up in Pune, but we would go to Kerala to my grandmother's place.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: And she would tell these vivid, reverting stories about her own family members.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
[Guest]: And she had this fascinating way of telling stories without any censorship.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Guest]: Because normally you have this image of your grandmother as somebody who tells you stories with, you know, moral lessons at the end of it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Guest]: My grandmother told me no such story.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
[Guest]: She told me about her uncles and how many illegitimate children they had,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
[Guest]: how many wives they married, how they discarded their wives, how the system there worked, you know,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Guest]: how when she was growing up, what the agrarian economy was.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Guest]: These were the things I grew up listening to.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: So it was a story of groves and gods and fighting goddesses and, you know,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: a great-great-great grandmother who could tame an elephant and things like that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: So I started getting interested in these people.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: And, you know, I refer to this uncle with illegitimate kids, for example.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: The idea was that she'd say it in such hilarious ways, these stories.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Guest]: I realized very quickly that although these people were not of my time,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: their context was different, their period was different completely,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Guest]: they were not like us human beings.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
[Guest]: They were made of flesh and blood.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
[Guest]: They had the same instincts and impulses.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
[Guest]: And that to me was fascinating, the idea that they may have lived 150 years before me,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[Guest]: but they were just like me in terms of what they were trying to do, you know, who they were as people.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: And once you start seeing history through the eyes of the people who make history,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[Guest]: then you start realizing that it's easier to connect with history.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
[Guest]: So then for me, the journey then moved to biographies of people.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: I started reading about people in history.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: And then, of course, when I was about 18, I came across this long-forgotten Malayali queen,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: the Setulakshmi Bai of Travancore.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: And the story was so fascinating for me that, you know,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
[Guest]: it launched something that lasted six years.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
[Guest]: And from 19 to 25, I was working on my first book, which came out in 2015,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
[Guest]: The Ivory Throne.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: And, you know, then, of course, I came to the Deccan, which was launched earlier this year.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Amit Varma]: So I remember when I was 19, back in the day, pretty much the only thing I knew was how to mix Old Monk and Coke.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
[Amit Varma]: How do you know how to do history?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Amit Varma]: How do you learn that?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[Guest]: What is doing history?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
[Guest]: Doing history, I suppose there's no single answer to doing history.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
[Guest]: Of course, it's a science in a way, it needs a certain amount of responsibility.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
[Guest]: But I didn't go into it thinking, oh, I'm going to write this book this way or whatever.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
[Guest]: That evolved over time.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: At 19, you know, I suppose when I went in, I was looking for this fascinating story.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
[Guest]: I was collecting material.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
[Guest]: I did a skeletal draft.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
[Guest]: But I didn't know what the hell I was actually doing.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Guest]: But then, luckily for me, because I invested the time in it, which was six years, I grew as a person.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Guest]: It wasn't the 19-year-old who went into the book, who finished the book in 2015.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest]: You know, I had changed as a person.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
[Guest]: The book changed me just as much as I ended up writing the book.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Guest]: And in that process, I did a master's degree at the time, which I had to do a thesis.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Guest]: So at university, we were taught about research methods, you know, how to do your footnoting, how to find material, things like that.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: Although that was in international relations, the point was those skills, so to speak, ended up, you know, being perfectly applicable to history as well.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: And I started figuring out how to access archives, how to go about getting your material.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
[Guest]: And then, naturally, things started falling into place.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Guest]: So you have a combination of your material, your story, as well as, you know, everything that needs to finally come together and create that recipe for it to work.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
[Guest]: So, you know, I put together three or four or five drafts, actually.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
[Guest]: Some parts of the book are five drafts.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Guest]: And the interesting thing is the final draft, the final version of the book, was entirely trying to read it from the perspective of the reader.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Guest]: In the sense that for the first three or four drafts, I was writing what I wanted to say.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: It was the story I wanted to tell.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
[Guest]: But the final version, before it went to press, for six months, was trying to figure out how is the reader going to read this.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
[Guest]: That's where the difference is, right?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
[Guest]: So you have academic historians who populate the seminar circuit.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: But I didn't want to do that because I found there are these fascinating stories.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Guest]: They need to be conveyed to a larger audience.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
[Guest]: You have to have a bridge that takes solidly researched history, but in an accessible fashion to as large an audience as possible.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
[Guest]: So then you need to know what the audience is thinking.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
[Guest]: You need to figure out what appeals to them.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
[Guest]: Your language has to have a certain elegance.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
[Guest]: So for me, doing history is academic rigor in terms of how you approach your material, how you interrogate your material, and how you draw your conclusions.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: But also writing in a fashion that is literary, that is attractive, that tries and reaches out to as many people as possible.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
[Guest]: Because this is, frankly, everybody's heritage.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
[Guest]: If the stories could fascinate me in my teens, someone needs to sort of disseminate them for a larger audience.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Guest]: And doing that means your style of writing also matters.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And you, of course, talking about your book, Ivory Throne, which I'd encourage all my listeners to check out.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And what was sort of the early books which gave you a sense that history is not a boring subject,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Amit Varma]: but it can, you know, be told in as fascinating and gripping and engrossing a manner as a novel or a storybook?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: You know, funnily enough, it wasn't so much history books that influenced the writing itself,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
[Guest]: which was, for example, P. G. Woodhouse, I keep saying that, you know, there's a certain irreverence that I picked up from there,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Guest]: which you may have found in Rebel Sultan, as well as my book on the Deccan,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
[Guest]: which is that every now and then, I mean, the whole idea is to say that although this is history, although this is serious business,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: never take yourself or your writing, or even frankly, any of these people too seriously.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Guest]: Because it wasn't like they woke up in the morning and decided, oh, we're making history today.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: No, they were just going about their lives.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Guest]: So we realized that we're able to look at history from a different perspective in a different way

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
[Guest]: without getting completely overawed by what is happening.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
[Guest]: But otherwise, in terms of writing history in an accessible way, William Dalrymple gets great credit.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: Because frankly, for me, in my early teens, his books were the ones that really, you know, stood out and told me that,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: hold on, this is history, it's archival material, but it's sold so well.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Guest]: It's told so richly that you feel an inducement to turn the page, you want to turn the page.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Guest]: And that is what I wanted to do as well.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
[Guest]: Just as the stories I heard in my family, you know, could make me sit up with pleasure and delight.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: This was, I was reading a book that was making me do the same thing.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
[Guest]: And I thought, you know, those are the kind of books that I want to do.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: So partly it was fiction more than nonfiction.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: Your P.G. Woodhouse of the world, Aubrey Menon and his Ramayana retold.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
[Guest]: It's a satirical take on the Ramayana. It was one of the earliest books to be banned in India.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
[Guest]: But it's fascinating to look at how one man could take this grand epic and give it this very interesting twist.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: And, of course, then finally Dalrymple and, you know, all the other writers who were writing at that time.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And before we start talking about the rebel sultans, which, by the way, I found, you know,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: something you wouldn't expect from a book of history is full of LOL moments, not just in the events you describe,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Amit Varma]: but also the way you write them, as you said.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to that, you also mentioned that the process of writing The Ivory Throne changed you as a person.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[Amit Varma]: In what ways did it change you or the way you look at the world?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Guest]: Well, if you looked at The Ivory Throne, it's a 700-page book.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, I didn't realize it was going to be such a long book, but obviously, you know, it proved to be a fairly long book.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
[Guest]: But, you know, going in at 19 meant that I wasn't an introverted person who was used to sitting at a desk and plodding away for hours every day.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
[Guest]: So, but once the story sort of, you know, hooked me, it took a life of its own and then everything became about that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
[Guest]: So I had in 2009 access to all my protagonist's personal letters and so on.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Guest]: But then I realized the other piece in the puzzle was in the British archives in London.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
[Guest]: So I wanted to go there.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
[Guest]: How do you convince your parents at 19 or 20 that you want to go abroad and write a book?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
[Guest]: So obviously I said, oh, I want to do a master's degree. Will you fund it?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest]: Of course, you know, parents being good parents, they said, of course, we'll fund it.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[Guest]: You know, there you go.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: So then I chose a university where the workload would be lower.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Guest]: So all the rest of my time I had access to the library.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
[Guest]: So my routine was normally classes in the morning and then rush off to the archive and sit there till whenever they shut,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
[Guest]: which was normally five o'clock the archive shuts and then the rest of the library at eight o'clock,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
[Guest]: which meant that from the age of 20, I was stuck, you know, from classes and then sitting in a room full of quiet people for about six, seven hours a day

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
[Guest]: and then coming home and then doing my business.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: So, so much so my friends started calling me the monk because I wouldn't go out.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
[Guest]: I wouldn't go out drinking.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Guest]: If I drank on a Friday, then, you know, you'd end up sleeping in late on Saturdays, where Saturday is the library shut early.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[Guest]: So I couldn't waste time there.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: So it took a toll in terms of my personal life, what is happening in my social life.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
[Guest]: But all the same, you know, I have no regrets as such.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Guest]: Work, of course, you know, I graduated, came to Delhi, started working in Parliament with Shashi Tharoor.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
[Guest]: That took its own toll.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest]: So then from nine to nine, I was working on his job, you know, running his parliamentary office in Delhi.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
[Guest]: And then about 10 o'clock to three was my writing time.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Guest]: So I got into this routine of sleeping four hours a night.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
[Guest]: And strangely enough, after all these years, I haven't been able to shake it off.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: I still can't sleep well.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Guest]: Even if I go to bed at 11, I stay there with my eyes open.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Guest]: So in many ways, you know, the process of writing a book and being attached to that project for six years,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Guest]: meant that everything came to, everything depended on what the project needed at any given time.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: So where I was, so when I needed the National Archives in Delhi, I came and worked in Delhi.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Guest]: When I wanted the British Archives, again, I went back to London and started working there.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Guest]: Finally, it was in 2014, I realized it's been five years since I've been doing this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: I can't allow this to go on indefinitely, because it's taking over my life.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
[Guest]: So one way or the other, before I'm 25, the book has to be done.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Guest]: So that's when I finally shut the project and, you know, got on with the task of publishing it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And from there, how did you move on to the Deccan as a subject?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Guest]: The Deccan came, so the ivory throne relates to my Malayali heritage.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Guest]: As somebody, as a Malayali who grew up outside Kerala,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Guest]: I was always interested in the story of my ancestors and the past in Kerala.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: But I grew up in Pune.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
[Guest]: So, you know, I grew up in the heart of the Deccan in that sense.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
[Guest]: Shivaji was this towering figure in all my school textbooks.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
[Guest]: But the interesting thing is that great historians have done great books on Shivaji.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
[Guest]: He's a figure that has been given a great deal of historical attention.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: But I noticed that every now and then there'd be these other characters looming behind him.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Guest]: And you got these cameos and occasional peep shows into their lives.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
[Guest]: But they were largely footnoted.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: So every now and then Adil Shah of Bijapur or Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar would pop up.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
[Guest]: But you never really understood who these people were.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Guest]: Because they were merely secondary characters in the story of Shivaji.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
[Guest]: So at some level I kept wondering who were these people.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: Because they're not Mughals. They're not South Indian.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Guest]: They're Shivaji's people or the people who set the stage for Shivaji to arrive.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
[Guest]: But what about their story?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
[Guest]: So finally, you know, I kept collecting these stories in a sort of ad-hoc, non-committal fashion.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest]: But finally in 2016 when I was in Golconda in Hyderabad,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Guest]: I went to the Golconda fort and went and looked at the Qutub Shahi tombs there.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
[Guest]: And I was fascinated because beautiful structures, a very impressive fort.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: And strangely enough, you know, nobody seemed to know very much about it.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: Other than the tour guides there and a not very impressive trickle of tourists.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
[Guest]: I was like, why aren't these stories out there? They need to be told.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Guest]: So that's when I decided I would sit down and do a book on the Deccan Sultans.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And then yeah, that's when the project picked up.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of go through the timeline of the book now, which is incredibly fascinating.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And your story in a sense starts in the 13th century with the Delhi Sultanate.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And I was struck by an early bit of fake news about a character

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Amit Varma]: who's not really a character in your book at all.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But you sort of mentioned him early on, which is Ghiyasuddin Balban.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And Balban had never actually conquered South India or even been there or whatever.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But he got a Sanskrit inscription commissioned, which basically said,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Amit Varma]: quote, he issued forth on a military expedition.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[Amit Varma]: The Gaudas abdicated their glory.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Amit Varma]: The Andhras, through fear, besought the shelter of the caves.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
[Amit Varma]: The Keralas forsook their pleasures.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
[Amit Varma]: The Karnatas hid themselves in defiles.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
[Amit Varma]: The Maharashtras gave their place.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
[Amit Varma]: The Gujaras resigned their vigor.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And the Lathas dwarfed themselves into Kiratas.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's, you know, just as an early example of fake news.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And there are like sort of examples of fake news throughout your book.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, you have one of his near contemporaries, Ramchandra Yadav.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: With breathtaking humility, you mentioned, he compares himself

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Amit Varma]: to the mythological great boar in suckering the earth from the oppressions of the Turukas,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course, the Turks.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
[Guest]: And he never encountered a Turk.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
[Guest]: Never seen a Turk till then.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
[Amit Varma]: So your book immediately humanizes this by, you know,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
[Amit Varma]: placing it in a context that even we can understand today immediately.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
[Guest]: So the thing is, you know, Indian kings had this habit.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
[Guest]: It was part of an old Sanskritic tradition,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
[Guest]: which is that you draw your legitimacy,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: A, by connecting yourself to old institutions, temples,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
[Guest]: previous dynasties sometimes.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Guest]: But also by these exaggerated declarations,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: normally in these classical languages.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest]: So although Balban is the Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: he's writing in Sanskrit here.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: And the funny thing is a little later,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
[Guest]: you have the emperor of Vijayanagar making the same claims

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
[Guest]: about North Indian people he's never seen.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
[Guest]: Even in Shivaji's time, you have similar claims,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: where even the Madras rulers, which is essentially the British,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
[Guest]: even they're included in inscriptions,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
[Guest]: as though everybody's running away at the sight of Shivaji's armies.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Guest]: The idea is kings try to project this supernatural power,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Guest]: because that's how kingship was constructed in India.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest]: The idea was, it was pointless if you merely had power.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
[Guest]: Power had to be demonstrated.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
[Guest]: How? Through great rituals, through great processions.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: Why do we have this great love of processions and display?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
[Guest]: Exactly this.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
[Guest]: If you had power, you had to show it.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: Why is it that Mughal emperors had to appear at that window

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: in the fort every day?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
[Guest]: Because otherwise, if you didn't appear consistently for a few days,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Guest]: people thought you were dead.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
[Guest]: Which meant what? Chaos.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
[Guest]: You don't know who the next ruler is going to be.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
[Guest]: So power had to be demonstrated.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: These inscriptions essentially do the same thing,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
[Guest]: where they're trying to project to the elites that,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
[Guest]: oh my God, look at my influence.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
[Guest]: All these people bow before me.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
[Guest]: They may not necessarily.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
[Guest]: It's not completely true.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
[Guest]: But it's a way of sort of suggesting that,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[Guest]: look, I am the most potent of them all.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
[Guest]: I am the one who dominates the landscape.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: Your subjects don't know better,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
[Guest]: because their lives are fairly localized.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: But when you make this claim,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Guest]: you sort of elevate yourself to this degree,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
[Guest]: where you're special, your power becomes then unquestioned.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
[Guest]: And you know, you go into a league of great rulers and emperors and others.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Guest]: And people are also imitating previous rulers.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
[Guest]: So each of these inscriptions is imitating a previous inscription.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: Which is why every dynasty, every area of this country,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Guest]: when it comes to the Sanskrit language and these common themes,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
[Guest]: you find similar sort of bombastic, flamboyant claims,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
[Guest]: because they're all trying to look impressive and over majestic.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is obviously before the age of mass media.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, this signaling that is happening,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
[Amit Varma]: is happening for a very limited audience.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And part of that audience might be the emperor himself,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
[Guest]: or whoever the person is.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
[Guest]: I mean, it's almost like, you know, you want to look at it this way.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
[Guest]: You're a small minority of Muslim elites,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: ruling over a largely Hindu territory.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: One way of convincing yourself that you have the power,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: is by repeating it constantly.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
[Guest]: Even the British were no less.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: Even they had a similar habit of these, you know, bombastic proclamations.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: You know, Queen Victoria's proclamation was built up into this big hoo-ha.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: But really, how many people in villages knew who Queen Victoria was,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: or what she was saying?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
[Guest]: Nobody did.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
[Guest]: Why did the British build these grand monuments?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Guest]: Because buildings were trying to convey the idea,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: project majesty and power,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Guest]: which they may not necessarily have had.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
[Guest]: So all of this goes into that fiction of power.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
[Guest]: The idea that, you know, the more I say it, the more it becomes real.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
[Guest]: The more the chances that people start taking this seriously.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
[Guest]: Because otherwise, frankly, the reality of these kings, as I said,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
[Guest]: is that they were pretty much human like us.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
[Guest]: But if the people knew you were human, then hold on,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
[Guest]: why are we listening to you?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Guest]: Why are we your obedient subjects?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
[Guest]: You have to make yourself special.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
[Guest]: In The Ivory Throne, I have this,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Guest]: what I found a very fascinating episode where

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Guest]: the king, Marthanda Varma, he's created this new kingdom of Travancore in Kerala

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: by conquering a whole lot of places.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: And till then, he's first among equals.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: You know, first among all the nobles.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
[Guest]: In his early career, a lot of the nobles were trying to kill him.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: But suddenly he realizes that you have to elevate royal blood to a very special degree

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Guest]: so that, you know, even spilling royal blood becomes a sin.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
[Guest]: How does he do it?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: He goes to this old Sanskritic ritual called Hiranyagarbha

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Guest]: where they essentially get a golden cow.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Guest]: They construct a cow made of gold.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
[Guest]: And the Raja goes in from the mouth of the cow.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
[Guest]: He's essentially just a regular warrior.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
[Guest]: He sits inside the cow for a certain duration.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
[Guest]: Brahmins pelt it with flowers and things to sort of,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
[Guest]: and chant mantras of birth.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
[Guest]: And then he pops out from under the tail of the cow

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Guest]: and he's considered reborn.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
[Guest]: He's suddenly descended from the sun and the moon

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
[Guest]: and Suryavamshi, whatever you want.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
[Guest]: And he becomes a twice-born Kshatriya

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest]: who can wear a sacred thread and all of that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Guest]: It's a second birth, but it's also a birth that's elevating him from everybody else.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: Now nobody else may touch him.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: Nobody else may eat with him.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
[Guest]: Only Brahmins can eat with him.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: So by doing that, he slowly starts elevating his thing.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
[Guest]: Every time a member of the family goes out,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Guest]: there's a procession attending to them.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
[Guest]: All of this is visually reinforcing the idea

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Guest]: that this family or this dynasty is special.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Guest]: So these inscriptions, these kings, their recordings, their sayings,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: they're all exaggerated to a degree

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Guest]: because all of them are trying to cement power.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Guest]: At the end of the day, everyone knows power comes and goes.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[Guest]: If all these claims were true, these dynasties would have never fallen.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
[Guest]: Why is it that every dynasty falls

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
[Guest]: and then the next dynasty makes the same claims?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
[Guest]: Because they're all trying to show up as much power as possible.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
[Guest]: And like today, propaganda, PR, it all matters.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: We still in our own times have a prime minister

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Guest]: who has a habit of saying things that don't always add up

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: when you look at the facts.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
[Guest]: But the idea is, you know, what you say matters.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Guest]: The image you project,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
[Guest]: the potency you can show yourself as possessing,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: all of that matters.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: And this is what they were trying to do at that time.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's fascinating to think about modern ways

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of signaling the same things.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I can't see our prime minister

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
[Amit Varma]: entering the mouth of a cow, literally.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
[Amit Varma]: But he's worshipping cows in other ways.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So your narrative really starts get going,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Amit Varma]: let's say around 1290 when Balban's dynasty is wiped out

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and the Khiljis come to power and the nephew

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
[Amit Varma]: of first Khilji Sultan, Alauddin is sent down south.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Amit Varma]: So let's start then.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Guest]: He actually comes down south partly for his own ambition,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
[Guest]: which is that he, you know, he realizes the south has wealth.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
[Guest]: Now they've got most of the north in their hand now.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Amit Varma]: And if I may interrupt, you also point out that

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Amit Varma]: legend suggests that he left court to get as far away as he could

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Amit Varma]: from a nagging wife and overbearing mother-in-law.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Guest]: What sources give you this?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
[Guest]: You know, you can read about in Ferishta

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: and a bunch of other places.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: The idea again though is that,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: so every time you have a historical source,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
[Guest]: you have to interrogate it for multiple things.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
[Guest]: Who's written it?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: What is the intended audience?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
[Guest]: What is the language?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest]: And what is it achieving?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Guest]: So, you know, if it's written in Persian,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
[Guest]: it's not for your lay reader on the ground.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
[Guest]: It's not for the average peasant.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Guest]: It's again targeting a certain elite.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: Now when making this claim that he was only trying to get away

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
[Guest]: from a mother-in-law and just happened to come down south

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
[Guest]: and, you know, conquer a kingdom.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Guest]: All of this is trying to sort of build up a parallel narrative.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Guest]: In reality, the man knew exactly what he was doing.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Guest]: He knew there was wealth in the south.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
[Guest]: The thing is, look, the Khiljis are a new dynasty, right?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
[Guest]: Which means they haven't been cemented in power yet.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Guest]: So if he topples his uncle, he can quickly claim power.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Guest]: And therefore, he needs money to bribe nobles,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
[Guest]: to get people onto his side.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
[Guest]: So for an independent source of wealth,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
[Guest]: he needs to come south

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Guest]: because the north is entirely in his uncle's hands.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
[Guest]: Where can he get independent wealth and money and gold?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
[Guest]: In the south.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Guest]: So the Yadavas may be writing poetry about how the Turks

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Guest]: and the Muslims are shivering at the thought of them.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
[Guest]: But they've never actually seen a Turk.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: And when Al-Awwadun shows up,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
[Guest]: they're completely ill-prepared

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: because their own armies are in the south

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
[Guest]: fighting with the Hoysalas.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Guest]: And the king of the Yadavas, Ramachandra,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
[Guest]: essentially locks himself up in the fort,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: but very quickly realizes that he has an impregnable fort,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
[Guest]: but he has no food.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: So finally, he comes to terms with Al-Awwadun.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Guest]: And just then, his son comes back from the south with his army.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
[Guest]: And there you have another...

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
[Guest]: It's not fake news as such,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: but it's a very clever strategy where

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: Al-Awwadun Khilji realizes he's outnumbered

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
[Guest]: and sends a bunch of horsemen into the distance

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: to just, you know, trot about on this distant field for a bit

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Guest]: so that so much dust is raised,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
[Guest]: it starts looking like a big army is coming to aid him.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: And the Yadavas are horrified.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
[Guest]: They think there's some massive imperial army coming from the north.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
[Guest]: And they come to terms with Al-Awwadun Khilji

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest]: who then happily walks away from Devagiri

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: with heaps and mountains of gold

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: and takes it to the north, topples his uncle

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[Guest]: and becomes the next sultan.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, when you're talking about that tactical maneuver

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
[Amit Varma]: where he had his thousand horsemen

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
[Amit Varma]: raise such a whirl of dust in the distance

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
[Amit Varma]: that the Yadavas believe this inspired Gannad,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Amit Varma]: you also have a really nice sentence

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Amit Varma]: which gives a taste of the book to the reader.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Quote, and so it was that a ghost army

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Amit Varma]: behind a blur of earth and wind

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Amit Varma]: brought Devagiri to its knees.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And Devagiri, of course, is the capital of the Yadavas

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
[Amit Varma]: which later becomes Zolatabad.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Amit Varma]: As you point out, lay a scene for me

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Amit Varma]: at the time that Khilji goes to the Deccan.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
[Amit Varma]: There are essentially three sort of ruling kingdoms

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
[Amit Varma]: or dynasties or whatever

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Amit Varma]: which eventually vanish very fast within the next 50 years.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
[Amit Varma]: But just sort of tell us a little bit about

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Guest]: what those three are.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
[Guest]: So that's why I've chosen this particular period

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
[Guest]: for rebel sultans which is, you know,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
[Guest]: it begins in the 1290s

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
[Guest]: and it ends with the fall of these sultanates

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
[Guest]: in the late 17th century, in the 1680s.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Guest]: And what's interesting is that this is the Islamic period

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Guest]: that we have in the Deccan.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest]: Because before Khilji shows up,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
[Guest]: what you have in what is primarily the Maharashtra region

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
[Guest]: is the Yadavas ruling from Devagiri.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
[Guest]: In Karnataka it's the Hoysalas

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Guest]: and then in Telangana you have the Kakatiyas.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: And these three dynasties are old,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Guest]: they have their own claims of Sanskritic glory and so on.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
[Guest]: And they are all fighting each other obviously.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So the Kakatiyas are in Warangal,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
[Amit Varma]: the Hoysalas are based in Dwarsamudra.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Amit Varma]: For the modern Indian,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[Amit Varma]: just give a context of what these areas would be.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
[Guest]: So yeah, I'd say you can basically overlap them

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Guest]: with modern day Karnataka for the Hoysalas,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Guest]: Telangana for the Kakatiyas

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: and then Maharashtra for the Yadavas.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
[Guest]: Because by this time you also see the evolution of these languages.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Guest]: You see Karnataka, you know, building up Karnataka

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Guest]: and a sort of, you know, common Karnataka identity

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Guest]: through language.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[Guest]: In Maharashtra you see the Marathi language

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: evolving at the same time.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: And Telanganas had this long-standing culture as well of their own.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: And the Kakatiyas are particularly interesting

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
[Guest]: because I mentioned these bombastic Sanskritic inscriptions and so on.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: One place where this sort of Sanskritism is conspicuous

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Guest]: in its absence is in the Kakatiya dynasty

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Guest]: where with one exception all the kings embraced

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
[Guest]: what is called Shudra status.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
[Guest]: They didn't want to be twice born,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: sacred thread wearing Sanskritic Kshatriyas.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
[Guest]: They were more than happy being Shudras.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Guest]: Richard Eaton's fascinating research on how

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: most of the nobles in the last Kakatiya king,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
[Guest]: they hadn't inherited their place at court through the logic of blood.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Guest]: They'd actually worked for it.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
[Guest]: There was upward mobility that was possible.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: There were great public works that the Kakatiyas had installed in Telangana.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: So it's very interesting how each kingdom has its own flavor.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
[Guest]: Each was of course phenomenally wealthy.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: And one big reason was that these are all peninsular kingdoms.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: So a difference is that in the north where an empire means great size,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: in the south you don't necessarily need to be that large to be of equal wealth

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: because being in the peninsula you have trade

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
[Guest]: which the north also has trade of course but in a very different way.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
[Guest]: When you have seaports you have another source of income

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Guest]: which northern empires don't have.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
[Guest]: So northern empires also realized that as you come further south

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Guest]: you get access to these additional sources of revenue.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
[Guest]: You get ports, you get trade and so on.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: So these southern kingdoms existed in a little cocoon of their own.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: They knew what was happening in the north.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
[Guest]: They knew that Islamic power had been established in Delhi and the surroundings there.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
[Guest]: But they didn't quite realize that they were going to come for them as such.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Guest]: I mean it wasn't, you know, we can now say that India we have these particular boundaries.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
[Guest]: In those days these boundaries didn't exist.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
[Guest]: The north was as alien then as you know we may today find Afghanistan alien.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
[Amit Varma]: It was just as different as that.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's easy to say with hindsight that, you know,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Amit Varma]: had these three kingdoms sort of stayed united and fought together

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
[Amit Varma]: they could have prevailed.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean the same criticism that you later make of the rebel sultans

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
[Amit Varma]: that it's only when, you know, they are split up and on different sides

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[Amit Varma]: that they kind of fall apart.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But these guys didn't have that early lesson.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Like one of Alauddin's dreaded generals was Malik Kafur

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and the Yadavas actually helped Malik Kafur fight the Kakatiyas.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: Because, you know, as I said there was no,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
[Guest]: for people who try to project nationalism and these sentiments to the past

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: it's unhistorical for the simple reason that people didn't see it that way.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
[Guest]: In the past power was held by a series of elite interests

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
[Guest]: that wasn't held in the name of any grand nationalistic ideology

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: which meant that, you know, okay we've now come to terms

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest]: that guy is still my enemy let's go eat him for breakfast together.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: So, you know, that sort of mentality was there

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
[Guest]: which is why after the Yadavas were taken

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
[Guest]: they are the ones who showed the way to the other kingdoms in the south

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: to Warangal and to Hoysalas because they knew that these were my enemies.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: Why should I suffer alone?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: You know, let's try and destabilize them as well.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: So, on the one hand the Yadavas are trying also to kick off the northern yoke.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: They don't want to be under the Delhi sultans.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: But while the Delhi army is there

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[Guest]: let's also use them to get rid of our own ancestral enemies.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's a fascinating nugget here that, you know,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
[Amit Varma]: when Mohammed bin Tughlaq comes into the peace later on

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's a cousin of his who's fighting with him

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
[Amit Varma]: who takes refuge with the Hoysalas

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and I just want to quote this full paragraph because it's fantastic.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Amit Varma]: The Sultan ordered the prisoner to be skinned alive

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and as his skin was torn off, his flesh was cooked with rice.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Some was sent to his children and his wife

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and the remainder was put into a great dish and given to the elephants to eat.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
[Amit Varma]: The elephants, we know reassuringly, refused to touch this ghastly offering

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Amit Varma]: but the wail of the poor widow can only be imagined.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Her husband's skin was stuffed with straw and exhibited through the country

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Amit Varma]: as a lesson for all who might harbor romantic notions about resisting the Sultan

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Amit Varma]: in the name of their own glory or to satisfy their own ambitions."

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Amit Varma]: These were pretty gruesome times, weren't they?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
[Guest]: I mean, power and violence went hand in hand at that time.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
[Guest]: You know, this often happens on Twitter

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: where people selectively pull out a random Muslim Sultan

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: saying, so barbaric, so violent.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Guest]: And like, hold on, everybody was violent at this time.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: It wasn't the monopoly of one faith or one set of people

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: because in those days, if you wanted to have power,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Guest]: you had to be willing to shed blood.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
[Guest]: So, you know, for everybody who says,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: oh, the Mughals killed their brothers to claim power.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: I'm sorry, that happened in Vijayanagar also.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: A brother killed a brother, a son killed a father.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: That happened in Vijayanagar.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: Devaraya II, one of the most charismatic and famous Vijayanagar emperors

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
[Guest]: had a coup either orchestrated by a nephew or a cousin.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: The exact relationship was not clear, but a close family member.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: In the end, Devaraya survives.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: But what does he do?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: He cuts his head off, gets it in his hand

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Guest]: and rides a horse across the capital

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Guest]: just to show people that I'm still alive and my enemy is gone.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: That blood, the gore, it was all very natural at the time

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Guest]: because as I said, if you wanted to hold on to your power,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
[Guest]: you had to be willing to, you know,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: rip off people's heads and do these gruesome things.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Guest]: And sometimes the gruesome things were done also to make,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: to sort of establish a lesson for others

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: who might have such similar notions,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Guest]: which was that if you do this, the punishment will not be kind.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: You will not be comfortably poisoned to death or anything.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
[Amit Varma]: It will be painful. It will be slow.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Amit Varma]: The chilling effect.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, in that whole Devaraya incident,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Amit Varma]: where his cousin or uncle, whoever it is,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
[Amit Varma]: he sets that up, like before he goes to Devaraya,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
[Amit Varma]: you describe the scene, which is right out of Game of Thrones.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
[Amit Varma]: He has this elaborate banquet at his house

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and he calls all the people close to Devaraya

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's a beating of drums and there is a lot of noise there

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Amit Varma]: so that, you know, people can't really hear much.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And then one by one at different times,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Amit Varma]: because they're supposed to have dinner at different times,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Amit Varma]: according to their, this thing,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
[Amit Varma]: they're taken into the eating room and they're ritually slaughtered.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And after a sufficient number of them have been slaughtered,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Amit Varma]: he actually goes to Devaraya and tries to do it there

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and gets beheaded for his efforts.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, at multiple points through the book,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
[Amit Varma]: you talk about people being trampled to death by mad elephants,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
[Amit Varma]: which is fascinating.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Guest]: So you don't just put them to death.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: And you figure out like really creative ways.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
[Guest]: Everything is a scene.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: Everything has to be done in public

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: and everything has to be done in as powerful a way as possible

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
[Guest]: so that the message goes out.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
[Guest]: Don't come and, you know, fiddle with me

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Guest]: because you will pay and pay badly.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
[Guest]: Because as I said, power at this time,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: although these inscriptions make all these claims,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Guest]: as we were discussing earlier,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: it's actually very volatile.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Guest]: You have to have the right number of allies,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: you have to have the right number of nobles on your side,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Guest]: the right number of horses,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
[Guest]: the right number of artillerymen.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest]: If you don't have all this,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: your power starts very quickly going.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
[Guest]: See, even at this time,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
[Guest]: there were no fixed borders either.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
[Guest]: So, for example, you often find that there were,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
[Guest]: for example, Maratha, you know, Deshmukhs or village heads

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Guest]: in border territories.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
[Guest]: And one season they may ally with this king on this side.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: You may find that next year he's allying with the other king.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: So the border is constantly shifting.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
[Guest]: How many power interests you can keep on your side

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
[Guest]: determine your power.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
[Guest]: And fear is a great weapon.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
[Guest]: And fear is a very important asset there

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: because if they fear you,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: then they'll listen to you.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: If you have money,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[Guest]: then they will listen to you.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Guest]: And finally, you have to have some claims to legitimacy.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
[Guest]: And if you don't,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
[Guest]: you have to invent these claims to legitimacy.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: So even the rebel sultans,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
[Guest]: when they all broke off from Delhi

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Guest]: and the Delhi sultans and established their own power,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
[Guest]: they're all scrambling for legitimacy.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[Guest]: And this isn't merely the Islamic kings.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
[Guest]: The Hindu kings do the same.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
[Guest]: So Vijayanagara tries to concoct,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
[Guest]: find its own legitimacy

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
[Guest]: by concocting relationships with previous dynasties.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Guest]: So you know,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
[Guest]: the early emperors are claimed to be

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
[Guest]: through marriage related to the Hoysalas

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: or you know,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
[Guest]: some connection with Telangana is also found.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: In fact, one of the most enduring stories

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Guest]: is that the founders of Vijayanagara

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
[Guest]: were actually captured,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
[Guest]: taken to Delhi,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
[Guest]: converted to Islam.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Guest]: And then when they came back to the south,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
[Guest]: they sort of threw off that

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
[Guest]: and went back to being Hindus.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
[Guest]: But that's why Vidyaranya, the sage,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
[Guest]: advised them to sort of

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: rule in the name of Virupaksha, their deity.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
[Guest]: Because that would take away the taint of having converted.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Guest]: What is it trying to do?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: Claiming legitimacy.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest]: The Sultans,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: they were all trying to get legitimacy.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: The later Sultans from the Persian Shah,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
[Guest]: because the Persian Shah was a superior force,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Guest]: or from one of the Caliphs of Islam.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Guest]: Because by doing this,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Guest]: you find a way to

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Guest]: get your stamp recognized as legal.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[Guest]: if you have the right number of forces,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
[Guest]: anybody can take power.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Guest]: Even Shivaji, you know,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
[Guest]: after he conquered and built his initial

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Guest]: Samraj as it were,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Guest]: his Hindavi Swaraj,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
[Guest]: what happens is that

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: he also goes for an elaborate coronation ceremony.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: He also acquires the sacred thread.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Guest]: He also remarries all his wives

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Guest]: using Sanskritic rituals.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Guest]: All of it is doing what?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Guest]: He is connecting himself to an older tradition

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Guest]: and legitimizing his conquests.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: Till then, everybody can treat him as a warlord.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
[Guest]: But having gone through the coronation,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Guest]: he becomes a legitimate king.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest]: And he himself in a letter notes how

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
[Guest]: after the coronation when he met the Kutub Shah,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: the Kutub Shah would earlier expect Shivaji

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
[Guest]: to sort of do this prostration

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Guest]: like everybody else in front of him.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: But once Shivaji had gone through these rituals,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: he was received as an equal.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Guest]: So all of this was again an effort to legitimize.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: And violence was also an instrument for this.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
[Guest]: Upindar Singh has written about violence in India.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: It's a book spanning several thousand years.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
[Guest]: And you find that violence was always there.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Guest]: It's only now that we can sit in times

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: and think that violence was sparingly used

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: or whatever because that's what we know.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
[Guest]: But back in the day, violence was ubiquitous.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Guest]: It was everywhere.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: It had to be everywhere.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
[Guest]: Otherwise, even your remote local sense of power,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Guest]: being a village head or whatever,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: everything depended on how many swords you had.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of get back to Khilji for a moment

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Amit Varma]: on how Khilji basically over a period of time,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
[Amit Varma]: not Khilji per se himself alone,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Amit Varma]: but these three started the process

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
[Amit Varma]: by which these three empires got wiped out in the south.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
[Guest]: So he comes to the south.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: He obviously gets all the money from Devagiri

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Guest]: and then goes back.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: It's his eunuch lover Malik Afur

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
[Guest]: who eventually comes and finishes the job

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: by one by one picking off these kingdoms

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: and taking over.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: And what you then find is that these Hindu kingdoms

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: or empires, whatever you will,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: they start folding and collapsing

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: and various either local powers emerge,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: which is that when there's a vacuum,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: other ambitious people locally will emerge to claim it

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: or sometimes as you have in Madurai,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: a new Muslim Sultanate emerged there

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Guest]: because one problem the Delhi Sultans faced consistently

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
[Guest]: while they had any influence in the south

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
[Guest]: was that they would send nobles to the south

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: but the distance was so large

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: that these nobles are too often tempted to rebel

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: and sort of establish their own independent kingdoms.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: So the guy sent off to Madurai decided,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: why am I paying tribute to Delhi?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: I'm so far away.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: I can become an independent Sultan.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: So he does that.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: You know, people often present Vijayanagar

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Guest]: as a dharmic Hindu cause.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Guest]: Well, then they would have prevented the Hoysalas

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Guest]: and the other dynasties from falling.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[Guest]: No.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: They also took advantage of the fall of these kingdoms.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
[Guest]: They didn't stall them.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Guest]: They merely made sure that as these kingdoms were falling,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
[Amit Varma]: they were occupying the vacuum that came.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, as I think you pointed out,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Amit Varma]: the five brothers who founded the Vijayanagar kingdom

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
[Amit Varma]: were also claiming legitimacy

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
[Amit Varma]: by claiming to be descended from the previous kingdoms

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: and so on.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Guest]: They all had various ways of, you know,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: trying to make their conquests look as legal as possible.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Guest]: But what they were all doing,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Guest]: what Alauddin Khilji essentially did was

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest]: he destabilized this entire region.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Guest]: Everything started falling.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Guest]: And once these existing powers fell,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Guest]: it became a free-for-all.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Guest]: Anybody who had the capacity could build something new.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest]: As it happened in the northern Deccan,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Guest]: it was the Bamani Sultanate that eventually emerged.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
[Guest]: In the southern Deccan, it was Vijayanagar that emerged.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: And then these two entities were locked in conflict

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Amit Varma]: constantly with each other.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Amit Varma]: What would enable this was also, you know,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
[Amit Varma]: a classic, the blunder by Tughlaq.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we remember Tughlaq for the shift to Daulatabad in 1327,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
[Amit Varma]: which of course was a blunder

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and the army had to kind of go back after a while.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And even this is told very entertainingly by you

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Amit Varma]: because you write about how he forced all of Delhi

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Amit Varma]: to shift to Daulatabad

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and this included a blind man who didn't want to go.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And he was actually dragged to Daulatabad.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So he started losing his limbs.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And when he actually reached Daulatabad,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
[Amit Varma]: he had only one leg.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a, it's an,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: I'm pretty sure it's an apocryphal story,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: but it's an entertaining one.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Guest]: The idea being, this is,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: this is one chronicler's way of saying that

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[Guest]: this was how drastic the move was.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Guest]: I'm pretty sure this didn't happen

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
[Guest]: because whoever was pulling would have realized

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: that the man was falling away in bits on the way.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
[Guest]: But the idea was that, you know,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Amit Varma]: everybody had to move.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's absolutely fantastic.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Amit Varma]: But the real blunder was in 1345,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Amit Varma]: what Tughlaq kind of did was that

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Amit Varma]: he recalled his old guard governor from Daulatabad

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and there was now this internecine battle

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Amit Varma]: between the old guard,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Amit Varma]: whom he was trying to get rid of

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Amit Varma]: with these new people

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: who he thought would be loyal to him.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: So he, what he did was,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: because all these people going to the south

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
[Guest]: were too readily tempted to sort of

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
[Guest]: stand up in rebellion and claim independence,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest]: he thought he would create a new aristocracy

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: who would be personally loyal to them.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Guest]: So of course you have a critic of this saying

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: that cooks and cobblers and everybody's sons

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
[Guest]: were overnight turned into noblemen

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Guest]: and then the old guard was expected

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: to relinquish power to them.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: Now this could also be a legitimizing trick

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
[Guest]: for the old guard

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: because they ended up breaking away from Delhi.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: So they made it look like,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: oh look, we are the legitimate ones.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: This king is bringing low born people to power

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: which is not correct

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: and therefore we are breaking away

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: from his unjust rule.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest]: But in the end that failed

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: because if he tried to create a new aristocracy

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: it didn't work.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Guest]: The old aristocracy managed to hold together

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
[Guest]: and create an independent sultanate in the south

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[Guest]: which was of course the Bamani Sultanate

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Guest]: where they ended up selecting their first sultan

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: almost by lottery

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
[Guest]: because they chose the most efficient among them

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Guest]: and he is the one who became the first Bamani Sultan.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And that was Hasan Gangu who called himself

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Abul Muzaffar Alauddin Behman Shah

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and there was some sort of speculation

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Amit Varma]: about his surname itself, Behman.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Why is he calling himself that?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: People think that he was a servant to a Brahmin

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
[Guest]: and this was some way of commemorating

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: his original master.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: Another theory is that he was half Hindu

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: which is likely

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
[Guest]: because even the Tughlaqs took Hindu wives.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Guest]: So the later Tughlaqs

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: as you come further down the family tree

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Guest]: they are all essentially the sons of Hindu mothers.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Guest]: So it's very likely that Hasan Gangu's mother

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: was also Brahmin.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: But of course connecting Baman to Brahmin

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Guest]: is a little too convenient

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Guest]: and therefore it's very unlikely

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
[Guest]: this was the origin of that title.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: And in reality we know that he grew up in Multan.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: He was involved in the sultanate.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: He even served in Afghanistan briefly

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Guest]: and he had his own career.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Guest]: He was essentially a top level nobleman.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Guest]: He had led a botched rebellion at one time

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: but then when the Deccan was finally breaking away

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
[Guest]: he landed up on the scene

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: did a very good job

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: and impressed all his peers

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
[Guest]: and therefore they ended up making him sultan.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And what's interesting was that

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Amit Varma]: he immediately abolished Jazia long before Akbar

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and you point out there's possibly two reasons for this.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Amit Varma]: One is just real politic

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Amit Varma]: because he was helped in his quest to power

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Amit Varma]: by a bunch of Hindu chieftains.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So obviously he's going to want to keep him on their good side.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And two, to distinguish himself from the brutal Naudis

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Amit Varma]: in a manner of speaking.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And this also sort of ties back to something

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned in your book

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: about how there are sort of two faces of Islam in India

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and one is you have Islam coming pre the 10th century to South India

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's very peaceful

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and there are traders

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and there are perhaps even refugees

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
[Amit Varma]: who are getting away from where they are coming from

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and they are immediately integrated into the culture

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's all very peaceful.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other is invasions from the North

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And that struck me as pretty fascinating.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
[Guest]: Yeah, the South, you know,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
[Guest]: this is the thing where I mentioned

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Guest]: that there is a Northern bias in Indian history

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: because if you look at everything from the North

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
[Guest]: you get one perspective

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
[Guest]: which is that Islam came to India how?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
[Guest]: When the swords were raised in the Sindh.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
[Guest]: Now if you look at the same issue

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: which is Islam's arrival in India from the South

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Guest]: completely different perspective

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
[Guest]: because if legend is to be believed

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
[Guest]: the oldest mosque in Kerala

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
[Guest]: was built in the lifetime of the Prophet himself

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: one year before the Prophet dies

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
[Guest]: you have this mosque being established in Kodungallur.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: Okay, there is no proof of this

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
[Guest]: because the current building is not that old

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[Guest]: but even then, two centuries later

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
[Guest]: in the 800s

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
[Guest]: you have inscriptional evidence

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[Guest]: with Arabic signatures of Muslims

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Guest]: which is that Muslims are already witnessing

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
[Guest]: royal Hindu grants by this time

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
[Guest]: to have that kind of influence

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Guest]: they had at least been there for a hundred years

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
[Guest]: they had at least been there for a while

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Guest]: to have that kind of power.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: So Islam came to the South

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
[Guest]: through peaceful embassies of commerce

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Guest]: they existed all around the Konkan coast

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
[Guest]: in fact, culturally Kerala has more in common

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
[Guest]: with Arabia than it has with North India

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
[Guest]: Delhi has more in common with Kabul

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
[Guest]: than it has with South India

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
[Guest]: and this is not very convenient now

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Guest]: for people to say

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
[Guest]: because we are now sort of completely infected

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
[Guest]: by this over-nationalistic bug

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[Guest]: but that's how history was

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
[Guest]: people had various links in this way

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Guest]: and Islam therefore

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
[Guest]: in the South wasn't a disruptive force

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
[Guest]: people associated Islam with trade

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Guest]: and that is how even later in these sultanates

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
[Guest]: you find that a lot of culture

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
[Guest]: came through Islamic networks

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
[Guest]: so even now if you go to Tirupati

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[Guest]: there are these famous bronzes

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
[Guest]: of Krishnadevaraya and his wife

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
[Guest]: the Vijayanagara emperor and his wife

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
[Guest]: go two of them

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
[Guest]: if you look at the bronze closely

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Guest]: now they've draped the women in saris or whatever

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
[Guest]: but they haven't covered Krishnadevaraya's head

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
[Guest]: he's wearing a Turkish hat

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
[Guest]: because Turkish fashions became fashionable

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
[Guest]: in Vijayanagara at that time

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Guest]: if you go to Hampi

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: you'll find that early stage remains

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: or the ruins in Hampi

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: typical, everybody's wearing the South Indian

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
[Guest]: munda or the veshti or whatever

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
[Guest]: and the torso is left bare

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
[Guest]: but as time passes

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
[Guest]: you see in later structures that have survived

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
[Guest]: the tunic starts appearing

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
[Guest]: in the Vitthala temple

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
[Guest]: there's a pillar which shows an Arab or a Muslim

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
[Guest]: on a horse

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: and this is in a temple

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
[Guest]: a Muslim enshrined forever on its walls

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
[Guest]: in its pillars

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
[Guest]: at the great platform

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
[Guest]: where all the great rituals are supposedly held

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
[Guest]: you see Arabs carved into the sides

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
[Guest]: and they're dancing and entertaining the Vijayanagara emperor

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: and so on

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
[Guest]: and most striking of all is

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
[Guest]: from the 1350s

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Guest]: the Vijayanagara emperors adopted a new title

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
[Guest]: which was Hinduraya Suratrana

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: interesting for two reasons

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: because Suratrana is the Sanskritization of Sultan

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
[Guest]: you find it in the Delhi Sultanate

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
[Guest]: where on the coins on one hand

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Guest]: on the one side you have the Arabic Sultan

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
[Guest]: on the other hand you have Suratrana

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
[Guest]: in Nepal when the Sultan of Bengal invades

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Guest]: Suratrana

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: even in Shah Jahan's time

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
[Guest]: the word for Sultan

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Guest]: in Sanskrit is Suratrana

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
[Guest]: so the Vijayanagara kings are calling themselves

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
[Guest]: Hinduraya Suratrana

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
[Guest]: which is Sultans among Hindu kings

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
[Guest]: which is that

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: funnily enough

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: they're the first people I think

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
[Guest]: who are appropriating Hindu

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
[Guest]: which is a word normally outsiders use

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
[Guest]: to everybody in India

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
[Guest]: and applying it to themselves

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: so saying among Hindu kings

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
[Guest]: we are the Sultans

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: which is that we are Hindus

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[Guest]: but we are also Sultans

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
[Guest]: you find a Telugu lord also

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
[Guest]: calling himself Suratrana

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
[Guest]: so

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
[Guest]: Islamicate culture

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
[Guest]: was bringing all this to the south

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: you know it was bringing soft power

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
[Guest]: of a certain type

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
[Guest]: fashion

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
[Guest]: what you were wearing

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: what you were eating perhaps

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
[Guest]: what you were calling yourself

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
[Guest]: everything depended on these Islamic networks

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
[Guest]: which wasn't the story of the north

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: the north had a very different

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
[Guest]: experience with Islam

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
[Guest]: but there also

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: you find these compromises

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
[Guest]: because

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
[Guest]: Mahmud of Ghor for example

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
[Guest]: you know famous for destroying

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: temples and killing so many infidels

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
[Guest]: he happily boasts that he killed

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
[Guest]: so many thousand infidels

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
[Guest]: but at the same time

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
[Guest]: in the coins he minted

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Guest]: he had no option

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
[Guest]: but to have an infidel goddess Lakshmi

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
[Guest]: because otherwise

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: the infidels would not use his coins

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
[Guest]: so the thing is

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
[Guest]: for legitimizing yourself

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
[Guest]: for audiences in the Islamic world

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
[Guest]: you play up the idea

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
[Guest]: of you bringing Islam

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
[Guest]: to these eastern barbaric lands

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: whereas in reality

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
[Guest]: in the so called barbaric lands

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: you have to come to terms

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
[Guest]: with the people

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: which is what happened

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
[Guest]: in the Deccan as well

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
[Guest]: you come to power

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
[Guest]: but you realize very quickly

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[Guest]: that you are a minority

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
[Guest]: you need local power

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
[Guest]: you need local assistance

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[Guest]: that's how the Marathas emerged

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
[Guest]: as a very powerful caste

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
[Guest]: because they became

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Guest]: the middlemen

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
[Guest]: between the people on the ground

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
[Guest]: the agriculturists

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: and the Sultans

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
[Guest]: in the big towns and cities

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
[Guest]: because they were the ones

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Guest]: who knew the countryside

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
[Guest]: they were the ones

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
[Guest]: who rallied the armies

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
[Guest]: to fight for these Sultans

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: so the Maratha caste itself

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
[Guest]: rose to prominence

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
[Guest]: in the period of the Sultanates

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
[Guest]: because finally

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: they had a particular purpose

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
[Guest]: acting as the main

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
[Guest]: sort of intermediaries of power

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
[Guest]: as main brokers of power as well

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
[Amit Varma]: so I'm speculating here

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and thinking aloud

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
[Amit Varma]: this is probably very simplistic

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
[Amit Varma]: but the thought just struck me

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
[Amit Varma]: when you were speaking

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
[Amit Varma]: is that is it then possible

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that the reason

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
[Amit Varma]: that that simplistic

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva binary

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
[Amit Varma]: of Hindus good

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Muslims bad

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
[Amit Varma]: is more dominant

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
[Amit Varma]: in the North

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
[Amit Varma]: because the North

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
[Amit Varma]: has experienced Islam

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
[Amit Varma]: more in that way

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
[Guest]: I think that may be one example

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
[Guest]: because their introduction

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
[Guest]: to Islam

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
[Guest]: came through blood

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: and violence and war

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
[Guest]: that would lead to

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
[Guest]: a certain kind of

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
[Guest]: impression of Islam

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
[Guest]: in Kerala again

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
[Guest]: to give an example

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Guest]: the experience is a

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: polar opposite

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest]: because there has been

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
[Guest]: no violence till

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
[Guest]: the Moplah rebellion

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: in 1921

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Guest]: in the previous century

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
[Guest]: in the 19th century

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: there were what were

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
[Guest]: called the outrages

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
[Guest]: which had a religious element

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: there was a so called

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
[Guest]: Jihadi element to it

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
[Guest]: which is fascinating

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
[Guest]: but what is interesting

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: is that in Kerala

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
[Guest]: the Muslims

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
[Guest]: were so deeply

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
[Guest]: wedded into

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
[Guest]: the general Hindu society

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: there was no Parda

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
[Guest]: the women did not have Parda

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: there was a matrilineal

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
[Guest]: Muslim royal family

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
[Guest]: the family of the

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: Arakkal Bibi

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
[Guest]: which is completely

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[Guest]: against the Sharia

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: you know in the

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
[Guest]: Arakkal family

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
[Guest]: it's the eldest child

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
[Guest]: that inherits

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[Guest]: if it's a girl

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: it's called the Arakkal Bibi

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
[Guest]: if it's called

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
[Guest]: it's called the Ali Raja

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
[Guest]: but the point is

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: women had right of succession

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Guest]: and this is a woman

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
[Guest]: who corresponded

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: with the Turkish

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: Ottoman Sultan

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
[Guest]: and so on

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Guest]: but she was the product

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
[Guest]: of a matrilineal system

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
[Guest]: which is a very

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
[Guest]: Malayali upper caste thing

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
[Guest]: it's not an Islamic concept

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
[Guest]: there is also something

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest]: called the Moplah Ramayana

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
[Guest]: or the Muslim Ramayana

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
[Guest]: in Kerala

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
[Guest]: where Shurpanakha

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest]: tries to seduce Rama

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
[Guest]: and Rama says no no

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: but I have already

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
[Guest]: got a wife

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[Guest]: so they were

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
[Guest]: very deeply wedded

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
[Guest]: to local society

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: just as the Christians were

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Guest]: you know their

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
[Guest]: oldest churches

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Guest]: just like the oldest

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
[Guest]: mosques in Kerala

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
[Guest]: there are no minarets

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Guest]: there are no domes

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
[Guest]: they are built

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
[Guest]: like Kerala structures

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
[Guest]: made of wood

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
[Guest]: with gables

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
[Guest]: and so on

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
[Guest]: and if you go to Calicut

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
[Guest]: there is something

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
[Guest]: called the Mishkal Palli

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
[Guest]: which is a mosque

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
[Guest]: built about 800 years ago

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
[Guest]: at some point

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
[Guest]: the Portuguese

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
[Guest]: come and destroy it

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
[Guest]: some 70-80 years later

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Guest]: in the 1570-72

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
[Guest]: I think

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
[Guest]: the Zamorin of Calicut

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
[Guest]: who is a Hindu ruler

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
[Guest]: goes to war

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
[Guest]: against the Portuguese

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
[Guest]: wins

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
[Guest]: dismantles

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
[Guest]: one of their forts

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
[Guest]: brings back all the wood

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
[Guest]: and reconstructs this mosque

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
[Guest]: that was demolished

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
[Guest]: some 70 years before

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
[Guest]: because

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
[Guest]: their identities

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
[Guest]: didn't depend on their

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
[Guest]: religious loyalties

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
[Guest]: or allegiances

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
[Guest]: they were much more than that

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
[Guest]: even the rebel Sultans

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
[Guest]: in general

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
[Guest]: the point I make is that

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
[Guest]: religion is not what

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
[Guest]: guided their politics

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
[Guest]: religion often lent

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
[Guest]: legitimacy

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
[Guest]: it often justified

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
[Guest]: what they were doing

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
[Guest]: but politics itself

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
[Guest]: was guided by the same

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: things that it is

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest]: even today guided by

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
[Guest]: which is power

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
[Guest]: greed

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
[Guest]: avarice

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
[Guest]: that sort of

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
[Amit Varma]: those human instincts

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact religion was

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
[Amit Varma]: almost in a sense

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
[Amit Varma]: a tool of their politics

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
[Amit Varma]: in the same way

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
[Amit Varma]: that for example

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
[Amit Varma]: one of the

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
[Amit Varma]: empires you mentioned

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
[Amit Varma]: declared itself Shia

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
[Amit Varma]: so it could then

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[Amit Varma]: appeal to Persia

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
[Amit Varma]: to hey look after

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
[Amit Varma]: our interests

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and that's pretty much

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
[Amit Varma]: what Persia actually did

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Persia later intervening

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
[Amit Varma]: with the Mughal emperor

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
[Amit Varma]: saying hey

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
[Amit Varma]: leave the Deccan alone

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll give you land

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
[Guest]: somewhere else

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
[Guest]: but leave the Deccan alone

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
[Guest]: which was a funny

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
[Guest]: and somewhat odd

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
[Guest]: offer to make

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: because normally

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
[Guest]: the Mughals and the Persian

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: had a lot of influence

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
[Guest]: over the Sultans

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
[Guest]: and to actually

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
[Guest]: offer this to the Mughals

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
[Guest]: if they left the Deccan

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
[Guest]: alone

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
[Guest]: it showed how much

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
[Guest]: the Persians

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
[Guest]: viewed the Deccan

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
[Guest]: as their sphere of influence

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
[Guest]: and the Deccan Sultans

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
[Guest]: also had it very

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
[Guest]: comfortable because

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
[Guest]: the Shah of Iran

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
[Guest]: was far away

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
[Guest]: he was an ocean

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
[Guest]: he was across the sea

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
[Guest]: so it was convenient

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
[Guest]: to sort of claim

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
[Guest]: to be his vassals

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
[Guest]: because you didn't

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
[Guest]: really have to see him

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
[Guest]: you didn't really have

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
[Guest]: to deal with him

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
[Guest]: as such he wasn't

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
[Guest]: coming and breathing

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
[Guest]: down your backs

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
[Guest]: it gave you a degree

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
[Guest]: of autonomy

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
[Guest]: so when the Sultans

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
[Guest]: and the Deccan

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
[Guest]: played up their

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[Guest]: Shia or Persian links

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
[Guest]: the Mughals got

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
[Guest]: only more aggravated

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
[Guest]: and more desirous

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
[Guest]: of conquering the Deccan

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
[Guest]: but yeah

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
[Guest]: as I said

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
[Guest]: these boundaries

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
[Guest]: that we have today

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
[Guest]: were not the boundaries

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
[Guest]: that were then in force

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
[Guest]: and you know

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
[Guest]: having links to Persia

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
[Guest]: having very active links

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
[Guest]: so much so that

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
[Guest]: the Shah of Iran

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
[Guest]: could ask the Qutub Shah

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
[Guest]: of Golconda

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
[Guest]: for a daughter

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
[Guest]: and the Qutub Shah

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: had the power

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
[Guest]: to say no

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
[Guest]: is interesting

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
[Guest]: because that meant

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
[Guest]: that they had their

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
[Guest]: own little ecosystem

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
[Guest]: oriented towards Persia

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and we have to go

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
[Amit Varma]: in for a commercial

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
[Amit Varma]: break now

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
[Amit Varma]: but before we

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
[Amit Varma]: that a final mention

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
[Amit Varma]: of Hassan Gangu

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
[Amit Varma]: with a little bit

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
[Amit Varma]: of fake news

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
[Amit Varma]: which I found

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
[Amit Varma]: very entertaining

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
[Amit Varma]: where you talk about

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
[Amit Varma]: how Hassan Gangu

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
[Amit Varma]: no doubt

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
[Amit Varma]: wanting to establish

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
[Amit Varma]: his own legitimacy

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of created

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
[Amit Varma]: this story

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
[Amit Varma]: which you mention

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
[Amit Varma]: as obviously

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
[Amit Varma]: apocryphal

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
[Amit Varma]: about the Nizamuddin

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Auliya

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
[Amit Varma]: that once he went

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
[Amit Varma]: to you know

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
[Amit Varma]: before he was a

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Sultan

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
[Amit Varma]: he went to meet

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
[Amit Varma]: the Nizamuddin

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and he said

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
[Amit Varma]: the Nizamuddin

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
[Amit Varma]: has left my door

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
[Guest]: another is waiting there

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
[Guest]: again

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest]: invent a story

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
[Guest]: to paper over

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
[Guest]: inconvenient corners

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
[Guest]: in history

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
[Guest]: that's also actually

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
[Guest]: a very Indian

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000

[Amit Varma]: when Hassan Gangu

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000
[Guest]: a

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
[Guest]: collection

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
[Guest]: of

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
[Guest]: wives

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
[Guest]: and

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
[Amit Varma]: knowledge

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
[Amit Varma]: languages

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
[Amit Varma]: poets

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
[Amit Varma]: consciously

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
[Amit Varma]: present

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Bahmani

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
[Amit Varma]: state

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
[Amit Varma]: as a

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
[Amit Varma]: global

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
[Amit Varma]: network

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
[Amit Varma]: all

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
[Amit Varma]: kinds

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
[Amit Varma]: languages

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
[Amit Varma]: economies

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
[Amit Varma]: all

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
[Amit Varma]: kinds

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
[Amit Varma]: languages

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
[Amit Varma]: so

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
[Amit Varma]: it

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
[Amit Varma]: would

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
[Amit Varma]: be

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
[Amit Varma]: his

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Amit Varma]: duty

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
[Amit Varma]: to

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
[Amit Varma]: build

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
[Amit Varma]: up

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
[Amit Varma]: a

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
[Amit Varma]: full

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
[Amit Varma]: collection

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
[Amit Varma]: of

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
[Amit Varma]: wives

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
[Amit Varma]: that

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
[Amit Varma]: was

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
[Amit Varma]: his

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.840
[Guest]: Because Feroz was trying to get rid of his brother because Feroz wanted his son to succeed

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.580
[Guest]: whereas Amit Shah wanted himself to sort of take over after Feroz died.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.160
[Guest]: So when Amit Shah ran away, Feroz sent an army in pursuit and then Amit Shah turns around

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.760
[Guest]: and does this little clever thing where you know all sorts of farm animals are lined up

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.920
[Guest]: and presented as horses because from the distance everything looks impressive, right?

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.020
[Guest]: So all you see is men mounted on animals.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.200
[Guest]: You can't really tell if they're buffalos or bollocks or whatever.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:37.720
[Guest]: But yeah, in the end that demoralized Feroz's force and he's the one who ended up losing.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.720
[Guest]: And although he died soon after and Amit Shah became king, there's also a long-standing

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.440
[Guest]: rumor that Amit Shah actually had Feroz Shah suffocated.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.680
[Guest]: So much for his intellectual activities and his very many wives, he also died a rather

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.320
[Guest]: painful death even though it was in bed.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And Amit Shah sort of continued the process of importing foreign cultures and foreign

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.240
[Amit Varma]: peoples like you write about how he imported 3,000 archers from Iraq, Khurasan, Transoxania,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Turkey and Arabia.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.240
[Amit Varma]: What's Transoxania?

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.240
[Guest]: Sorry.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.240
[Guest]: I'm actually not sure now.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.320
[Guest]: Transoxania is, I think, parts of Central Asia somewhere.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And Khurasan is of course Persia and all of that.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And so how does the narrative proceed here?

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.880
[Amit Varma]: What are the Bahmanis trying to do?

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Like first they come to power, they of course consolidate and all of that.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And by the time Feroz Shah has come to power, they have consolidated, which is why Feroz

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Shah is sort of looking at his legacy and building up all of this cultural whatever.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.400
[Guest]: Building up cities and now Amit Shah also builds up his own new city.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:36.800
[Guest]: He moves the capital to Bidar, where simultaneously Bidar was used by various old dynasties, including

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800
[Guest]: the Chalukyas and others.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800
[Guest]: Does it have a modern name?

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.800
[Guest]: Bidar.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.400
[Guest]: Oh, it's still called Bidar.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.280
[Guest]: And so the idea is that he's trying to tap into all that saying that, you know, this

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.440
[Guest]: is an old city with very many old links.

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.200
[Guest]: I'm sort of channeling that.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.640
[Guest]: But the other thing is also, as I said, these are all military states in the sense that

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.080
[Guest]: you have to constantly keep replenishing your military capacity.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.160
[Guest]: For that, this importing from the West became extremely important because the best horses

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.160
[Guest]: came from Persia.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.880
[Guest]: Horses do not thrive in India.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.600
[Guest]: And this is why often Vijayanagara was left behind.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.480
[Guest]: And the Vijayanagara emperors always grappled with this internal conundrum, which was that

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.780
[Guest]: even though they were bigger, even though they were often wealthier than the Sultans,

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.040
[Guest]: they were often defeated on the battlefield simply because they didn't have the latest

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.760
[Guest]: artillery technology that the Sultans imported from Turkey.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.960
[Guest]: All the artillerymen were usually Ottomans.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.680
[Guest]: They got their best horses from Persia and they got these soldiers from Persia.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.840
[Guest]: And the thing is, the idea was that by getting these foreigners in, there would be a degree

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840
[Guest]: of loyalty.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.480
[Guest]: They also got Africans, thousands and thousands of Africans who had absolutely no other loyalties.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.960
[Guest]: Their loyalties were only supposed to be to the Sultan.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:40.080
[Guest]: So being Muslims, the Bhamani Sultans could tap into this Islamic network that brought

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.700
[Guest]: them the best of the world at the time.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.240
[Guest]: Best of technology, the best of arms and, you know, ammunition that they needed.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.840
[Guest]: And of course, the best of actual manpower.

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.600
[Guest]: Whereas Vijayanagara was a little handicapped there because everything that came to them,

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.000
[Guest]: first the Bhamani Sultans would have.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.540
[Guest]: So scholars have found, for example, that Vijayanagara never evolved a fortification

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.880
[Guest]: technique like the northern Sultans of the Deccan.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.560
[Guest]: Because the Sultans kept upgrading their forts as, you know, upgradations happened elsewhere

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.200
[Guest]: in the world because the Islamic network connected them to that.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.440
[Guest]: Whereas the Vijayanagara emperors never bothered to build up their forts that way, which eventually

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.360
[Guest]: they ended up paying a cost for.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.560
[Guest]: So what Ahmed Shah was also doing was this, trying to reinforce on the one hand this link

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.240
[Guest]: to Persia to keep the Bhamani Sultanate within that network, on the other hand, trying to

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.440
[Guest]: milk that network for whatever it was worth to get the best into his kingdom, whether

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.580
[Guest]: it was people or whether it was technology.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.880
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps as a consequence of this, he then ended up defeating Vijayanagara, where he

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.280
[Amit Varma]: then destroyed a lot of temples and what you call colleges of Brahmins.

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.320
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very funny story about here when the battle is ongoing about how both

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.720
[Amit Varma]: the leaders of the forces, Zaria of Vijayanagara and Ahmed Shah himself almost got captured

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720
[Amit Varma]: in battle.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.320
[Guest]: The story about the Raya was quite hilarious.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.520
[Guest]: Yeah, these, I mean, that again, the stories tell you that, you know, battle wasn't one

00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:00.320
[Guest]: situation, as cinema shows, you know, everybody meets on a battlefield and clashes, you know,

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.040
[Guest]: huge establishments are moving.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.680
[Guest]: Often the largest section of a moving army is the cooks and the cleaners and the prostitutes

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.080
[Guest]: and people like that, the bazaar that moves with it.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.600
[Guest]: So you, I had this later quote towards the end in the book about the Marathas and how

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.640
[Guest]: towards the end when the Mughals moved, there'd be a soldier, his wife would be with him,

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.880
[Guest]: his babies would be with him, the soldier would be carrying things on his head, his

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.480
[Guest]: gun would be in the hand of his wife, and she would have stuck some kitchen ladle or

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.480
[Guest]: something into the barrel of the gun.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.320
[Guest]: And suddenly out of nowhere, the Marathas will appear on horses, cut off everybody's

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.160
[Guest]: head quickly and disappear into the hills.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.160
[Guest]: And before these guys could remove the ladle and start taking aim, they were dead.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.100
[Guest]: So armies on the move were also big establishments that were on the move.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:43.200
[Guest]: So in these situations, sometimes you have context where say the Raya is sitting somewhere,

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.360
[Guest]: his tent is pitched somewhere, ends up being not protected well.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.000
[Guest]: Similarly, in this particular battle, what happens is, on the one hand, Ahmed Shah one

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.720
[Guest]: day decides I want to go for a hunt.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.440
[Guest]: So battle is not a one day event, it's a leisurely pace, you know, the king comes slowly, they

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.440
[Guest]: set up camp.

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a marathon not a sprint.

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.040
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a very convenient thing.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.000
[Guest]: So he decides, let me go for a hunt, he ends up going too far, and ends up being ambushed

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.680
[Guest]: by a set of Vijayanagara people.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.560
[Guest]: And he's chased till he reaches this rather unglamorous situation where this Sultan of

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.640
[Guest]: the Bahmanis, you know, king of so many Persians and Africans or whatever, ends up hiding in

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640
[Guest]: a barn.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.080
[Guest]: And he's luckily saved because a number of his own men come to his rescue, but he could

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.000
[Guest]: have fallen into Vijayanagara's hands.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.840
[Guest]: Similarly, you have this Vijayanagara emperor, who's reposing somewhere in a field comfortably,

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.160
[Guest]: when suddenly he discovers that, you know, these Bahmani troops have come in.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.960
[Guest]: And because he's sitting there in his South Indian clothes, he's not actually dressed

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960
[Guest]: like a king.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960
[Guest]: He's just wearing a lungi and he's sitting shirtless.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960
[Amit Varma]: He's nearly naked.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.560
[Guest]: He's nearly naked.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.200
[Guest]: So people think he's a nobody.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.840
[Guest]: He's just some random man who's lying there.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.720
[Guest]: So he gets up and they say, we're now looting the sugarcane field, here, hold these sugarcanes.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.200
[Guest]: And he sort of, the soldiers try and make him their, I don't know, their coolie for

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200
[Guest]: the day.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.040
[Guest]: And he very quietly and cleverly decides not to say that he's actually the emperor on the

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
[Guest]: other side.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.280
[Guest]: And for some time, he's carrying the sugarcanes with them because they just think he's some

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280
[Guest]: random man.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.440
[Guest]: And of course, then they discover that the main battle has been won.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.760
[Guest]: And now there's gold to be had instead of sugarcane.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.060
[Guest]: So they abandon him and go.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.960
[Guest]: And that's how the Vijayanagara emperor ends up saving himself.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.440
[Guest]: It's the same in the final battle where Vijayanagara falls in 1565 as well, where the Vijayanagara

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.200
[Guest]: sultan is in a palanquin or one of those sedan chairs or whatever.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.240
[Guest]: And he ends up in the wrong place where an elephant comes from the other side.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.460
[Guest]: His bearers of his palanquin run away and he's just lying about there.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.440
[Guest]: And then an idiot Brahmin says, no, no, no, don't hurt him.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.200
[Guest]: He's the raya of Vijayanagara.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.920
[Guest]: That's the only reason he was captured.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.940
[Guest]: Otherwise the elephant and the elephant rider would have moved on thinking he was just some

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.280
[Guest]: random nobleman.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.860
[Guest]: But because, you know, so these things always happen in battle, these comical, somewhat,

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.320
[Guest]: you know, unglamorous, unheroic situations.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Really comic, almost lapstick situations.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.900
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I mean, I'm a proponent of the keto diet, I often say sugar is poison.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.840
[Amit Varma]: So you could argue that by carrying sugarcane for the...

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.600
[Amit Varma]: You say that as we sip coca-cola here.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, Diet Coke.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.560
[Amit Varma]: No sugar is written here.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.240
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so when the raya was carrying sugarcane for the enemy, he was in a sense

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: contributing to the eventual downfall.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.920
[Amit Varma]: What's also interesting here is, you know, people often paint, you know, Vijayanagara

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.920
[Amit Varma]: as a Hindu empire.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.360
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it might seem that, okay, they're fighting the sultans, the Bahmani empire,

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.680
[Amit Varma]: and therefore it's a Hindu versus Muslim thing.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.520
[Amit Varma]: And you point out here that Amit Shah, on the one hand, yes, whenever he captured 20,000

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Hindus, he held a feast, for example, which is an interesting factoid.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.560
[Guest]: And one wonders, it's a doubtful claim, not captured, killed.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.400
[Guest]: The idea is that every time he killed 20,000 Hindus, he would hold a feast.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.240
[Guest]: Now it's simply improbable, because, you know, if he was killing 20,000 Hindus on such a

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.760
[Guest]: regular basis, Vijayanagara would have collapsed, because we don't know the exact population

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760
[Guest]: figures.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.840
[Guest]: But we do know from global population trends, etc, that that sort of slaughter is impossible.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.560
[Guest]: Because Vijayanagara went on to have a great golden age after this, although, of course,

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.920
[Guest]: golden age is not a concept historians sort of, but the idea is that Vijayanagara grew

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
[Guest]: after that.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.040
[Guest]: It would not have been possible if 20,000 people were being slaughtered on a daily basis.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.280
[Amit Varma]: But the point you sort of make here is that even though this sort of sentiment was there,

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.480
[Amit Varma]: he was he's actually celebrated in the South by Hindus even today.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480
[Guest]: So that's what I'm saying.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.960
[Guest]: So his own chroniclers will say, oh, yes, he killed 20,000 individuals on a daily basis.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.160
[Guest]: It's an exaggeration.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.040
[Guest]: The idea is that, yes, he killed a large number of people in the course of these conquests.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.320
[Guest]: But in reality, you know, he's he's worshipped by Hindus, the Lingayats come to his tomb

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.880
[Guest]: every year, and they perform on his birth anniversary, a certain ritual where they smash the coconut

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.680
[Guest]: and they do everything in a Hindu way.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.320
[Guest]: And he was a great patron of Sufis and others.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.320
[Guest]: And this is the complexity that the Deccan highlights, which is that this binary Hindu

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.440
[Guest]: Muslim divide does not quite work.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.280
[Guest]: There's Vijayanagara, for example, on the one hand, as I said, they already called themselves

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.200
[Guest]: sultans because they are no Kwams appropriating an Islamic title and using it for themselves.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.160
[Guest]: They often, you know, there's one sultan later in the Adil Shahi kingdom, which is one of

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.660
[Guest]: the Bahmani successor states, where one sultan dismisses 3000 Persian soldiers and warriors

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660
[Guest]: he has.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660
[Guest]: Where did they go?

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:58.680
[Guest]: They trot down all the way to the south and seek service in Vijayanagara.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.920
[Guest]: Vijayanagara had its own Muslims, it had its own mosques at one point.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.440
[Guest]: The last emperor of Vijayanagara even allowed the eating of beef because he didn't want

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440
[Guest]: to.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.240
[Guest]: Similarly, the Quran was always placed in court because the Muslim soldiers said they

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.400
[Guest]: couldn't bow before a Hindu or any other human being as such.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.640
[Guest]: Therefore, they would bow in front of the Quran instead.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And the Quran was behind his throne.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.680
[Guest]: The Quran was kept near the throne so that, you know, they wouldn't be awkward about bowing

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680
[Guest]: in front of him.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.600
[Guest]: So the idea was that it was much more complicated.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.280
[Guest]: It's encapsulated best in the 1565 battle of Talikota, which is where Vijayanagara is

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.520
[Guest]: finally, the city falls and the empire starts disintegrating and the sultans of the Deccan

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.240
[Guest]: take over and start, you know, really win that historic battle.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.880
[Guest]: What's interesting is most of the, especially right-wing historians and the Twitter school

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.840
[Guest]: of history, which is the screenshot school of history, they say, oh, this is a Hindu

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.960
[Guest]: empire being destroyed by these Muslim sultans.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.640
[Guest]: Complicated history here, because what happens is the emperor of Vijayanagara, who's leading

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.360
[Guest]: the Vijayanagara forces, he began his career in the court of the Qutub Shah of Golconda.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.200
[Guest]: He was a nobleman of a Muslim sultan.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.240
[Guest]: He only ended up becoming emperor of Vijayanagara because he married Krishnadevaraya's daughter.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.840
[Guest]: The Qutub Shah who was fighting at that battle, he lived seven years as a teenager from the

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.200
[Guest]: age of about 15 or something till, you know, his early 20s in Vijayanagara, where he Teluguized

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.300
[Guest]: his name from Ibrahim to Abhirama.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.800
[Guest]: He came back to Golconda eventually, patronized poetry on the Mahabharata, acquired a wife

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.880
[Guest]: who was of Vijayanagara origin.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.200
[Guest]: He spoke and he's a great patron of Telugu.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.480
[Guest]: Look at the way poets moved.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.040
[Guest]: A poet like Shetrayya could compose poetry not only in Madurai and Hindu courts, but

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.960
[Guest]: also for the Qutub Shah of Golconda, he composed 1500 Padams, because the Qutub Shah saw themselves

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.880
[Guest]: also as custodians of Telugu heritage.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.320
[Guest]: Similarly, at the 1565 battle, you have 6000 Marathas, but they're fighting for the sultans.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.960
[Guest]: You have one Muslim warrior called Ainulmul Gilani.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.080
[Guest]: He's fighting on the side of the Vijayanagara emperor.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.760
[Guest]: Now the Twitter school, they pulled out screenshots from recent books that say, oh, Ainulmul

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.640
[Guest]: Gilani, you know, defected and went over to the side of the sultans before the battle

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.640
[Guest]: ended.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.840
[Guest]: There's no evidence of this.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.040
[Guest]: I don't know where the stories come from, because the only inscriptional evidence of

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.960
[Guest]: Ainulmul Gilani is where he's called in Telugu Ainumuluka, and he's recorded as giving a

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.440
[Guest]: grant of land to 80 Brahmins.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.720
[Guest]: So it's very mixed up.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.920
[Guest]: You can't conveniently make any black and white categorizations.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.000
[Guest]: Even the Sultanates themselves, the Nizam Shahs of Ahmednagar were descended from a

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.040
[Guest]: converted Brahmin, and they actually kept links with their Brahmin relatives.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.920
[Guest]: They made grants of land to their Brahmin relatives.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.000
[Guest]: They gave estates to their Brahmin relatives.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.360
[Guest]: They married Persian women.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.720
[Guest]: The Adil Shah of Bijapur, the Adil Shahi dynasty was founded by a man called Yusuf, who got

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.880
[Guest]: on a boat from Persia to build a career in India.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.720
[Guest]: Somewhere on the way, he decided, I'm going to start claiming I'm a long lost son of the

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.080
[Guest]: Ottoman emperor.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.760
[Guest]: Comes here, marries a Maratha woman, and that's how the Adil Shahi dynasty is founded.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.120
[Guest]: So where people say, oh, the Adil Shahs are Muslims, you're completely forgetting the

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.920
[Guest]: mother, the founding lady, who's a Maratha woman.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.320
[Guest]: And this Maratha woman is very important because two generations down the line, when her legitimate

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.600
[Guest]: grandson proves to be not up to the mark, she has no issues blinding him, putting him

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.800
[Guest]: to the side and having an illegitimate grandson elevated to power.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.280
[Guest]: So she was not a docile lady sitting wrapped up in some corner.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280
[Guest]: She was a political actor herself.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.060
[Guest]: And different Adil Shahs sometimes highlighted different sides of their heritage.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.000
[Guest]: So the second Adil Shah was very Persianized.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
[Guest]: He preferred Persian.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.180
[Guest]: He spoke only Persian.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.400
[Guest]: He dressed his troops in Persian uniforms.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.880
[Guest]: But then you have someone like Ibrahim Adil Shah II, who was a contemporary of Akbar and

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:24.040
[Guest]: Jahangir, who is exactly the opposite, where the Mughal envoy finds that barely he doesn't

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.040
[Guest]: like speaking Persian.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.040
[Guest]: He speaks Marathi.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.120
[Guest]: He prefers Marathi.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.840
[Guest]: He was Sunni Muslim, but he wore the Rudraksh mala, painted his nails red and called himself

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.560
[Guest]: the son of Guru Ganapati and the pure Saraswati.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.120
[Guest]: He was so besotted with Saraswati that he went on to rename his capital from Bijapur

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.440
[Guest]: to Vidyapur.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.840
[Guest]: So again, he's a Sunni Muslim, but he has these other sides to his identity as well.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.160
[Guest]: Just as Akbar established Fatehpur Sikri for his great debates with various religious experts

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:54.000
[Guest]: from other religions, Ibrahim Adil Shah II had his Noraspur, where Jesuits and Shaivites

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.480
[Guest]: and everybody could come and discuss religion with him.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.200
[Guest]: When a trader comes to see him, he finds the Adil Shah surrounded by 500 bejeweled women,

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.480
[Guest]: all of them playing the Veena, because he loved Veena music, you know.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.160
[Guest]: So the man is very colorful.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.040
[Guest]: He's very interesting like this.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.520
[Guest]: So you have the option of looking at him as, oh, Ibrahim equal to Sunni Muslim Sultan.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.560
[Guest]: But wasn't he a little bit more than that, to the extent that when he died on his tomb,

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.400
[Guest]: you have a very clever inscription that says, it's actually a quote from the Quran, which

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.840
[Guest]: says, no, Ibrahim was not a Jew.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.280
[Guest]: He was not a Christian.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.480
[Guest]: Certainly he was not an idolater, that is a Hindu.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.240
[Guest]: He was a devout Muslim.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.280
[Guest]: It's almost like he's teasing everybody in a sense of saying that none of you can figure

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.800
[Guest]: out who I was, you know, what my religious identity was.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.560
[Guest]: So I just put it here on the inscription.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.120
[Guest]: But the funny thing is, although it says Ibrahim there, there also he's playing a little bit

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.840
[Guest]: of a, there's a little bit of wordplay there because it could either refer to him or it

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.480
[Guest]: could refer to Ibrahim from the Quran.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.040
[Guest]: So you can't really tell what his final loyalties were, whether he was part Hindu, part Muslim

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
[Guest]: or both.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.760
[Amit Varma]: He had no contradiction there.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And when I was reading your book, you know, two of the fascinating themes that kind of

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.720
[Amit Varma]: stood out for me were globalization and assimilation.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.760
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, you have this kind of globalization where you have, say, the soft

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.560
[Amit Varma]: power of the Persians being imported and you see an influence of that in clothes, in food,

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560
[Amit Varma]: in architecture.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, to quote you again, you write about how Amit Shah started a new style of

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.520
[Amit Varma]: architecture, quote, with the elegance of Iran, the sensuality of South India, even

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.320
[Amit Varma]: the occasional influence from Europe.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:27.840
[Guest]: Even Vijayanagar, the so-called elephant stables, the domes, domes are not a South Indian architectural

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840
[Amit Varma]: style.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.640
[Amit Varma]: They're borrowed very clearly from Islam.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.760
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, you have influences from across the world, from Europe, from Africa,

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.080
[Amit Varma]: from the Middle East flooding in.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, you also have a remarkable assimilation to the extent of, you know, all

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.480
[Amit Varma]: the things you pointed out that you have these rebel sultans knowing all the local languages,

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.680
[Amit Varma]: marrying local women, adapting to local cultures.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And this is happening back then before there are, you know, regular flights between these

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.000
[Amit Varma]: two places or YouTube, where you can actually immerse yourself more in the culture.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's sort of a reminder of how even in our current day, we might be like so sure

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.120
[Amit Varma]: of what our cultural identity is, but actually it's a blend of just about everything.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.600
[Guest]: It always is a blend.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.920
[Guest]: Globalization may be a new word that is in fashion now, but the phenomenon has existed

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:11.920
[Guest]: always.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.200
[Guest]: It may not have been as fast and instant as it is today, because there was no internet

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.840
[Guest]: and quick communication and travel, but it existed.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.960
[Guest]: People always communicated with other cultures and peoples.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.520
[Guest]: They had no issues absorbing from there.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.840
[Guest]: Look at some of the names around us now, everybody, you know, recently there was this thing about

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.680
[Guest]: Amit Shah's name, Shah, being a Persian thing.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.880
[Guest]: Now, of course, in Amit Shah's case, it could have been, I mean, there is a theory that

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.280
[Guest]: it's Sahoo that becomes Shah, but even then Shah is a Persian pronunciation.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.520
[Guest]: So even if Sahoo adopted Shah, there's a Persian influence there, but forget the Shah because

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.520
[Amit Varma]: that's unsettled.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even the clothes Amit Shah and Narendra Modi wear, the churidar kurta, I mean, that's

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.200
[Guest]: classically Islamic.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.760
[Guest]: Look at some of the Peshwas who succeeded the actual Maratha rulers and became the real

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.520
[Guest]: force in the Deccan afterwards.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.960
[Guest]: The Peshwa, the title itself is Persian.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960
[Guest]: It means minister.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.960
[Guest]: It's a Persian title.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.480
[Guest]: Devendra Fadnavis is the current chief minister of Maharashtra.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480
[Guest]: What is Fadnavis?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480
[Guest]: It's a Persian title.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480
[Guest]: So these things are not gone.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.480
[Guest]: I'm not talking about a time that's no, that's left no traces.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.240
[Guest]: The traces are still in front of us.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.520
[Guest]: These traces still exist.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.880
[Guest]: Shivaji himself referred to the Hindu path, Patshahi.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
[Guest]: What is a Patshahi?

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
[Guest]: It's derived from Batsha.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.120
[Guest]: It's again an Islamic influence.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.720
[Guest]: Look at all the clothes that Shivaji and his contemporaries wore, again, inspired by Islamic

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720
[Guest]: fashions.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.880
[Guest]: Speaking of Shivaji, you know, Shivaji's father was a man called Shahji.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.720
[Guest]: Now his grandfather, who was a close associate of the Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar, Maloji, Maloji

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.360
[Guest]: couldn't have sons for a long time.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.160
[Guest]: So Maloji goes to a holy man and the holy man blesses him and his wife and then eventually

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.480
[Guest]: he has two sons.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.960
[Guest]: Interestingly, the name of the holy man is Shah Sharif.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.480
[Guest]: He's a Muslim holy man.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.000
[Guest]: And what does Maloji name his sons?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
[Guest]: Shahji and Sharifji.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.780
[Guest]: This is Shivaji's father and uncle.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:52.760
[Guest]: If you go to Ellora, where Maloji's Samadhi exists, you know, one scholar, the controversial

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.680
[Guest]: James Lane, has made the mistake of saying that this is a tomb where Maloji is buried.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.680
[Guest]: It's not a tomb.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.680
[Guest]: It's a Samadhi.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.800
[Guest]: But the reason James Lane made the mistake is because if you go to the Samadhi, it looks

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.240
[Guest]: like an Islamic monument.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.560
[Guest]: It looks exactly like the tombs you'll find in Golconda and other places.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.040
[Guest]: It's got that Islamic structure with some Hindu influences in terms of the ornamental

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.520
[Guest]: activities but the dome, all of that, if you look at it in one glance, it looks like an

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
[Guest]: Islamic structure.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.000
[Guest]: But whose Samadhi is it?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.280
[Guest]: Shivaji's grandfather.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.160
[Guest]: Shivaji himself commissioned a Sanskrit poem called the Shivabharata, the Nizam Shah in

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160
[Guest]: one place.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.760
[Guest]: Here you see the contradiction emerging, which is that on the one hand, Shivaji claims this

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.720
[Guest]: is Vishnu reincarnated to deliver the world from the oppressions of the Turukas, the Muslim

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.720
[Guest]: kings.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.180
[Guest]: But on the other hand, it also refers to the Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar as a dharmatma.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:40.160
[Guest]: It also refers to the famous African warrior general Malik Ambar as brave as the sun.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.100
[Guest]: At one point, Malik Ambar is compared to the Hindu god Kartikeya.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:48.760
[Guest]: So the idea is that even then, there was this black and whiting of history was very complicated.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.440
[Guest]: You couldn't do it very easily.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.880
[Guest]: And even Shivaji himself recognized it.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.780
[Guest]: And the Shivabharata is a fascinating case and example.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:00.120
[Guest]: And Malik Ambar is an even more fascinating case because this, we've discussed the Persian

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120
[Guest]: influence.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120
[Guest]: We've discussed the Marathas.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.360
[Guest]: We've discussed the Hindu blend with all of this.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.220
[Guest]: But the other element in the Deccan was the Africans, which is that thousands and thousands

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.900
[Guest]: of Africans came as military slaves to the Deccan year after year.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.720
[Guest]: And this wasn't merely to the Deccan.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.840
[Guest]: In the 1200s, in Razia Sultan's time, one of the reasons she was assassinated in Delhi

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.920
[Guest]: was because she had an Abyssinian, an Ethiopian African lover.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.320
[Guest]: In Bengal, there was a brief Habshi dynasty, which is African slaves kicking out the ruling

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.720
[Guest]: dynasty and seizing power for less than a decade.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.040
[Guest]: But it existed in Bengal.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.040
[Guest]: In Uttar Pradesh, an African eunuch founded in Jaunpur, a dynasty that lasted for a while,

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.880
[Guest]: I think, in the 14th century.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.440
[Guest]: So Africans were always in India.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.960
[Guest]: As late as 1724, the Mysore Maharaja had an African guarding one of his forts.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.440
[Guest]: The Nizam of Hyderabad and 19th century Africans, but the Deccan, it achieves an even more special

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.840
[Guest]: place because at least two Sultans had African wives.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.400
[Guest]: That is, picture this, in present day Ahmednagar, which is a tier two town in Maharashtra now,

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.120
[Guest]: there were African queens, two of them in the late 16th century and early 17th century.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.800
[Guest]: One of them was a daughter of Malik Ambar, who began life as a young boy in the Oromo

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.200
[Guest]: tribe in Ethiopia, gets enslaved when he's about 10-12 years old, gets carted off to

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.280
[Guest]: Baghdad, at some point ends up in the Deccan where he's purchased by the Peshwa of Ahmednagar,

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.640
[Guest]: who is the Peshwa also a black man, who has a thousand other black people he's purchased.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.680
[Guest]: Malik Ambar then rises slowly, ends up having a small little mercenary force.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.600
[Guest]: And finally, by the end of the 1500s, he becomes the main man standing between the Mughals

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.400
[Guest]: and the conquest of the Deccan.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.680
[Guest]: So several generations before Shivaji, with Shivaji's grandfather as one of his right

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.720
[Guest]: hand men, it was this African man who had adopted India as his home, become a Muslim,

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.720
[Guest]: who was the main problem for the Mughals in terms of conquering the Deccan.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.760
[Guest]: Jahangir, if you read the Jahangir Nama, it's quite fascinating, Jahangir is constantly

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.120
[Guest]: bitching and hating on this man.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.000
[Guest]: He calls him Ambar the ill-starred, Ambar the black-faced, Ambar that disastrous man,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.640
[Guest]: because he can't conquer this man, Ambar is too clever.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.960
[Guest]: And Ambar is the one who develops what is called Bargigiri, guerrilla warfare, which

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.160
[Guest]: is what Shivaji then takes to perfection a few generations later.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.480
[Guest]: And Shivaji therefore, as I said, describes Ambar as brave as the sun in his own Shiva

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.160
[Guest]: Bharata, because Ambar was a legend, he was a remarkable man.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.040
[Guest]: Jahangir was so frustrated with Ambar and his inability to conquer and reduce Ambar

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.640
[Guest]: to nothing, that he commissioned a painting which shows Jahangir shooting an arrow at

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.480
[Guest]: Ambar's severed head, impaled on a spear.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.960
[Guest]: It was something Jahangir never managed to do in real life.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.080
[Guest]: But he fantasized in art what he couldn't achieve in real life.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.920
[Guest]: And Ambar, as it happened, died a very old man in his 80s, comfortable and secure in

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.960
[Guest]: his fortress, undefeated by the Mughals.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.620
[Guest]: So the Deccan was a place where not only Persians, Marathas, Vijayanagar existed, but also thousands

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.960
[Guest]: of Africans who came in.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.680
[Guest]: All of them left their marks on this place.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.200
[Guest]: And many of these people married Maratha women, and many of their descendants would have been

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.760
[Guest]: absorbed into the community.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.240
[Guest]: So it's a mix of all these, not only cultural influences, but also blood from so many places.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.400
[Amit Varma]: And many of us are probably descended from Africans in a more immediate sense than we

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400
[Amit Varma]: think.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I think so.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.880
[Amit Varma]: And just tangential question that occurs to me, how would Shivaji have known about Malik

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Ambar?

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Because you don't have history books, you don't have podcasts, you don't have YouTube.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.000
[Guest]: I mean, family tradition, as I said, Shivaji's father knew Ambar, Shivaji's grandfather was

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
[Amit Varma]: a priest.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
[Guest]: So it's all oral traditions.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
[Guest]: It's only two generations.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
[Guest]: Right.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.680
[Guest]: When your grandfather is closely associated with him, and you commission this.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.360
[Guest]: So Ambar dies in the late 1620s.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.720
[Guest]: And in the 1680s, Shivaji, several decades later, Shivaji commissions the Shivabharata.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.520
[Guest]: Why is Ambar compared to Kartikeya?

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.940
[Guest]: Because Ambar's memory and his legacy is still standing tall.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.200
[Guest]: That's something that clearly inspired Shivaji, for Shivaji to give Ambar such prominence

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.240
[Guest]: in the Shivabharata, which is otherwise a work of eulogy for Shivaji himself.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.960
[Guest]: It's a Sanskrit poem that talks about Shivaji's conquests and adventures.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.120
[Amit Varma]: But Ambar is a very prominent figure there.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:49.720
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of head back now to the Bahmanis again and trace, go all the way to how they

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720
[Amit Varma]: fell.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.960
[Amit Varma]: You talk about like, another bit that fascinated me was the grandsons of Amritsar, Humayun

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.840
[Amit Varma]: the cruel and Hassan.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.760
[Amit Varma]: And you write about how Hassan was made the Sultan, and then the paying crowds gathered

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:06.760
[Amit Varma]: outside Humayun's palace waiting to sort of plunder it.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And then he managed to get out of that and he took power from Hassan and then, quote,

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.800
[Guest]: And he did it very cleverly, he didn't have men with him.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.800
[Guest]: So what did he do?

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.520
[Guest]: He got a holy man to come and stand next to him, because that's a different kind of legitimacy.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.360
[Guest]: And then this crowd sort of backed off when they saw the holy man.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.320
[Guest]: And then he walks all the way to Hassan, who's sitting in the darbar on the throne, walks

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.440
[Guest]: up to him, slaps him, pushes him off the throne and takes a seat on the throne.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.360
[Guest]: This is so hilarious to just picture the scene.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:38.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and then a little Hassan and then you say, quote, Humayun had, quote, Hassan thrown

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.040
[Amit Varma]: before tigers, ordered some of his adherents to be cast into cauldrons full of boiling

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.600
[Amit Varma]: water and oil and release mad elephants and other wild bees to prey upon the unfortunate

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600
[Guest]: victims.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600
[Guest]: Stop, quote.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.960
[Guest]: Yeah, again, as I said, violence displayed and violence used in a very visually ghastly

01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.080
[Guest]: fashion just to sort of reinforce the idea that don't mess with me.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And why mad elephants?

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.240
[Guest]: You mentioned mad elephants, like multiple times, they appear in the sources.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.240
[Guest]: I think mad in the sense that, you know, very aggressive sort of elephants, which will come

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240
[Guest]: and sort of destroy you no matter what.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.440
[Guest]: Otherwise, elephants, if it's a regular elephant that's standing there, why would it come and

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440
[Guest]: trample you?

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.640
[Guest]: You know, so if it has to be done with as much brutality as possible, you need an elephant

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.240
[Guest]: that's really got something going for it.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:27.640
[Amit Varma]: Pissed off, unfed, made to, and then you talk about how Humayun the cruel was stabbed by

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.040
[Amit Varma]: a maidservant, which is also an ignominious way to die, I suppose, for a guy like that.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.880
[Guest]: How did the Bamani Empire come to an end?

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.320
[Guest]: The Bamani Empire came to an end because of the weight of its own internal contradictions.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.600
[Guest]: As I said, at the height of its confidence, absorbing, say, you know, a lot of Persians,

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.720
[Guest]: absorbing the local Maratha element, absorbing culture from Vijayanagara, all that is possible.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And also the Dakhnis, like you pointed out, are basically, they've come from the Turks

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.640
[Guest]: and they're Sunni Muslims.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.960
[Guest]: They're either people who come from the north, but they're essentially Indian in the sense

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.840
[Guest]: that largely the Dakhnis are Sunni Muslims, they're people who've converted within India

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:03.280
[Guest]: and they're considered Hindustani Muslims, whereas the Westerners or the Afakhis, they

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.960
[Guest]: are Shias, largely, who've come in from Persia later.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.240
[Guest]: And the thing is, the Westerners have a little bit of a superiority complex in the Bamani

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.520
[Guest]: court, because as I said, there's this Persian, Persian is considered the latest soft power

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520
[Guest]: asset.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.900
[Guest]: It's very glamorous, etc. compared to which the Dakhnis look a little bit like poor cousins.

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.120
[Guest]: So there's that internal sort of rivalry there.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And would it be correct to say that the language also plays a part?

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.160
[Guest]: So the Persian at that time is like the English of today, the elite speaker.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.200
[Guest]: In fact, Persian was a Persian was diplomatic language till the early 19th century.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.840
[Guest]: And I was stunned when I was working on my first book, letters written by the Maharani

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.560
[Guest]: of Travancore in the 1810s to the British governor, they're in Persian.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.240
[Guest]: It wasn't even in English, it was in Persian, because even the British recognized Persian

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.760
[Guest]: as the international language in this part of the world.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.500
[Guest]: And Persian had therefore great value attached to it.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.900
[Guest]: So therefore, the Persian faction was very influential.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.680
[Guest]: So you have the Persian faction, you have the Dakhni faction, you have the Marathas,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.080
[Guest]: you have the Africans, all of these are groups.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:02.040
[Guest]: So in the end, the contradiction was that if it was a sultan who was confident and broadminded

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:06.000
[Guest]: enough, he was able to take all these people along with him, he could inspire that confidence.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.380
[Guest]: But some sultans made the mistake of playing these groups against each other.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:13.320
[Guest]: So as political power started weakening a little bit, they started being tempted to

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.000
[Guest]: play one group against the other for their own benefit.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.480
[Guest]: So this led to violence between these groups, and slowly the differences started solidifying.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.360
[Guest]: And you know, as I said, this was a military state, and these borders and loyalties are

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360
[Guest]: not constant.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.680
[Guest]: You can easily, you know, one entire group can remove themselves from this court and

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.540
[Guest]: find patronage in the next court.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.120
[Guest]: So in that sense, and different sultans, so within the Bahmani state, by the end of their

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.040
[Guest]: days of glory, as it were, what you have is a weak sultan who doesn't, who can't hold

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.960
[Guest]: all these factions together, and powerful governors.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.080
[Guest]: So the Nizam Shah is converted from a Dakhni, which is a converted Brahmin, and they're

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.520
[Guest]: the first ones to establish an independent kingdom and found the city of Ahmednagar and

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520
[Guest]: so on.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.520
[Guest]: And they become an independent kingdom.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.760
[Guest]: Technically, the Bahmani sultan is maintained for another 40-45 years.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.700
[Guest]: But slowly the power, they're just a cipher, the final Bahmani sultans are reduced to picking

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.760
[Guest]: out the jewels from their crown and selling it, and then picking out things from their

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.340
[Guest]: throne and selling it because they have no money.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.640
[Guest]: Then you have the Adil Shah who realizes, hold on, the kingdom is falling to bits, let

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.040
[Guest]: me also sort of consolidate my little corner somewhere.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040
[Amit Varma]: That's Bijapur, basically.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Bijapur.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.200
[Guest]: The Qutub Shah of Golconda does the same in Golconda.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.720
[Guest]: Although he never proclaims independence, he still carves out his own independent realm.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.980
[Guest]: And you know, he sends a tribute annually to the sultan, but then when that particular

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.560
[Guest]: sultan dies, he stops.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.280
[Guest]: So eventually the sultans are left with nothing.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.960
[Guest]: And the last, it's quite tragic, the last descendant of the Bahmani sultans at the end

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:36.440
[Guest]: of the 1530s is reduced to getting on a ship and going off to Mecca because he has nothing

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440
[Guest]: left here.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.440
[Guest]: He's nobody.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.160
[Guest]: So the Bahmani sultanate essentially disintegrates.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.640
[Guest]: Why do I call them rebel sultans?

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.720
[Guest]: Because the Bahmani sultanate was established by a set of people in rebellion from Delhi

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.360
[Guest]: and it was destabilized by another set of rebels who sort of rebelled against the Bahmani

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.440
[Guest]: sultan, founded their own kingdoms and they were the next generation of rebel sultans

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.440
[Guest]: as it were.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.840
[Guest]: So for about 150 years, the Bahmanis are in charge.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.120
[Guest]: Then you have a second cycle which ends in the late 17th century when successive states

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.680
[Guest]: come into the picture and the Bahmani sultanate disintegrates into five smaller kingdoms.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.560
[Amit Varma]: But each of them very powerful and strong.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's also interesting how sort of that dynasty, the Bahmani dynasty sort of whimpers

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.320
[Amit Varma]: out like the Mughals do almost.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's not like someone beheaded and you become a non-entity.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you just become absolutely nobody.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Let's, you know, now before we talk about those sort of rebel sultans who succeed the

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Bahmani empire, let's talk a bit about Vijayanagara.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Bring me up to speed.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.840
[Guest]: Vijayanagara is going through its own internal issues, which is that unlike the Bahmani state

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.680
[Guest]: which was disintegrated into several pieces, Vijayanagara, you have three dynasties that

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680
[Guest]: come and fall.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.320
[Guest]: So first you have the original dynasty, the Sangama brothers who found Vijayanagara.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.200
[Guest]: They rule for a certain time.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.720
[Guest]: Then you have a short-lived dynasty in the middle, which is a military general who takes

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.120
[Guest]: over and then his son, he dies, his son is sort of kicked out.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.160
[Guest]: And then finally, Krishnadevaraya's dynasty comes to power.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.000
[Guest]: And if the initial ones founded the kingdom, and I think they were largely Shaivites, Krishnadevaraya's

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.040
[Guest]: time is you start seeing more of a Vaishnava influence.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.920
[Guest]: And Vijayanagara at this time, again, as I said, is absorbing all these influences.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.640
[Guest]: It's expanding its boundaries in the south, failing frustratingly when it comes to the

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.400
[Guest]: sultans because the sultans have more technology as far as Vijayanagara is concerned.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.440
[Guest]: And at certain times, the Vijayanagara kings have to pay tribute to the sultans.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.280
[Guest]: Sometimes the sultans have to come and enforce it, but they have to end up paying tribute.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.320
[Guest]: Interestingly, after the splinter states come to power in the northern deck and the Adil

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:36.680
[Guest]: Shahs of Bijapur, the Qutub Shahs in Golconda and the Nizam Shahs in Ahmednagar, Vijayanagara

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.600
[Guest]: then has greater influence because Vijayanagara is still solid.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.920
[Guest]: It's still one big empire.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.360
[Guest]: And then the last, the mistake was that the last emperor of Vijayanagara, and when I say

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.120
[Guest]: last, Vijayanagara survived, but the last main character before the historic battle

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.040
[Guest]: of Talikota in 1565, he starts meddling a little too much in these northern kingdoms.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.480
[Guest]: Now, again, there's no Hindu-Muslim divide here.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.480
[Guest]: So one of the Adil Shahs of Bijapur was adopted by this last emperor of Vijayanagara as his

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.560
[Guest]: own son.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:05.680
[Guest]: As I said, the Qutub Shah, when he had no place in his brother's court, he came and

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.680
[Guest]: lived in exile in Vijayanagara.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.080
[Guest]: There are lots of continuities and commonalities between them, but Vijayanagara starts getting

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.720
[Guest]: tempted a little too much to start playing politics with these people.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.520
[Guest]: And these northern kings realized that, hold on, we're all losing and Vijayanagara is slowly

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.280
[Guest]: gaining at our expense.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.860
[Guest]: So finally, for the one time in history where their survival was threatened, they come together.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:28.120
[Guest]: And of course, this is justified in the name of Islam and all of that, but that's not the

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120
[Guest]: point.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120
[Guest]: The point is politics.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.840
[Guest]: They come together, they decide this is a common enemy.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.440
[Guest]: We may all hate each other, but for the time being, this is our biggest threat.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.600
[Guest]: So, they come to a series of marital alliances where, say, one of the Nizam Shahi princesses,

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.400
[Guest]: the famous Chand Bibi, is given in marriage to the Adil Shah.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.840
[Guest]: Another daughter of the Nizam Shah goes off to the Qutub Shah family.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.600
[Guest]: Similarly, girls are exchanged from those families and they have a new alliance.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.120
[Guest]: And that's when Vijayanagara is finally destroyed in that historic battle in Talikota and the

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.240
[Guest]: city is sacked and taken.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.800
[Guest]: Interestingly, the Sultans don't go out and try and conquer all of Vijayanagara.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.200
[Guest]: Once the city is destroyed, they go back to their capitals.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.920
[Guest]: They gain some territory, but they're not trying to completely, you know, wipe out Vijayanagara

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920
[Guest]: from the map of India.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920
[Guest]: That's not happening.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.600
[Guest]: Vijayanagara is still seen as a legitimate entity.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.360
[Guest]: And you see some of this in the texts as well, where there's this later text called the Rayavachakamu,

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.000
[Guest]: where also you find some Hindu-Muslim polemics, the early beginnings of a certain polemical

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.480
[Guest]: line that starts occurring at this time, where it's written after Krishnadevaraya's time,

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.240
[Guest]: 70-80 years later, but it talks about how, it says how all the Sultans of the Deccan

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.360
[Guest]: are evil, men are being cut into half in the streets, they're all greedy, their own ministers

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360
[Guest]: are scared of them.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.560
[Guest]: Basically, it's compared to the land of death, the Yama's kingdom.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.960
[Guest]: That's how bad the Deccan Sultans are.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.360
[Guest]: Some people interpret this thing, say all these Muslims are so bad and the Hindus are

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.920
[Guest]: clearly saying this is bad.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.960
[Guest]: But the same Rayavachakamu also says the Mughal Emperor is great.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.720
[Guest]: It says the Mughal Emperor is blessed by Kashi Vishwanath.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:58.480
[Guest]: So just as Vijayanagara is blessed by Tirupati, the Gajapati of Orissa is blessed by Jagannath

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.320
[Guest]: of Puri, the Mughals are blessed by Kashi Vishwanath.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.960
[Guest]: So they recognized to make the Deccan Sultans look bad, they play up the Mughals and make

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.960
[Guest]: the Mughals look good.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.160
[Guest]: So again, Vijayanagara wasn't playing a Hindu-Muslim game.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.120
[Guest]: If they were, Bukka, one of the founders of Vijayanagara, who claimed in his inscriptions

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.720
[Guest]: to be Krishna reborn to destroy the Mlecchas, which is the Muslims, he had no issues trying

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.120
[Guest]: to seek an alliance with Feroz Shah Bahmani, saying, okay, you and I'll join hands together

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.200
[Guest]: and I'll come from the south, you come from the north and we'll destroy the Bahmani Sultanate

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.320
[Guest]: in the center.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.640
[Guest]: So again, politics is what guides it.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.280
[Guest]: But Vijayanagara, of course, has its own issues.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.040
[Guest]: You have these coups that are happening in Vijayanagara and so on.

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.680
[Guest]: But finally, of course, it was overstretched, where the last emperor of Vijayanagara played,

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.860
[Guest]: he tried to gamble in a way that didn't quite work out in the way he thought.

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.440
[Guest]: And the Sultanate, instead of breaking away and his divine rule succeeding, they instead

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:49.280
[Guest]: united and they decided to teach Vijayanagara a lesson.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.520
[Amit Varma]: And I think this was partly because, like you point out in the book, he got incredibly

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.600
[Amit Varma]: arrogant, he humiliated the Nizam Shah more than he should have in a particular instance.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.480
[Amit Varma]: And then despite allying with the others to fight with the Nizam Shah, he annexed part

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.240
[Amit Varma]: of the kingdoms and destroyed mosques, destroyed mosques and all annexations would be accompanied

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:12.040
[Amit Varma]: by the destruction of mosques and the humiliation of women and there's an interesting legend,

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.120
[Guest]: which is actually a footnote in the book, which is Chand Bibi's mother, Khunza Humayun,

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.680
[Guest]: which is Hussain Nizam Shah, the one who's at this battle, his wife.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.880
[Guest]: The story goes that, this is from one particular poem from the Ahmednagar court, where Ramaraya,

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.000
[Guest]: the emperor of Vijayanagara demands tribute from Ahmednagar.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.480
[Guest]: And in the list of things that the Nizam Shah should pay, there is a sexually loaded reference

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.800
[Guest]: to Khunza Humayun, the Begum's anklets, saying that, you know, the tribute includes the Begum's

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.240
[Guest]: anklets and Hussain Nizam Shah says, no, I will avenge her honor or whatever.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.800
[Guest]: Again, it's an excuse to justify what was geopolitics.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.860
[Guest]: They essentially wanted to destroy each other anyway.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.080
[Guest]: But it's interesting that a woman appears here at this particular time.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.200
[Guest]: And as it happens, Khunza Humayun is one of those few women that appears in the history

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.120
[Guest]: of the Deccan as a political figure.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.520
[Guest]: And of course, she rules for six years after her husband dies, but then her son and his

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.880
[Guest]: coterie eventually topple her and imprison her and sort of wipe her out to the extent

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.920
[Guest]: that she's not only wiped out of records, she's painted over in paintings, she's reduced

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.320
[Guest]: to this giant blot in paintings where her husband still remains intact, but she's been

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.000
[Guest]: reduced to a smudge in these miniature paintings.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Which brings me down to a question I plan to ask at the end of this, but before we get

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.000
[Amit Varma]: back to the narrative, just to take it up, and you'd mentioned this yourself before is

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.560
[Amit Varma]: how women are viewed in history and how their roles are recorded in history.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.840
[Guest]: It's complicated because, you know, the further back you go in time, you find that most of

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.960
[Guest]: the material is authored by men, which means there's that male gaze.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.680
[Guest]: It's largely about men and their battles.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.560
[Guest]: There are women here and there occasionally, but the voices that tell their story are still

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.560
[Guest]: not female voices.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.560
[Guest]: They are men who often have their own prejudices, their own biases.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.640
[Guest]: They often don't approve of these autonomous, strong women.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.400
[Guest]: So Kunza Humayun, as I was mentioning, she ended up rotting in jail for some 15, 16 years

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.520
[Guest]: before she died.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520
[Guest]: She was wiped out.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520
[Guest]: She was, there was no glory for her.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.360
[Guest]: Her daughter, Chand Bibi survives a little bit in legend and popular imagination, partly

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.780
[Guest]: because Chand Bibi died in the course of the Mughal invasion and she died, she was assassinated.

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.040
[Guest]: So that tragedy therefore allowed her to be enshrined as a sort of martyr.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Before that, she also kind of fought a famous battle, almost taking a man's role and going

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.840
[Guest]: out into the ramparts.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.360
[Guest]: When the Mughals breached the fort, she actually went into the breach and ensured it was reconstructed

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.360
[Guest]: and so on.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.920
[Guest]: So she was a very formidable figure.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.160
[Guest]: The Mughals themselves were in awe of her, but because she died a martyr, as it were,

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.600
[Guest]: died in the course of battle and not on the battlefield.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600
[Guest]: Her own men killed her.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.600
[Guest]: It was an internal job.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.600
[Guest]: But she died violently.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:34.520
[Guest]: There was a certain romance attached to her and romance therefore keeps the story alive.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.800
[Guest]: But a more everyday woman like Khunza Humayun, her mother, who didn't die on the edge of

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.680
[Guest]: a sword in a battle, she didn't die violently.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.140
[Guest]: She tried on an everyday basis to take power.

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:48.040
[Guest]: She tried on an everyday basis to hold power and the men resented that to the extent that

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.160
[Guest]: they wiped her out.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.240
[Guest]: So what happens in history is if you're a woman and you play some sort of romantic,

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.560
[Guest]: poetic role, either as a tragic heroine or some sort of sacrificing mother or whatever,

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.760
[Guest]: then you have a place.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.420
[Guest]: Then your story survives in some ways.

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.160
[Guest]: If you are of interest to the male imagination.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.560
[Guest]: If you're of interest to the male imagination.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.080
[Guest]: But if you're a Khunza Humayun who tries to take charge of those bastions of male power

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.240
[Guest]: and use that and exercise that on an everyday basis, then my God, you're going to be wiped

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.200
[Guest]: out of records, wiped out of paintings, wiped out of everything.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.240
[Amit Varma]: So as a male historian, how do you overcome this?

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.560
[Amit Varma]: Because on one hand, there is a problem that all your sources are written from this male

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560
[Guest]: gaze.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.560
[Guest]: What can you do differently?

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.960
[Guest]: So in my first book, I was lucky in that sense, because it taught me a lot, which is that

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:30.360
[Guest]: my protagonist, my antagonist, they're all women, often the primary material, the letters,

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.360
[Guest]: these are all their letters.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.040
[Guest]: It's women writing, it's their perspective and so on.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.120
[Guest]: But with this, with the second book, Rebel Sultans, because as I said, we're going further

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.880
[Guest]: back in time, the material becomes a problem.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.880
[Guest]: You can consciously try and resurrect these women.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.520
[Guest]: You can consciously try and tell their stories.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.020
[Guest]: But if the material doesn't exist, you can't invent stuff.

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.460
[Guest]: So that is the tragedy in history.

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:55.160
[Guest]: So what I see as the solution is largely more women writing history.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.500
[Guest]: Because although historians are in the task of connecting the dots, as a man or because

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:05.360
[Guest]: most textbooks are written by men, we are taught or trained at some ingrained level

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:09.320
[Guest]: to connect the dots in a certain way, whereas a woman writes history, if more women come

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.320
[Guest]: into history, look at the same material, they will bring a different gaze to it, a gaze

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.680
[Guest]: that has not so far received as much space as it should.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.120
[Guest]: So I'll name Parvati Sharma, who's now written a book on Jahangir or Ira Mukherjee, who's

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.700
[Guest]: written about Mughal women.

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:25.920
[Guest]: And it's fascinating because they bring a completely different perspective to this,

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.280
[Guest]: the same material I would have approached in a certain way.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.920
[Guest]: But because they are women, they bring a completely different angle.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.120
[Guest]: And it's an angle that's been missing for too long.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.440
[Guest]: And it needs to be rectified.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.280
[Guest]: A man can do his best to try and see it from that perspective.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:42.520
[Guest]: But naturally, having more women historians has its own advantages as well.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.160
[Amit Varma]: And on that note, let's get back to your narrative and to our male protagonists.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about how after the Bahmanis fell, how Bijapur and you know, how the different

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.640
[Amit Varma]: rebel sultans, how they evolved in different directions, for example, Bijapur almost seems

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:02.760
[Amit Varma]: to sort of use faith as a weapon of real politic, Yusuf Adil Shah declared Bijapur a Shia state,

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.680
[Amit Varma]: which was also very interesting, because at that point, there was still the pretense of

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.440
[Amit Varma]: the Bahmani Empire going on.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:14.240
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, he had two masters nominally, which is a Bahmani king and the Shah of Iran.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And is this in any way analogous to a dilemma that Muslims face right up to the 20th century,

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.780
[Amit Varma]: where you are part of whatever nation state you're part of?

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:27.680
[Amit Varma]: But you know, like with the Khilafat movement, you saw a dilemma sort of playing out that

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:31.680
[Guest]: you're also part of the larger Qaum, so to say, which is what, you know, right wing Hindutva

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.400
[Guest]: people keep using against Muslims.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.800
[Guest]: What was the great Golwalkar Savarkar argument, which is that, oh, you know, to be truly Hindu

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.800
[Guest]: or Indian, you need to have not only your birth here, your home here, but also your

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.880
[Guest]: place of worship.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.880
[Guest]: This has to be a motherland and your fatherland, which is not the case for Muslims.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.440
[Guest]: If you're bowing to Mecca, which is in a foreign country, then your loyalties are suspect.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.880
[Guest]: And for Muslims, of course, you know, not acknowledging that global aspect of it is

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.880
[Guest]: impossible because, and silly, in fact, it's silly and no, but it's impossible to the idea,

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.000
[Guest]: which is that why must you be either or?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.640
[Guest]: The whole point of this country is there's so much diversity, so much language, so many

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.840
[Guest]: castes, you can be all of it at once.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.960
[Guest]: You can be, you know, a North Indian, I'm a South Indian, but that doesn't make you

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.160
[Guest]: or me less Indian.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.920
[Guest]: I can be at the same time a Malayali.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.280
[Guest]: And this is an example my ex-boss Shashi Tharoor often gives, which is, you can be a good Hindu

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.480
[Guest]: and you can be a good Indian.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.840
[Guest]: You can be a good Malayali and you can be a good Indian.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.320
[Guest]: None of these are in contradiction to each other.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.800
[Guest]: It's okay to have multiple layers of identity.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:32.480
[Guest]: But of course, for the right wing, the fact that Muslims have a non-Indian link as well,

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.860
[Guest]: which is an identity that rises above any one given nation state, that becomes a little

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.080
[Guest]: bit of a problem.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.600
[Guest]: But as I said, that it depends on how you want to look at it, because I don't think

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.840
[Guest]: Indian Muslims are any less Indian because they have a place of worship in Mecca, or

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:50.320
[Guest]: because many of them are descended from people who came from Iran or whatever.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.560
[Guest]: As I said, many, if you come to the South, the oldest Muslim communities have nothing

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.320
[Guest]: to do with these later immigrations.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.760
[Amit Varma]: They've been here for thousands of years.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:00.280
[Amit Varma]: And there's a great hypocrisy inherent in these claims, because these claims are made

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.080
[Amit Varma]: by people who are wearing clothing, which have come from outside, from the Middle East.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.080
[Amit Varma]: They're eating food.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.720
[Amit Varma]: I had a great episode with Vikram Doctor recently about the Indianness of Indian food, about

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.080
[Amit Varma]: how so much Indian food has sort of originated in various different places and are still

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:16.880
[Amit Varma]: nevertheless inherently completely Indian.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.240
[Guest]: Look at Bombay or Mumbai, where we now are, you know, the Ganesh festival just happened.

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.760
[Guest]: You would have seen there were so many marigold flowers that were being used.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.920
[Guest]: Where did the marigold come from?

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:25.920
[Guest]: South America.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.920
[Amit Varma]: It's only a 400, 500 year old flower.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.640
[Amit Varma]: That's the same point Vikram made in the show.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.960
[Guest]: We now use the marigold for all our rituals, but the marigold is not even an Indian flower.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.560
[Guest]: The potato is not Indian.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.520
[Guest]: You know, a lot of these spices that we, the green chillies are not Indian.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.480
[Guest]: You know, South Indians make sambar now with potato and tomato and onion.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.520
[Guest]: These were never there in the old version of sambar.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.560
[Guest]: These are vegetables that came, my grandmother tells me, growing up in the 1930s and 40s,

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.400
[Guest]: they never ate potatoes and onions because they never came there.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.480
[Guest]: Once in a while, you'll see it coming from somewhere else in the country, but most of

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.480
[Guest]: the time it was never eaten.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.840
[Guest]: It was never, the tapioca, if you go to Kerala now, what we call kappa in mean curry, which

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:03.720
[Guest]: is, you know, tapioca with fish, it's considered like a staple quintessential Malayali dish.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.120
[Guest]: Tapioca came to Kerala in the 1880s.

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.120
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard my episode with Doc?

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't think so because he said all of this.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.160
[Amit Varma]: So let's, I think the episode's gone on for a long time.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.360
[Amit Varma]: So let's, we can kind of rush through this portion of history and sort of, so sum up

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.520
[Amit Varma]: for me how this dynamic is playing out, these different rebel sultans after the Bahmani

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Empire in the North Deccan.

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.680
[Amit Varma]: What's really going on?

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.680
[Guest]: What are the dynamics?

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.000
[Guest]: Well, as I said, these are military states.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.800
[Guest]: They have no grand agenda, they have no grand, you know, nationalistic principle, nothing.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.240
[Guest]: It's just that one set of elites is in power, somewhere else, another set of elites is in

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.240
[Guest]: power.

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.640
[Guest]: Lower elites are trying to claim power.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.000
[Guest]: That's what ends up happening.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.160
[Guest]: So the most striking figure is towards the end of the book.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.760
[Guest]: So the book is the subtitle from Khilji to Shivaji.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:51.040
[Guest]: Shivaji is the one where I end the book because what Shivaji is doing is for 400 years, 500

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.440
[Guest]: years, the Deccan's been under Islamic rule.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.120
[Guest]: Now this doesn't mean the Hindus have been displaced.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.900
[Guest]: The best example is this little kingdom called the Garhwal Raj, which was in former princely

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.400
[Guest]: state of Hyderabad.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.280
[Guest]: Now initially they were feudatories or vassals of the Kakatiyas.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.200
[Guest]: Then the Kakatiyas are displaced and the Delhi Sultans come.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.840
[Guest]: They start serving the Delhi Sultans.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:10.840
[Guest]: Delhi Sultans are gone.

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.840
[Guest]: Bahmanis come.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.840
[Guest]: They start serving the Bahmani Sultans.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.840
[Guest]: The Bahmanis are gone.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:17.320
[Guest]: Finally, the Adil Shahs and the Qutub Shahs at various points end up being their overlords.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.840
[Guest]: They sound a lot like the Indian bureaucracy.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840
[Guest]: Yeah, yes.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.200
[Guest]: That's the point I'm making.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.840
[Guest]: Finally they come under the hands of the Nizam of Hyderabad, who was an agent of the Mughal

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.320
[Guest]: Emperor and they survive all the way till 1948.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.040
[Guest]: So something that existed in the 1300s, that same family ruling of the same 1000 square

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.000
[Guest]: miles of territory has continued to rule all the way till 1948.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.440
[Guest]: So the top layer may keep changing and shifting and falling and rising, but just beneath that,

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.120
[Guest]: there aren't that many changes.

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.640
[Guest]: These are all very elite level changes and discussions that are happening.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.000
[Guest]: At the next level, things are pretty much, you know, they're in the hands of the same

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
[Guest]: family Muslims.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.960
[Guest]: Hindus have not been displaced en masse or anything.

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.400
[Guest]: What is interesting with Shivaji is that this Islamicate court culture that evolved in the

01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:01.520
[Guest]: Deccan, a very peculiar blend of part North India, part Persian, part Vijayanagar, all

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.200
[Guest]: of it existed.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.560
[Guest]: Shivaji now wants to go back to a Sanskritized version of kingship.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:12.760
[Guest]: So he consciously starts avoiding Persian words and creates the Raja Vewahar Kosha,

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.000
[Guest]: which is a Sanskrit dictionary, starts writing letters towards the end of his reign in Sanskrit

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.040
[Guest]: to other northern kings because he's trying to construct a new court culture, a new way

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:25.440
[Guest]: of doing politics inspired by Sanskritic Hindu traditions.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.360
[Guest]: So he wants the Rajputs and him and all these Hindu origin people to sort of, you know,

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.920
[Guest]: stick to the Sanskritized version of things rather than the Persianized version of things.

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.960
[Amit Varma]: And would you say this is similar to what happened in the early 20th century, the late

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.800
[Amit Varma]: 19th century, when a lot of these groups tried to take Hindustani and separate Urdu from

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Hindi and build some kind of separate Shuddh Hindi?

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.880
[Guest]: Yeah, that begins in the 19th century, really, where you have this ultra Sanskritized Hindi

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.080
[Guest]: being born and this ultra Persianized Urdu being crafted as a separate thing.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.320
[Guest]: Whereas in reality, they're children of the same mother and that mother was much more

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.520
[Guest]: mixed up than either will admit, but this quest for purity.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.440
[Guest]: So that is largely a result of the colonial intervention as well, that's a later phenomenon.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.720
[Guest]: What's interesting in Shivaji's time, however, is that simultaneously with him in Golconda,

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.480
[Guest]: we have two Brahmin ministers of the Qutub Shah called Madana and Akana and they're brothers.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.220
[Guest]: And one of them refers, talks to a Dutch merchant and he says, oh, look, all these Persians

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.640
[Guest]: coming here, they make their money and their fortunes and they go back because those are

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.640
[Guest]: their fatherlands.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.960
[Guest]: We have only this as our land.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.500
[Guest]: So we are much better in terms of we should be running this place properly.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:31.400
[Guest]: It's interesting because this is almost a Golwalkar-esque, Savarkar-esque argument from

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.800
[Guest]: the 20th century, but we're hearing it in the late 17th century.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.360
[Guest]: So what it indicates is that at the elite level, there was some beginning of an identity

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.880
[Guest]: that was in common, saying that something was missing.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880
[Guest]: There was a sense of loss.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:50.360
[Amit Varma]: And these intellectual strains, therefore, existed from before, it's not like Golwalkar

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.400
[Guest]: and Savarkar sort of, it began with them.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.800
[Guest]: They took it to a completely different level, which is by making more mass.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.840
[Guest]: Why is this mass now?

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.440
[Guest]: Because we've now bought into this idea that the Sanskritic version of Hinduism is the

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.640
[Guest]: version of Hinduism, which is not true.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.320
[Guest]: What happened to lower caste versions of Hinduism?

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.240
[Guest]: What happened to tribal versions of Hinduism?

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.080
[Guest]: You know, there are surveys in South India from 1915, as late as 1915, talking about

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.680
[Guest]: how 80% people in South India did not subscribe to Brahminical gods.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.900
[Guest]: They had their local tree gods and local goddess of smallpox and things like that.

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:24.760
[Guest]: But as education came in, they started Brahminicizing or Sanskritizing and giving up their ancient

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.880
[Guest]: gods and becoming worshippers of Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.440
[Guest]: So this happens simultaneously with that, where you have this mass reinforcement of

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.920
[Guest]: the idea that the faith of the Brahmins is the legitimate form of Hinduism.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.880
[Guest]: Whereas in the earlier phase, what you see is this sense of, I think, what happened is

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.960
[Guest]: that earlier, if you were under Hindu kingdom or a Hindu king, your patronage was limited

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.320
[Guest]: to these elite groups.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.320
[Guest]: With the Muslims, there was competition.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.600
[Guest]: There were these Persians, there were these Africans.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.200
[Guest]: So you weren't quite the top of the chain, as it were.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.280
[Guest]: So that seems to have created a little bit of elite resentment, which is what you see

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.680
[Guest]: in the 17th century.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.760
[Guest]: And Shivaji was definitely, therefore, when he says he's building a Hindavi Swaraj, he

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.680
[Guest]: does therefore play up the idea of that.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.480
[Guest]: But it wasn't something for all Hindus against all Muslims.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480
[Guest]: He employed Muslims.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:11.200
[Guest]: He had Qazis in, you know, the famous episode where Afzal Khan is sent to murder Shivaji.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.560
[Guest]: Now, if you look at it, Afzal Khan versus Shivaji, Muslim versus Hindu.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.360
[Guest]: But look at the people coming with Afzal Khan, Ghorpade.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.440
[Guest]: So Maharashtrian surnames, they're Maratha surnames.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.160
[Guest]: On Shivaji's side, Siddhi Ibrahim, it's a Muslim.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160
[Guest]: Shivaji had plenty of Muslims.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:27.280
[Guest]: He had plenty of Islamic influences in his court as well.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.960
[Guest]: But he looked at power from a Sanskritic position.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.000
[Guest]: And that seems to have begun something.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.680
[Guest]: And simultaneously, you have similar trends in Golconda, which means that at that particular

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.680
[Guest]: juncture, when the Sultanate is starting to collapse, when the Mughals are coming in violently

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.440
[Guest]: from the north, there is this germination of a new sense of elite identity.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.480
[Guest]: I will not say it's a Hindu identity because there was no one broad Hindu community.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.640
[Guest]: For a Brahmin, a Dalit was as alien as a Muslim.

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.240
[Guest]: There was no commonality between them.

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.560
[Guest]: One could argue it's still the same today.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:02.000
[Guest]: I mean, I don't think they see each other as part of the same ecosystem or whatever.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.600
[Guest]: So in that sense, there was something that was being born then.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.600
[Guest]: So I wouldn't agree with many people who say that, oh, you know, communalism is entirely

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.240
[Guest]: a colonial invention.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:16.560
[Guest]: No, at the elite level, there seems to have been some, you know, some sort of minor flavor

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.160
[Guest]: that seems to have been coming in at this particular time, which later assumed bigger

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.960
[Amit Varma]: proportions in the colonial period.

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, reading your book and listening to you now, on one hand, it seems as if, if you look

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.680
[Amit Varma]: below the top layer, if you look below the Sultans and the people in charge, what you

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.800
[Amit Varma]: really have are these vast, really solid waves of history moving, you know, like the same

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.840
[Amit Varma]: bureaucracy serving different empires for hundreds of years, and so on.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.400
[Amit Varma]: And they are as they are.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:48.000
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you also see these powerful individuals like maybe Alauddin Khilji or

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.680
[Amit Varma]: like Shivaji later, who have a huge impact on history just as individuals.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.080
[Amit Varma]: So what do you think of Thomas Carlyle's great man of history kind of the great man theory?

01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.680
[Guest]: See, I think they become great men largely in hindsight, in the sense that we pick and

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.920
[Guest]: choose who we want to highlight, who we want to project more at the cost of whom.

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.320
[Guest]: So as I said, you know, Shivaji dominates the Deccan landscape.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:13.360
[Guest]: The Deccan is often reduced to Mughals versus Shivaji, if you're lucky, otherwise, it's

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.680
[Guest]: only Shivaji, especially in Maharashtra, it's only Shivaji.

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:16.680
[Guest]: He deserves his place in history.

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.000
[Guest]: He's a very charismatic, interesting figure.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.400
[Guest]: But as I said, better historians have done good books on him.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.160
[Guest]: What interested me was, why only him?

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:24.760
[Guest]: There are so many people before him.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.140
[Guest]: Why not Ibrahim Adil Shah II with his Rudrakshan Saraswati love?

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:32.960
[Guest]: Why not Malik Ambar, the African who saved the Deccan for at least two generations from

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:33.960
[Guest]: Mughal conquest?

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:38.080
[Guest]: You know, these are people who also made history, but because they have no political constituency

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.960
[Guest]: now, they've been forgotten.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.240
[Guest]: So the great men of history are also a reflection of our own anxieties, our own insecurities,

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.120
[Guest]: our own sense of what we want to draw from history, rather than what actually happened

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120
[Guest]: in history.

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:53.160
[Guest]: Which is why more and more people, at least with my first book and my second book, the

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.320
[Guest]: idea is to pull these people or pull these stories out of the footnotes and give them

01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.360
[Guest]: the broad audience that they deserve.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.760
[Guest]: Because they don't deserve to merely be a footnote in a larger story of somebody else.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.120
[Guest]: They were actually independent actors in their own right, in their own time, they were the

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.080
[Guest]: main actors and people who made history.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.640
[Guest]: We shouldn't put them into the shadow of any one great man or great woman as such.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.520
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you mentioned Ibrahim Adil Shah II, Ibrahim Adil Shah I died in a very interesting

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:19.760
[Amit Varma]: way, which you described, but basically he fell ill.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And every physician who tried to cure him when they couldn't take his pain away, he

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.580
[Guest]: had them trampled by mad elephants, which then led to a mass exodus of all physicians

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:27.580
[Amit Varma]: from his capital.

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.840
[Amit Varma]: He had no one to treat him and he died, which is a classic mistaking causation for correlation,

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.120
[Amit Varma]: something modern leaders tend to do today as well.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Listen, I've taken a tremendous amount of your time and I would actually have loved

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.320
[Amit Varma]: to go through the whole narrative all the way to Shivaji and beyond.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.400
[Amit Varma]: All I can do is urge readers to read your amazing book because there is a lot more to

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.840
[Amit Varma]: the Deccan than just Shivaji or the Mughals and so on.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.280
[Amit Varma]: On that note, Manu, thanks so much for appearing on The Seed and The Unseen today.

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.280
