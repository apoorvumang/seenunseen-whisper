00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
[Amit Varma]: There are terms we take for granted that perhaps we need to look at closely. One of them is

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.280
[Amit Varma]: art. What is art? How do we define it? Can art only be done by those who have been deemed

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.240
[Amit Varma]: by elites and academics to be artists? Or can anyone do art? Is a five year old kid

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.080
[Amit Varma]: drawing an upside down house and a pink moon creating art? As a guide to thinking about

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.800
[Amit Varma]: this, I recommend an excellent book by Ernst Gombrich, The Story of Art, which begins with

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.720
[Amit Varma]: these words, quote, There really is no such thing as art. There are only artists. Once

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.440
[Amit Varma]: these were men who took colored earth and roughed out the forms of a bison on the walls

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.960
[Amit Varma]: of a cave. Today they buy their paints and design posters for the underground. They did

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.720
[Amit Varma]: many things in between. There is no harm in calling all these activities art, as long

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.480
[Amit Varma]: as we keep in mind that such a word may mean very different things in different times and

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.280
[Amit Varma]: places. And as long as we realize that art with a capital A has no existence. For art

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: with a capital A has come to be something of a bogey and a fetish. You may crush an

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.400
[Amit Varma]: artist by telling him that what he has just done may be quite good in its own way, only

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.320
[Amit Varma]: it is not art. And you may confound anyone enjoying a picture by declaring that what

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.080
[Amit Varma]: he liked in it was not the art, but something different. Stop quote. I agree with Gombrich.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: And I'm glad that we are finally achieving a world in which a small group of elite gatekeepers

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.920
[Amit Varma]: and tastemakers don't get to decide what is art. To hell with them. We don't need them.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.840
[Amit Varma]: We can all be artists if we want.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.640
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Nishant Jain, better known online

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.800
[Amit Varma]: as the Sneaky Artist. I first noticed Nishant when he put up these time-lapse videos of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.040
[Amit Varma]: him sketching people in outdoor locations. Later, I realized that's what is known as

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.480
[Amit Varma]: urban sketching. Then Nishant signed up for my course, The Art of Clear Writing. And along

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.640
[Amit Varma]: with other participants in the course, we have since had many lively discussions on

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.640
[Amit Varma]: what constitutes art and what is this thing called the creator economy. Nishant thinks

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.480
[Amit Varma]: about this new world in counterintuitive ways that are filled with clarity. He does unconventional

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.880
[Amit Varma]: things, but he's thought them through and he's clear about why he's doing them. After

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.080
[Amit Varma]: doing my course, he also started a long form conversation podcast where he speaks to artists

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.880
[Amit Varma]: like himself. And he began an excellent newsletter where he writes about his journey, thinking

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.000
[Amit Varma]: aloud in a sense for all of us. He lives in Vancouver, but he happened to be in India

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.960
[Amit Varma]: in November. So I said, Hey, if you're up for an episode, come to Mumbai. I was kind

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.160
[Amit Varma]: of kidding, but he flew down just for this recording. We had so much to talk about that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.680
[Amit Varma]: we crossed five hours and felt we could have spoken for another five. I love this conversation.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.160
[Amit Varma]: But before you begin listening to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.060
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.800
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.440
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.080
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.520
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.680
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.320
[Amit Varma]: where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.400
[Amit Varma]: the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.080
[Amit Varma]: Nishant, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.200
[Guest]: Hi, Amit. Thank you for having me. I'm both excited and terrified at the same time to

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200
[Guest]: be here.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're a podcaster yourself, you should kind of know this by now that the only

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.440
[Amit Varma]: person who has any business feeling terror is a host because a host has to kind of constantly

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.960
[Amit Varma]: be alert and think about where to take the conversation left when to interject all of

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.000
[Amit Varma]: that. Well, you know, guests just chill and they just kind of chat about stuff. But since

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.900
[Amit Varma]: you are so terrified, let me ask you a sort of unconventional question, which is that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.600
[Amit Varma]: if say Da Vinci or Rembrandt were alive today, would they do what they were doing? Would

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.200
[Amit Varma]: their art be what it was then? Or would they go off into different directions?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.400
[Guest]: That's a really good question. Because what often happens I feel is that when people look

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.800
[Guest]: back at the art of people they admire, they sort of transpose them to the current moment

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.600
[Guest]: doing that same thing. So somebody looks at Rembrandt and decides they want to be a fine

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.920
[Guest]: artist. But Rembrandt was a fine artist of his time and they are trying to be a fine

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.760
[Guest]: artist in the 21st century using the same tools almost. That's a strange decision in

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.760
[Guest]: my in my opinion. So I don't know much about the background of these people and how they

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.280
[Guest]: came to be artists, whether they went through formal education, but they were alive in a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.760
[Guest]: time of great discovery. And they were leaders of various movements, artistic visions and

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.760
[Guest]: ideas. So how I would like to think of it is that they would be using all the technologies

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.400
[Guest]: they could because that's what they did. Then people used technologies like camera obscura

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.880
[Guest]: as soon as those were available to them too much criticism, that this is not real art.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.760
[Guest]: And a lot of great artists have faced this criticism in their time that what they are

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.280
[Guest]: doing is not real art. And it is only in retrospect centuries later that we are looking at their

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.400
[Guest]: work and now giving it the title of real art and trying to imitate that in the same way

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.340
[Guest]: today. So I feel like somebody like Da Vinci for sure would have a TikTok channel. And

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.080
[Guest]: you would see you would see NFTs from a number of them and all kinds of because these are

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.160
[Guest]: people excited by the future. So I had a guest in on my podcast sometime back and we were

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.920
[Guest]: talking about we were talking about the things that people make as subjects. So I speak to

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.160
[Guest]: urban sketches on my podcast. And one of my consistent questions to them comes from the

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.120
[Guest]: fact that urban sketches come from a very diverse set of backgrounds. Anybody is an

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.660
[Guest]: urban sketcher, if they simply take a sketchbook, and they walk around that town and they draw.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.080
[Guest]: So I'm always curious to know, what is it that makes you draw? What about your city

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.960
[Guest]: do you look at that gets you interested? So what are the subjects that excite you? And

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.880
[Guest]: why? And this is something I tried to find out through these conversations I have, he

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.240
[Guest]: broached the subject of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. And the idea was that these guys painted

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.080
[Guest]: landscapes and rural landscapes and windmills and things like this, we might look at that.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.520
[Guest]: And inculcate a romantic notion of pastoral rural life and think that this is what we

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.720
[Guest]: should do. Real artists paint windmills and old buildings and that's what we should do.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.120
[Guest]: But windmills were the latest technology of Rembrandt's time. The farming scenes that

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.580
[Guest]: Van Gogh was painting were happening outside his home. This was modern life for him. So

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.440
[Guest]: somebody like Rembrandt painting windmills is like someone like me going to Silicon Valley

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.800
[Guest]: and making a drawing of Googleplex, or finding Elon Musk and drawing a portrait of Elon Musk

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.360
[Guest]: and not of some other thing which is informed by an aesthetic that is two centuries or three

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.640
[Guest]: centuries old. So it's kind of difficult to think about what someone would precisely do.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.160
[Guest]: But the easier route is to think about the motivations that they had in the time that

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.040
[Guest]: they were alive, and how those motivations can be the same for us today in the time that

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.480
[Amit Varma]: we are alive. That's a great point. So I have a couple of

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.680
[Amit Varma]: related thoughts. I'll just voice them and tell me what you feel about them. And thought

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.800
[Amit Varma]: number one is this, that the population of Warsaw today is probably more than all of

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Europe at the time Da Vinci was alive. And therefore, just looking at it in a crude statistical

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.320
[Amit Varma]: way, you would assume that the distribution of artistic talent is as much if not even

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.040
[Amit Varma]: better. And I say better because you have much more exposure to art, you have that entire

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.360
[Amit Varma]: body of centuries of art, which you can look back on and learn from, if not consciously,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.600
[Amit Varma]: then at least sort of imbibe it without realizing. And also we have far better technology available

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.920
[Amit Varma]: to us. So my assumption would be that in a modern times, with so many more people, which

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.440
[Amit Varma]: by the way, is a bloody good thing. Population is not a problem. It's a greater strength

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.280
[Amit Varma]: that in these modern times, with so many more people, with so much better technology, with

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.480
[Amit Varma]: so much better exposure to art, my assumption would simply be that we should get art of

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.360
[Amit Varma]: a much higher quality than in days past. And I think this is happening, but I think it

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.920
[Amit Varma]: is happening in ways that are unseen by us. I think that what is most likely happening

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.880
[Amit Varma]: is that we are so inundated by all kinds of music and sound and visuals and all of that,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.800
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of stuff just falls by the wayside, that there is a great danger today to be lost

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.080
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps lost forever. Like I remember there was this thread on Twitter a while back,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.920
[Amit Varma]: which I think Roshan Abbas had pointed me to, which was about Billy Joel, that when

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.080
[Amit Varma]: Billy Joel's Piano Man came out, it sank basically, and the record label was just not going to

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.600
[Amit Varma]: print anymore. And it was a done thing and he wasn't going to do any more records and

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.160
[Amit Varma]: that's it, the guy was over. Till one random enthusiast decided that no, this is such

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
[Amit Varma]: an amazing album, it has to be heard. And he himself took it around to all the radio

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.320
[Amit Varma]: stations saying that please play this, which in the early 70s was how you made a mark by

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.520
[Amit Varma]: being played at a radio station. And finally, he made the deal with the RJ of a big radio

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.300
[Amit Varma]: station that there was some kind of quid pro quo, but basically, I'll give you something

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.360
[Amit Varma]: that you want if you kind of play this and that guy played it. And you know, what happened,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.120
[Amit Varma]: happened. And similarly, I remember this old video by Rick Beato, the music YouTuber, where

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.040
[Amit Varma]: he talks about how during his lifetime, Bach was unknown. You know, he was a marginal figure.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And then in the decades after his death, you had this kind of Bach Renaissance and today

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.200
[Amit Varma]: he's a great figure he is. And the truth is that number one, there are possibly many people

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.920
[Amit Varma]: like that today we don't recognize, but future generations might. But also that there is

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.200
[Amit Varma]: a danger that a lot of people are A, getting lost, and B, that we aren't adequately appreciative

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.320
[Amit Varma]: of the quality of art out there that we're looking at past centuries. And of course,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.120
[Amit Varma]: we should admire pioneers of the past, like Da Vinci and Rembrandt for everything they

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.660
[Amit Varma]: did and everything they stood for. But we are probably closing our eyes to a lot of

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.760
[Amit Varma]: incredible art that is already out there. And some of us may even be sort of looking

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.880
[Amit Varma]: down on it with this knobbish thing, that this is not on the canvas, therefore it is

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.200
[Amit Varma]: not art. Looking down on new media, like for example, TikTok, if there is a Da Vinci on

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.400
[Amit Varma]: TikTok today, obviously, he's not being regarded as a Da Vinci of TikTok, which is sad.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: Well, the question of regarded implies who is doing the regarding. So this is the great

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.400
[Guest]: liberation of today, right? Like, when we think of Da Vinci's time, or we think even

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.480
[Guest]: 50, 60 years back, let's say, there is a certain group of people who have the privilege

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.360
[Guest]: to be able to regard and then give value to someone's art. They own galleries, or they

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.860
[Guest]: own auction houses, and they get to decide, okay, art and okay now, and therefore you

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.280
[Guest]: become an artist. So these people come through the cracks, music industry, all even film

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.800
[Guest]: industry, everything, because of those gatekeepers. And gatekeepers is a pejorative term, but

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.480
[Guest]: they were, they would see themselves as curators, they are the ones preserving and proliferating

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.860
[Guest]: a movement. So it is a very noble job to do none very true. But when you say something

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: like say, Da Vinci today, on TikTok, today's Da Vinci not being regarded, I would counter

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.720
[Guest]: that with saying that there is no need for them to be regarded. Someone like him on and

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.840
[Guest]: there are hundreds like him on TikTok. And the beauty of today's time is that we can

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.200
[Guest]: find each of those hundreds of people. When I think of the 1600s and 1700s, I think of

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.080
[Guest]: how many people perhaps died remaining unknown their whole lives, their paintings lost to

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:23.400
[Guest]: us because the geographic location of where they lived, made getting access to a gallery

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.920
[Guest]: difficult, made getting access to an elite patron difficult. If you don't have an elite

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.920
[Guest]: patron, your paintings don't last 200 years later for them to be seen, and then to be

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.200
[Guest]: discovered again further and put in museums and you to become a name. So there are so

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.440
[Guest]: many geniuses who simply by not having the right set of circumstances around their work

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.760
[Guest]: could not become big names. And today, all of those things have been shattered in lots

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:54.120
[Guest]: of different ways. Today, it is possible for an artist to be known and to earn the value

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.360
[Guest]: of their work in their time. And you don't need to have a situation like Vincent van

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.960
[Guest]: Gogh and somebody being appreciated after their death, somebody committing suicide out

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.640
[Guest]: of the lack of appreciation for their work. So when we talk about this thing of things

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:16.040
[Guest]: getting drowned, so I always think about music because I have grown around good music. Music

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.200
[Guest]: has been a very deep part of my life always. And I have sort of gone backwards in time

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.920
[Guest]: in my appreciation of music. I started off when I was a young teenager, I wanted the

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.640
[Guest]: music of my time, Green Day was big for me, Bryan Adams was big for me. And every year

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.720
[Guest]: since then, I would go another decade back. And until I came to settle on even music from

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.480
[Guest]: the 20s and 30s, and like jazz and old blues, and that became my music. And how I think

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.160
[Guest]: of it is that somebody might look at my choice of music and say, you don't even listen to

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.480
[Guest]: pop music. I have never heard a Taylor Swift song, for example, I wouldn't be able to tell

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.560
[Guest]: her voice apart from some of the other big pop stars of today. What does that mean? Does

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.560
[Guest]: that mean should I feel that the kind of music I like is being drowned out by the pop music

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.880
[Guest]: of today? This again implies that there is one pyramid to climb, and that you have to

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.960
[Guest]: be the top of this pyramid, otherwise you are nothing. And this has been true for centuries,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.600
[Guest]: that there is one pyramid or two pyramids, you have to be top of the pops, or you are

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.100
[Guest]: nothing. The doors get on this TV show, and they get to perform live or they are nothing.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.800
[Guest]: But that's not the case today, right? Like you can exist within your own ecosystems,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.600
[Guest]: all of these musical genres have their own ecosystems within which they thrive. Jazz

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.400
[Guest]: is alive today, there is more incredible jazz today than there was in the 30s, 40s, 50s,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:44.400
[Guest]: 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s. This year has the most jazz. This year has more people appreciating

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.360
[Guest]: Bach than ever before in history. This year has more people appreciating Da Vinci than

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.680
[Guest]: ever before in history. So our notions of what is being drowned out is, I feel like

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.000
[Guest]: it is a function of this old idea that there is one pyramid. And if you are not on the

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.200
[Guest]: top of that one pyramid, which is incidentally driven by corporations who want to sell certain

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.400
[Guest]: things, and who want to prop up certain musicians, I answer the pop music question by simply

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.000
[Guest]: saying pop music is one thin layer on top of what is music. All the music of the whole

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.320
[Guest]: world, all the centuries of it is accessible to me today. Why does it matter that I didn't

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.480
[Guest]: listen to an album that came out in 2021? What makes it special compared to an album

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.320
[Guest]: that came out in 1970 that I also haven't heard that I might be curious about? Because

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.360
[Guest]: now I am in my world of discovery, my ecosystem, through which I go to YouTube to access some

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.160
[Guest]: of it. I go to Instagram to access my art. I go to another place to access videos and

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.880
[Guest]: music and things. Spotify tells me about music from the 30s and 40s, just as it tells me

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:59.820
[Guest]: about music from 2021. So these races, almost, of who is on top is increasingly irrelevant.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.400
[Guest]: It has helped me to think like this as an artist myself, to consider these things as

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.160
[Guest]: relevant, because it has helped me to do more work. And it has helped me to make peace as

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.320
[Guest]: a creator, this feeling that you are being drowned out by other things, the understanding

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.960
[Guest]: that we are not in a single race anymore, as listeners, as readers, and as writers and

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960
[Amit Varma]: as musicians.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.200
[Amit Varma]: That's so well put many different races to run and sort of a sideways sort of angle before

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.680
[Amit Varma]: we continue with the line we embarked upon, which is, you know, you mentioned about how

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.880
[Amit Varma]: in Da Vinci's time or Rembrandt's time, they are the guys who got lucky enough to get noticed

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.080
[Amit Varma]: to find a patron to be geographically in the right place. And there's another aspect of

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.540
[Amit Varma]: this, which is, at one level, of course, you're lucky enough to get noticed. So you're noticed.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.160
[Amit Varma]: But at another level, if you're not noticed, what is also happening is you're not iterating,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.680
[Amit Varma]: you're not improving your art, you're not getting better and better. You know, even

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.120
[Amit Varma]: canvases are expensive back in the day, somebody who could have been a great artist, never

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.640
[Amit Varma]: even gets close to that, because he's not painting enough canvases, because of course.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.280
[Guest]: So there's this artist I really admire, and he died of the Spanish flu almost exactly

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.560
[Guest]: 200 years ago, Egon Schiele, and he died in his 20s. And I saw his work in a museum. And

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.340
[Guest]: this was the first time that I also read about his life. So it was a chronological collection

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.220
[Guest]: of his work next to incidents of his life. And one of those incidents was about how he

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.720
[Guest]: went to I think some in the hills of Switzerland, to find a blue color. Wow. There's no art

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.200
[Guest]: supply store to go into and get a full palette of colors. You want a particular shade, you

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.400
[Guest]: have to source those things from a part of the world where that color is made.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.120
[Amit Varma]: That's insane. You know, this brought to mind, like yesterday, I saw this video of this guy

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.160
[Amit Varma]: called Puneet Superstar. Have you heard of Puneet Superstar? I have not. Neither had

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.200
[Amit Varma]: I till yesterday. We are recording this in 23rd November, right? Episode will sort of

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.680
[Amit Varma]: broadcast later. So Puneet Superstar is this guy who's apparently very big on TikTok and

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Instagram and all that. And there was a time where he was putting out guess how many videos

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.840
[Amit Varma]: in a day? It's obviously a high number, because I'm asking you but guess.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Three, four? No, keep guessing. Eight?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.480
[Amit Varma]: There was a day he put out 500 videos. Five?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.440
[Amit Varma]: He was just sitting with his phone, turning it on himself, record clip after clip, put

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.740
[Amit Varma]: it up, right? Massive volume. He's made more than one and a half lakh videos. He said in

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.320
[Amit Varma]: his early days, it was disheartening, because he was getting three, four likes per video.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.040
[Amit Varma]: And his family was like, what are you doing, son? In fact, even one uncle, like he had

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.480
[Amit Varma]: called himself, I forget the exact term for it, but basically useless, unemployed, the

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Hindi for it. And his uncle had told him, what are you doing? Why don't you see this

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: thing called TikTok? Why don't you make videos? So he started making videos. And after a week,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.480
[Amit Varma]: his uncle was what the fuck are you doing? You know, what is this? That you're just putting

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.280
[Amit Varma]: three likes, two likes per video, probably his own likes, but he continues.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.840
[Amit Varma]: And eventually a video goes viral, which in his terms is like 1500 views. And then he

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.320
[Amit Varma]: stays stable at that level. And then he hits another level. And today, apparently, people

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.520
[Amit Varma]: pay him to record personalized birthday messages for him. So in a day, he'll do like 30 personalized

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.400
[Amit Varma]: birthday messages. And the manner of that, and again, I've seen him speaking about this,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.280
[Amit Varma]: I haven't even seen any of those videos, I'm entering a rabbit hole of Puneet superstar

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.840
[Amit Varma]: soon. But apparently, what he does is he'll take a cake, he'll take a separate cake for

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.560
[Amit Varma]: each guy. And he'll wish the guy and smash it on his face. So he speaks about the process

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.880
[Amit Varma]: of then wiping off all of the previous cake and before he smashes the next cake, 500 cakes

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.980
[Amit Varma]: a day, not 500 cakes a day, it must be less than that 15-20 cakes for whoever he wishes

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.000
[Amit Varma]: happy birthday to. If they make special requests, he'll give them more. So one guy apparently

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.240
[Amit Varma]: said, don't do it with cake, do it with chowmein. And I'll give you 500 bucks more. So then

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.680
[Guest]: he went out and bought some chowmein and did it with the chowmein. This is approaching

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.520
[Amit Varma]: some sadism territory though. But the guy's making money. It's an interesting way for

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.240
[Amit Varma]: a creator. And the thing is, the buggers iterate. Like I keep telling people that quantity

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.320
[Amit Varma]: leads to quality, keep doing, keep doing, keep doing. But I'm not sure I would say that

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.000
[Guest]: for 500 videos a day. There is a market for this kind of thing, you know, what's happening

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.760
[Guest]: is that not only are you creating video content, but you're inviting your viewership to contribute

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.720
[Guest]: to the creation. Yeah, you are giving them a reason to talk to you to reply to you. Maybe

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.640
[Guest]: if he has a live stream, then they can tell him something to do right then. So a lot of

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.200
[Guest]: creative technology, and it's a little controversial to say, but a lot of creative technology and

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.680
[Guest]: online individual creator technology benefits from the pornography industry. And that has

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.040
[Guest]: given us handicaps that has given us independent micro payments that has given us all these

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.960
[Guest]: platforms that Twitch and everything thrives upon. Like the reason why video streams are

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.960
[Guest]: possible today is because the there was a market in porn for it. I mean, a lot of the

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.200
[Guest]: intimate creator economy is kind of driven by only fans as well. So exactly. And only

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.360
[Guest]: fans works on this platform. And it has like it's taken huge leaps since the pandemic because

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.720
[Guest]: so many people lost conventional income streams of live streaming things. Well, there are

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.280
[Guest]: different degrees of how intimate and how explicit things get. But the fundamental concept

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.560
[Guest]: of somebody feeling like they matter, that somebody that they watch on video is responding

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.800
[Guest]: to them in a sense, and the value that that has, what's happening now is there is a phase

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.560
[Guest]: when ideas are skeuomorphic, not only in format, but even in the mentality of what is the idea,

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.360
[Guest]: what is the product, a drawing is a drawing that I sell physically. Otherwise, it is a

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.960
[Guest]: drawing that somebody sees digitally. But the idea that the making of the drawing could

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.920
[Guest]: be the product. If I live stream a drawing, then people would pay money just to watch

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.320
[Guest]: me draw. And people might pay money simply because I live in a part of the world that

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.440
[Guest]: they can never otherwise access and actually watch over my shoulder. So the technology

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.520
[Guest]: is making possible this interaction between us. And therefore it has value because it

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.320
[Guest]: is otherwise impossible. So this is as things evolve, as we get more into it, you get these

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.840
[Guest]: very digital native ideas of what is a product and what has value. And it's super interesting.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.240
[Guest]: Like young people are better positioned to do this because they are digital natives.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.320
[Guest]: And I think it's a fan like all creatives, all creators should look at what the youngest

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:13.400
[Guest]: person they can find is doing and apply their creative ideas to making that work in their

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
[Amit Varma]: favor.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, both of us benefit from being at a point where things

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.320
[Amit Varma]: have changed in a particular direction. Like, of course, 12 years ago, or more than a decade

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.800
[Amit Varma]: ago, Kevin Kelly wrote this great essay 1000 fans. And just to kind of summarize for my

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.680
[Amit Varma]: listeners Kelly's thrust there was that artists no longer need to scale like earlier, if you

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.380
[Amit Varma]: were a musician, you'd need to be, you know, make it to the top people at the top make

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.400
[Amit Varma]: a lot of money, not so much for everybody else. But his point was in the new age artists

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.800
[Amit Varma]: will no longer need to scale. If you just find 1000 true fans who are say paying you

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.760
[Amit Varma]: $100 a year, that's $100,000 a year, that's that's extremely healthy. And you can get

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:55.040
[Amit Varma]: by on that. And something that both you and I have seen where it's no longer so important

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.040
[Amit Varma]: to get into the mainstream, even if there is a mainstream at all, which is why what

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.560
[Amit Varma]: you said about the da Vinci of tick tock, not needing that kind of large audience is

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.080
[Amit Varma]: absolutely true. He's got 1000 or more likely 100,000 true fans. And that's perfectly fine.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.040
[Amit Varma]: And thinking aloud, it also strikes me that that is not only a fantastic shift from a

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.300
[Amit Varma]: creator's point of view. It's also a very interesting shift from the consumer's point

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.760
[Amit Varma]: of view, like much as you and I are creators, we're also consumers. And a lot of the stuff

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.400
[Amit Varma]: that I consume is stuff that I feel an intimate connection with, like there will be podcasts

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.880
[Amit Varma]: I listen to like Russ Roberts doing his thing, or, you know, Tyler Cowen show, or hardcore

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.640
[Amit Varma]: history, which is so incredible, where it's not like you're listening to something broadcast

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.520
[Amit Varma]: to you, but you actually witnessed you're sitting with a couple of friends, people often

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.160
[Amit Varma]: say this about my show, that I felt I was sitting on a sofa and you and your guests

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.520
[Amit Varma]: are just sitting and talking and I'm just listening in, which is incredible because

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.640
[Amit Varma]: it fosters a sense of intimacy. Like earlier, your artists were at a plane removed from

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.600
[Amit Varma]: you, you know, like Amitabh Bachchan had temples made for him. So they were at a plane removed,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.760
[Amit Varma]: they are larger than life. Today, you are so much smaller than that you are life itself,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.120
[Amit Varma]: you're right there, you're next to the guy, you when you if you accidentally meet him,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.600
[Amit Varma]: you feel like you actually know the person which is what many, you know, listeners of

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.520
[Amit Varma]: the podcast sometimes tell me, except that they wonder why am I speaking like a retard

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.280
[Amit Varma]: at half the speed because they listen at double speed. So that apart, what is your sense of

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.640
[Amit Varma]: this of the kind of art you consume and the liberation that this realization must have

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640
[Guest]: brought you?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:29.160
[Guest]: Yeah, so I grew up in the 90s. And I was 10 years old when I first went on the internet

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.440
[Guest]: with the dial up connection and everything. And instantly this opened up a world like

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.600
[Guest]: immediately there was the idea that you can have online friendships, there were these

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.420
[Guest]: chat rooms and this idea that you can talk to somebody. So you can get something from

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.560
[Guest]: somebody that you've never met. And there was no money in these ideas initially. So

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.480
[Guest]: I look a little nostalgically back on those times, because what that meant was, because

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:59.600
[Guest]: there is no idea of it being financially feasible or financially profitable. Everything was

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.000
[Guest]: sincere. Only somebody who really, really cared about a subject wrote about a subject

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Guest]: there was no incentive to have disinformation, for example, because why what will how will

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.120
[Guest]: it help? There's no political angle to it, there's no money to be made. So somebody writing

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.920
[Guest]: about history, the only reason they would do it is because they honestly actually love

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:23.520
[Guest]: this subject, or politics or art or whatever. So there was this native sort of niceness

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.320
[Guest]: about the internet in its early form in that sense. So what I have often felt is that I

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.720
[Guest]: have learned so many things from being on the internet. And what that has done to me

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.960
[Guest]: as a consumer of the written word of music of videos, all art and all these things, is

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.920
[Guest]: that it has empowered me in so many ways, I would always draw when I was young. But

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.280
[Guest]: I used to think that I'm not good at it, because I can't draw from imagination. I was always

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.200
[Guest]: even when I was super young, very good at looking at something and drawing. And I used

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:02.280
[Guest]: to think that that is not art. This is copying. I can't draw I can copy. So I would dismiss

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:08.280
[Guest]: my abilities like this and think he moved in India. But so from watching people do this

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.640
[Guest]: thing and watching people put out content, which is not that simple idea of this is art,

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.720
[Guest]: you know, that singular definition art means a finished painting with all this level of

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.760
[Guest]: detail with all this like huge canvas with all these tools and supplies that I will never

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.240
[Guest]: own like oil paints and big brushes. So I can't make art. But then I saw this webcomic,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:36.680
[Guest]: I saw xkcd. And xkcd is this webcomic with just lines and just stick figures. And it

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:43.120
[Guest]: made me feel things it made me feel think about ideas, it made me think about love and

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.960
[Guest]: math and science, which are the various subjects that that webcomic is about. And I could see

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:53.400
[Guest]: that it's instantly connecting so easily with me and I am geographically so far away from

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:59.160
[Guest]: this person's world. And so it has to be similarly connecting with so many 1000s of people. And

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.920
[Guest]: it's just stick figures. And that was the first time that I distinctly remember that

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:10.360
[Guest]: a piece of content on the internet gave me permission. And this idea of permission is

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.080
[Guest]: very dear to my life, because I feel like I have always been a contrarian who does not

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:21.680
[Guest]: seek permission. But even that idea is on the surface, like deep inside, I feel all

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.280
[Guest]: of us need permission from various forces in our life to do anything. And we seek it

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.520
[Guest]: from peers, we seek it from people who inspire us, let me do something, tell me I can do

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.600
[Guest]: something, show me how I can also do something. I saw the stick figure comic and I told myself,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.000
[Guest]: you know, I don't know how to draw, but I can also make a webcomic. And I started to

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.560
[Guest]: make a webcomic. And I started to make a webcomic just like xkcd. I would talk about my life

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.640
[Guest]: though. But just like him, I would draw three times a week and publish it. And it became

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:57.280
[Guest]: a thing. And I got into this idea that I can put my drawings on the internet, which are

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.120
[Guest]: not very good. I don't know how to draw really. But I can be funny about it. Because I've

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: always been putting writing on the internet. I'd been a blogger for about five years before

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: then. And this is another thing that I took permission on. There was a Telegraph article

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.920
[Guest]: Telegraph in Calcutta, with the title of weblogs, this new thing that has happened. And there

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:22.200
[Guest]: is a blogosphere on the internet. And that reading that gave me the permission to put

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.320
[Guest]: my writing online. Hey, I don't need to be any blight and or I don't need to be Arthur

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.360
[Guest]: Conan Doyle, I can just write and I get to hit a publish button. What an empowering feeling

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.480
[Guest]: that I get to do that. Who am I, I get to do it. I started a weblog, a blog. And I started

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.640
[Guest]: blogging religiously. And five years later, I started a webcomic. And I had the right

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.160
[Guest]: to do that somebody gave me the permission to do that. And this is what content on the

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.360
[Guest]: internet is to me. No matter what I consume, no matter what someone else consumes, whether

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.800
[Guest]: you enjoy it or not, it gives you this, it empowers you, you get to appreciate it. And

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.960
[Guest]: you know that your appreciation has value to that person who is seeking it from you.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.960
[Guest]: Even the idea that I have the right to appreciate something, who am I to appreciate something

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:14.120
[Guest]: who am I to say that this person is an artist, don't gallery owners get to decide those things.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.720
[Guest]: But now on the internet, I get to decide that my like button matters. If I upload a video

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.600
[Guest]: on YouTube, that person becomes a more consistent YouTuber, I help to do that. So it is empowerment

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.040
[Guest]: on all ends of the spectrum handed out to every average internet user. It's been just

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.280
[Amit Varma]: amazing for me the last 15 years of doing this, the point to make about who is an artist

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.640
[Amit Varma]: and this permission that we need is so true, like something that I discussed on an episode

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.200
[Amit Varma]: I recorded recently, though I don't know whether it will release before or after this one probably

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.720
[Amit Varma]: before and I would have said it is with Annapurna Garimela, the art historian and we were kind

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.440
[Amit Varma]: of discussing how, you know, a lot of fine art through the ages, the problem that I have

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.400
[Amit Varma]: with it and by fine art, I mean, you know, painted canvases and all of that is that it's

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.240
[Amit Varma]: restricted to the elites, you know, you have a bunch of elite gatekeepers at a particular

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.400
[Amit Varma]: point in time, who may be in the throes of particular ideologies or beliefs or politics

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.680
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, they decide what is good and what is not they decide who is an artist and

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:19.200
[Amit Varma]: who is not they create this distinction between art is this and the rest is craft or whatever.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I've actually had artists, fine artists here in India talking to me about,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, referring to something a famous critic wrote about their work saying that

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.920
[Amit Varma]: I don't know, none of that was in my head when I made it. But he's seen something that's

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.200
[Amit Varma]: not there. And and to kind of, you know, get past that elitism to make those gatekeepers

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.560
[Amit Varma]: irrelevant is pretty fantastic to me. And just speaking of forms, like I remember, like

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.360
[Amit Varma]: I was one of the early bloggers here. And when I started blogging, the great part of

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.840
[Amit Varma]: it was that, like I was a mainstream journalist, but it freed me from the necessity of following

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.520
[Amit Varma]: the news cycle that you have to write about what is newsworthy. It freed me from dictates

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.200
[Amit Varma]: of style, what the house style in a place might be, so I could find my own voice. And

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.440
[Amit Varma]: most of all, it freed me from formats, right, you know, the 800 word article, and we used

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.640
[Amit Varma]: to think in fixed formats, like a writer would think that an article has to be 800 words,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.560
[Amit Varma]: a book is 100,000 filmmakers would think that all Hollywood film is, you know, 190 minutes

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.160
[Amit Varma]: or a Bollywood film is three hours, and you're stuck to those formats. And today, over time,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.880
[Amit Varma]: and even it took even me a while to realize this, even after I had blogged a lot and all

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.840
[Amit Varma]: of that, that today, that thinking is outdated. Like you said, skeuomorphic, and skeuomorphic,

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.040
[Amit Varma]: by the way, is a design term. And what it means is that when you're working in a new

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.920
[Amit Varma]: format, to make it familiar to people who've used the old format, you reproduce some of

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.160
[Amit Varma]: those motifs, even though you don't have to. So for example, I think Apple had an eReader

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.920
[Amit Varma]: once, and they made it look like a bookshelf, you know,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.320
[Guest]: or you can think of a music processing app like GarageBand having the same knobs, but

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.320
[Guest]: digital knobs, digital knobs, exactly, I used to the physical knob. So they translate, whereas

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.680
[Guest]: you don't need a knob anymore, because it's just moving your finger on a screen.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.960
[Amit Varma]: It's moving. Yeah, yeah, that's fantastic. And a time will come when even people who've

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.200
[Amit Varma]: never used a physical knob will still be, you know, will think knobs are something because

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.720
[Guest]: if you think about I think the easiest example of skeuomorphic stuff is icons that we use.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.520
[Guest]: So the use of the classical staff notation as the music icon, who recognizes that like

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.880
[Guest]: most people today don't, but that instinctively means music to us. And we know what's being

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.840
[Guest]: talked about, or even the folder icon on the desktop. And so in interesting observation

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.100
[Guest]: on that, like I was just reading this article about how somebody was talking about college

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:37.720
[Guest]: professors were speaking to design students about this idea of just a file organization.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.960
[Guest]: And the new students have no concept of it. They don't understand what you mean by C drive,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.800
[Guest]: then doing a docs folder, then another folder, because the way we use our phone, the way

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.980
[Guest]: we use these devices like iPad and things like tablets and things. So the idea of organizing

00:32:53.980 --> 00:33:00.360
[Guest]: information in folders and directories with references is an older idea. And the idea

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.000
[Guest]: today is that everything is sort of like a big bag. I put it in and when I need it, there's

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.160
[Guest]: a find function that finds it for me. Why should I know where exactly what does it mean?

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.600
[Guest]: What does it matter where exactly it is located and cataloging something like that is already

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.360
[Guest]: a skeuomorphic idea.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.560
[Amit Varma]: That's really interesting, because I use Rome research to take my node that is based on

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.160
[Amit Varma]: this old German system called Zettelkasten. Forgive me if I pronounce it wrong. That again

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.960
[Amit Varma]: doesn't have like a folders concept, though you can have it you have nested entries and

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.920
[Amit Varma]: you could think of each category there is a folder, but you also have bidirectional

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.960
[Amit Varma]: linking and you can get to any part of your repository from any other part. So that's

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.740
[Amit Varma]: kind of interesting. Let's now go back to where I normally start my episodes by talking

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.880
[Amit Varma]: about somebody's personal life. Like you are a Marwari from Calcutta who did engineering

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.400
[Amit Varma]: and build race cars. So tell me a little bit about your journey. Specifically, you mentioned

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.680
[Amit Varma]: you grew up in the 90s, presumably in Calcutta and all of that. Tell me what were those years

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.280
[Amit Varma]: like what was growing up in those years like what was Calcutta like? What did you want

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280
[Amit Varma]: to be as a kid?

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:11.240
[Guest]: Yeah, sure. So for the longest time I can remember, I wanted to be a writer. This is

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.480
[Guest]: how I talk about it now that I'm a very deliberate writer. And I'm a very accidental artist.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.400
[Guest]: Becoming an artist was never part of the plan until it sort of happened one day. And it

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.680
[Guest]: took me another year after that to accept that label. But so I grew up in Calcutta,

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:35.080
[Guest]: and I was a voracious reader, like any wannabe writer is to begin. And I would read everything

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.160
[Guest]: like I read books, and I read dictionaries, and I read encyclopedias, and I would read

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.000
[Guest]: instruction manuals, just if there is something with words on it, I will read it. And I will

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.880
[Guest]: just keep reading. My parents were very hands off, like they let me do things they let my

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.360
[Guest]: brother and I play however we wanted and do whatever we wanted. We didn't have many rules

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.280
[Guest]: set on us. One thing interesting about my life growing up in the 90s, because I am part

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.640
[Guest]: of the generation that had the big push towards engineering, right? So IITs became a thing

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:10.480
[Guest]: IIT-JEE and AIEEE and all these competitive exams and preparing for them became a thing,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.360
[Guest]: very, very firmly a thing for us. And I in my high school years was the only person I

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:22.640
[Guest]: knew who did not have any tuitions. So I never took any tuitions for science studies. And

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.960
[Guest]: I gave all these entrance exams. And I gave all these entrance exams simply because that's

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.520
[Guest]: what's done like this idea of what do you want to do? I don't think it was ever put

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.800
[Guest]: to me. It was I maybe it's not something that quite occurred to my parents as that kind

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.040
[Guest]: of open world in which you just become whatever you want. And it was just taken for it was

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.200
[Guest]: implicit that you're good at science. So you will become an engineer. And I've always been

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.840
[Guest]: that way that I'm a very curious person. I like to know how things work. I'm always I

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.520
[Guest]: always try to figure things out. And I love learning. I just really love learning things.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.120
[Guest]: So I pay I'm the guy who sits in the back row, but pays attention in class. I'm the

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.040
[Guest]: guy who sits in the back row but takes notes. So like I have diligent neat notes of all

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.600
[Guest]: my classes. Why do you sit in the back row? Just because I don't want to sit in the front

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.080
[Guest]: row. I will not be the kind of guy who sits in the front row. Okay, so there is a bit

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.160
[Guest]: of the rebel. But I just I love learning things like even in my college years when I was a

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:33.640
[Guest]: very, very anti-authoritarian, you know, anti-establishmentarian, contrarian rebel kind of person, I still took

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:39.560
[Guest]: diligent notes in class because I just loved thermodynamics. And I loved the mechanical

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.080
[Guest]: design and learning all these things. It was just so much cool stuff. I always wanted to

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.700
[Guest]: know it in my in when I was in class eight, my English literature professor stood me up

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.460
[Guest]: in class and said, Nishant, you are the most cynical person I have ever met in my life.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.120
[Guest]: And I thought that was the greatest compliment someone could give me. Because for all my

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:04.480
[Guest]: these young years, I used to think that the only weapon or armor and it's sort of the

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:12.460
[Guest]: same thing at that age I had was my wit. I loved words and I loved what words could do,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:18.080
[Guest]: how you could disarm someone or cut through them with sharp words. And I cultivated sharp

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:23.640
[Guest]: words, nice sentences, comebacks. I had all of those things because I always felt like

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: an outsider. So I was in very posh school of Calcutta. I was in La Martiniere for boys.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.060
[Guest]: And I'm I wasn't the in crowd of that school as I saw it then. And as I see now, looking

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:41.280
[Guest]: back at it, I'll tell you an incident from it was really funny. And I recently refreshed

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.640
[Guest]: this incident in my mind, which sort of told me about my place in this world that I was

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:52.560
[Guest]: in in school, and I didn't realize how profound it is. So when I was in class six and seven,

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.120
[Guest]: backstreet boys were a big deal. And backstreet boys are a big deal. So spiked hair was a

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.600
[Guest]: big deal. Everybody had spiked hair. And I had no idea how this works. But I had classmates

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.480
[Guest]: who used to come with shiny, spiky hair, like shining, glistening and just staying there.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.760
[Guest]: And I asked this classmate of mine how how this works, like what what are you doing to

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.420
[Guest]: your hair? And he just said, it's just water. I just put water and then I come and I used

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:26.680
[Guest]: to live an hour away from school, I would take this matador bus, which would take a

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:34.160
[Guest]: bunch of us students at 7am and 8am drop us off at school. It was hot. And it was it was

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.960
[Guest]: a long journey. And I would wet my hair just before leaving home and not dry it off and

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.760
[Guest]: then go into this bus and hope that it was like obviously it did not stay this way by

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.120
[Guest]: them in Calcutta. It did not stay this way by the time I reach school and those hairstyles

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.640
[Guest]: never worked for me. And all those years it never occurred to me that he was putting gel

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.360
[Guest]: on his hair. And not only was he putting gel on his hair, he was living he was getting

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.760
[Guest]: into an air conditioned car, and then coming to school and getting dropped off. And I was

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.280
[Guest]: taking a bus and all the air from outside and all the dust and everything was and it

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.400
[Guest]: never occurred to me that there was this huge difference. And I kept feeling like I am not

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.840
[Guest]: good enough. The privilege of gelled hair. Yeah, like I'm not cool enough for this. And

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.000
[Guest]: the way that I can be cool, what what is the armor that I can get? How can I feel good

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.040
[Guest]: about myself in this environment in which I feel inadequate? And that was words that

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.440
[Guest]: was being smart and being intelligent. So I love these authors who made me feel this

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.440
[Guest]: way. Like I love the twist of phrase that PG Woodhouse would bring into a book. I love

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.760
[Guest]: the kind of intelligent plotting that Agatha Christie would do in her novels. And I would

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.120
[Guest]: be like, yeah, if I can craft a novel like that, then somebody would read me and be like,

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.800
[Guest]: yeah, this guy's got it. So I wanted to be those things. And I grew up like that. And

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.600
[Guest]: I thought I wanted to be a writer. But it never occurred to me that you can become a

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.580
[Guest]: writer until I started blogging. Even then it didn't occur to me that you can become

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.840
[Guest]: a paid writer just by wanting to be so like, you can just you can just do it. And then

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.400
[Guest]: you can keep doing it. And then it'll it'll work like it never occurred to me. So what

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.080
[Guest]: do you do for studies? And my parents had engineering because I was good at science.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.000
[Guest]: And that's what you do. If you're good at science, I got really high marks and things

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.640
[Guest]: like that. I was quite self destructive with all my competitive exams, I forgot to send

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.480
[Guest]: in the papers for my comet K, which is the entrance exam for Karnataka colleges. And

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.980
[Guest]: the day that your admit card is supposed to come, I opened my drawer to find that the

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.440
[Guest]: check is still in my drawer, I haven't posted it, I reached my AIEEE exam one hour after

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:44.560
[Guest]: it had already started, because I read the starting time wrong. So I did all kinds of

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.080
[Guest]: terrible things. And I got into only Manipal, where I went for engineering. I did pretty

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.480
[Guest]: well, I really enjoyed it. I got this opportunity in second year, to be part of this new group,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:00.720
[Guest]: which was making a race car. And this is, it's not Formula One, but it's called Formula

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.080
[Guest]: Student. So it's the college student edition of Formula One. Formula One basically means

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.920
[Guest]: that it's a race car competition with certain rules around it. So there are rules of design,

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.080
[Guest]: there are restrictions on engine size, and all these various restrictions that Formula

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.960
[Guest]: One keeps updating. And if you stick to these restrictions, then you're a Formula One car.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.440
[Guest]: And Formula Student similarly has its own set of rules. And universities all over the

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.440
[Guest]: world do this, but no Indian university was doing it at that time. And we were nobody's

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.440
[Guest]: if you're not even an IIT. I think IIT was doing it at that time, but not very well.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.400
[Guest]: And we'd like it was quite audacious for us to do this. And in fact, our teachers, my

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.400
[Guest]: own teachers in mechanical engineering, told me, what's this? Why are you wasting your

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.600
[Guest]: time? Just get your degree, get a job, go by you, what are you doing? They wouldn't

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.720
[Guest]: give us attendance. Like, if we had to take time off from class to do some work, we wouldn't

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.840
[Guest]: get attendance, like we had to stick to everything. And then on top of that, do this, which is

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.600
[Guest]: a super non supportive framework, and it was very difficult. But we really wanted to do

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.640
[Guest]: it. And I just got a kick out of learning things and being able to do things. And I

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.240
[Guest]: was part of it. And we went to we raced that car in 2008. We went, we were the only Indian

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:14.560
[Guest]: team in a group of like 60 universities from around the world. In Italy, we went to the

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.880
[Guest]: Ferrari racetrack in Fiorano. It's the name of the racetrack is Fiorano racetrack. And

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.520
[Guest]: we were there in this town called Maranello in in rural Italy. And we raced our car there.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.920
[Guest]: The next year, we went to Silverstone, which is where the British Grand Prix happens. We

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.600
[Guest]: had another car there. And that sort of liberated me from the restrictions of what the education

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:41.760
[Guest]: system was like. Because I was deeply disappointed when I first got to university. And I could

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:49.160
[Guest]: sense that we're just faking it here. They are pretending to teach, I pretend to learn.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.680
[Guest]: And then I say some things at a job interview. And that guy pretends to get it. And maybe

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:59.000
[Guest]: he gives me a job. Like there's no real thing happening here. I really have questions. And

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.880
[Guest]: they don't want to answer because why are you asking these questions? These questions

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:07.040
[Guest]: are pointless, they won't come in the paper. What am I doing? Is this an education? And

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.680
[Guest]: this jadedness really set in around authority figures around around the thing, the hoops

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.800
[Guest]: that I have to pass. So I was angry at my parents for a little bit. I used to be like,

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.140
[Guest]: you know, you asked me to be an engineer, but do you know what it is to be an engineer?

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.920
[Guest]: How did you decide that you want me to be an engineer? Does it matter if I was a mechanical

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.360
[Guest]: engineer or a chemical engineer or a computer science engineer? It clearly it wouldn't have

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.440
[Guest]: mattered to them if I had gotten computer science engineering. Why not? It's a completely

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.720
[Guest]: different field. The skill set is completely different. And then that had me thinking about

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.880
[Guest]: what does it take to be a computer science engineer in India, to be a computer science

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.980
[Guest]: engineer in India, because that is the top field, you have to be really, really good

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:53.120
[Guest]: at organic chemistry. Does that make any sense at all? You have to know nothing about computer

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.840
[Guest]: science, you don't have to know how to write even a single line of code to get a computer

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.120
[Guest]: science engineering seat in it, whatever the top ideas, you need to be really good at organic

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.480
[Guest]: chemistry, though, because that's one third of the paper that you have to cross and I

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:13.140
[Guest]: hated chemistry. So in my particular gripe against organic chemistry is this that why

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.940
[Guest]: should I have to learn this? Maybe I can still be an engineer who doesn't know anything about

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:22.280
[Guest]: chemistry. And lucky for me that I ended up in mechanical engineering and I had nothing

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.920
[Guest]: to do with those things. Mechanical engineering was perfectly suited to me because it perfectly

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:33.560
[Guest]: vibed with my way of learning. And it's completely accidental that I got it. It's so wrong that

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.480
[Guest]: it had to happen this way. But this is how I learn. I have to internalize these ideas

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.480
[Guest]: that I read about. The reason why I take notes is because this is how I learn. I don't do

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.320
[Guest]: the tuitions. I don't have three hours every evening with lecturers and teachers after

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:54.520
[Guest]: class. And I'm lazy. I don't like to study. So how do I learn? At the first time, I take

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.720
[Guest]: notes while I'm in class. And that process of taking notes is your first layer of teaching

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.800
[Guest]: yourself and then you revise those things and then you get a second layer of understanding.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.760
[Guest]: So I stuck with that through college, I would take notes. And mechanical engineering is

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.440
[Guest]: suited to that because mechanical engineering is about imbibing these ideas. And once you

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.840
[Guest]: sort of intuitively understand how things work, how thermodynamics goes, how designs

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.880
[Guest]: structures work, how loads fall, and you can you can sort of visualize all of these things.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.620
[Guest]: And electrical engineering and all these things felt alien to me because I couldn't visualize

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:31.920
[Guest]: these circuits in my mind, at least. And so it was complete happenstance that I happened

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.840
[Guest]: to become a mechanical engineer, and that it worked with the way that I the ways that

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.880
[Guest]: my curiosity worked, and that I got this chance to make a race car. And because I got this

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.400
[Guest]: chance to make a race car, we went to Europe a couple of times with these race cars, and

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:51.080
[Guest]: we spoke to students from other universities. And I found out that in other countries, people

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:57.240
[Guest]: just do what they want to do this alien bizarre concept that you study what you wanted to

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:03.000
[Guest]: study, you have a curiosity and you take it. And nobody tells you that you don't deserve

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.080
[Guest]: to study here, or that you don't have to prove that you deserve to study in a good place.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.960
[Guest]: So there's this thing I read much later, I think it's by Malcolm Gladwell, he talks about

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:20.120
[Guest]: these two models of education. So either a modeling agency route, or the army route in

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.480
[Guest]: the modeling agency route, you have to prove that you're good enough. And then they take

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.600
[Guest]: you on and they make you a model. In the army system, you get in, and they make you into

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.000
[Guest]: a soldier, they put you through the grind to become a you don't have to prove yourself,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.160
[Guest]: you have basic qualifications, but you don't have to deserve to be there, the way you have

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.720
[Guest]: to prove your worth to be a model, we've kind of follow the former one in India, simply

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.600
[Guest]: because of our numbers, like we don't have a examination system, we have a filtration

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.720
[Guest]: system. If you can get through this IIT JEE, then because of simply because now you are

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.720
[Guest]: the top 5000 because of this exam, you deserve to be an IIT and it's nonsense. This is not

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.720
[Guest]: how you decide 16 year old is not positioned to say whether he wants to be a mechanical

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.680
[Guest]: or a computer science engineer or any of these things. It's just utter nonsense that we do.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.360
[Guest]: We tell people that they should choose what they need to do at this early age, then we

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.880
[Guest]: berate them for not doing it enough, not committing hard enough. And then if it turns out many

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.440
[Guest]: years later that they made the wrong choice, and they're sad, then we berate them again

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:27.080
[Guest]: for why did you choose it in the first place. And how I think about it is that our entire

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.880
[Guest]: country suffers from what I call the Abhimanyu complex, that we've all been taught how to

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:41.240
[Guest]: get into this Kurukshetra from before birth only, that we have to get into it. Nobody

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.640
[Guest]: tells you what you're supposed to do once you get in. Nobody tells you why you got in.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.440
[Guest]: Nobody tells you how you're going to get out. But you have to go that is beyond conversation

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:55.600
[Guest]: or debate. And it really made me very angry. And I saw this foreign university and how

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.600
[Guest]: they do things. And I decided I wanted to. This is how I told my father that I want to

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:06.160
[Guest]: get a real education. Now I've had it like I really want to I gave these interviews,

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:14.000
[Guest]: I have an ex I had a 8.7 CGPA. I have all these projects. I am the dean of our University

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.600
[Guest]: of Manipal. He would he held us up as an example to follow in front of everybody. Things like

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.880
[Guest]: this happened, but I did not feel like an engineer. I felt like I have faked it. I know

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.440
[Guest]: what work I did. I know how little you demanded of me. This is not an education. I really

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:37.040
[Guest]: want an education. And this ties into another idea I have about finite versus infinite games,

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.360
[Guest]: which maybe you can broach it a little later. I wanted an education. So I went to the TU

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.960
[Guest]: Delft, the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, I applied there because they

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.480
[Guest]: had a great formula student racing team, a friend and I both were kind of swayed by this

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.960
[Guest]: idea of biomechanics. And I got a little interested in the subject. So we did our bachelor's thesis

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.960
[Guest]: in Manipal together, which was working out how the structure, the musculoskeletal structure

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:07.920
[Guest]: of a knee joint, which has suffered from an ACL injury. And that got us animated about

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.200
[Guest]: the subject of biomechanics. And I applied for a master's degree in biomechanics at the

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:19.320
[Guest]: TU Delft. And I got in, I went there. And that was my master's degree. I spent two years

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:25.840
[Guest]: in which I unlearned everything. My model for this is that I demolished everything.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:31.020
[Guest]: And I built a fresh foundation of knowledge. And biomechanical engineering came under the

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:36.880
[Guest]: umbrella of control engineering, in a sense. And now I think of myself as a control engineer.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.420
[Guest]: And that term is super important to me. And I am a control engineer, even today that I'm

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:49.420
[Guest]: an artist, in many ways. And I learned some very, very deep, profound, amazing things

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:55.360
[Guest]: that I'm going to keep with me forever. And yeah, so I did this master's degree. And this

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:01.200
[Guest]: whole time, bachelor's degree, master's degree, I'm writing my blog, I'm drawing these web

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.200
[Guest]: comics, I started the web comic in the final year of bachelor's because everything was

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:11.500
[Guest]: such a joke, man, like we weren't doing serious work, there was so much free time. And we

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.500
[Guest]: were just messing the kind of things we did to kill time. So I started this web comic

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.700
[Guest]: just to make fun of my friends, and make jokes about life. Because humor was my weapon, humor

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.660
[Guest]: was my shield. And it's, I can't do that kind of humor anymore. So one of the reasons why

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:30.180
[Guest]: that web comic stopped was that I couldn't do that humor anymore. And that was a very

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:34.880
[Guest]: big moment in my life. And I realized why I can't do that humor anymore. And I'm writing

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.160
[Guest]: and I'm writing and I'm writing and I'm doing this blog and I'm doing the web comic becomes

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.660
[Guest]: from three times a week to once a week to once a month to once in two months, because

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.820
[Guest]: my studies are taking up more time. And what's happening is that I'm moving away from my

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:50.900
[Guest]: world. So I'm in this new place now. And I think that I should talk about Bollywood because

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.300
[Guest]: that's what I used to make fun of, I think I should talk about Indian life, because that's

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.420
[Guest]: what I know. And that's what my audience is about. And that's what I should talk about.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.380
[Guest]: But I'm moving away from it, and it's getting harder to do it. So I'm doing it less, and

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.580
[Guest]: I'm feeling angrier because I'm not feeling fulfilled. After I finished my master's degree,

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.180
[Guest]: I got offered a PhD program in the university. And this was so my master's degree, my master's

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.240
[Guest]: thesis was on the subject of what is known as bimanual control. bimanual control is how

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:24.220
[Guest]: you manually control your two arms or two legs. So example, juggling, or playing drums,

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:29.880
[Guest]: things like that. And I was studying how there are these various models of bimanual control,

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.380
[Guest]: how the brain does this. So if you try to keep a beat 6060 beats per minute with your

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:39.020
[Guest]: right hand on the, and you can probably do a 30 beats per minute, meanwhile, so half

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:43.020
[Guest]: of that frequency with your left hand, but if you try to do 20, it would get tougher

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:47.740
[Guest]: if you try to do 25 and 60. So they're not multiples, it becomes very tough, because

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.020
[Guest]: now your brain has to do these crazy computations. And it's very difficult, you have to train

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:56.020
[Guest]: yourself to do it, you have to be a drummer or something like that was put in the hours,

00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:03.000
[Guest]: then they can achieve limb independence. Like different limbs are not in order to process

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.460
[Guest]: complex information, what our brain does is it breaks it down into more like to reduce

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:12.180
[Guest]: the processing load. So if you try to keep these very, very discordant beats with two

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.660
[Guest]: different hands, and you're not trained as a drummer, your hands will automatically fall

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.220
[Guest]: into a simpler rhythm. And that is your brain trying to be like, Oh, I can't do this. But

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.900
[Guest]: this is a little easier to do. And I don't need to think about it too much. Because that

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.420
[Guest]: kind of processing of two different beats is very difficult. It's a lot of processing

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:32.020
[Guest]: power. So let's make it simpler. Why don't you do half of what this is instead of trying

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:36.660
[Guest]: to do three fifths of what this is. So instead of a complex beat, a slightly simpler beat

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.240
[Guest]: unless you train otherwise. So my thesis was about trying to figure out how these models

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:48.220
[Guest]: work, and how the muscles and the nerves and how they form this control model to describe

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:54.220
[Guest]: this whole thing, feedback and actuators and springs and dampers. So a mechanical system

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:59.460
[Guest]: to describe a biological reality. This is what biomechanical design was about in my

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.300
[Guest]: study, it was about the marriage of mechanical idea, mechanical principles and ideas to describe

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:11.140
[Guest]: biological phenomena. And it has applications in robotics, it has applications in orthopedics

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:16.700
[Guest]: and all kinds of assistive devices. But mine was because I am this stupid person who's

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.700
[Guest]: just animated by difficult things, because they are interesting. I chose the toughest

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:26.100
[Guest]: one that I could find for my PhD, which was how to stroke patients use their reflexes.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:32.140
[Guest]: So let's do neuroscience. And this led to this research project that was offered to

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:38.240
[Guest]: me in my PhD program, which was about stroke patients. And the idea was to develop nice

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.060
[Guest]: rehabilitation programs for stroke patients. So stroke patients have a whole bunch of rehab

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.700
[Guest]: programs, which are very general. But what if we want to get specific, what if we want

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.380
[Guest]: to cut down the rehab time, therefore, like what if we know this person needs three months

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:54.460
[Guest]: of one thing instead of one year of this other thing, in order to become normal, we need

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:59.300
[Guest]: to understand what is their deficiencies, we need to have a number for those deficiencies.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:04.620
[Guest]: So we need to quantify a lot of biological defects, quote unquote, or whatever the situation

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.480
[Guest]: is post stroke. And we need to have as many variables as we can get to describe the system

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.380
[Guest]: and get the numbers to where they need to be. So we need a mechanical understanding

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:18.780
[Guest]: of this system, because mechanical systems have sensors, sensors give you numbers, and

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:23.460
[Guest]: numbers are can be fit into equations, we need equations, and we need mechanical understandings

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.700
[Guest]: of what's going on, like what happened in the brain? How does that react to the muscles?

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:32.820
[Guest]: How do their arms move? How do you describe this arm and its movement as various mechanical

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:37.900
[Guest]: phenomena? What are the numbers that are useful? What are the eigenvalues? So the eigenvalues

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:44.220
[Guest]: are the least number of variables you need to describe something perfectly. What are

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:48.660
[Guest]: the eigenvalues? What is the eigenvector? And what is the values within them? So these

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:53.060
[Guest]: are the eigenvalues within the eigenvector, identify the vector. So it's a process of

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:58.580
[Guest]: what's known as black box system identification. If you have a system that you can't open up,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:03.180
[Guest]: so it's a black box, you don't know how it literally works, you can only hit it and you

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.900
[Guest]: can see what happens. So you can put an input, you can get an output. And then you can be

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:11.780
[Guest]: output divide by input is equal to system. And then try to with intelligent inputs, try

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.900
[Guest]: to figure out what is this system. So we need to do black box system identification of brain

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:23.420
[Guest]: of a body that has been affected by a stroke, a cortical stroke, and therefore has muscular

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:29.260
[Guest]: neuromuscular deficiencies. And that meant learning a lot more about biology. So project

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.980
[Guest]: was in collaboration with the Northwestern University in Chicago. And I went to Chicago

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:39.740
[Guest]: to do experiments. The first time I went to Chicago, and I was vehemently opposed to it

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:45.100
[Guest]: because I hated America at that point. I thought it represents all the evil of the world and

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:50.700
[Guest]: I don't want to be in America, I'm not gonna like it. Chicago means guns and violence.

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.980
[Guest]: I got to Chicago during the first polar vortex of 2013. It was three days, the first three

00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:00.460
[Guest]: days were shut down, nobody went anywhere, minus 45 degrees Celsius. The first day that

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:07.340
[Guest]: I stepped out, I fell in love with the city completely. Chicago absolutely changed my

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:13.340
[Guest]: whole life. Everything I am today, everything that I've been able to do is because of that

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:20.540
[Guest]: city. And I went there only because of doing all these other random things that were not

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:25.180
[Guest]: what I really, really, really wanted to do. They were simply things I was good at. And

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:30.540
[Guest]: there is this joy of achievement you get. And that's also a nice high, it's a nice kick.

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:35.260
[Guest]: I'm good at it. And I do it and I get rewarded and it's nice. University system rewards are

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.140
[Guest]: nicely set up. You know, you do this much work, you get so reward and it feels nice,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:45.300
[Guest]: you can feel good about life. And it carries you through to a lot. So it brought me to

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:50.540
[Guest]: Chicago. And I'm doing experiments with stroke patients, fascinating people. I met somebody

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:56.620
[Guest]: who used to train with Chuck Norris. I met someone who was on the original 21 team, the

00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:02.660
[Guest]: MIT team that did the thing in Vegas or Atlantic City, the blackjack players. So he has now

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:07.380
[Guest]: had a stroke, he would take 15 minutes to come from the door to the seat. Because he

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:12.740
[Guest]: couldn't walk, he would walk so slowly. But he had stories like he had real stories. Now

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:18.140
[Guest]: he travels to casinos all over the world. In order to spot card counters. He teaches

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.220
[Guest]: people how to spot card counters because he's one of them. This is the outlaw who's become

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.540
[Guest]: the sheriff. Exactly, right. So this is how he makes his money. And he would tell me these

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:30.180
[Guest]: stories while we were doing nine hour long experiments. It would take me half an hour

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:37.540
[Guest]: just to unclench his fist because of the stroke. And it's so debilitating. But anyway, so I'm

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:42.460
[Guest]: doing these experiments, I'm learning, I'm having a good time implementing these ideas,

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:49.500
[Guest]: figuring things out. But I'm feeling creatively unfulfilled. I want to write, I want to be

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.060
[Guest]: a writer. This is the first thing I said to my girlfriend on our first date we met in

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.100
[Guest]: Manipal in the first year. And I told her one day I'm going to be a writer. And she

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.980
[Guest]: just laughed that oh, you're an engineer, you're becoming an engineer, though. And there's

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:07.060
[Guest]: no pathway visible. How will you? How do you become a writer? There's no pathway to becoming

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:14.420
[Guest]: a writer anyway. But I wanted it I this is what I wanted to do. And I've always doing

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:20.620
[Guest]: it on the side. And what Chicago did was that after my experiments in the evenings, I would

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:27.460
[Guest]: go to open mic nights. I would write because I've always been writing funny things. I did

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:33.300
[Guest]: stand up, I would go up on stage in front of a bunch of people who are not from my world,

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:37.100
[Guest]: who will not understand the jokes that I've always written. So I have to say something

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:42.380
[Guest]: new. And I have to say something that they will get and they will laugh at. And sometimes

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.100
[Guest]: I failed. Sometimes I did pretty well. Maybe they were being kind, I don't know. But I

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:53.060
[Guest]: got this rush from it. And first rush was that I did it. The second rush was that I

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:58.500
[Guest]: was surrounded by people, some of whom were not very good. But I would see them every

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:04.540
[Guest]: night at this club, the next club, because so Chicago is a is the world capital of stand

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.420
[Guest]: up comedy. Every night of the week, you can find a free open mic somewhere or the other

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:14.260
[Guest]: as audience or as a wannabe comedian. Same for music. And every night of the week, you

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:18.860
[Guest]: can find it. I would see these guys night after night after night. I'm not doing anything

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.980
[Guest]: because I'm nervous today. I don't feel like doing it. But this guy's going and he's not

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:27.700
[Guest]: very good. I know he's not good, but he's really doing this. And I got this from America,

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:34.100
[Guest]: but if you really want to do it, just do it. And that's when I sort of understood what

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:39.740
[Guest]: they keep talking about when they say freedom, because I didn't get it before this. Americans

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:45.000
[Guest]: are crazy people. They just do things like they just they just do whatever they want

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.900
[Guest]: to do. Like, they have no qualms. They have no they don't feel like misfits. It's interesting.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:57.260
[Guest]: Like the word misfit, right? The word misfit implies that you're supposed to fit. Because

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.020
[Guest]: that's what Indian culture is you fit. And if you otherwise you're a misfit, and that's

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:06.540
[Guest]: a bad thing. What if there's no standard of fitting? You can't be a misfit anymore, right?

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.940
[Guest]: What if there's no requirement to fit? That's what America was like. They'll just say anything

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.860
[Guest]: like people will be dressed in all kinds of ways. People will be having these super dramatic

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:19.700
[Guest]: phone call conversations on the bus, not caring that people can hear hear them. People are

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.980
[Guest]: like really being themselves on a stage, even if they are introverted in real life, what

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:30.860
[Guest]: freedom and they gave me permission to do the same. I looked at them and I said, Why

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:37.660
[Guest]: am I not doing this? Because I have a certain degree of privilege. My girlfriend had started

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:41.860
[Guest]: working. She's a dentist. She went to the US to study to practice there. And she just

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.820
[Guest]: started working. And she told me why aren't you doing this? You want to be a writer become

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.740
[Guest]: a writer? Why are you doing this PhD stuff? I thought No, I have what I can't I can't

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:55.380
[Guest]: quit. Can I? But Chicago told me Yes, why can't you quit? You have the freedom. If you

01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:01.140
[Guest]: want to do it, you have to do it. And I recognized that I have the privilege. A lot of people

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:06.100
[Guest]: want to do these things, but they their circumstances don't allow them to maybe they really need

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.580
[Guest]: to earn next month's rent. Maybe they really have big big loans to pay off. My PhD program

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.220
[Guest]: luckily paid me nicely enough that I was able to pay off my master student loan. And I had

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.380
[Guest]: somebody willing to support me. I felt like privilege was like this trampoline with the

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.980
[Guest]: privilege came the responsibility. How can you ignore the value of your privilege? There

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.060
[Guest]: are people who want to do this who are not able to you can do it and you want to do it,

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:39.260
[Guest]: but you are afraid of how we will explain it. I can't do that. That's not okay. I wanted

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:43.740
[Guest]: to do something that I really, really, really wanted to chase. And at the same time with

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:50.300
[Guest]: my studies, I had come to this idea that a PhD program needs 200% from you. This has

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:56.300
[Guest]: to be what you sleep dream about. This is what you think about all the time. I knew

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:03.500
[Guest]: that honestly, I'm able to give this 90%. I like it. I'm excited by learning. But PhD

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.420
[Guest]: is not about learning. You are now at the at the at the frontier. You have to discover

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:15.340
[Guest]: you have to prove things. And I am not as motivated in this field with the level of

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:20.500
[Guest]: explicit mathematical knowledge it needs not an implicit understanding, but an explicit

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:27.900
[Guest]: application of the knowledge. And I am not enamored by that aspect. I loved it while

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:33.660
[Guest]: I was learning things. But now that I have to do further, I am not as excited anymore.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:39.060
[Guest]: And I'm surrounded by people who are excited by it. All my fellow researchers, my fellow

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.780
[Guest]: PhD postdocs, they were super enamored and excited and passionate about their things.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.500
[Guest]: And I felt like I was faking it in comparison to them. And that's not fair to them. That's

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:54.260
[Guest]: not fair to my professors. And that's not how things like I don't want my life to be

01:02:54.260 --> 01:03:00.860
[Guest]: about that. So quite quickly, I reached this decision that this means that I'm quitting.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:06.340
[Guest]: And I've I feel I've kind of always been like that. Like I can't do something if I'm not

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:11.820
[Guest]: once I lose interest, I can't push myself anymore. Like that's the day that I just stop.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.820
[Guest]: And so I just stopped like just like how I stopped studying organic chemistry in class

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:21.320
[Guest]: 11. And I paid the price in my ITJ exams and all the other exams, all the organic chemistry

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.740
[Guest]: sections are empty. I didn't answer anything because I like I can't do it. It's not something

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:32.580
[Guest]: I hate it. So I stopped. I told my professor I'm leaving. I went home and I told my parents

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.260
[Amit Varma]: that I'm quitting my PhD program to become a writer and to live with my girlfriend, a

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:42.580
[Guest]: nightmare for Indian parents. Such a funny conversation. So my parents are incredible

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:48.500
[Guest]: people in this respect, because they needed just a few conversations over a week's time.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:53.860
[Guest]: And they were okay with it. They have empowered me a lot. They have given me the permission

01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:02.220
[Guest]: to do things, to be myself, to even disobey is a permission like I have never faced serious

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.900
[Guest]: consequences for disagreeing with them. I have never been punished in I have never like,

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.820
[Guest]: you know, been slapped or corporal punishment or in threatened or intimidated. So that also

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.380
[Guest]: is permission. And that made me who I am. And they trusted who I am. When I told them

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.500
[Guest]: that I'm quitting my PhD program to be a writer, I could show them 400 webcomic strips that

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.420
[Guest]: I had drawn. I could show them dozens of scripts I had written. I had written for a YouTube

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.980
[Guest]: show at that time. I had done I had written six months for NDTV's Gustakhi Maaf, the puppet

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:39.540
[Guest]: 6-7 minute puppet show episodes they would have about current events. I had done that.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:46.420
[Guest]: I had so many blog articles and stories. I had all these ideas. I had put in the work.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.980
[Guest]: And I was telling them that instead of doing this in the evening, with two hours of time,

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:56.740
[Guest]: I want this to be my race. This is how I put it to them that everything is a marathon.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.700
[Guest]: There's no overnight success. Everything is going to take a lot out of me. I want to be

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:07.940
[Guest]: in the race that I want to be in. I have understood which race I want to be in. And at this point,

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:13.180
[Guest]: it is wrong for me to continue in the other race simply with the idea that finish to Karlo.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.980
[Guest]: My mother still sometimes says this to me Khatam to Karleta PhD. And it's just key,

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.660
[Guest]: I would have lost two or two and a half more years. And once I knew that I don't want to

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:28.700
[Guest]: do it, it's not good. It's not fair anyway. And that's a different argument like to others

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.820
[Guest]: around me for me to continue in this fake mode. But it's not fair to myself to do this

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:39.380
[Guest]: thing. So I quit. My girlfriend was working in Chicago. We got married a few months after

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:45.980
[Guest]: that, I moved in with her and I started to become a writer. And then I started on this

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:50.740
[Guest]: journey that suddenly made me an artist. But we can go into that. I think I should pause

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.980
[Amit Varma]: at this point because I've been going on and on.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.660
[Amit Varma]: No, no. These are the conversations which are most delightful to me when I can just

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.820
[Amit Varma]: sit back and listen. Bunch of things I want to double click into. But before I continue,

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.060
[Amit Varma]: you know, with your journey as a writer slash artist and all of that bunch of things. Firstly,

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:09.500
[Amit Varma]: you know what you said about education strikes a chord and many guests have spoken on this

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:13.380
[Amit Varma]: topic before I think Anirban Mahapatra was the last and in fact, the most popular episode

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.620
[Amit Varma]: of my show right now, overtaking my episodes on Kashmir and CAA with Srinath Raghavan is

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.980
[Amit Varma]: the one I did on education with Karthik Muralidharan, which has just gotten to number one. And there

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:28.500
[Amit Varma]: he speaks at length about how our system is set up for sorting not teaching exactly as

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.940
[Amit Varma]: you said, you just want to sort out who are the brightest kids and then whatever happens

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.820
[Amit Varma]: happens and you see the successes of that but don't realize that it was because of incredibly

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.340
[Amit Varma]: smart to begin with and you found them and not necessarily that you taught them something.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.580
[Amit Varma]: Earlier you were talking about your cynicism. And you've written a beautiful post about

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.980
[Amit Varma]: this, which of course I linked from the show notes. But I want to read out a bit from that

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.740
[Amit Varma]: before I go on to my next question, where you talk about how you discovered the power

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:59.100
[Amit Varma]: of being cynical. And you write quote, cynicism was smartness, cynicism was pragmatic, cynicism

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:03.980
[Amit Varma]: was a way of adults. I took pride in my cynicism. It helped me fight off insecurities before

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.300
[Amit Varma]: the popular guys in school. It helped me deal with my social inadequacies. It gave me a

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.820
[Amit Varma]: sense of humor. I won many battles with the sharp edge of my wit. Over the years, I honed

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.460
[Amit Varma]: it to terrific sharpness. In college, a professor asked me not to be over smart. I asked him

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.340
[Amit Varma]: to explain exactly how smart I should be in that case. He kicked me out of the class but

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.540
[Amit Varma]: the rest of the students laughed and that was my win. I made funny comics mocking the

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.780
[Amit Varma]: idiosyncrasies of my friends. I wrote funny stories with elaborate dialogue and plots

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.780
[Amit Varma]: that pointed to the foolishness of trying the inevitable failure of all action. I made

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:38.980
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people laugh, and so on. And then you say in a later para, but one day I found

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.300
[Amit Varma]: the fountain of my creativity had gone dry. I could not write. After struggling for many

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.660
[Amit Varma]: months, I came to the conclusion that I had reached the end of my tether with cynicism.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.940
[Amit Varma]: Cynicism is like a wall we build inside our mind brick by brick. We do it to protect what

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.640
[Amit Varma]: is most vulnerable inside us. We hide that thing behind walls so others cannot know.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.540
[Amit Varma]: So they cannot mock us the way we mock them. It shields us from people and also from other

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:06.100
[Amit Varma]: horrors of the outside world, pain and fear and shame and rejection. Nothing cannot breach

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.300
[Amit Varma]: these defenses. Every year the walls grow higher. Every morning you climb the ramparts

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.620
[Amit Varma]: and rain arrows upon the enemy at the gates, stop good. Which is sort of a beautifully

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:20.140
[Amit Varma]: put description of a defense mechanism, which many of us have, which I think to some extent

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:24.620
[Amit Varma]: I also had when I was a kid where with your cleverness, you know, it's like you don't

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:31.040
[Amit Varma]: know where you stand in the world. So to hide the doubts of your own inadequacies, you you

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.780
[Amit Varma]: adopt a superior position by mocking others. And that's really easy to do. And that's something

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:39.380
[Amit Varma]: that you see on Twitter all the time where everyone's standing in judgment upon everybody

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.060
[Amit Varma]: else because that's easy to do. It's an easy way to say, look, I'm so virtuous. I'm so

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:49.300
[Amit Varma]: good. I'm so right. But my question is not about that. My question is that in your writing

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.500
[Amit Varma]: this there is tremendous self-awareness. And one of the things I've realized about my own

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.700
[Amit Varma]: writing when I do look back is that a lot of that self-awareness comes from writing

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:05.060
[Amit Varma]: about it. That till the moment that you start writing and you start examining your childhood,

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:10.140
[Amit Varma]: you are not aware that you were like this, but then it becomes explicit. Like in a sense,

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.580
[Amit Varma]: you spoke earlier in the context of your PhD program that you were more towards implicit

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:19.260
[Amit Varma]: understanding and not explicit application. And here it seems that by writing, you're

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:23.740
[Amit Varma]: getting this implicit understanding of your own self. And then just that understanding

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:28.380
[Amit Varma]: in a sense is automatically an explicit application because you are changing as you look back

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:34.740
[Amit Varma]: on the older you. So is this how it was for you as well, that writing became also a powerful

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.540
[Guest]: tool to understand yourself?

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:42.660
[Guest]: Yeah. Yeah. So once writing started to become difficult for the first time, like why did

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:48.340
[Guest]: it become difficult for the first time? I reached this very profound understanding that

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:57.740
[Guest]: I want to share. It's simply put the fact that other people exist. That's it. I am not

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:04.380
[Guest]: the universe and other people are not revolving around me. They are actually real people.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:13.840
[Guest]: Women are real people too. I can't just make sexist jokes. Other people have other skills

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.820
[Guest]: and they might not be good with their words. And this might be my superpower, so to say,

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:27.780
[Guest]: but this doesn't make me powerful. This doesn't make me a hero. If I have hurt someone, other

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:35.060
[Guest]: people exist. And this took time because initially this first phase of writing the blogs that

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:41.320
[Guest]: I wrote from 2006 to 2010, the comics that I drew, I was the only person who existed.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:48.820
[Guest]: I was the unfortunate one. I was the I had no privilege. I was suffering. I was sidelined.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:54.860
[Guest]: I was hitting back. So everything was allowed. I'm defending myself. I'm not lashing out.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:01.260
[Guest]: I'm defending myself. So everything is allowed. In the process of writing stories, though,

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:05.140
[Guest]: what happens is like these walls that I wrote about that you quoted, these walls that you

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:11.020
[Guest]: build up, what it does is it encloses your world. And I realized that if I want to write

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:18.260
[Guest]: good stories, I have to feel real things. I have to grow my world. You can't grow your

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:23.660
[Guest]: world once you've built walls. You have to shatter those walls and then you have to accept

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:29.940
[Guest]: everything. You have to accept everything that comes, including the pain. Cynicism helps

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:35.180
[Guest]: to shield you from pain and from explicitly feeling pain. But you have to welcome that

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:40.900
[Guest]: pain. You have to welcome sadness and you have to welcome feeling inadequate and processing

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:46.300
[Guest]: that as a human emotion that is valid and not something to be shunned. And then let's

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.420
[Guest]: just make a quick repartee and then forget about it because look, I'm funny.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:57.260
[Guest]: This process was important to go through because I wanted to be a good writer. I wanted to

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:05.700
[Guest]: be not a successful writer in the literal term. I wanted to be a really good writer.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:12.020
[Guest]: I wanted to do all the really great things and thereby get success. But success was not

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:18.980
[Guest]: the end. The end was being really, really good. And that means feeling this pain, letting

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.500
[Guest]: this pain happen to you. And I would read more things and I would read books and I would

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:29.260
[Guest]: see people go through this. So I remember reading Shantaram in which he talks about

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:36.020
[Guest]: the process of grieving and the process of loss. And this is this big hulking New Zealand

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:43.300
[Guest]: person who is talking about crying and talking about crying alone in a room and hiding his

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:50.300
[Guest]: tears from other people. And he makes you feel it. I wanted to do that. I wanted to

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.220
[Guest]: not just feel it. I wanted to make people feel it. That's the kind of writer I want

01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:02.700
[Guest]: to be. I want to be able to like if people have heartstrings, I want to play them. I

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:07.140
[Guest]: want to be able to play music on other people's heartstrings. I want to tug at them and pull

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:13.340
[Guest]: at them and pluck at them at my will. I want to have that power. And that power means giving

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:19.980
[Guest]: up control. That power means shattering these walls and letting in the whole world. Once

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:25.920
[Guest]: I did that, the immediate consequence was that the first source of my humor, which is

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.300
[Guest]: pointing at other people and laughing, ran dry. I couldn't do it. I couldn't be that

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:37.540
[Guest]: cynical person anymore. Cynicism had to be defeated. I had to let the shields down. So

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:44.100
[Guest]: I did that. And that was really important for me to become the kind of writer who could

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:49.420
[Guest]: write the way that you've read out that to be able to be self-aware like that, so that

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:54.540
[Guest]: I can write stories in which my characters are not self-aware, but are going through

01:13:54.540 --> 01:14:00.100
[Guest]: these things. The writer has to know so much more than his characters are allowed to know.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.980
[Guest]: I think about this quote from a movie I saw. I don't know if you've seen it. It's called

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:09.620
[Guest]: Superman of Malegaon. So it's this independent movie. It's about a bunch of filmmakers in

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:16.420
[Guest]: Malegaon, which is, I think, in Maharashtra itself. And they have Maliwood. They make

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.140
[Guest]: movies with a handicap. They have no technology, but they want to make a Superman movie now.

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:27.780
[Guest]: So this is a documentary following these real people who are actually trying to make a Superman

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.940
[Guest]: movie, Superman of Malegaon. And the documentary is called Superman of Malegaon because these

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.940
[Guest]: people are the supermen. And they are finding out what is a green screen and how do you

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:43.860
[Guest]: do video editing for a green screen. It's a fantastic movie. It's on YouTube to watch.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.700
[Guest]: Everybody should watch it. Like truly profound movie and beautifully made, very funny. But

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:54.740
[Guest]: the writer in that movie, he says this thing that it's stuck, it's seared into my brain.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.740
[Guest]: He said that the best writer in the best of times can communicate only a tenth of what

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:05.700
[Guest]: he wants to communicate. The rest of the pain he has to bear. It is his pain. He will never

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:12.700
[Guest]: be able to share it. Not being able to share it is pain. But even that emotion itself is

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:18.380
[Guest]: unshared, has to live inside him 10 times the emotion of what he's able to put out.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:24.580
[Guest]: So to be a good writer, it was my responsibility to take 10 times that pain that I wanted to

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:31.300
[Guest]: show. Another reason why I had to break down these walls. In the effort, therefore, of

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:37.940
[Guest]: trying to be a good writer, I realized what I was doing wrong. In writing again and again,

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:43.220
[Guest]: this character, these ideas and putting them out in stories and failing, I realized what

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:48.140
[Guest]: I was doing wrong before. And that's where all of the self-realization came from. A bit

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.940
[Guest]: of the externalization is thanks to the fact that I lived in the Netherlands where you

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:58.100
[Guest]: have access to excellent recreational drugs to help you with externalization. But mostly

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:04.060
[Guest]: it was the writing and the really wanting to be good, just good.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.420
[Amit Varma]: So this is a lovely word I came across in another of your newsletter posts from the

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:13.940
[Amit Varma]: Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows. And it's a word called Sonder, which is defined as, quote,

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:18.900
[Amit Varma]: the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.740
[Amit Varma]: own, populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries, and inherited craziness.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:28.940
[Amit Varma]: An epic story in which you might appear only once as an extra sipping coffee in the background

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.260
[Amit Varma]: as a blur of traffic passing on the highway as a lighted window at dusk, stop quote. You

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.900
[Amit Varma]: know, and this obviously speaks to that thing you said about realizing that there were other

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:42.300
[Amit Varma]: people. And you've also quoted, you know, Sartre in another of your posts saying hell

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:46.460
[Amit Varma]: is other people, which is something, you know, as an introvert, I completely get where that

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.500
[Amit Varma]: is coming from. And I don't know if it's a moral dilemma or an existential dilemma or

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:56.220
[Amit Varma]: what category it falls into. But when the time comes that you realize this, and you

01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.620
[Amit Varma]: realize this in a visceral way, and you realize that you've kind of been living your life

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:06.620
[Amit Varma]: as if you are all that matters, and everyone else is a character in the play inside your

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:13.820
[Amit Varma]: own head, it then takes moral significance that you make them something more of a character,

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.980
[Amit Varma]: a mere character that you see them as a flesh and blood people as they are, you know, to

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:24.100
[Amit Varma]: invoke, you know, Kant's categorical imperative, that you see them as not a means to an end,

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.980
[Amit Varma]: but as an end in itself. And even if I remind myself of that, I wonder if I find it hard

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:34.300
[Amit Varma]: to do and at some level, I wonder if it's possible to do at all. And with you this kind

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.780
[Amit Varma]: of, I mean, you've probably thought much more about this, because a lot of what you are

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.220
[Amit Varma]: known for when people first hear of you, the whole sneaky art business is really absorbing

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.500
[Amit Varma]: other people as other people, and letting yourself be the background. So on the one

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.940
[Amit Varma]: hand, you are just conscious of other people, it's, you know, you're making them vivid.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:56.340
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you are the one observing, it is what you are doing, it is an act of

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:01.300
[Amit Varma]: ego, or just assuming that something that you draw of other people add something to

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.340
[Amit Varma]: the world or is meaningful. And again, an act of ego and arrogance that you also written

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:13.100
[Amit Varma]: about eloquently. So, you know, so what are sort of your thoughts on all of this?

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:20.580
[Guest]: One thing that helped me to this realizations, and regarding other people as real people

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:26.540
[Guest]: was also the change in my life circumstances. So when I went to the US, I gave up a lot

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:32.460
[Guest]: of things, right, I gave up a previous identity, I gave up the race that I was in, in favor

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:40.180
[Guest]: of something new. And I had to redefine these structures of my life. One of the early silly

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:46.140
[Guest]: little thing that I had was that I had lived a very nicely categorizable life, like quantifiable

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:50.860
[Guest]: life, you could measure success, what is a good day, this is the work I have today as

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:55.260
[Guest]: a researcher, this so much progress, I can measure it, I can put a percentage term to

01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:00.100
[Guest]: it, I can evaluate it as a monthly, yearly, six monthly basis and understand how well

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:06.300
[Guest]: I did. But as a creative person, how the hell do I find out what is a good day of work?

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:11.820
[Guest]: There are no numbers anymore. There is no way to quantify there are no good metrics.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.180
[Guest]: For a time, I became like really big on Google Calendar, like putting everything like there

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:19.700
[Guest]: is one year of my life, which is entirely on Google Calendar every single day, every

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:23.860
[Guest]: single hour. And I thought that would help, but it didn't. But anyway, the point of this

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:31.580
[Guest]: is that I was redefining a lot of life, life's understand purpose point, how I am who I am.

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.060
[Guest]: And I was in this new world, I was an immigrant in the new world. Part of what also helps

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:43.500
[Guest]: you to remain this, I am the only thing that matters in India is, it's nice, it's easy

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:49.300
[Guest]: if you're a male in India, right? So if you go to another place where you're suddenly

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:55.640
[Guest]: not the top dog, not at the top of the pyramid, you suddenly see that, oh, there is this pyramid.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.780
[Guest]: Because now I'm not at the top anymore, I get to see up and there is people above me

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:03.500
[Guest]: and I get to see also down sometimes. And then I see, oh, wait, I'm somewhere in the

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:09.600
[Guest]: middle here. So there is this whole structure here. And this was another way to sort of,

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.320
[Guest]: I needed to put myself somewhere, I needed to see where I belong, I needed to see who

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:19.020
[Guest]: I am, and what is this place, it's another line of curiosity that came in, right? So

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:25.900
[Guest]: I'm, I want to learn things I want to learn now about this world that I inhabit. So, sneaky

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:32.660
[Guest]: art started as my way, one of the reasons it became this way was that I wanted to unobtrusively

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:39.220
[Guest]: observe my world to see what this world is all about. Because I was in these alien places.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:44.020
[Guest]: While I was in Chicago for a few months, it was good, one of the most beautiful famous

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:50.100
[Guest]: cities of the world, buildings and tourist destinations and all kinds of people you can,

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.180
[Guest]: so much stuff for art. And I'm a sneaky artist, we kind of didn't go into how that started,

01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:02.820
[Guest]: we will again, but just coming to this point, is that I was trying to really just see how

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:08.060
[Guest]: things operate. Once I moved to Wisconsin, I wanted to see, now that I don't have these

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:13.860
[Guest]: big tourist attractions, these obvious artistic choices, it will look great, look at these

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.820
[Guest]: amazing skyscrapers of Chicago, everybody will want to see it. How do I find art now

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.700
[Guest]: in this world? It's a semi rural town I was in, I had no mental picture of, there were

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:27.580
[Guest]: no people who looked like me around, there were just other people. It was the start of

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:31.940
[Guest]: the Trump years. And I had all reasons to feel out of place and nervous. And like I

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:39.620
[Guest]: don't belong. I needed to find a way to belong. And art became my way to sort of discover

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:46.060
[Guest]: that. And this helped me to, to see other people, to observe other people, because I

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:51.420
[Guest]: didn't, I couldn't be obsessed with myself, because I knew that I don't matter here. So

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:57.220
[Guest]: I was sort of helped by these adverse circumstances to reject my ideas of myself. And to just

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:02.540
[Guest]: see because I desperately need to feel comfortable in this uncomfortable place. Because I'm such

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:07.580
[Guest]: an alien, I feel like an alien every day. So I need to look at these people, I need

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:12.060
[Guest]: to understand these people. And I need to find out the ways that they are not different,

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:17.580
[Guest]: but the ways that they are similar to me, so that I can feel that we have a bond, so

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.100
[Guest]: that I can feel comfortable about going to a cafe, which has only people who look completely

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.540
[Amit Varma]: different from me.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:29.060
[Amit Varma]: Does the looking change you like one of the things that I've noticed in myself, and I

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.780
[Amit Varma]: think in a lot of people, but it's there in differing degrees to people is how much of

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:37.700
[Amit Varma]: the world is invisible or unseen, as it were, to me that I go on the street, and I'm not

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:43.540
[Amit Varma]: even noticing most people right. And for you one, I imagine that the just the act of looking

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:48.240
[Amit Varma]: and looking with the kind of closeness that you must have looked would have changed something

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.980
[Amit Varma]: about you in some way, like in the context of podcasts, and you're also a podcaster.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:56.140
[Amit Varma]: And we'll talk about both of these in detail, as we go along both the public art and the

01:22:56.140 --> 01:23:01.720
[Amit Varma]: podcasting. But I do feel that doing these long episodes kind of forced me to listen

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:07.020
[Amit Varma]: much more and therefore, made me a better listener and maybe made me a better person

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:10.580
[Amit Varma]: on the margins, because I'm just listening more. And I'm not, it's not all about me,

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:14.580
[Amit Varma]: me. It's not about the ego. It's not about always trying to interrupt to show how smart

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.940
[Amit Varma]: you are, but actually kind of sit back and take it in and learn something. So do you

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:23.540
[Amit Varma]: feel that in that sense that not just the looking, also in the context of the podcast,

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.660
[Amit Varma]: you also now do long episodes, which are more than three hours, the looking, the listening,

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.660
[Amit Varma]: that they change the person you are that when you look at, say the Nishant who started drawing

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:36.380
[Amit Varma]: the web comics back in the day with the cynicism and the sarcasm and the cleverness and the

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:41.580
[Amit Varma]: biting wit, and you look at yourself today, where that cynicism and sarcasm and biting

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:45.020
[Amit Varma]: wit are not there, you're just sitting back and you're watching, or you're sitting back

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:50.180
[Amit Varma]: and you're listening. And do you think you're a fundamentally different person for that?

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:57.460
[Guest]: Yeah, it's it made me a much nicer person. I am a very patient listener. In fact, when

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:02.460
[Guest]: I draw, I'm an even more patient listener, because I don't interrupt at all. So the best

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:06.580
[Guest]: time to talk to me, if you want to say things to me, is to get me to start drawing things

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.340
[Guest]: because then I won't move for an hour and I'll be listening.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.620
[Guest]: I'm sure this is a lesson your wife is learning.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.100
[Guest]: This is the one pleasure she gets from the fact that I am likely to sit down anywhere

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.340
[Guest]: and start drawing, which is quite a problem when you go on vacation, that this guy just

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:24.180
[Guest]: takes out a sketchbook everywhere. And then he wants a half hour over here when we could

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:29.860
[Guest]: be doing something else. So it's a pros and cons. But as I like to remind her, this is

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:36.700
[Guest]: a good time to talk to me. I am listening. So like Frasier Crane. Yeah, so being an artist,

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:42.460
[Guest]: like the kind of artist I am, it has really made me very observant. And you're right exactly

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.700
[Guest]: that the way our life is right now, we don't give too much attention to things because

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.220
[Guest]: so many things demand our attention all the time. There is not only things around us.

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:58.740
[Guest]: So if you compare to 100 years ago, the amount of traffic, the amount of hoardings and signals

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.580
[Guest]: and people, all of these are things that requires little, little bits of attention, even just

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:10.240
[Guest]: to be aware of them. Then there's the phone. Maybe it rings, maybe it pings, maybe it doesn't.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.720
[Guest]: And there is the possibility that there is amazing stuff happening on Twitter right now.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.060
[Guest]: So that maybe there's something I'm missing out on is also another attention requirement

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.340
[Guest]: in the back of your head, which you have to sort of drill down and bury deep into you

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.500
[Guest]: in order to neglect that maybe I should just scroll Instagram for a bit just to see maybe

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:33.020
[Guest]: something amazing is happening, even if it isn't. I sometimes feel that just this, those

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:41.460
[Guest]: few seconds that I spend before I launch the app, that moment of expectation is the joy.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:46.980
[Guest]: That's a dopamine coming. The expectation of the dopamine is the dopamine at this point.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:51.900
[Guest]: So because inevitably, there's nothing interesting on Twitter, it aggravates me instead. But

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:56.700
[Amit Varma]: just the idea that maybe there could be, you never know, someone could be wrong on the

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:00.820
[Guest]: internet, and I could have to argue with I could get this golden opportunity. And just

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:06.500
[Guest]: that microsecond is the joy, in fact. So being an artist has made me a better observer. And

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:11.860
[Guest]: it has helped me to drown out these noises. So the only time I'm not actively thinking

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:17.700
[Guest]: and overthinking, which I am apt to do is when I'm drawing. The only time I'm not worried

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:22.740
[Guest]: about where I am and what million stupid things are running through my head anxieties is when

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:29.420
[Guest]: I'm drawing it, I'm at complete peace, just absolutely Zen. I am a little bit nervous

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.860
[Guest]: until I start to draw about where I am, are people looking at me, etc, etc. This is I'm

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:39.300
[Guest]: self conscious. But the moment I put the pen to the paper, I lose all of that those moments

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:44.140
[Guest]: are just so precious to me. And I speak to urban sketches on my podcast, and we talk

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:48.300
[Guest]: about this experience and what it does, why we do it. Because if you think about it, the

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:53.260
[Guest]: idea that there are grown adults who spend their precious leisure time walking around

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.500
[Guest]: the street sitting with a sketchbook drawing something, most of them are not going to sell

01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:02.900
[Guest]: that art. Most of them are not necessarily great artists, but they still do it. The vast

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:08.220
[Guest]: majority of the global urban sketching community and it is a huge growing community all over

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:13.940
[Guest]: the world. The vast majority of it are not professional artists. And those people absolutely

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:21.180
[Guest]: fascinate me, because they have a real articulated to themselves reason for for doing this. And

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:27.280
[Guest]: a reason that has nothing to do with an end. With another end. It's not a means to at the

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.460
[Guest]: end of making sales or becoming an artist or becoming big or sharing getting 5000 likes.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:38.620
[Guest]: The activity is the end itself. They are getting something from just doing this. And that is

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.180
[Guest]: the real joy that I acquire in my podcast as well. And I get this from people that it

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:50.100
[Guest]: doesn't matter how you draw, what it looks like is so irrelevant. Just that you spend

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:56.060
[Guest]: two hours doing it is the joy of that two hours is the real value that you really squeezed

01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:01.020
[Guest]: those two hours for everything. So I look through my sketchbook. Now, there is the things

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:05.140
[Guest]: that I drew. So there is the things that I looked at. But there are the things that I

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:10.460
[Guest]: didn't draw. I look through a sketchbook that is two years old. And I can remember sounds

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:15.060
[Guest]: I can remember if I was listening to a podcast or if I was overhearing a conversation. I

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:20.180
[Guest]: can I remember the smells I remember the temperature of the day I remember if it was windy. I remember

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:25.040
[Guest]: what it felt like to be sitting where I was sitting who was around me. All these senses

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.900
[Guest]: come rushing back. It's as if I'm in this hyper aware state. And all of those things

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:35.060
[Guest]: are locked into that page. And this is not just me. I'm not special in this. This is

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.580
[Guest]: a case for anybody who's doing this. This is consistent with all urban sketches I speak

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:46.140
[Guest]: to. It's simply the act of doing this, that does this to you the act of observation, and

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:52.860
[Guest]: the act of patient observation, the value of giving not just your attention, but really

01:28:52.860 --> 01:29:00.300
[Guest]: giving your time to something sustained attention. It's become so rare. We don't even do that

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.740
[Guest]: to the television we're watching. We watch TV and we're also scrolling at the same time

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.760
[Guest]: on our phones. Most television is watched like that now. But this is something because

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.460
[Guest]: it involves your hands and your eyes and you have to be sitting you can't be doing 10 different

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:20.700
[Guest]: things. And it pushes you to engage. And that is the most beautiful thing you can do. And

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:25.540
[Guest]: you find amazing art everywhere that you look once you start to do it.

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:29.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, you called it the Zen state, I guess people could call it flow or sportsman

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.500
[Amit Varma]: could call it you know, being in the zone. And it's weird that I find it very hard to

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:36.980
[Amit Varma]: come about and the other things I do like writing, for example, it's just very hard

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.540
[Amit Varma]: to get in the zone. Most of the time, it's just hard work and you kind of have to battle

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.740
[Amit Varma]: through it and get it done. But this kind of thing, just sitting and drawing something

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:52.140
[Amit Varma]: seems to me to combine two things. One is that your mind is kind of empty. It's not

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:56.300
[Amit Varma]: cluttered with other stuff happening. And at the same time, it's very focused on what

01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:00.740
[Amit Varma]: you're doing. And at the same time, there's a physical aspect to it where your hands are

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.740
[Amit Varma]: kind of moving and all of that. And you point out that many of the people you speak to also

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:09.700
[Amit Varma]: experience the same kind of flow doing this. So perhaps if you don't think of it as art,

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:14.060
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's something therapeutic and useful on its own. Is that what you'd say?

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:20.980
[Guest]: Well, so the word art is a very strange word. So many people define it in such terrible,

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:28.140
[Guest]: oppressive, prohibitive ways. Art with a capital A especially, it's a scary word. We would

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:31.940
[Guest]: rather not do it because we don't want to be pretending like we can do it because we're

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:40.140
[Guest]: not allowed to do it. Not anybody can just make art. Who am I to just make art? And I

01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:46.340
[Guest]: don't know if it helps to think of it like that. Or maybe the the key is to defeat this

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:51.420
[Guest]: terrible notion of what is art and oh my God, am I an artist? Maybe the key is to not think

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:57.260
[Guest]: like this and to just own the word. Yes, I am an artist. I can call it art. The definition

01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:02.260
[Guest]: of art is changing now so quickly because artists are able to reach so many people and

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:08.740
[Guest]: find success through so many channels on Instagram, YouTube, blah, blah, blah, TikTok. So there

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:14.920
[Guest]: is no one ladder. There is no single definition. This allows more people to own this term.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:21.540
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to say is that I think the real purpose of art is just this. Like

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:28.500
[Guest]: art is not supposed to be the job of an elite minority. Art is not about that, like you

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.340
[Guest]: compare it to writing. And that's a very interesting comparison. Because to me, writing is fun

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.900
[Guest]: after having done it. It's nice that I feel great the rest of the day having got it out

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:46.860
[Guest]: of me. But getting it out of me is an excruciating process. And I flip tabs and I do all kinds

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:53.940
[Guest]: of terrible, wrong things that Da Vinci could never have done. But I'm doing them. And when

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:59.000
[Guest]: I'm drawing, I'm not. So art is different from drawing from writing for me very much

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.900
[Guest]: because the joy of it is in the doing of it. And the result does not matter. I get the

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:11.020
[Guest]: same joy from the drawing I do today, as the drawing I did the first time I did it when

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:15.420
[Guest]: I went outside to draw, I look at the drawing and it's not as good. Obviously, I've really

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:21.300
[Guest]: become a much better artist in four, five years. But the level of joy is the same. And

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:28.060
[Guest]: it is very, very high. Once you tap into this idea, the reason why this is a good exercise

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:32.260
[Guest]: is not so that you become an artist, nevermind becoming an artist, don't don't draw all the

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:38.020
[Guest]: time, don't ever think about ever becoming good at it or selling. It's just a good idea

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:44.300
[Guest]: to get used to this habit, that some things are good just to do. Some things are good

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:52.060
[Guest]: just to do because spending time in a good way is a good idea. Getting used to this notion

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:58.140
[Guest]: that there are some things you can find joy from just in doing them is a very useful notion

01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:02.260
[Guest]: because then you start to seek it in other avenues in your life maybe. And that is how

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:09.180
[Guest]: you become a better person. You start to understand that some activities can bring me joy. Maybe

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.180
[Guest]: I should look for some other activities that are similar to this and you will find it for

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.780
[Guest]: a while running to me felt like the joy is only after the run. But now the process of

01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:25.020
[Guest]: the run is the joy even with aching limbs and everything. The time I spend running is

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:29.860
[Guest]: beautiful me time that I just enjoy. And incidentally, it is also you time because I'm often listening

01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:36.060
[Guest]: to your podcast while I run. But this idea, this concept that you should do things which

01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:43.060
[Guest]: bring you joy. It's amazing how easy it is to get used to it once you do a few drawings.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:46.820
[Guest]: And hopefully you carry it into other spheres of your life as well.

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:52.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, it also makes me sort of think about the notion of joy. Like I think a lot

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:56.740
[Amit Varma]: of things that we take happiness from, we take happiness from looking back at them,

01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, we'll remember a certain time, and we'll say, Oh, I was happy then. But the point

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.700
[Amit Varma]: is, if you were not in the moment, then, then you were nothing, you were not happy or sad

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.580
[Amit Varma]: or whatever shit was happening. And now in the looking back, you're finding the happiness.

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:13.100
[Amit Varma]: So there is a kind of happiness where you're almost forcing yourself to be happy, you look

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.180
[Amit Varma]: back on that and say, Oh, you know, I had such a lovely conversation with so and so

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:20.980
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, and that makes you happy. But then there's another kind of happiness, which

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.940
[Amit Varma]: is something that, you know, I wish I could have more of in my life where you're just

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.660
[Amit Varma]: happy in the moment, where the rest of that shit doesn't matter with the narratives you

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:32.460
[Amit Varma]: build around yourself don't matter at all. And I know what you mean by running because

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:37.020
[Amit Varma]: like a couple of years ago, I was like 20 kgs lighter and I was running and stuff. I

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.260
[Amit Varma]: remember running a 10k and I get some of that where initially like I remember one of the

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:46.460
[Amit Varma]: interesting things that made me you know, stay with running after I got into it was

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.980
[Amit Varma]: that every morning you might get up and there'll be many days where you think that hey, I don't

01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:54.740
[Amit Varma]: want to run today. But after you run, you're always glad you ran every single time there

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.980
[Amit Varma]: was not a single time that I regretted going out to run today, right? You just know that

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:05.260
[Amit Varma]: after the run, you'll be glad that you ran. And so I completely kind of get that analogy

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:11.140
[Amit Varma]: and does it then demand that you live a different kind of life? Like there is one kind of life

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:15.340
[Amit Varma]: where you're completely in the moment, you're drawing something or you're running, or maybe

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:18.980
[Amit Varma]: you're playing an instrument or whatever it is, but you're completely in the moment. And

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.580
[Amit Varma]: there's another kind of life where you are focused either on the past or the future,

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.940
[Amit Varma]: where for example, you might be trying to sell your art, you might be trying to chatting

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:33.020
[Amit Varma]: with a publisher and deciding publishing details or you might be talking to an event organizer

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:37.700
[Amit Varma]: and saying, hey, I'll come there and do this live drawing and all of that. And these seem

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.900
[Amit Varma]: therefore almost opposed to each other than the purest form of living, it would seem to

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:49.660
[Amit Varma]: me at one level is to ignore the hustle entirely, and just do the drawing. And you don't just

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:54.000
[Amit Varma]: do that you also do the other stuff. In fact, you know, after the break, one of the themes

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.700
[Amit Varma]: that I want to ask you a lot about is this sort of dual life that an artist like you

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.740
[Amit Varma]: lives where you're not just an artist, but you're also a salesman of your own art. You're

01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.780
[Amit Varma]: also an entrepreneur of your own brand, right, which are all impressive to me, you know,

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.860
[Amit Varma]: I'd love to be able to do the same things. But what are you really living for? And at

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:18.540
[Amit Varma]: one level and not as in what are you trying to live for? But as a general question, it

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.820
[Amit Varma]: would seem to me that you already have that what you're trying to live for, which is just

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.940
[Amit Varma]: being present in that moment and having that joy.

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:32.180
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think the reason why I draw is the same reason by another urban

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:39.700
[Guest]: sketcher who might be a lawyer or an architect draws, we are getting that joy in the moment.

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:44.620
[Guest]: Maybe the argument would then be that it helps the rest of life to go by to know that you

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:49.300
[Guest]: have this source of pure joy, you can do some other things just for the work, you can do

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.100
[Guest]: some other things for not the same kind of rewards, you are getting your rewards or your

01:36:54.100 --> 01:37:00.100
[Guest]: nice dopamine from this one activity. The Marwadi instinct in me is that of a salesman,

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:06.100
[Guest]: but I hate it. I hate doing it. I don't like I get I get a kick out of it. But sometimes

01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:12.300
[Guest]: I feel like I'd rather not. I hate thinking about money. Again, very wrong instinct considering

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.020
[Guest]: who I am. But I hate thinking about I hate thinking about money. And I'm terrible at

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:20.940
[Guest]: thinking about money and working with money and investing and just horrible at it. Never

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:27.380
[Guest]: know how much money I'm carrying or what I should do with it, etc. But being an artist,

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:33.280
[Guest]: I get certain joys from this act of being an artist. And that puts me in a frame of

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.500
[Guest]: mind where I feel like, okay, now I can do some of the work work things, the quote unquote

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:43.420
[Guest]: work things which are not the same, because I have done this. And now I want to take and

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:47.420
[Guest]: my business is being an artist. So therefore, my business is again related to the thing

01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:52.180
[Guest]: that I got joy from which is my art. But if I was not an artist, if I was just doing this,

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:57.060
[Guest]: I feel like this would make me simply a calmer person in the rest of my life. This I have

01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:01.780
[Guest]: this source for whenever I need pure joy, I get it from here. Now I can get on with

01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.700
[Guest]: the rest of my life and get whatever else I get from that.

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.020
[Amit Varma]: Superb. Let's take a quick commercial break now. And after the break, we'll come back

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:12.180
[Amit Varma]: to the story of your life and begin where we left off at Chicago.

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:23.420
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:27.460
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:32.300
[Amit Varma]: face is how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:37.100
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way, a couple of friends of mine run this

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:43.660
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.100

[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.300
[Amit Varma]: covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:02.300
[Amit Varma]: me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:07.140
[Amit Varma]: better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to

[Amit Varma]: the code UNSEEN. Up level yourself.

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:49.860
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with sneaky artist, Nishant Jain.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.620
[Amit Varma]: You know, Nishant, I should have, you know, randomly cornered you somewhere and recorded

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.540
[Amit Varma]: this conversation with you without your knowing it was being recorded. Now that would have

01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:02.780
[Amit Varma]: been sneaky and most kind of appropriate. So, you know, while digressing all over the

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.420
[Amit Varma]: place, we got enough through the linear journey of your life to find you in Chicago where

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:12.100
[Amit Varma]: you've to locate you in Chicago where you've decided that man, I want to be a writer and

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:16.220
[Amit Varma]: you know, this pyramid is not for me. I want to do the things that I love. The universe

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:21.640
[Amit Varma]: has given me permission as it were, and you move on to that. Now that's writer and then

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:27.020
[Amit Varma]: you become a sneaky artist. So take me through a little bit of that journey about drawing

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:31.660
[Amit Varma]: like were you into drawing from before that? How was all of that kind of working out?

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:37.500
[Guest]: So like most children, I was drawing and I was encouraged to draw but also like most

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:43.260
[Guest]: children when they grow up, drawing is something that kids do. So you stop doing it. So I stopped

01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:48.080
[Guest]: doing it like we were speaking before I started drawing these webcomics which were in my limited

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.100
[Guest]: ability of the time I was doing stick figures. They were quick turnaround like I have a joke

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:56.820
[Guest]: I can draw it and realize it in 30 minutes and post it. And instead of Facebook in those

01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.780
[Guest]: days was very generous, not like the Facebook it is today, I could reach my whole audience

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:06.780
[Guest]: and I did fairly well for myself. Now when I was at this juncture in Chicago, my idea

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:12.180
[Guest]: was that I'm a writer and I'm a cartoonist. And now that I'm doing this full time, both

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:18.320
[Guest]: of these things, I owe it to myself to do them better. And I had ambitions as a cartoonist

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.820
[Guest]: because I've also read graphic novels and I wanted to draw incredible deep things. Basically,

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:28.820
[Guest]: I wanted to tell stories that stick figures could not do justice to. I needed my figures

01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:34.340
[Guest]: to be recognizable. I needed them to be distinct. I needed to draw worlds that resembled actual

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:41.900
[Guest]: worlds, not just have them suspended in white ether. So I needed to learn how to draw. And

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.900
[Guest]: I tried to do these different things I did. Actually, before I became an urban sketcher

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.560
[Guest]: before sneaky art, I did this thing on Reddit. There's this subreddit called Reddit gets

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.600
[Guest]: drawn in which people post interesting photos of themselves and artists of various persuasions.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.540
[Guest]: They make portraits and they post it, you get upvoted and a lot of artists are there.

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:06.700
[Guest]: So as an aspiring artist, it is good because you see a reference photo and you see 20 realizations

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.900
[Guest]: of it in different styles. And as an aspiring artist, if you contribute, you get nice comments,

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:18.620
[Guest]: you get feedback. It's a very thriving subreddit. I drew maybe 400 portraits in like a year.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.740
[Guest]: Like I would sit in one sitting, I would make five portraits in half an hour. So quickly,

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:27.980
[Guest]: quickly, quickly. And this is a function of my inclinations that I draw quickly, that

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:32.060
[Guest]: I wanted to do things in one go. I didn't want to do layers and layers. I can think

01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:37.140
[Guest]: of it as lazy, but who you are sort of informs the art you make. And it's good to lean into

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:43.260
[Guest]: who you are. And I'll touch upon that a little later. But I wanted to be a better artist.

01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:47.500
[Guest]: And I knew that this needs me to draw more and more. I'm learning some skills from doing

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.940
[Guest]: these Reddit gets drawn portraits, but that's not enough. Like I need to know how to draw

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:56.340
[Guest]: cities and nothing is working. I need to put in the hours and I don't know how. So I needed

01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:02.660
[Guest]: to find things that I could merge together. And Chicago was perfect for that. I loved

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:09.100
[Guest]: the city. I wanted to explore it. How do I explore it? Let's take a sketchbook and I'll

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:14.860
[Guest]: have a reason to explore it. So I will get this kick of exploring the city. But the way

01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:19.860
[Guest]: to really look at it would be that I draw it. So I will keep drawing because the idea

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:23.860
[Guest]: is that I will go out with a sketchbook and I'll look at things and I'll draw the interesting

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:28.980
[Guest]: things I see. So if I combine my love for this and exploration of the city with drawing,

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.820
[Guest]: I'll build a sustainable drawing habit and eventually surely I will learn how to draw.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:39.380
[Guest]: That was the idea. Now, one more thing I did in this pursuit was one rule I set for myself

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:43.820
[Guest]: is that I will draw with a pen and I had a fountain pen, which is the fountain pen I

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:50.260
[Guest]: use today. And I will draw with this fountain pen, not a pencil because I have a perfectionist

01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:55.580
[Guest]: nature or a very exacting nature and I'm very cruel on myself. So I never finish things.

01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:00.760
[Guest]: I just keep erasing and redoing. And I needed to turn the page metaphorically and literally.

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:08.760
[Guest]: So fountain pen ink on paper, no steps backwards. Every line I draw is there in full contrast.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.900
[Guest]: So I can only finish drawings. I can't change them. And I can only draw again if I want

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:19.900
[Guest]: to improve and draw more if I want to improve. So this was a constraint I set upon myself.

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:25.100
[Guest]: Another theme I come in my podcast very often and we should talk about it again is constraints

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:31.820
[Guest]: bring freedom. They don't restrict you. They set you free. And I talk about how that this

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:38.100
[Guest]: manifests in different ways as an artist and how useful it is. But so I'm doing this. I'm

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:42.700
[Guest]: walking around Chicago and I'm drawing things in my sketchbook with a pen. Not very well,

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:49.580
[Guest]: but doing it every day. And I am a little not ashamed is not the word, but it's a little

01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:55.660
[Guest]: ridiculous. I think I'm a grown adult. It's too late for me to learn to draw. And I'm

01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:59.340
[Guest]: how am I going to explain this to anyone? What if they look at me? What do they last?

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:03.260
[Guest]: What are you doing? What will I say? I'm trying to learn how to draw. Like I'm a grown adult

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.140
[Guest]: who quit his job and is now trying to walk around drawing things. They laugh or I'll

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.980
[Amit Varma]: think I think they laugh. I think one of the things people don't realize is that there

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:16.700
[Guest]: is no such thing as a grown adult. No adult is grown. We're all just winging it. Yeah.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.360
[Guest]: So but when you make a nice practice out of beating yourself up, then all of these things

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:28.980
[Guest]: are the tools you use. So why not? So I wanted to hide. I'll go and I'll draw and I'll draw

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:34.500
[Guest]: quickly and I'll just get out of there before they see me. I will be sneaky. So the first

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:39.620
[Guest]: idea I had of sneaky art, the first definition I had of this word, and it has evolved since

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:50.300
[Guest]: then. So sneaky art 1.0 is that I am sneaky looking for art and I draw and within half

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:56.580
[Guest]: an hour before I'm conspicuous, I'm gone. And I kept doing this. And this is how I sort

01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:02.780
[Guest]: of learned how to draw better. I merged it with the love of the city and exploring the

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:08.680
[Guest]: city full of fantastic, crazy people. And what happened therefore also is that I realized

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:13.140
[Guest]: what are the things I like looking at? What are the things that catch my eye? And this

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:18.660
[Guest]: is such a nice thing to learn about yourself. Like what do you find interesting as a person?

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:22.380
[Guest]: And I didn't explicitly realize it at the time, but this is such a fantastic way to

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:27.700
[Guest]: become an artist, to know what you want to draw. All these years as a child and as a

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:32.220
[Guest]: young adult, when I was practicing how to draw, there were these how to draw books.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:38.580
[Guest]: Usme you have eyes with hyper-realistic detail. Usme you have body anatomies in hyper-realistic

01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:42.980
[Guest]: detail. You have birds and animals. These are incidentally none of the things I can

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:47.860
[Guest]: draw even today. I can't draw birds and animals. I can't draw hyper-realistic eyes and feet

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:54.140
[Guest]: and legs. I'm bad at it, but I'm a decently well-to-do artist who can't draw these basic

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:59.980
[Guest]: things because there's not a single way to become an artist. And from doing it this way,

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:08.100
[Guest]: from feeling like an outsider, forcing himself in, I chanced upon this thing. I'll only learn

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:13.220
[Guest]: if I keep drawing more and I'll only draw more if I draw the things I like. And by doing

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:16.660
[Guest]: this, I'm finding out, oh, these are the things I like. When I flip through the sketchbook,

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:21.820
[Guest]: I'm like, oh, this is what I look at. Oh, this is what I look at. Oh, this is what I

01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:24.700
[Guest]: found interesting in this space over here when I could have also been looking at this

01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:28.620
[Guest]: other thing. Specifically, what kind of things surprised

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.180
[Guest]: you about the way you look? Yeah, so this was to do with being an immigrant

01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:35.780
[Guest]: here, right? So I'm trying to understand this world, how it works. And I found the things

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:39.980
[Guest]: that fascinated me were the people. So you have this city where the temperature goes

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:45.900
[Guest]: from minus 40 to plus 40. 80 degrees of difference happens over the course of a year. And no

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:51.620
[Guest]: matter the temperature, these people go about their lives. I came upon this understanding

01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:59.500
[Guest]: of what is a city. So a city, if you think about it, has no reason to exist. It has only

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:06.120
[Guest]: one reason to exist. A city exists because humans need things. We want to get from A

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.380
[Guest]: to B. So there are roads. We want to get there efficiently. So there are buses on these roads

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:16.300
[Guest]: and there are bus stops. We might need money. So there are ATM machines and sometimes we

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:21.380
[Guest]: get tired. So there are cafes with coffees and there are places for lunch. So all of

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:25.700
[Guest]: these things are not natural things. They exist because of human need. And this is what

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:31.620
[Guest]: I was understanding. What is the way that people interact with things in their cities?

01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:37.980
[Guest]: How do people live in a city? What is the function of a city and how do people use these

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:43.780
[Guest]: various functions to get about their day? So I was fascinated by just the sea of humanity

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:49.540
[Guest]: you see at a metro station. These are all people from different social classes, different

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:55.060
[Guest]: economic classes, getting into this train to go from A to B. In this moment, we are

01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:59.860
[Guest]: all together. We are all trying to do the same thing. We don't know each other. We're

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:02.900
[Guest]: not looking at each other. We're not speaking to each other. We don't want anything to do

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:08.180
[Guest]: with each other maybe. But we are united in this common purpose and therefore this train

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:14.740
[Guest]: exists. I was thinking about how tall buildings are. And a building is only tall if there

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:21.580
[Guest]: is a human next to it. So I came upon this set of questions. Is a cafe a cafe if there

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:27.780
[Guest]: is no person drinking coffee inside it? What makes it a cafe is the person drinking coffee

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:33.560
[Guest]: inside it. I came upon this question when I was drawing a cafe. Realized that it is

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:40.220
[Guest]: until the point that I draw a person with a coffee, this is just an interior space.

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:45.700
[Guest]: Is it a mug unless there is coffee in it? It's just this thing made of ceramic. We give

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.780
[Guest]: it purpose. We give it value. We give it context. And that is how these things, a building is

01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:56.740
[Guest]: tall because humans are six feet or five feet tall. And a building is so many times taller

01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.940
[Amit Varma]: than us. That's what makes it tall. It's not just tall.

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:05.460
[Amit Varma]: At this point, there's a lovely poem by Vijay Shishadri I'll read out called Imaginary Number.

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.140
[Amit Varma]: Have you read this? I have not.

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:11.940
[Amit Varma]: Okay. Imaginary Number by Vijay Shishadri. The mountain that remains when the universe

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:17.280
[Amit Varma]: is destroyed is not big and is not small. Big and small are comparative categories.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And to what could the mountain that remains when the universe is destroyed be compared?

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.460
[Amit Varma]: This observes and is appeased. The soul scrambles across the screes. The scroll, like the square

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:32.140
[Amit Varma]: root of minus one, is an impossibility that has its uses.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.700
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, I remembered the mountain at the end of the universe.

01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:39.260
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, it's it's beautiful because I found myself thinking along these lines, the

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:45.460
[Guest]: more I did these things, that this exists because I am looking at it. This has meaning

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:50.980
[Guest]: because this random person came in here looking for a coffee. So this person is integral.

01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:56.340
[Guest]: If I want to say that I drew a cafe, I need to draw this person here who ordered the coffee

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.260
[Guest]: and is drinking it.

01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:03.700
[Guest]: And this taught me more about myself. Firstly, it begins without articulation. You just look

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:08.100
[Guest]: at something and you're interested, you find it curious. So if you walk through a city,

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:12.500
[Guest]: you observed a bunch of things, maybe you took pictures of a bunch of things on camera,

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:17.500
[Guest]: but there is a filter here. You take a picture already with the idea of is this thing worth

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:22.260
[Guest]: taking a picture of worth to whom, to me or to someone else?

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:27.060
[Guest]: You might think, is it something worth sharing on Instagram? So again, you immediately externalized

01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:32.220
[Guest]: to outside standards. Is this worth sharing on Instagram? Therefore, if it's not, I don't

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:37.780
[Guest]: need to notice it. I don't need to take a picture of it. But as an artist, I was spending

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:43.700
[Guest]: more and more time just without explicitly articulating it, just trying to discover what

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:48.260
[Guest]: excites me. If I looked at something, I would tell myself, okay, give it 10 minutes and

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:53.260
[Guest]: let's draw it. And in the process of drawing it, I would discover what I find beautiful

01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:58.180
[Guest]: about it. And therefore, in the process of this repeated exercise, I would find out these

01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:00.980
[Guest]: are the things that I find beautiful.

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:05.700
[Guest]: And this made me a better person over time. And I found this such a useful exercise. So

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:10.020
[Guest]: I did it more and more. I did this project called 30 days of Chicago, every day, new

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.300
[Guest]: side of Chicago and every day a drawing. And I kept going after that even like I just kept

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:20.820
[Guest]: drawing more and more and more things. And I posted something on Reddit on the Chicago

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:27.180
[Guest]: subreddit that I sat in this place and I saw the beautiful skyline of Chicago here it is.

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:34.300
[Guest]: And somebody reached out and said, do you sell prints? And this was a very crazy moment

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:40.220
[Guest]: for me, because up until this moment, I was thinking of myself as a cartoonist or a comic

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:46.940
[Guest]: artist. And the idea was that even if I draw well, the thing will sell because I will say

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:52.020
[Guest]: something witty or funny or profound next to it, there will be a word bubble, there

01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:59.000
[Guest]: will be a dialogue, there will be a caption. The idea that someone could want just the

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:06.340
[Guest]: art for what it is did not ever occur to me. And it was it took me aback that they just

01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:11.400
[Guest]: literally just the drawing, you want my drawing, I just drew it. I just sat for half an hour,

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:18.100
[Guest]: you want that and you will you'll pay me for it. And I sold it. And after that, I got a

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:26.060
[Guest]: few requests on Instagram. And this thing kept happening. And I came to this understanding

01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:30.180
[Guest]: that I was in this new place. These people don't know me. They don't care that I wrote

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:34.700
[Guest]: for this YouTube channel in India. They don't know that I had a blog. What are they seeing

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:40.940
[Guest]: me as if I keep calling myself a writer cartoonist? They think I'm what am I talking about? They

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:45.980
[Guest]: don't even understand it because they know me for sneaky art. More and more people are

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:51.860
[Guest]: knowing me for sneaky art, and they don't know this other side of me. Am I now an artist?

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:58.540
[Guest]: I had to kind of rationalize that this reality that if people see know me as only for my

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:05.180
[Guest]: art, and they want my art and I'm selling art, do I get to use this word artist now?

01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:11.420
[Guest]: And I was so hesitant, like this word held all these various meanings in my head, which

01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:17.100
[Guest]: I felt I wasn't qualified to use. I learned to accept it over time that I guess I'm an

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:23.020
[Guest]: artist slash writer. I also write but I guess primarily I draw because yeah, that's what

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:26.700
[Guest]: I'm doing every day. I'm not writing every day anymore. I'm just drawing every day. And

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:31.180
[Guest]: I'm getting so much out of it that I keep doing it. Then we move to Wisconsin. And suddenly

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:37.460
[Guest]: I was drawing in Wisconsin and there was not those iconic sites. So there aren't photogenic

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:44.900
[Guest]: things anymore. Now what do I draw? And now I discovered that now in a more concentrated

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:50.260
[Guest]: form my art is telling me who I am. Because now those external things are gone. They aren't

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:56.780
[Guest]: Instagram worthy sites. Hashtag Chicago can't be used. Hashtag Eau Claire or hashtag Wisconsin

01:54:56.780 --> 01:55:00.980
[Guest]: is what I use. Not a big hashtag. Not so many people care about it. It's not so iconic.

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:08.580
[Guest]: I don't get the same likes. So those external factors of choosing this subject are gone.

01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:13.700
[Guest]: Now why did I draw this thing? And I realized more and more that this is about me. And this

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:19.300
[Guest]: is about my artistic journey. So I started doing it from a new perspective now. Now I'm

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:23.800
[Guest]: doing it because I'm in this new part of the world whose mental picture I only have from

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.980
[Guest]: watching that 70s show when I was a kid. That's all I know what Wisconsin might be like. And

01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:37.020
[Guest]: I feel like such a stranger. And maybe if I draw things, I will feel a little more comfortable.

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:44.380
[Guest]: The only excuse I have for sitting in this cafe for one hour, not feel awkward and out

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:50.460
[Guest]: of place is if I have my sketchbook. Sketchbook was sort of holding me there. Observation

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:56.660
[Guest]: was making me at that same time bond with people from a distance. Like, yeah, I ordered

01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:01.020
[Guest]: that coffee. They ordered the same coffee. This is how I might have sat at a cafe with

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:05.300
[Guest]: a friend the way that they are sitting here. When I would go to the park in summer and

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.940
[Guest]: I would see people sprawled on the grass and I'm enjoying the grass in the same way and

01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.620
[Guest]: I'm watching them and I'm making a drawing or something like that from a distance. It

01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:18.300
[Guest]: made me feel all these common things that we have. I might not have sat on the grass

01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.300
[Guest]: for an hour in the park if I didn't have my sketchbook. I would just feel self-conscious

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:28.660
[Guest]: out of place and I would leave. But this sketchbook gave me the mandate to do this thing. And

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:34.260
[Guest]: sneaky art became this other thing that I reached sneaky art 2.0. So this other thing

01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:45.260
[Guest]: was that sneaky art exists. Everywhere. In plain sight. It is sneaky. It needs you to

01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:51.940
[Guest]: look for it. Once you start to look at it, you see it everywhere. It has to be believed

01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:58.180
[Guest]: to be seen. It's not about me being sneaky anymore. It's now about me being the observer

01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:04.240
[Guest]: who waits patiently for these magical moments to happen. So I was looking for what I described

01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:11.180
[Guest]: as moments of accidental art. So when you're at a cafe and two people are talking and right

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:15.820
[Guest]: behind them, someone comes to place another order at the counter and this juxtaposition

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:21.020
[Guest]: of three figures happens. It's this moment, you know, these worlds have collided. Two

01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:25.180
[Guest]: people are at a cafe. They are talking to each other. That's two worlds colliding. And

01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:30.780
[Guest]: then this other person comes and just from my vantage, my point of view, they make this

01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:35.780
[Guest]: composition, three people, one person standing tall, two people in the foreground, and this

01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:40.700
[Guest]: triangle is formed just from my point of view. If I sat somewhere else, it might have looked

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:46.620
[Guest]: different. But just from this point of view, it exists in this beautiful artistic moment.

01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:53.000
[Guest]: My job as a sneaky artist is to register this moment before it is lost. So I make it my

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:02.340
[Guest]: job now to walk around and capture these moments out of the relentlessly changing flux of life

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:06.900
[Guest]: in busy places. These moments of accidental art.

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:12.540
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about how your art itself sort of evolved through these processes like, you

01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:16.700
[Amit Varma]: know, one of your newsletter posts, I came across this pro tip where you write, quote,

01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:21.460
[Amit Varma]: to draw quickly begin with what is most interesting, put it in the middle, then radiate outwards

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:25.280
[Amit Varma]: for as long as you're interested. And I'll, you know, link that post, obviously from the

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:28.980
[Amit Varma]: show notes. And there's actually a video where you sort of show yourself drawing, you put

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:33.060
[Amit Varma]: something in the middle and you kind of radiate outwards at another point where you write

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.700
[Amit Varma]: about this phrase, which you use a lot in your posts, tiny people, and you write quote,

01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:42.820
[Amit Varma]: there's a philosophy to drawing tiny people akin to phenomenology, I strip away the layers

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:47.620
[Amit Varma]: of obfuscation and distill every person to the essential lines, I remove all that separates

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.700
[Amit Varma]: them from me and leave only the things we universally recognize the art of tiny people

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:57.060
[Amit Varma]: brings us to the things themselves. And then you have a link to a post which explains that.

01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:04.260
[Amit Varma]: So I imagine that at some level, does it then involve trying to draw less, just getting,

01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:08.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, more minimal, trying to draw less trying to capture the essence. And then this

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:14.420
[Amit Varma]: also brings me to the question of, like at one level for an artist for a visual artist,

01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:19.900
[Amit Varma]: there is a pressure of fidelity, how accurately am I capturing something does what I am drawing

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:24.700
[Amit Varma]: look like the real thing in front of me. But at some point, I guess this begins to shift

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.420
[Amit Varma]: towards just capturing the essence of it. Because what is fidelity? I mean, everybody's

01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:32.540
[Amit Varma]: looking at everything in a different way. You know, what do you see of it? So how did

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.940
[Guest]: your thinking and your art evolve around all this? Yeah, yeah. So you've touched on two

01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:42.820
[Guest]: points of, like, these are two things that I use to inform my raw thinking. So when I

01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:48.340
[Guest]: got into this business of articulating myself, so when I started the newsletter, it the idea

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:53.940
[Guest]: of the newsletter was that every week, I need to talk about my drawings. What do I need

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:58.900
[Guest]: to say? I don't know. But I need to get better at talking about communicating my art. This

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:02.820
[Guest]: was part of being in the business of selling art, which I started in Wisconsin. And we'll

02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:08.700
[Guest]: go into that rewind to that a little later. But the idea of phenomenology then came to

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:12.920
[Guest]: me because I'm reading about these various ideas. And I read this book, which was recommended

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:17.260
[Guest]: by our group, incidentally, it's called the it's called at the existentialist cafe by

02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:22.700
[Guest]: Sarah Bakewell. And it's a fantastic book, which introduced me to the concept of phenomenology,

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:29.180
[Guest]: which is that learning to see things as they are, and not through the way that we recognize

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:35.780
[Guest]: them. And this was something that philosophers did in order to, in order to see things without

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:41.860
[Guest]: judgment. But I realized that this is what I do as an artist all the time. This is the

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:47.100
[Guest]: way to draw difficult things to not be intimidated by what I know it looks like. So if I'm drawing

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:52.180
[Guest]: someone's face, if I get into this loop in my mind of own the nose, the nose looks like

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:56.020
[Guest]: this. And I run through all these images of the nose in my mind, I don't draw what is

02:00:56.020 --> 02:01:00.820
[Guest]: in front of me, I draw what is in my head of what a nose should look like, and my best

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:06.940
[Guest]: representation of it. So I have to do what is in front of me. So I have to reject the

02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:13.020
[Guest]: notions of it that I had before, I have to see it very carefully, but I have to not recognize

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:19.620
[Guest]: it. Therefore, I have to see the things as they are, not as I know them. And this vibed

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:25.500
[Guest]: with phenomenology in a beautiful way, like I thought it was just perfect how it synced.

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:29.920
[Guest]: That's why I sort of articulated it in this manner. The minimalism though, is a function

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:36.140
[Guest]: of me. I don't think that is a necessary prerequisite of art. That is just me with my inclinations

02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:42.380
[Guest]: and my idiosyncrasies. I'm a mechanical engineer, we optimize, I want to say more with less,

02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:47.580
[Guest]: I am a lazy person, I optimize, I want to say more with less work. I am a sneaky artist,

02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:53.260
[Guest]: I have less time. So I do not have the luxury of drawing things with millions of lines.

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:58.240
[Guest]: Not to mention, I want to capture what is it that I'm interested by, I want to capture

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:03.560
[Guest]: transient human activity. I can't afford to take time because it is gone. And I'm going

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.580
[Guest]: to capture it while it is there in front of me. So I needed to minimize my lines. And

02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:14.080
[Guest]: I needed to say more with less lines because I needed to draw those things very quickly.

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.180
[Guest]: So the idea of starting at a point of interest was crucial. It's a case of form follows function.

02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:23.860
[Guest]: I'm trying to draw these things. I'm trying to draw a person who might leave any moment

02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:28.040
[Guest]: in a train, I don't know which stop they'll get off at, it could be the next stop. What

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:33.500
[Guest]: do I need to do in order to make this not a pointless drawing? Why did I want to draw

02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:39.740
[Guest]: that person? I'm going to start there. This happened because I needed to draw quickly,

02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:46.080
[Guest]: but it therefore trained me to learn to spot what it is that caught my interest. Now I

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.240
[Guest]: can explicitly immediately see this is what catches my interest because I've done it half

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.120
[Guest]: a million times I've done this with people I have looked at somebody tried to draw them

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:59.200
[Guest]: and they left and it was incomplete. But I could see where I started and why I started

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.960
[Guest]: there that is a good part of my artistic process start at the point of interest and the point

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.280
[Guest]: of greatest interest so that even if the person is lost, I have got something that I wanted.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.080
[Guest]: Even if it's not a complete drawing, I have got something that I wanted from it. This

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.480
[Guest]: was it satisfied my craving of having done that drawing. So the speed is also a function

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:24.000
[Guest]: of the situation. The minimalism is also a function of the situation. This idea of tiny

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.920
[Guest]: people is a useful exercise in this. So tiny people drawings are made at traffic lights.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:35.880
[Guest]: I'm sitting in a corner cafe looking at people at a traffic intersection. 10 seconds, maybe

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:42.760
[Guest]: if I'm lucky, I get 15 seconds, then they're gone. How can I capture a human form in that

02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:49.400
[Guest]: little time looking, starting to draw, finishing to draw and then they're gone. All of this

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:55.000
[Guest]: happens and there is no time for hesitation. There isn't only instinct. Ancillary effect

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.800
[Guest]: of this is you learn to trust your instinct. So I ask participants in my workshops to do

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:05.120
[Guest]: speed drawing, not because speed drawing is an end in itself. I don't want you to be speed

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:10.840
[Guest]: artists, but I need you to be quick to identify what interests you. I need you to be quick

02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:17.320
[Guest]: to identify over time why it interests you. And I need you to be quick at seeing. You

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:23.720
[Guest]: need to see faster. You need to register more things at first glance. And that these are

02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:28.560
[Guest]: useful habits, whether after that you take three hours or three weeks to compose a piece,

02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.080
[Guest]: it doesn't matter. But all these skills are useful skills for you to have, to be able

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:37.320
[Guest]: to zero in on what is your interest. This will make you a better artist. Don't try to

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:41.560
[Guest]: draw these things that you don't want to draw. There is no single standard of art anymore.

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:45.560
[Guest]: Just draw what you want to draw. You look at my tiny people drawings. There are no feet.

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:52.400
[Guest]: I don't like to draw shoes, so I don't draw shoes. Their legs end as stumps, so to say.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:56.960
[Guest]: It's my style now. Style is also something that develops in this way. Style develops

02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.760
[Guest]: when we lean into these things that are our idiosyncrasies. So there's this quote that

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:07.040
[Guest]: I share in my blog posts and my podcast often. It's by my favorite musician, Miles Davis.

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:16.040
[Guest]: He says, once is a mistake, twice is an idea, three times is style. So we think that as

02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.760
[Guest]: creatives, our job is to erase our mistakes. By drawing with a pen, I could not erase my

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:26.760
[Guest]: mistakes. By drawing quickly, I did not have the chance to think about my mistakes. I could

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:32.560
[Guest]: only move forward. And by doing this again and again and again, and insisting on drawing

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:38.600
[Guest]: what I care about, I developed more ideas about what is it that I like? What is it that

02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:43.000
[Guest]: I don't like? If I have only 10 minutes, why should I draw the things I don't like? What

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.520
[Guest]: if I didn't draw the things I don't like? What if I only drew the things I like? Can

02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:52.720
[Guest]: that be a completed piece also? Let's see. I'll do it today. I'll do it again tomorrow.

02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:57.720
[Guest]: Let's see what happens if I do it 50 times. This is how you develop style. These ideas

02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:04.160
[Guest]: reiterated so many times over so many pages, never stepping back, never editing is what

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:08.800
[Guest]: developed into what eventually became my style. And I honestly have thought about the word

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:14.240
[Guest]: style for so many years. And I've always thought it's too late. Like you have style or you

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.760
[Guest]: don't. Like I can't develop a style anymore. I'm too old for that. Like you have to be

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:22.920
[Guest]: a genius to have your own style. And I remember the first time I was with an urban sketchers

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.360
[Guest]: group in Minneapolis. And someone said to me that, you know, I can identify your drawing

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:32.520
[Guest]: immediately you have a distinct style. And that's the first time it occurred to me that

02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:38.880
[Guest]: wow, I have a style. How did this happen? It came from following these first principles

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:45.960
[Guest]: and which were all necessary to my inclinations and my ideas and my circumstances that that

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:50.920
[Guest]: became what it became. And that led to tiny people that led to understanding what draws

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:57.520
[Guest]: me to tiny people. So the word Sonder, the ideas of existentialism, even the quote by

02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:02.680
[Guest]: by Sartre about hell is other people. That's such a beautiful, insightful quote. And it's

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:07.760
[Amit Varma]: so important to me how that works. Yeah, thinking about style is interesting. Like just thinking

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:12.880
[Amit Varma]: aloud it strikes me that look at one level, all of us are exactly the same. You know,

02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:17.680
[Amit Varma]: what appear to be differences between us are differences of happenstance in terms of slight

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.280
[Amit Varma]: tweaks in our genetic code. And, you know, the circumstances around us, the small differences

02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:27.080
[Amit Varma]: in nature and nurture, as it were. And therefore, it could be argued that these differences

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:31.480
[Amit Varma]: might appear as weaknesses, because they don't fit in with whatever, you know, the average

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:35.560
[Amit Varma]: view of the world is. But see, in another way, they are what make us unique, perhaps

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.800
[Amit Varma]: by accident, but they are the style. You know, this chess tournament called Tata India, just

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:45.000
[Amit Varma]: got over in Calcutta, in fact, your home city, your hometown, and your home city, sorry,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.760
[Amit Varma]: I shouldn't call it a town, Bengalis everywhere will be mad at me. Omito mito, half Bengali,

02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:54.120
[Amit Varma]: we thought you're one of us. The Blitz section was won by a guy called Levon Aronian. And

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:58.240
[Amit Varma]: he was being asked about the tournament where he was trying to explain that he played badly.

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And he was sort of talking about how he played badly and he made so many mistakes. He was

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.440
[Amit Varma]: being interviewed by this guy called Sagar Shah and Sagar asked him that, do you feel

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:10.400
[Amit Varma]: bad about the mistakes you made? And he said, No, I feel not bad about the mistakes I made

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.120
[Amit Varma]: because they're old mistakes. They are who I am. And it's obviously a matter of concern

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:19.920
[Amit Varma]: that I'm repeating them. But I'm glad that they're old mistakes and there are no new

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:24.480
[Amit Varma]: mistakes. So the question that sprung to my mind was the one Sagar now asked that aren't

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:28.760
[Amit Varma]: you, you know, concerned that old mistakes are popping up again? And he said, No, because

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.560
[Amit Varma]: I know them, you know, they're familiar to me, they are who I am, in the sense that,

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, some people will have a knee problem, some people will have a back problem, you'll

02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.360
[Amit Varma]: have back pain, once in a while, you'll learn to manage it. And you will not get worried

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.320
[Amit Varma]: if the back pain springs up, because it's part of you and you'll learn to manage it

02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.680
[Amit Varma]: again. But if some new problem happens somewhere, like you get a heart attack, then that's a

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:53.320
[Amit Varma]: problem. So if it's an old weakness, I don't kind of mind it because I know how to control

02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:59.100
[Amit Varma]: it, I've controlled it before, which struck me as a very profound point, because my assumption

02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:02.960
[Amit Varma]: would have been that what you want to do is you want to eliminate the old mistakes. And

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:07.120
[Amit Varma]: if you make new mistakes, and you eliminate them after that, and it's a linear process.

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.160
[Amit Varma]: But his point is, once you settle into like, what is your style, your style is a way you

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.320
[Amit Varma]: think, given a form, right? And if you think in a particular way, you think in a particular

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.400
[Amit Varma]: way, it is who you are, I guess, in your case, some of the things which would be considered

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.000
[Amit Varma]: style like the minimalism or, you know, drawing stumps, because you don't like shoes, you

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.640
[Amit Varma]: know, others could look at them and call them weaknesses and say, Hey, you can't do hyper

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:33.080
[Amit Varma]: realistic eyes. But your style is what it is. And these weaknesses would have pushed

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.960
[Amit Varma]: you, I suppose, into an area of strength, where you can just take one look and kind

02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:41.440
[Amit Varma]: of locate the essence of something and put that down quickly before the person gets up

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.360
[Guest]: to exactly. So in my urban sketching community, there are many artists who this is another

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:51.520
[Guest]: recurring topic of conversation on the show, even in person with other urban sketchers

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.640
[Guest]: that you can sit side by side with somebody on the same bench, look in the same direction,

02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.880
[Guest]: and draw entirely different things. Because of our inclinations, because of our skills,

02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:05.680
[Guest]: and because of everything being a function of the way you draw, right? So like you mentioned,

02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:11.880
[Guest]: I draw quickly, and somebody draws hyper realistically. So what that means to me, as an advantage

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:17.680
[Guest]: part of it is that there are opportunities to draw that occur to me that do not even

02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:23.200
[Guest]: occur to them. I make drawings when I'm standing in a queue, like five minutes, maybe and we're

02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.440
[Guest]: done. But I'll draw quickly with a pen and I'll finish a drawing in that time. But that's

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:32.280
[Guest]: not even enough time for them to get out their things, get out their tools. So that is not

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:37.160
[Guest]: a situation in which they can draw. Those are not subjects they can ever capture. Only

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.800
[Guest]: I can capture them because of the temporal nature of those transient nature of those

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:47.440
[Guest]: subjects and those scenes. So there is the disadvantage, you can argue that all the realism

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.200
[Guest]: is lost, you don't have the you're not you're not representing the reality in the same way.

02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.000
[Guest]: I think that's entirely unnecessary as an artist. And we should let's talk about the

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:03.400
[Guest]: end of art as it is called by Arthur Danto who talked about it. I see the benefit as

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:09.240
[Guest]: me capturing a world which is changing very quickly. And me offering something about that

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:16.320
[Guest]: world in my style in my way of seeing it in my way of representing it. That does the same

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:22.520
[Guest]: job like I spoke once Episode 15 of my podcast is with this person. He's a war illustrator.

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:29.200
[Guest]: So he draws in war zones. He goes to Syria and with a pot of ink and watercolors and

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:36.240
[Guest]: a big board with art paper on it and he sits and he paints in a war torn country in refugee

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:40.720
[Guest]: camps. He went to Myanmar, he went to the Eastern European border with migrants coming

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:46.320
[Guest]: in with in Kenya with the economic crisis. He was drawing and painting there. So I asked

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.840
[Guest]: him this thing that you're doing you're doing this stuff here. What does it matter that

02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:56.440
[Guest]: you made a painting in Syria? Like you could have taken a photo, you could have made a

02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:01.200
[Guest]: video, you could have broadcasted live to everybody. You could have made a TikTok video.

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:05.320
[Guest]: What does a painting matter in this time of multimedia content and instantaneous multimedia

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.760
[Guest]: content? You took an hour to make one scene. What like why is that good? What what uses

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:19.920
[Guest]: that? His answer was interesting to me. His answer was that people really look at a painting

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.520
[Guest]: and I extrapolated based on what he said because I had had thoughts like this as well. And

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.960
[Guest]: as a control engineer, I thought of information. So if you look at a picture, a picture has

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:38.720
[Guest]: a certain amount of information, color, shadows, details, it captures everything in its point

02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.440
[Guest]: of view with an equal amount of focus. Everything is equally focused, everything is equally

02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:52.240
[Guest]: detailed. And we live in an age where we have access to all the pictures in the world. You

02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.760
[Guest]: can't really shock anyone with anything. Everybody's seen everything somewhere or the other. Nothing

02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:04.280
[Guest]: is amazing. So this, we have reached a level of jadedness with photography. It's unfortunate

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:09.520
[Guest]: and it makes life very difficult for genuinely talented photographers. But people are not

02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:14.640
[Guest]: impressed by photos anymore, the unfortunate reality of our time. What a drawing does in

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:20.080
[Guest]: this time, what does a simplistic drawing like mine or even his one hour representation,

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:25.360
[Guest]: surely he doesn't have the same details as a photograph, because he's perturbed by his

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.200
[Guest]: situation. He's not comfortable all the time. It's hot. That plays an impact on he's uncomfortable.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:35.200
[Guest]: So how does that pan out in his drawings? He's afraid of what's happening around him.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.580
[Guest]: How does that pan out in his details? He doesn't have the luxury of putting in the details

02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:44.480
[Guest]: like a fine art painting made over weeks and months. So a lot of instantaneous momentary

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:52.040
[Guest]: things are captured. So it's not fully detailed. But you don't need fully detailed. What a

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:57.920
[Guest]: drawing does, in my opinion, this is just me thinking out and why I feel like I've sold

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.760
[Guest]: a lot of art in person and I speak to people who buy my art in front of me and I asked

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:08.280
[Guest]: them why. And I'm building upon those that feedback as well. Is that incomplete information

02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:13.960
[Guest]: has a lot of value. incomplete information, which is a drawing, not a photograph, it my

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:19.520
[Guest]: drawing is an ink drawing of certain shapes, no colors, no shadows, so much information

02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:25.200
[Guest]: is lost, taken away by me. What I'm offering is what I saw. So it is again filtered by

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.400
[Guest]: my personality and my skill level, no feet, only stumps. So again, my inclinations, my

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:37.080
[Guest]: abilities, incomplete information invites engagement. People look at it and then they

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:42.840
[Guest]: fill the spaces. They look at it and they imagine the colors that will go there. They

02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:47.800
[Guest]: look at it and they see that Oh, this is what you saw. Why did you see this? They know that

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.640
[Guest]: it is your perspective. It is not the objective truth, so they don't feel threatened by it.

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.800
[Guest]: There is no insistence that this is the truth. It is implicit that this is just what I felt

02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:03.280
[Guest]: what I saw and how I drew it. George, my guest in episode 15, he said, every illustration

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.920
[Guest]: is biased towards its subject. You could make a painting of Saddam Hussein, but the act

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:14.600
[Guest]: of making that painting, the act of drawing the contours of someone's face, getting the

02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:20.760
[Guest]: colors and someone's physique and all of those things, it is an act of appreciation, not

02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.480
[Guest]: of the person, but simply of the thing in front of you, the phenomenological thing in

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.960
[Guest]: front of you, like not the person you as you identify them. And that is what communicates

02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:36.640
[Guest]: to another person when they look at a painting. So this is a very powerful thing. When you

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:43.000
[Guest]: get somebody to engage, you buy time. Time is the literal most powerful thing as an artist

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.160
[Guest]: that I could want. If I can get someone to spend time with something that I drew and

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.400
[Guest]: they really look at it, that's all. That's all that matters. There's this quote by Kandinsky.

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:56.520
[Guest]: Do you know the artist Kandinsky? I've heard of him. Yeah. So he's supposed to be the father

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:03.160
[Guest]: of surrealism, I think. Or maybe is it cubism? But I think surrealism. His quote is that

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:08.480
[Guest]: look at a painting and and I'm paraphrasing. I don't remember the quote exactly. But he

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:17.160
[Guest]: says that look at a painting and just lose yourself in it. If it has for a moment taken

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:22.160
[Guest]: you out of your world, if it has it has enabled you to move in a plane that you had never

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:31.040
[Guest]: seen before, what more can you ask for? The idea being that what is the purpose of art?

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:36.920
[Guest]: The purpose of art is only to give us that moment where we are not in our world anymore.

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:42.240
[Guest]: For a moment, we are in another world. It has these different rules. My world does not

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:47.600
[Guest]: have colors. It has only lines. My world does not have precise shapes. People like that.

02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:52.120
[Guest]: It's a nice release from their world. It's a nice release from all this information that

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:57.680
[Guest]: is always assaulting our eyes. A little less information maybe but maybe a little more

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:04.740
[Guest]: to feel then. Makes it a little easier to feel if you take away all this burden of information.

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:10.640
[Guest]: So I am very firmly against the concept of realism in art as this is just an artistic

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:15.480
[Guest]: inclination. And this is how I feel this kind of minimalism adds value.

02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:19.960
[Amit Varma]: So to go by Kandinsky's quote, what artists had that impact on you that you looked at

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:22.200
[Amit Varma]: their work and you got lost in their work?

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:29.640
[Guest]: Yeah, so a lot of artists who I didn't understand. So someone like Dali or Picasso, like, I don't

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.360
[Guest]: know what's happening. And this kind of fine art is interesting. You know, this kind of

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:40.540
[Guest]: fine art is not, we keep asking too much from it. We keep asking stupid questions like,

02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:45.960
[Guest]: what is he trying to say? What does it mean? These are all such wrong questions like and

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:50.480
[Guest]: I learned that they are wrong questions from being an artist. And all this time I would

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:55.440
[Guest]: look at fine art and modern art and what is this? Like, what is it? What's the point?

02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:01.960
[Guest]: Wrong question. That's not that's not the question. The job is just to experience it.

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:08.800
[Guest]: To suspend judgment, again, the phenomenologist, to not see things as they are to just let

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:16.200
[Guest]: it happen, whatever it is. Just this exercise has value. It doesn't matter what kind of

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:20.360
[Guest]: art it is. It doesn't matter if it's hyper realistic, it doesn't take hyper realistic

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:25.000
[Guest]: art. So you know, like people like Renoir, people like impressionists, not hyper realistic

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.720
[Guest]: anymore, but someone like Monet. So I was in Chicago, I was lucky enough to see some

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:35.160
[Guest]: of the best art in the world, Van Gogh and Monet and Rembrandt and Seurat who did pointillism.

02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:39.320
[Guest]: And it's a different kind of appreciation. You look at it from 50 feet away, it looks

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.360
[Guest]: like something you come closer and closer and closer and the resolution breaks because

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:47.600
[Guest]: now you can see the brush strokes. So the shapes aren't consistent. Now you can see

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.360
[Guest]: it as a mess of color. And now you can understand it as that and then you move away again and

02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.440
[Guest]: suddenly those shapes resolve into things that you recognize. So it's an experience

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.080
[Guest]: how you like it. Van Gogh is so important to me, not only for his art, but just for

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:08.720
[Guest]: the persistence of the artist. He had colors in his mind that he was seeing that were not

02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.960
[Guest]: real. He was seeing compositions that were not real. He was seeing stars behave in a

02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:19.320
[Guest]: way that is not real. And he was showing it to us in that way. This job, the way the artist

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:24.000
[Guest]: brings you into their world. One of the artists really important to me is MC Escher. And Escher

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:31.760
[Guest]: played tricks with you. He represented these amazing mathematical concepts in just graphical

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:38.000
[Guest]: prints, woodcut prints, the amount of work that takes. And he's not even a mathematician.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.760
[Guest]: The concepts that he's talking about, the things you understand when you become a student.

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.200
[Guest]: So I sort of became a student of art in a sense in this way. I've never studied it.

02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:50.640
[Guest]: I don't know these movements of art that exist. And I don't, I can't tell you cubism from

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:55.440
[Guest]: Surrealism or any of that, Dadaism, etc. I have no idea. But I just know that I look

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.000
[Guest]: at this thing, it looks interesting. Let's try and find out what this is about. I look

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.680
[Guest]: at this guy and Egon Schiele is a tragic, interesting figure. His figures, his people

02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:09.120
[Guest]: are have these long extended limbs and these striking poses and colors. And I want to know

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.160
[Guest]: why, why did he do this? So I try to find out more about him. I find equal fascination

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.840
[Guest]: in artists 300 years old and artists who I follow on Instagram today, because it's all

02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:24.600
[Guest]: art. It doesn't matter where it's from. If it has the power to move you, just enjoy that.

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:28.160
[Guest]: Enjoy being kicked a little bit out of your out of phase.

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so there's this interesting story about you mentioned Surat and pointillism. So he

02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:38.660
[Amit Varma]: had made this famous painting called a Sunday afternoon on the island of La Grande Charte.

02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And there's an interesting story about it that it was at one point made into a musical

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:47.440
[Amit Varma]: called Sunday in the Park with George by James Lepine and Stephen Sondheim. And when Stephen

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:51.200
[Amit Varma]: Sondheim saw this painting for the first time, do you know what he said? What?

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:56.360
[Amit Varma]: Kya surat hai, kya surat hai, kya surat hai. Sorry, I had to get my one bad joke out of

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.360
[Guest]: the frame.

02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:58.360
[Guest]: That is the famous painting of his that I saw incidentally.

02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Oh, that's a famous painting of yourself.

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:03.600
[Guest]: It's the one of the greatest examples of pointillist art.

02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.080
[Guest]: Yeah, but you didn't react like this.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.080
[Guest]: I did not.

02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.080
[Guest]: I'm very disappointed.

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.220
[Amit Varma]: I was too dignified to do that.

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Maybe since we all construct our memories anyway, maybe now in your memory, when you

02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:16.480
[Guest]: look back after 20 years, you'll be like, yeah.

02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:18.760
[Amit Varma]: I've incepted this idea in my mind.

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.120
[Amit Varma]: I've incepted this idea.

02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So now tell me a little bit about this act of painting in public.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.780
[Amit Varma]: Like I imagine that you've mentioned how like me, you're a bit of an introvert, hell is

02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:30.000
[Amit Varma]: other people, so on and so forth.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.920
[Amit Varma]: And just sitting down in public, doing something in public can bring with it great self consciousness.

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And this would be doubly so in this case, because you're actually horror of horrors,

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:44.440
[Amit Varma]: drawing people who are actually there, which can feel so intrusive if they see what you're

02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:47.480
[Amit Varma]: doing, and it can be awkward with other people around you.

02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: So how was that evolution within you?

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.520
[Amit Varma]: Like once you started, would you just lose yourself in the drawing and forget all that?

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:59.040
[Amit Varma]: Or did it take a period of time to sort of be comfortable in your skin and just relax

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:00.560
[Guest]: and be able to do it?

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.560
[Guest]: It was really bad.

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.680
[Guest]: Initially, I thought of it as escaping.

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:08.160
[Guest]: I thought of it as getting away with something, which has a nice kick to it, it makes you

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:10.420
[Guest]: feel good, you got away with something.

02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:13.820
[Guest]: But it's also it's not necessarily positive.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:15.920
[Guest]: You don't need to feel like that.

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:20.160
[Guest]: What really changed things for me was when I discovered what urban sketchers are.

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:23.080
[Guest]: So I was doing this project 30 days of Chicago.

02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:29.120
[Guest]: And like, it's it's incredible, like the whole serendipity of the moment serendipity is that

02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:35.600
[Guest]: I was walking down the street, and I saw this poster on a lamppost saying urban sketchers

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:37.320
[Guest]: symposium.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:40.400
[Guest]: And that's how I found the word urban sketcher.

02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:44.640
[Guest]: And I googled it, and I saw this is exactly what I do.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:46.200
[Guest]: There's a hashtag, I followed it.

02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:49.560
[Guest]: And I followed these artists who are urban sketchers.

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.960
[Guest]: I tried to go to the symposium.

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:55.340
[Guest]: And I realized that much later, I would realize that tickets get sold out within seconds.

02:22:55.340 --> 02:23:01.160
[Guest]: So it's impossible if the symposium was happening in, I think, a couple of months after that.

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:04.600
[Guest]: And I sort of gate crashed it.

02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:08.360
[Guest]: So I they have open sketch crawls, they walk around the city drawing.

02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.560
[Guest]: And I just walked along with them.

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:14.560
[Guest]: And I started talking to some people, and I started looking at what they're doing.

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.660
[Guest]: made friends, therefore, with urban sketchers.

02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:22.400
[Guest]: And Chicago has a super generous, super lovely chapter of urban sketchers.

02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:25.940
[Guest]: Urban sketching, urban sketchers are a really cool community.

02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:29.560
[Guest]: So the one big difference is there's no hierarchy here.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:33.920
[Guest]: All kinds of artists that I've spoken to interacted with who are fine artists otherwise, and also

02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:38.320
[Guest]: urban sketchers have said this, I've confirmed this for me that usually in art circles, people

02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:41.680
[Guest]: are protective of their styles, people are protective of what they do, they're not so

02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:45.880
[Guest]: welcoming to outsiders that are gatekeepers, essentially, you have to prove your worth

02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:47.400
[Guest]: to them.

02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:52.280
[Guest]: But in this community, there is no such thing for various reasons, there is no such thing.

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:57.640
[Guest]: And anybody speaks to anybody, anybody learns from anybody, the teacher becomes a student,

02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:00.400
[Guest]: the student becomes a teacher for various things.

02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:05.600
[Guest]: As I had the opportunity to do myself, like I was a instructor at urban sketching seminar

02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:07.360
[Guest]: in Chicago later.

02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:11.760
[Guest]: And one of the most prominent urban sketchers of the global community was one of my students

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:12.760
[Guest]: in it.

02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:14.400
[Guest]: And I felt so self conscious the whole time.

02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:19.000
[Guest]: But she said lovely things about what I how I spoke to her and how I taught and later

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.560
[Guest]: she would be a guest on my podcast as well.

02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:26.760
[Guest]: So once I was with these urban sketchers, and I saw somebody who is putting out a whole,

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:30.800
[Guest]: you know, watercolor palette on the ground on the road, sitting down on the road with

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.440
[Guest]: their sketchbook, and a jar of water and these brushes, everything laid out.

02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:40.560
[Guest]: And it just seemed so silly that I was nervous about having a sketchbook and a pen.

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:43.200
[Guest]: Like, again, I needed permission.

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:46.940
[Guest]: They gave me permission to do this, they told me it's okay.

02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:51.280
[Guest]: You can do this, really, really great artists do this.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:55.620
[Guest]: And then I started thinking that, of course, this is what Van Gogh must have done.

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:59.640
[Guest]: Like how else did he paint in the fields like he didn't take a photo and go back.

02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:02.800
[Guest]: He sat there with his things and he painted on the fields.

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:04.720
[Guest]: How did Rembrandt paint windmills?

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:05.720
[Guest]: What will he do?

02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:09.440
[Guest]: Of course, he had to stand there and do it like there's nothing weird about standing

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:11.120
[Guest]: and looking and making art.

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:13.360
[Guest]: This is how art is made.

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:18.600
[Guest]: And observation of the world is not copying this idea that I was copying and I was not

02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:21.460
[Guest]: an artist also fell away with that.

02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:28.360
[Guest]: So I gave myself this mandate to do it that I am allowed to be outdoors, I am allowed

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:30.400
[Guest]: to look at people and to draw.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.140
[Guest]: Nonetheless, at that time, I was still very conscious of it because I just I don't want

02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:35.640
[Guest]: to explain.

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.840
[Guest]: And everybody who has ever asked me what I'm doing, whether they've come up from behind

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:42.120
[Guest]: at a cafe or I draw at concerts.

02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:47.440
[Guest]: So someone I drew the musicians and somebody looked and they asked me what I'm doing.

02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:48.680
[Guest]: It's always appreciative.

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.340
[Guest]: It's always positive comments.

02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:54.400
[Guest]: People react positively to the act of drawing or painting.

02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:59.160
[Guest]: They react in a way again, this is an important differentiator from photography, photography.

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:05.280
[Guest]: Again, if you think of information, the way it captures everything, it is an intrusion.

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:07.920
[Guest]: It is perceived as an invasion of privacy.

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:12.720
[Guest]: There are ideas around how you can take photos of people, whether you can share it or not.

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:16.000
[Guest]: And they are valid ideas because you are really capturing their image.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.680
[Guest]: In a sense, that old idea, the onset of photography that you are losing a part of your soul.

02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:27.080
[Guest]: When someone takes a photo, I can see it making sense in a twisted way in this.

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:32.240
[Guest]: But a drawing is always perceived as an appreciative act, as a gesture of appreciation.

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:33.560
[Guest]: There's no evil intent.

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:36.920
[Guest]: There's no nastiness involved in making a drawing of someone.

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:39.280
[Guest]: And so I always got positive comments.

02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:45.040
[Guest]: Nonetheless, as a person, I just don't want to explain even the nice things.

02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.120
[Guest]: Just the process of being like, oh, this is why I do it.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:49.800
[Guest]: Oh, I'm an artist.

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.320
[Guest]: And I this is what I do.

02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:53.120
[Guest]: I call myself sneaky artist.

02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:56.240
[Guest]: It's just a conversation I would rather not have.

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.240
[Guest]: I try to not speak to people.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:04.240
[Guest]: This is odd from a podcaster's point of view, but I try to minimize the number of conversations

02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:05.240
[Guest]: I have.

02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:06.240
[Guest]: It's just who I am as a person.

02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:09.280
[Guest]: I live inside my own head and I think too much.

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:14.880
[Guest]: So it's been interesting to do this while observing people.

02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:21.000
[Guest]: It's been interesting to want to learn about people but not speak to them.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:28.280
[Guest]: And it leads to interesting artistic effects like guests, subjects leave while I'm drawing.

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:30.960
[Guest]: So somebody else comes and sits in their place.

02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:35.080
[Guest]: And so I've drawn half of one person and the legs of the other person.

02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:36.720
[Guest]: That kind of stuff happens on trains.

02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:37.720
[Guest]: It happens a lot.

02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:38.920
[Guest]: Like I just drew the head and then they left.

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:42.520
[Guest]: So okay, body from here, legs from here, hands from another place.

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:45.080
[Guest]: So part of your legs are stumps as we now know.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:46.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.280
[Guest]: So it leads to interesting results.

02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.280
[Guest]: So then what am I doing?

02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:51.200
[Guest]: You know, am I capturing reality?

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.800
[Guest]: Because this is not a person that existed at all, right?

02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:57.640
[Guest]: This person left and this is someone else's body and someone else.

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:00.960
[Guest]: So this thing never happened.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.960
[Guest]: So there was another sense of independence that came to me when I thought and I accepted

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:13.240
[Guest]: this thing that I don't need to be realistic and I can't be realistic because of the nature

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.120
[Guest]: of my work and there's nothing wrong with that.

02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:21.720
[Guest]: I am capturing a sense of a place over the course of time that I spend there.

02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:28.160
[Guest]: So for example, I drew at a beach in Vancouver and I'm drawing 20, 30 people at the beach.

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:32.520
[Guest]: And by the time I draw someone on the left, they have walked on and I move on to drawing

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:33.920
[Guest]: someone on the right side of the page.

02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:36.360
[Guest]: The left side of the scene has changed completely.

02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.680
[Guest]: Those guys have left and gone home.

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:39.960
[Guest]: Maybe other people are sitting in different poses.

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.400
[Guest]: So I have never captured a single moment.

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:47.920
[Guest]: What I have captured is a sense of that place over the time I have spent there.

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:51.220
[Guest]: That moment never existed in singularity.

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:53.240
[Guest]: It is an amalgamation of things.

02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.840
[Guest]: And that is a very liberating thought.

02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:00.640
[Guest]: It lets you do more things once you realize you don't have this burden of needing to be

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.360
[Guest]: realistic.

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.720
[Guest]: And realism is a thing that really, it bores me.

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:07.920
[Guest]: I had ideas about it.

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.440
[Guest]: And then I read this about this essay by Arthur Danto called The End of Art.

02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:14.440
[Guest]: And it's fascinating.

02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:18.120
[Guest]: Like, it's the whole idea is exactly what I had thought about before.

02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:21.600
[Guest]: And I love it when this happens, you know, like, I have conversations with podcasters

02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:22.600
[Guest]: also.

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:27.820
[Guest]: And I like the moments not when they tell me something that I've never thought about.

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:31.720
[Guest]: As much as I like the moments when they tell me something I have thought about, and then

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.380
[Guest]: just been like, this is just me thinking what this this doesn't matter.

02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:37.640
[Guest]: But then they validate it.

02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:42.740
[Guest]: And then I give it value again, they again, give me a little bit of permission to back

02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:44.200
[Guest]: my own ideas.

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:46.000
[Guest]: And I love those moments.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.680
[Guest]: So The End of Art talks about this moment when Arthur Danto, who is an art historian,

02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:56.960
[Guest]: art critic and philosopher, he in the 60s sees Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes.

02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:59.480
[Guest]: So Brillo boxes are these packaging boxes.

02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:05.320
[Guest]: And Andy Warhol's exhibit is literally a reproduction of that box in that same size with some other

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:06.320
[Guest]: materials.

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:15.000
[Guest]: What breaks Danto's mind is that how do you separate this from the real object?

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.360
[Guest]: What makes this art but not those real boxes art?

02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:26.200
[Guest]: So he felt that now art has in a very particular sense, art has ended.

02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:29.680
[Guest]: And he tracks two narratives of art.

02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.840
[Guest]: He doesn't firstly he doesn't think of this as a bad thing.

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:34.440
[Guest]: He thinks this is a great thing for art.

02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:37.280
[Guest]: And artists shouldn't think of this as a negative thing that all art has ended.

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:38.280
[Guest]: So what am I doing?

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:40.080
[Guest]: No, that's not what it is.

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:46.280
[Guest]: What he calls as the first narrative of art was when art had the responsibility of representing

02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:47.640
[Guest]: the world.

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.360
[Guest]: And I have thought about this, why am I not realistic?

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:54.400
[Guest]: Because photography exists, why do I need to be realistic?

02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:58.520
[Guest]: Photography exists, and you can record record the world as it is.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.440
[Guest]: So I don't need to be realistic.

02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:02.880
[Guest]: I don't need to compete with photography.

02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:07.480
[Guest]: Why when they can do it, you can put a filter, it'll look artistic, do that.

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:11.720
[Guest]: His thing was that for the first narrative of art was when it needed to be photorealistic,

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:14.640
[Guest]: well, realistic, because photos didn't exist.

02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:18.080
[Guest]: And that narrative ended when photography became a thing.

02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:20.920
[Guest]: Now art needed to find a new purpose.

02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:26.280
[Guest]: And that's when all of these ideas of impressionism, cubanism, cubism, surrealism, dadaism, all

02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:28.880
[Guest]: of these were developed, because now what is art?

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:29.880
[Guest]: Why am I drawing?

02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.520
[Guest]: Why am I painting?

02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:33.200
[Guest]: Can I play with perspective?

02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:34.680
[Guest]: Can I play with reality?

02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:37.680
[Guest]: What is the purpose of doing this exercise?

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:40.600
[Guest]: And all these great artists delved into that.

02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:45.160
[Guest]: And in his opinion, that narrative ended with Andy Warhol.

02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:51.640
[Guest]: Because now there was no distinction between now what art is, is not about looking at it,

02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:53.120
[Guest]: but it's about thinking about it.

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:57.720
[Guest]: So now in his words, we had reached the age of art theory.

02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:00.360
[Guest]: Art was art in a certain context.

02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:05.440
[Guest]: So he was thinking aloud and saying, if Leonardo da Vinci saw this, Brillo boxes, would he

02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:07.360
[Guest]: consider it art?

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.920
[Guest]: If Michelangelo saw it, would he consider this art?

02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:11.920
[Guest]: No.

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:17.720
[Guest]: This is art only when you take into context the art of before, and the movement of art,

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:22.520
[Guest]: and then you come to this meta understanding that why can't this also be art?

02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:27.240
[Guest]: Sort of Andy Warhol is doing that thing that, look at these Campbell soup cans, why can't

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:29.520
[Guest]: this be art, if you look at it?

02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:33.000
[Guest]: And this only makes sense if you think about what else has been art before.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:36.080
[Guest]: So we have entered the realm of art theory.

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:39.680
[Guest]: And this he called the end of art, the end of the second narrative.

02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:44.640
[Guest]: And what happens now is so he distinguishes narratives from chronicles.

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:46.080
[Guest]: Narratives have a purpose.

02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:50.280
[Guest]: They have a so like a story of anyone, it has a beginning, middle and end, it has a

02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:51.720
[Guest]: epic conclusion.

02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:54.320
[Guest]: But chronicles simply go on.

02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:59.080
[Guest]: My life is a chronicle, like even after a narrative of my life has gotten over the rest

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:00.720
[Guest]: of my life continues.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:01.720
[Guest]: That's the chronicle.

02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:06.480
[Guest]: So now art has entered this phase, where it is free to be whatever it wants.

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:09.160
[Guest]: It does not have a narrative bound to it.

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:11.340
[Guest]: It does not have a duty to perform anymore.

02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.480
[Guest]: It can be realistic if it likes, it can be impressionistic if it likes, it can dabble

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:19.120
[Guest]: in whatever direction, doing all kinds, it is completely free.

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.640
[Guest]: It is in the chronicle stage.

02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:25.140
[Guest]: He's been criticized, he's got a lot of critics, because firstly, he talks only about Western

02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:31.040
[Guest]: art, and then he kind of rejects Eastern art and other ideas in the process.

02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:33.020
[Guest]: But this is a useful model.

02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:36.760
[Guest]: Another thing I learned from control engineering, there's this quote that I'd shared with you.

02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:41.260
[Guest]: The quote is that all models are wrong, but some models are useful.

02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:48.240
[Guest]: So these models are not completely self sufficient, comprehensive models of the world, but they

02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:55.180
[Guest]: can be useful within a context to understand something to work in to do something with.

02:33:55.180 --> 02:33:57.100
[Guest]: And this has helped me do something.

02:33:57.100 --> 02:34:03.820
[Guest]: So I have understood the purpose of realism, what it was, I have understood why I don't

02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:07.820
[Guest]: need to be doing it, and why I don't need to feel guilty about not doing it.

02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:12.320
[Guest]: So I can't draw eyes realistically, doesn't matter, you don't need to do it.

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:14.820
[Guest]: The point is, I'm trying to communicate.

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:20.220
[Guest]: And if I can communicate with two dots, I've saved a bit of time, I've saved a lot of effort,

02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:24.620
[Guest]: I don't have a lot of time from my viewers, they are scrolling on Instagram, I have to

02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:26.240
[Guest]: catch their attention.

02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:28.780
[Guest]: So I am allowed to do these things.

02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:35.420
[Guest]: And sort of this kind of studying of these rules backwards, these art theories and histories

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:40.580
[Guest]: is useful, like it helps you own what you do, it helps you inform what you do.

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:45.500
[Guest]: And I think it makes me a better artist, to communicate this, to write about it, to share

02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:50.420
[Guest]: it in my newsletter to talk about why I'm doing what I'm doing and to share like, I

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:55.900
[Guest]: described my newsletter as sharing the journey of my self education.

02:34:55.900 --> 02:35:00.820
[Guest]: And because who am I to teach right, like I'm no one to talk about art, but I am allowed

02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:03.540
[Guest]: to share my journey.

02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:07.100
[Amit Varma]: Sharing the journey of my self education is also actually how I describe the seen and

02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:11.620
[Amit Varma]: the unseen and because everybody's trying to educate themselves, I guess that's why

02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:15.900
[Amit Varma]: journeys like the Stryker chord, you know, one of the things that has led to my unease

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:22.260
[Amit Varma]: with a fair amount of art is that you it seems like you can only appreciate it in a particular

02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:23.260
[Amit Varma]: context.

02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:27.700
[Amit Varma]: And that is often a context of some kind of theory or politics that goes along with it.

02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:32.780
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, Marcel Duchamp's fountain, right, which is basically for those who don't

02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:39.220
[Amit Varma]: know in 1917, Marcel Duchamp did a sculpture called Fountain, which is basically a urinal

02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:40.620
[Amit Varma]: and it's signed Armat.

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:46.140
[Amit Varma]: And the point is that that work of art is only meaningful for someone who's steeped

02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:49.680
[Amit Varma]: in the theory and in the context and in that particular narrative.

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:54.540
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't mean anything in and of itself, like if I come across that somewhere, I would

02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:59.020
[Amit Varma]: just think, okay, today I've hydrated enough, let's give a little back to the world.

02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.020
[Amit Varma]: But it would not strike me as anything other than that.

02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:06.620
[Amit Varma]: Whereas I think there is, you know, and I'm just thinking aloud again, that there is some

02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:10.740
[Amit Varma]: art and I don't want to make a value judgment comparing these two, but there is some art

02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:13.300
[Amit Varma]: which will stand on its own.

02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:17.620
[Amit Varma]: As we spoke earlier, as you know, going by Kandinsky's quote, you can just look at and

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:18.620
[Amit Varma]: immerse yourself in.

02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:20.660
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a lot of poetry certainly does that for me.

02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:25.420
[Amit Varma]: I don't need to know literary theory to fall in love with a short story or be greatly moved

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:27.940
[Amit Varma]: by a poem, even when I don't know what it means.

02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:33.500
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your, I mean, you've already spoken about definitions of art and, you know,

02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:39.020
[Amit Varma]: the thoughts provoked by this essay you mentioned, but in general, what are your sort of thoughts

02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:40.020
[Amit Varma]: on that?

02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:44.300
[Amit Varma]: Like, what do you consider the best art that you've encountered?

02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:49.540
[Amit Varma]: And did it take prior education to appreciate it for what it is, or does it just stand alone

02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:52.260
[Guest]: on its own and it doesn't need that context?

02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:59.060
[Guest]: About the fountain, for example, what do you find able to appreciate without prior knowledge

02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:02.860
[Guest]: is also a function of the time you are in and who you are.

02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:03.860
[Guest]: Right.

02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:09.220
[Guest]: Like, so if I made these drawings and I showed them to Van Gogh, he might think that's not

02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:10.220
[Guest]: art.

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:11.220
[Guest]: You're supposed to finish it.

02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:12.220
[Guest]: This is unfinished.

02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:16.860
[Guest]: I'll show it to Da Vinci and he'll think this is not art, like you have to, there's so much

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:19.220
[Guest]: more to do, like you haven't completed it yet.

02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:20.220
[Guest]: Right.

02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:21.220
[Amit Varma]: It's it's a sketch.

02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:24.300
[Amit Varma]: And he'll show you in his notebooks how you can build a better race car than what you

02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:25.300
[Guest]: did.

02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:26.300
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:27.300
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:28.300
[Guest]: Air powered or water powered.

02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:29.300
[Guest]: Why not?

02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:35.860
[Guest]: So again, this is my art is also a function of its time and I'll being myself a function

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:36.860
[Guest]: of my time.

02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:41.180
[Guest]: I will look at it and think, of course, this is independent, just like someone in 1917

02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.260
[Guest]: might have thought, well, if you showed them the fountain, they'll be like, yeah, what

02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:48.700
[Guest]: a great statement because I am being forced to look at this other stuff and call it art.

02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:49.700
[Amit Varma]: This is art.

02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:50.700
[Amit Varma]: I completely get it.

02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:56.300
[Amit Varma]: Except that I think even in 1917, 99.9% of people would have seen a urinal and not seen

02:37:56.300 --> 02:37:57.300
[Guest]: art.

02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.300
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a fair point.

02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:04.060
[Guest]: So I think about a lot of institutional ideas in this way, like, for example, I had this

02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:08.540
[Guest]: idea about this thought about philosophy, for example, that you have someone like Nietzsche

02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:14.460
[Guest]: writing about what would become existentialism and you have Sartre writing about it.

02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:15.860
[Guest]: What are they doing?

02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.660
[Guest]: Are they leading a movement?

02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:22.580
[Guest]: Are they articulating a movement or a philosophy?

02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:29.380
[Guest]: Should we call them the inventors of existentialism, for example, or somebody else as the inventor

02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:34.500
[Guest]: of something else or are they observers?

02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:41.020
[Guest]: So how many people read Sartre then and how many people explicitly read him and absorbed

02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:43.260
[Guest]: that philosophy and then became like this?

02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:48.020
[Guest]: And how much was it an observation of the time that he was in and the way that the art

02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:52.100
[Guest]: and the culture and the behavior post-World War Two or during the last years of World

02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.220
[Guest]: War Two was expressing itself.

02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:58.100
[Guest]: So we give things these names, right?

02:38:58.100 --> 02:39:04.260
[Guest]: And we give these movements, these leaders, but like, are they leaders or are they simply

02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:09.300
[Guest]: like leaders in the sense of creators or are they leaders in the sense of observers who

02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:10.740
[Guest]: articulated something?

02:39:10.740 --> 02:39:12.940
[Guest]: So that's a very crucial point to me.

02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:14.980
[Guest]: How many people read Schopenhauer?

02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:16.180
[Guest]: How many people read Heidegger?

02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:18.060
[Guest]: Like very few people must have read Heidegger.

02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:19.820
[Guest]: He's a very important philosopher.

02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:24.580
[Guest]: So is he just a really important philosopher to other philosophers or did he have something

02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:26.700
[Guest]: useful to say for all of us?

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:32.380
[Guest]: If he did, certainly it wasn't communicated by him to all of those people.

02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:37.980
[Guest]: So I like the idea of philosopher as Isaiah Berlin kind of pointed it out by saying that

02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:40.660
[Guest]: I'm a historian of ideas.

02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:45.660
[Guest]: And this is the reason why I personally started to read about existentialism and Nietzsche

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:52.220
[Guest]: and all of these other people also that I want to see the chronology of ideas over time,

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:56.540
[Guest]: the best ideas that people came up with, like, we are going through an era right now where

02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:58.900
[Guest]: there's a resurgence of stoicism.

02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:06.220
[Guest]: And stoicism is 2200 years old, like you tell someone that, and that's one of those mind

02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:13.040
[Guest]: exploding moments that somebody, a Roman general 2200 years ago said this thing that matters

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:19.180
[Guest]: to me today, the continuity of human experience.

02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:23.400
[Guest]: And what has kept that stoicism alive over 2200 years?

02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:24.780
[Guest]: Is it Seneca?

02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:27.180
[Guest]: Is it that Marcus Aurelius who wrote it?

02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:28.380
[Guest]: No, it's not that.

02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:30.580
[Guest]: How many people would have read him?

02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:37.020
[Guest]: All of these things are a part of like, at least I think so, like they're a part of humankind.

02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:44.500
[Guest]: And philosophers and artists, and these are just people who see it, and they share it.

02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:54.220
[Guest]: But these notions of rebellion, whether cubism or surrealism is rebellious, they come from

02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:58.740
[Guest]: tapping into the psyche of the community and the culture that they're in.

02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:06.780
[Guest]: So these things are incepted in this culture by the vast masses of humanity.

02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:11.460
[Guest]: And then one person comes along and he represents it on a canvas in one way.

02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:13.360
[Guest]: But I don't think they invent it.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.660
[Guest]: So again, when I think about whether people would understand it then as art or whether

02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:20.760
[Guest]: they would just see this person is just making a urinal.

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:21.760
[Guest]: It's a bit of both.

02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:24.700
[Guest]: Like surely some people will see it as that.

02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:29.940
[Guest]: But it sort of implies just that art has a bit of a learning curve sometimes, you do

02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:34.260
[Guest]: need to know a bit of context, you do need to be a bit erudite about it.

02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:36.780
[Guest]: I don't think that's a bad thing.

02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:41.060
[Guest]: And so this kind of is counterintuitive to how I practice.

02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:45.060
[Guest]: And you would think that if you're tearing down institutions, why won't you tear down

02:41:45.060 --> 02:41:46.060
[Guest]: institutions?

02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:47.060
[Guest]: But there's a bit of both in me.

02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:52.660
[Guest]: Like I feel like curators and institutions do an important job.

02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:54.620
[Guest]: They do articulate these things.

02:41:54.620 --> 02:42:00.220
[Guest]: Sometimes after the time, we needed these people for Van Gogh, for example, like, otherwise,

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:01.820
[Guest]: maybe we wouldn't have known about him today.

02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:03.540
[Guest]: Like possibly, I don't know.

02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:05.180
[Guest]: Maybe we wouldn't have known.

02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:07.180
[Guest]: But there's a bit of both.

02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:11.660
[Guest]: Like I feel like when people talk about this kind of art, and they say that, oh, but you

02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:13.140
[Guest]: know, I don't understand it.

02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:15.660
[Guest]: And there is this other stuff that I understand.

02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:18.660
[Guest]: And therefore, this is better than that other stuff.

02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:22.900
[Guest]: I don't know, like, I feel like that learning curve and that delayed reward at the end

02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:25.840
[Guest]: of it also has its own value.

02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:27.900
[Guest]: But it's not maybe a good entry point.

02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:33.480
[Guest]: And it's never good if that is the art and other things are not art.

02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.540
[Guest]: So we are in this beautiful place now where so many things can be art.

02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:42.900
[Guest]: And there is no, you can't be a gatekeeper, because there isn't one gate to one thing,

02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:47.020
[Guest]: you can be a gatekeeper to a certain kind of knowledge.

02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:48.780
[Guest]: And that knowledge can still have value.

02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:50.700
[Guest]: But there is other knowledge also.

02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:55.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of conflicted about this, but just thinking aloud on, you know,

02:42:55.540 --> 02:43:00.100
[Amit Varma]: if curators or the art elites hadn't discovered Van Gogh, would we have discovered him?

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:04.340
[Amit Varma]: The question is that it's much more possible that because of him, there are many Van Goghs

02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:05.340
[Amit Varma]: who didn't get discovered.

02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:12.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I just feel that this notion of depending upon elite curators and educators and theorists

02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.300
[Amit Varma]: is very dicey.

02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:17.660
[Amit Varma]: Because if we lived in that world, honestly, I don't think you would have come up and I

02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:21.820
[Amit Varma]: don't think I would have come up like if you had people curating podcasts and deciding

02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:26.400
[Amit Varma]: what is kosher and what is not and what is worth listening to and what is not worth listening

02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:29.260
[Amit Varma]: to and there's no other access to the masses.

02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:32.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, I would have been lost and basically, you would have had to be lucky.

02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:36.740
[Guest]: But then this situation is a function of today.

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:37.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:44.100
[Guest]: You did need curators in the 80s, for example, to run All India Radio a certain way.

02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:46.900
[Guest]: You can argue that sure, a lot of talent was stifled.

02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:47.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:50.700
[Guest]: Simply there was no accommodation for all the talent either.

02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:52.340
[Guest]: They couldn't have all become radio commentators.

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:53.340
[Amit Varma]: That's true.

02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:57.180
[Amit Varma]: That's driven by scarcity that there is so much space to give and somebody has to determine

02:43:57.180 --> 02:43:58.180
[Guest]: what goes there.

02:43:58.180 --> 02:44:04.820
[Guest]: It is possible for us to be podcasters, that we can say that now, these curators are not

02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:05.820
[Amit Varma]: necessary.

02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:06.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:10.620
[Guest]: But when knowledge is on the internet, and knowledge can proliferate and knowledge can

02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:14.220
[Guest]: be preserved in decentralized ways, it's great.

02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:19.820
[Guest]: But universities did a very essential function before because otherwise there is no chronological

02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:24.700
[Guest]: assessment of how do you build upon knowledge if you don't have these few curators who safeguard

02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:31.140
[Guest]: it, keep a lot of people out, and that's a necessary sin almost in the interest of preserving

02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:34.820
[Guest]: and in the interest of cataloging and moving things forward.

02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:39.660
[Guest]: We have therefore come to this place where we can be like, oh, we don't need you anymore.

02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:43.900
[Amit Varma]: So you know, earlier in the show, you mentioned your great revelation, there are other people,

02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:46.700
[Amit Varma]: which is a profound revelation to me also.

02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:50.660
[Amit Varma]: And I'll share another revelation, which I think is as startling and which you might

02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:54.700
[Amit Varma]: have come upon, but will certainly come upon later, even if you haven't now, which struck

02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:59.220
[Amit Varma]: me when you spoke of, you know, they start to believe Stoicism has been around for 2200

02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:01.180
[Amit Varma]: years, as if that is a long time.

02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:04.980
[Amit Varma]: And the realization is that time is very short, or time is short, because we shouldn't use

02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:06.380
[Amit Varma]: the word very.

02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:10.220
[Amit Varma]: The older I get, the more I realize how quickly time passes.

02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:14.140
[Amit Varma]: Someone commented on Twitter the other day, and I found it very perceptive comment that

02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:17.900
[Amit Varma]: when I speak of, you know, when I speak of 30 years ago, and this is a person who commented

02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:20.940
[Amit Varma]: when I speak of 30 years ago, I'm thinking of 1970.

02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:23.860
[Amit Varma]: And then I suddenly realized, wait a second, it's 1991.

02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:28.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, time passes much faster than we realize it.

02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:33.140
[Amit Varma]: Before we kind of move on with this linear narrative from which we keep deviating, I'm

02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:37.860
[Amit Varma]: actually going to do a flashback and go back to a phrase that you use earlier, and ask

02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:41.700
[Amit Varma]: you to sort of elaborate on that, which is control engineering, where you spoke about

02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:45.760
[Amit Varma]: how control engineering felt so natural to you, you immediately got it.

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:51.180
[Amit Varma]: And how even after you cease to be, you know, an engineer per se, it's dominated the way

02:45:51.180 --> 02:45:53.900
[Amit Varma]: you look at everything and why it's so important for you.

02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:57.100
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to go into this a little bit more, because it's very fascinating.

02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:03.900
[Amit Varma]: And I also wonder if it has something to do with a bent of mind that involves getting

02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:08.540
[Amit Varma]: meta a little bit about things getting to the first principles about, you know, like

02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:13.860
[Amit Varma]: I remember, last year, I was telling somebody something about podcasting, who doesn't podcast

02:46:13.860 --> 02:46:18.220
[Amit Varma]: or I mean, person who just has a Facebook presence and rants about many things there.

02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:19.980
[Amit Varma]: And I was telling him about podcasting.

02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:23.980
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, in my excitement of all that I had learned, I was harrowing Gyan and at

02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:27.780
[Amit Varma]: one point, he said, that is so academic who listens to the pseudo bullshit.

02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:32.620
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, wait a minute, I'm actually a successful practitioner at this shit, right.

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:36.980
[Amit Varma]: And part of the reason I think the show gets better is because I try very deeply to get

02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:41.200
[Amit Varma]: meta and think about all of these things, the importance of listening, how you structure

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:45.240
[Amit Varma]: a conversation, you know, how you get the kind of flow that you get.

02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:50.300
[Amit Varma]: And I sense that you look at things the same way in the sense you're trying to break things

02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:51.300
[Amit Varma]: down.

02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:52.300
[Amit Varma]: Why do I see what I see?

02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Why is my art the way my art is just that very profound point you made about your weaknesses

02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:01.460
[Amit Varma]: eventually turning into your style about constraints giving you freedom.

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:03.660
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about control engineering.

02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:08.180
[Amit Varma]: And if this point is separate from that, tell me a little bit about this mindset that you

02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:12.400
[Amit Varma]: have, and whether it's natural to you, or you worked at developing it, this mindset

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:16.700
[Amit Varma]: about just getting to first principles, taking that step back and getting a little meta.

02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:19.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I think they're both the same thing.

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:24.060
[Guest]: So the reason why I'm fascinated by control engineering is because it offers a way to

02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:25.500
[Guest]: do this.

02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:29.540
[Guest]: And there are reflections of it everywhere in my life.

02:47:29.540 --> 02:47:34.160
[Guest]: And so control engineering breaks the whole world into systems.

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:39.980
[Guest]: So once you're a control engineer, you see everything as systems, and systems which have

02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:43.940
[Guest]: inputs and outputs, and they function a certain way.

02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:49.660
[Guest]: And by intelligently understanding or manipulating these inputs, and studying the outputs, you

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:53.040
[Guest]: can understand what's why did that input turn into this output.

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.780
[Guest]: So therefore, this system must be doing this, this, this, this, this, oh, this system multiplies

02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:02.100
[Guest]: all numbers by five, or this system does two x plus five, or this system adds so and so

02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:05.420
[Guest]: feedback, and it does this and that, and it turns this into energy.

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:09.860
[Guest]: And with a 30% effect, you figure out these black boxes.

02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:16.820
[Guest]: And the way to do that the way to identify systems that are black boxes is a very fascinating

02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:17.820
[Guest]: thing.

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:23.460
[Guest]: What are the structures that we have that we can put here and see if this holds true?

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.460
[Guest]: Oh, this doesn't work?

02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:27.940
[Guest]: How do we why don't we try this kind of structure and see if this fits?

02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:30.360
[Guest]: Where did these structures come from?

02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:36.100
[Guest]: How did we learn about them, this idea of isolating variables and controlling certain

02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:38.700
[Guest]: variables and then seeing how something works?

02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:40.440
[Guest]: It's a very nice way to look at the world.

02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:43.860
[Guest]: And I have an inclination to look at my world in this way.

02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:47.300
[Guest]: And therefore, I appreciated what I learned from doing this.

02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:51.380
[Guest]: So I'll give you an example of why this was already something that I was thinking about

02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:55.220
[Guest]: from one of my favorite authors of all time is Kurt Vonnegut.

02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:58.820
[Guest]: And one of my favorite books by Kurt Vonnegut is Cat's Cradle.

02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:03.980
[Guest]: And in Cat's Cradle, there is a fictional religion called Bokononism talked about by

02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:07.980
[Guest]: the prophet Bokonon and who lives on this island.

02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:14.060
[Guest]: And at the start of the book, Bokonon says that.

02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:20.740
[Guest]: This religion is for any person who does not understand how a religion can be founded on

02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:25.300
[Guest]: useful lies will not like this book either.

02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:26.300
[Guest]: Useful lies.

02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:30.380
[Guest]: So there is another quote in the start of this book in which he says something like

02:49:30.380 --> 02:49:36.020
[Guest]: we all live by the FOMA that make us happy and healthy and kind and wise.

02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:41.840
[Guest]: And FOMA is a fictional word amongst many in the book, which means harmless untruths.

02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:46.680
[Guest]: So we all live by these white lies that make us happy and healthy and wise and kind.

02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:49.060
[Guest]: And this is the basis of all religion.

02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:54.140
[Guest]: It's a bunch of suspended delusions that we agree upon, whether with others or whether

02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:56.020
[Guest]: just inside our own minds.

02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:58.380
[Guest]: But they help us make sense of our world.

02:49:58.380 --> 02:50:02.820
[Guest]: The quote that I said before that was shared with to me by a control engineering professor

02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:07.420
[Guest]: in a lecture was all models are wrong, but some models are useful.

02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:12.140
[Guest]: All models are wrong means all models are simplifications of the truth.

02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:13.580
[Guest]: They are not the truth.

02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:19.140
[Guest]: So something as simple as Hooke's law of elasticity, that extension X is equal to a constant.

02:50:19.140 --> 02:50:24.660
[Guest]: So if you apply a force F, it is equal to a constant multiplied by X, which is the amount

02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:28.100
[Guest]: of deviation in that elastic deviation.

02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:34.340
[Guest]: So this is not true because it is a it's a linearized simplification of a nonlinear reality.

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:38.340
[Guest]: There is many, many more forces that are little, little deviations.

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:43.300
[Guest]: Many things come together, but we can make a useful equation.

02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:52.300
[Guest]: By within certain bounds, thinking of it as linear F is equal to KX and it is super useful.

02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:57.060
[Guest]: It is the basis for a lot of design, limitless number of applications.

02:50:57.060 --> 02:51:02.300
[Guest]: Similarly, all of these basic laws like F is equal to MA and E is equal to MC squared,

02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:06.580
[Guest]: all of these are simplifications of very, very deep and profound things.

02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:12.180
[Guest]: In a sense, they are all wrong because they are not exactly true, but some of them are

02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:15.540
[Guest]: useful and therefore we should not discard them.

02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:21.340
[Guest]: We should think about things don't have value only if they are absolutely true.

02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:26.780
[Guest]: Things can have useful purpose in our lives, even when we know they are not true, simply

02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:33.100
[Guest]: by our understanding how to use them within a certain context, therefore religion, therefore

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:34.780
[Guest]: the role of fiction in life.

02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:37.420
[Guest]: And you see, you see the conflict of that so much, right?

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:43.420
[Guest]: Like if you tell someone that a certain epic or a certain religious book is fiction and

02:51:43.420 --> 02:51:48.020
[Guest]: they take so much offense because fiction means it's not true and only true things have

02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:49.140
[Guest]: value.

02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:53.040
[Guest]: And that's such a narrow-minded point of view that stories don't have value.

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:55.620
[Guest]: The most valuable things in the world are stories.

02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:58.300
[Guest]: We all live, Elon Musk has a story of himself.

02:51:58.300 --> 02:52:00.340
[Guest]: He doesn't have the truth of himself out in the world.

02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:02.060
[Guest]: This is the source of his power.

02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:05.820
[Guest]: All religions and all prophets have stories of themselves.

02:52:05.820 --> 02:52:07.620
[Guest]: Nobody really wants the truth.

02:52:07.620 --> 02:52:09.020
[Guest]: They want a nice story.

02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:13.260
[Guest]: All political leaders have nice narratives and stories around them.

02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:16.740
[Guest]: And we believe them even if we sort of think it's not true.

02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:21.420
[Guest]: We know it's not true, but we know that our story is stronger than that guy's story.

02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:22.460
[Guest]: Our story will win.

02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.620
[Guest]: So let's stick with our story.

02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:27.500
[Guest]: So this understanding is very profound.

02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:34.260
[Guest]: It applies in so many ways to all of life and control engineering sort of was the scientific

02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:35.860
[Guest]: way for me to appreciate it.

02:52:35.860 --> 02:52:38.720
[Guest]: I heard it and I thought, look, this applies to art.

02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:39.880
[Guest]: This applies to history.

02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:43.580
[Guest]: This applies to someone like Gandhi, for example, right?

02:52:43.580 --> 02:52:48.620
[Guest]: A person with many flaws, so many detailed nuances that I don't know about.

02:52:48.620 --> 02:52:51.060
[Guest]: And there are so many people who don't know about it, right?

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:58.300
[Guest]: But if believing in the myth of Gandhi as a peaceful leader makes someone peaceful,

02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:03.340
[Guest]: makes them believe in nonviolence and not hurting other people, makes them believe positively

02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:10.780
[Guest]: about the value of bringing people along and making a movement, isn't that lie way more

02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:14.820
[Guest]: useful than the truth of maybe he's sexist.

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:15.820
[Guest]: Maybe he's casteist.

02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:16.820
[Guest]: Who cares?

02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:18.700
[Guest]: Like what a useless truth.

02:53:18.700 --> 02:53:22.860
[Guest]: Like you could, someone could make an argument that let's discard that truth.

02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:23.860
[Guest]: Let's forget.

02:53:23.860 --> 02:53:28.500
[Guest]: Let's erase it from public memory because that lie is just so much more useful in making

02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:29.820
[Guest]: us human.

02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:36.360
[Guest]: And it may be through this deification is of more use to society.

02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:40.220
[Guest]: And it's something I think about a lot, like you are wedded to the truth as engineers.

02:53:40.220 --> 02:53:44.540
[Guest]: You think that you're going for objective truth, but like, what does, what does the

02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:45.540
[Guest]: truth matter?

02:53:45.540 --> 02:53:49.340
[Guest]: Like engineering and science is just such a small part of the world.

02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:54.740
[Guest]: Math is such a small, like tangible things are such a small part of the world.

02:53:54.740 --> 02:53:59.660
[Guest]: And we engineers, we think, and this is the age of the tech bros, like we think that we

02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:04.420
[Guest]: understand everything because everything can be broken into equations and creativity will

02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:08.140
[Guest]: be broken into equations so that AI will become creative.

02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:13.140
[Guest]: But we don't appreciate how many things are intangible.

02:54:13.140 --> 02:54:15.980
[Guest]: Most of the world, most of reality is intangible.

02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:18.260
[Guest]: Most of reality is only inside our heads.

02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:20.660
[Guest]: It doesn't actually matter what someone did to us.

02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:22.620
[Guest]: What matters is how we feel about them.

02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:24.660
[Guest]: And that's how we behave with them.

02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:31.620
[Guest]: So control engineering helped me to make sense of all of these things, incomplete information,

02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:35.380
[Guest]: but can be still useful if you make it useful.

02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:39.620
[Guest]: And I've talked about all the ways that it has helped me in non-engineering ways, but

02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:41.900
[Guest]: it has also made, it made me a better engineer.

02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:46.260
[Guest]: It helped me find out so much about these complex things that are designed.

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:51.540
[Guest]: So for example, I worked on this system, which was like a creator's tray.

02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:54.860
[Guest]: Like suppose you have glasses on it and it's automated though.

02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:56.940
[Guest]: It's not actually being held by somebody.

02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:58.380
[Guest]: What if you pushed it?

02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:01.420
[Guest]: How can you design a system that will not let the glasses fall?

02:55:01.420 --> 02:55:06.140
[Guest]: It will absorb the shock and it will react appropriately like the way this lazy boy chair

02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:09.740
[Guest]: does like dampening and spinning action.

02:55:09.740 --> 02:55:14.220
[Guest]: So just those things, playing with things and figuring out how they work.

02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:17.020
[Guest]: It's such a powerful, empowering thing to do.

02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:18.580
[Guest]: And I just love that thing.

02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:24.260
[Guest]: And education by my goal with going to Delft to study was I wanted to be a real engineer

02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:26.340
[Guest]: and they made me a real engineer.

02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:29.180
[Guest]: Like they gave, they empowered me.

02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:33.540
[Guest]: And like that is just, it feels super great to have had that education.

02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:39.900
[Guest]: And even if I don't quote unquote use it, all knowledge is always there.

02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:41.140
[Amit Varma]: Everything adds up.

02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:45.580
[Amit Varma]: So just to elaborate on the lazy boy reference, all guests who come to my home studio now

02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:47.080
[Amit Varma]: now get a choice.

02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:51.340
[Amit Varma]: They can either use a lazy boy or they can use a green soul gaming chair, which I have

02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:53.020
[Amit Varma]: an extra pair of.

02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:57.020
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I use a green soul gaming chair, but the second chair is a recent addition.

02:55:57.020 --> 02:55:59.980
[Amit Varma]: And so Nishant is the first guest to be offered that option.

02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:03.940
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you know, being from Calcutta, a half Bengali like me can relate.

02:56:03.940 --> 02:56:05.140
[Amit Varma]: He chose a lazy boy.

02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:10.300
[Amit Varma]: So and the Calcutta boys are lazy boys for Calcutta boys are something in the air.

02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:11.300
[Amit Varma]: It's good to be lazy.

02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:12.300
[Amit Varma]: It's good to be lazy.

02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:15.300
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of things, a couple of observations.

02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:16.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, I love that quote.

02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:19.260
[Amit Varma]: Firstly, I think I've actually quoted it earlier on my show.

02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:23.580
[Amit Varma]: And I first heard it from you, which is all models are wrong, but some models are useful.

02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:24.580
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic quote.

02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:26.500
[Amit Varma]: And the world is complex.

02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:30.620
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the cliche on my show that we all contain multitudes of Whitman quote is a subset

02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:32.880
[Amit Varma]: of that, of the world being complex.

02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.260
[Amit Varma]: And I completely get that, that we can never really get at the truth.

02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:40.500
[Amit Varma]: Nevertheless, I actually think in a historical context, and I've been discussing this on

02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:43.340
[Amit Varma]: my show a lot, that the truth nevertheless has value.

02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:46.740
[Amit Varma]: Like I know you were just thinking aloud when you spoke of Gandhi and, you know, can we

02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:51.820
[Amit Varma]: not speak of the sexism and casteism and can we just speak of the nonviolence and the satyagraha.

02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:56.420
[Amit Varma]: But I think part of the mistake that we made post independence was taking exactly that

02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:57.420
[Amit Varma]: view.

02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:00.620
[Amit Varma]: That let's kind of whitewash the things that have gone wrong in our history.

02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Kapil Komiriddi spoke about this very eloquently in his episode with me, Manu Pillay agreed

02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:07.100
[Amit Varma]: with him when he came on the show recently.

02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:13.660
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is what happened post independence was that our historians to avoid conflict

02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:18.780
[Amit Varma]: in present day society decided to paper over earlier periods of time when there was violence

02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:21.020
[Amit Varma]: by the Mughals and so on and so forth.

02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:25.300
[Amit Varma]: And Komiriddi's contention is that now there is a backlash in the other direction.

02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:30.260
[Amit Varma]: And you should just have let it play out and let society resolve its own problems, we are

02:57:30.260 --> 02:57:31.260
[Guest]: mature enough to do so.

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:36.420
[Guest]: Once we have reduced things to binary good and evil, then it's this is the narrative

02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.420
[Amit Varma]: now.

02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:38.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:39.420
[Amit Varma]: And we're losing for that.

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:40.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:42.140
[Amit Varma]: And I really think that it's important to acknowledge the truth that has a value of

02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:46.340
[Amit Varma]: its own while accepting it can never fully be reached, but acknowledge the broad truth.

02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:50.300
[Amit Varma]: But also, I just think that history should not matter.

02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:54.700
[Amit Varma]: Like Gandhi was this or that, you know, all of these guys, you know, you're Gandhis and

02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:58.580
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayees and Nehru's and Savarkar's contain multitudes, I think discussing the people

02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:04.100
[Amit Varma]: are is irrelevant, we can discuss ideas, you know, Gandhi got it completely wrong on railways

02:58:04.100 --> 02:58:09.380
[Amit Varma]: and doctors, both of which he was against, Gandhi got it completely right on the means

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:12.980
[Amit Varma]: being more important than the ends and the importance of peaceful non resistance, there

02:58:12.980 --> 02:58:14.940
[Amit Varma]: is so much to learn from that.

02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:18.980
[Amit Varma]: And I agree with you that we should kind of look at the learnings and discard his bad

02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:23.700
[Amit Varma]: ideas while seeing them for bad ideas and acknowledging them that he had them.

02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:28.140
[Guest]: I think I think yeah, so what it comes to is that that quote, like all models are wrong,

02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:29.780
[Guest]: but some are useful.

02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:35.580
[Guest]: The meaning of useful here with the asterisk is that some models are useful within a certain

02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:41.020
[Guest]: context within, therefore, an engineering control terms you would call within boundaries.

02:58:41.020 --> 02:58:46.460
[Guest]: So these this equation holds the Hooke's law of elasticity holds until this limit beyond

02:58:46.460 --> 02:58:50.140
[Guest]: which it does not hold anymore because elasticity is lost.

02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:55.300
[Guest]: So all of these equations, all of these systems work within variables being within these boundaries,

02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:57.580
[Guest]: this variable in this boundary, this and that.

02:58:57.580 --> 02:59:01.540
[Guest]: Similarly, so like, for example, like similarly, it applies in social situations, right?

02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:07.380
[Guest]: Like, I have been a militant atheist before, like, anybody who is religious, I make it

02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:11.700
[Guest]: my business, I would make it my business to tell them why it's a foolish thing, right?

02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:17.780
[Guest]: But what a pointless thing to do, like a waste, like, so my grandmother is religious.

02:59:17.780 --> 02:59:24.660
[Guest]: It makes her a nicer person, and in that little context of her life, religion is a good thing.

02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:30.380
[Guest]: And I needed to appreciate that the truth has its place, or the absolute truth has its

02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:37.540
[Guest]: place, and the useful lie within a boundary within a certain set of limits has its useful

02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:38.540
[Amit Varma]: place.

02:59:38.540 --> 02:59:39.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:45.420
[Amit Varma]: That's why I think as one goes along with life and realizes that, listen, fundamentally,

02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:49.440
[Amit Varma]: life is meaningless and sad and ends in death, and we need to choose our delusions to get

02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:54.700
[Amit Varma]: by and some people have chosen religion and it's a convenient way to kind of get by and

02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:59.460
[Amit Varma]: we need to be kind and appreciate that I think there is also this balance between fidelity

02:59:59.460 --> 03:00:01.860
[Amit Varma]: to the truth and kindness.

03:00:01.860 --> 03:00:07.020
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes I think in some situations, you just need to not argue and just be kind

03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:08.020
[Amit Varma]: to the person.

03:00:08.020 --> 03:00:13.180
[Amit Varma]: Though I think that this invocation to kindness is often used by some people in ideological

03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:17.420
[Amit Varma]: context as appealing for, you know, when they don't want to talk about the truth, that don't

03:00:17.420 --> 03:00:21.060
[Amit Varma]: argue with what I believe, I will be offended and you have to be kind.

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:24.580
[Amit Varma]: So I think that is another extreme we kind of should not go to.

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:29.380
[Amit Varma]: Just continuing down this sort of control engineering mindset where you realize that

03:00:29.380 --> 03:00:34.300
[Amit Varma]: perfection is impossible, because, you know, all models are false, you can only get useful

03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:35.300
[Amit Varma]: with it.

03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:42.820
[Amit Varma]: Does that also then lead to that notion of satisficing like, you know, one thing that

03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:47.300
[Amit Varma]: I speak about in my course is that whenever you do something, there is that tradeoff between

03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:48.980
[Amit Varma]: getting it done and getting it right.

03:00:48.980 --> 03:00:52.980
[Amit Varma]: And my point always is that, as an artist, don't think about getting it right, just think

03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:54.280
[Amit Varma]: about getting it done.

03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:56.100
[Amit Varma]: And you can get it right later.

03:00:56.100 --> 03:00:58.780
[Amit Varma]: But especially when it comes to a first draft, just get it done.

03:00:58.780 --> 03:01:00.780
[Amit Varma]: The important thing is to get it done.

03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:05.420
[Amit Varma]: And you could also talk about this as a dichotomy between perfection and production.

03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:09.620
[Amit Varma]: And the irony here is that the route to getting it right is to get it done again and again.

03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:13.540
[Amit Varma]: And the route to perfection is through repeated production as you get better and better and

03:01:13.540 --> 03:01:14.540
[Amit Varma]: better.

03:01:14.540 --> 03:01:19.660
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, is it a good quality for an artist to satisfies like satisfies is a word

03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:24.820
[Amit Varma]: that is combination term combination of the two words satisfy and satisfies.

03:01:24.820 --> 03:01:29.620
[Amit Varma]: And what it means is you're satisfied with something that suffices, that you're not aiming

03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:33.180
[Amit Varma]: for perfection, that something that is good enough, you're happy to put it out there and

03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:34.260
[Amit Varma]: just move on.

03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:40.020
[Amit Varma]: And it seems like by the nature of your work, the sneaky art, you've been forced by circumstances

03:01:40.020 --> 03:01:44.860
[Amit Varma]: into satisficing all the time, where you don't have time, the person will get up and go,

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:47.340
[Amit Varma]: you just got to get what you can and then move on.

03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:53.420
[Amit Varma]: So do you feel that there is sort of deeper artistic value in this, for example, do you

03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:54.420
[Amit Varma]: think about this?

03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:59.380
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that this is a constraint or do you feel that by happenstance, you've been

03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:03.340
[Amit Varma]: forced into thinking this way, and it's actually a good way to think, you know, like you described

03:02:03.340 --> 03:02:07.380
[Amit Varma]: earlier that, let's say that there is someone who wants to do hyper realistic stuff, and

03:02:07.380 --> 03:02:10.980
[Amit Varma]: that person is standing in a queue, and that person cannot take out their material, but

03:02:10.980 --> 03:02:13.260
[Amit Varma]: you can you're always drawing, right?

03:02:13.260 --> 03:02:18.420
[Amit Varma]: And to me, that seems like a massive, massive, massive privilege, that at any point in time,

03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:21.980
[Amit Varma]: and I will tell my readers that he made a sketch of me while we were talking.

03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:23.300
[Amit Varma]: So just just imagine.

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:25.300
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on this?

03:02:25.300 --> 03:02:26.300
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:32.820
[Guest]: So I have I put myself in this situation where my perfectionism could not get in my way.

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:37.380
[Guest]: Choosing to draw with a pen, choosing to draw quickly, choosing to draw things that are

03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:43.620
[Guest]: transient, all of these things, perfectionism could not enter the picture.

03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:45.900
[Guest]: It's not a player in this game anymore.

03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:51.700
[Guest]: And I put it in in front of myself consciously, because I understand what my tendencies are.

03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:53.940
[Guest]: I know what my evils are.

03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:57.200
[Guest]: This is the mistake I always make, and I need to not make it.

03:02:57.200 --> 03:03:02.440
[Guest]: So I needed to be in a situation where perfectionism was not an option for me.

03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:06.460
[Guest]: So I often think about this idea of the things we call constraints.

03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:10.060
[Guest]: So it's a constraint that I have only one pen.

03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:11.500
[Guest]: I can't use another color.

03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:14.460
[Guest]: I can't use another line with thickness.

03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:15.460
[Guest]: I can't do this.

03:03:15.460 --> 03:03:16.460
[Guest]: I can't do that.

03:03:16.460 --> 03:03:17.980
[Guest]: I can't represent so many things.

03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:20.560
[Guest]: It's a constraint that I'm drawing quickly.

03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:24.740
[Guest]: That is this idea that you should be free to do your best work.

03:03:24.740 --> 03:03:28.460
[Guest]: You should have options so you can make the best choice.

03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:34.300
[Guest]: But more and more, I find that the best work does not come from these things like the best

03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:38.500
[Guest]: work comes when there is a deadline, for example, because you have to finish you finish, otherwise

03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:42.260
[Guest]: the best work just stays in your head, it never comes down on paper.

03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:45.660
[Guest]: Similarly, constraints in various forms.

03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:50.740
[Guest]: If you just change your perspective a little bit, they bring you great freedom.

03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:56.160
[Guest]: Having the constraint of only one fountain pen, not a pencil meant the freedom to finish

03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:58.060
[Guest]: many sketches.

03:03:58.060 --> 03:04:02.060
[Guest]: Having the constraint of time meant the freedom to draw this thing that is only there for

03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:03.740
[Guest]: this little time.

03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:10.340
[Guest]: Having the constraint of being sneaky meant that I am not anymore drawing in conspicuous

03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:11.340
[Guest]: positions.

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:13.060
[Guest]: Think about what a conspicuous spot is.

03:04:13.060 --> 03:04:16.340
[Guest]: If you're in front of the Eiffel Tower, that's a conspicuous spot.

03:04:16.340 --> 03:04:19.940
[Guest]: It's a conspicuous spot because everybody else is there.

03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:22.860
[Guest]: Because everybody wants to take a photo from that angle.

03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:28.660
[Guest]: Therefore, it is the most photographed and the most often seen view of the Eiffel Tower.

03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:34.780
[Guest]: By being sneaky, by imposing sneakiness on my art, I cannot take that option.

03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:37.540
[Guest]: I will circle around it two or three times.

03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:39.780
[Guest]: I will look for spots where nobody is.

03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:44.260
[Guest]: Therefore, I will look for spots from where pictures have not been taken or not likely

03:04:44.260 --> 03:04:46.100
[Guest]: to be taken as much.

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:49.380
[Guest]: I will therefore find something fresh.

03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:54.820
[Guest]: It has given me the freedom to discard my first point of view, my second choice, my

03:04:54.820 --> 03:04:59.860
[Guest]: third choice, and often my fourth choice, and therefore discover something that others

03:04:59.860 --> 03:05:01.140
[Guest]: have not.

03:05:01.140 --> 03:05:06.180
[Guest]: It has given me the freedom to find something original, quote-unquote, because nothing is

03:05:06.180 --> 03:05:11.100
[Guest]: really original, but it has given me the freedom to find something that others don't and to

03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:14.200
[Guest]: show something that other people are not showing.

03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:19.340
[Guest]: So I often think about this thing, about constraints and what we call constraints and why we try

03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:24.220
[Guest]: to run from constraints, because constraints have given me so many different freedoms.

03:05:24.220 --> 03:05:30.020
[Guest]: I'm only going to draw in this spot, and once I leave, I am not going to touch this sketch

03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:31.020
[Guest]: again.

03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:35.220
[Guest]: Therefore, there is this essence of that moment here.

03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:40.540
[Guest]: Some of these are incomplete, quote-unquote, they're not finished works, but they say where

03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:41.540
[Guest]: they are.

03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:47.060
[Guest]: They are an honest record of that time, and that is a quality that they have because they

03:05:47.060 --> 03:05:49.260
[Guest]: are never touched upon again.

03:05:49.260 --> 03:05:52.380
[Guest]: And that is a quality that very few other things can have.

03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:58.220
[Guest]: And as we explore this field of being creative entrepreneurs, being artists who have to create

03:05:58.220 --> 03:06:03.280
[Guest]: this brand, all of these identities matter because all of these identities are useful

03:06:03.280 --> 03:06:07.380
[Guest]: things to add value around your work.

03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:11.140
[Amit Varma]: So you mentioned the term creative entrepreneur, and that's kind of where I want to go next,

03:06:11.140 --> 03:06:15.860
[Amit Varma]: because it strikes me that in this modern age, there is much that is exciting about

03:06:15.860 --> 03:06:17.300
[Amit Varma]: this modern age.

03:06:17.300 --> 03:06:23.620
[Amit Varma]: But one thing that I feel a little unease at is that a creator is also expected to be

03:06:23.620 --> 03:06:27.540
[Amit Varma]: an entrepreneur, in the sense he's supposed to be the seller of his work, the entrepreneur

03:06:27.540 --> 03:06:31.980
[Amit Varma]: of his brand, be the guy pushing himself, like your art in the way that you actually

03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:34.460
[Amit Varma]: make it, that you produce it is sneaky.

03:06:34.460 --> 03:06:38.220
[Amit Varma]: But the selling is the opposite of that, you've got to go out on a limb and figure out how

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:40.900
[Amit Varma]: to get publicity and how to get your art out there.

03:06:40.900 --> 03:06:45.180
[Amit Varma]: Now it turns out that at one level, of course, this is something that you figured out how

03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:49.340
[Amit Varma]: to do well, whether it came naturally to you, or you worked at it, but you figured out how

03:06:49.340 --> 03:06:51.100
[Amit Varma]: to do well, but many people don't.

03:06:51.100 --> 03:06:55.540
[Amit Varma]: And the you know, and it's kind of unfair that artists also have to be entrepreneurs

03:06:55.540 --> 03:07:00.460
[Amit Varma]: in this way, in this day and age, though it is possible to, you know, that things can

03:07:00.460 --> 03:07:05.060
[Amit Varma]: work out and you can become successful without thinking of it in an entrepreneurial way.

03:07:05.060 --> 03:07:06.860
[Amit Varma]: But that takes a certain amount of luck.

03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:10.180
[Amit Varma]: For most artists, you're constantly working, working, working to get your brand out there

03:07:10.180 --> 03:07:15.420
[Amit Varma]: to get opportunities to figure out how to scale to figure out how to even gather the

03:07:15.420 --> 03:07:17.860
[Amit Varma]: first 1002 fans as it were.

03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:21.860
[Amit Varma]: So tell me of your journey in that regard, because you've already described how you want

03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:27.940
[Amit Varma]: to be a writer, you give up that other pyramid of engineer, PhD, whatever, to be a writer.

03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:31.300
[Amit Varma]: And then you discover drawing and is incredibly satisfying.

03:07:31.300 --> 03:07:36.700
[Amit Varma]: But from there, to making it a commercial proposition to sort of actually make money

03:07:36.700 --> 03:07:40.260
[Amit Varma]: from it and make it commercially viable, what was that journey like?

03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:41.980
[Amit Varma]: How did your thinking evolve?

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:44.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, what are the different routes that you explored?

03:07:44.420 --> 03:07:49.900
[Guest]: So I registered sneaky art as a business when I was living in Wisconsin.

03:07:49.900 --> 03:07:55.140
[Guest]: So I have business taxes that I collect and I pay as a business and I have business costs

03:07:55.140 --> 03:07:59.540
[Guest]: and more formalized setup that happened at that time.

03:07:59.540 --> 03:08:04.700
[Guest]: And I did it then because in Wisconsin, in this town of 80,000 people called Eau Claire,

03:08:04.700 --> 03:08:09.820
[Guest]: Wisconsin, right in the middle of the state, 90 miles away from the nearest city, there

03:08:09.820 --> 03:08:15.860
[Guest]: is this artist's market in every Saturday of summer, next to the farmer's market.

03:08:15.860 --> 03:08:21.620
[Guest]: So in the park where everybody congregates every morning from 6am to 12pm, a bunch of

03:08:21.620 --> 03:08:25.380
[Guest]: artists set up stalls and sell their wares.

03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:30.860
[Guest]: And having spent a year there, I decided now I want to sell my art.

03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:37.220
[Guest]: So as non sneaky as it gets, I have set up a stall with my prints and I am sitting and

03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:41.860
[Guest]: people are passing by who are here to buy vegetables or to buy cheese or something.

03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:44.860
[Guest]: And they stop and they look at my prints and they ask me what these are.

03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:50.300
[Guest]: And I tell them, it pushed me way out of my comfort zone, like firstly talking to complete

03:08:50.300 --> 03:08:55.780
[Guest]: strangers and telling them what I do and why they should care for it.

03:08:55.780 --> 03:09:02.100
[Guest]: Then putting a dollar value to my work, and then convincing, like the act of making a

03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:07.540
[Guest]: sale, there is some element of convincing, there is a pitch, even if it is something

03:09:07.540 --> 03:09:11.700
[Guest]: you give reluctantly, or you don't at all, but there is a pitch that needs to be made

03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:16.900
[Guest]: in some way, whether your art does it for you, or you talk a bit at least helps to talk.

03:09:16.900 --> 03:09:20.600
[Guest]: But I had to do these things which were uncomfortable.

03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:23.660
[Guest]: But these things have immense value.

03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:31.860
[Guest]: So from speaking to people who are there to buy vegetables, not here to buy art, and getting

03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:35.460
[Guest]: them to buy art, I learned things.

03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:41.140
[Guest]: Firstly from showing my work to people as a commercial artist, so I'm here to sell.

03:09:41.140 --> 03:09:45.780
[Guest]: With that in mind, when I showed my work to people, I set up my stall in a very formal

03:09:45.780 --> 03:09:46.780
[Guest]: way.

03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:51.420
[Guest]: Like I made sure I thought about the experience of somebody passing by, and the experience

03:09:51.420 --> 03:09:55.860
[Guest]: of somebody who decided to stop and walk in, what would they see next, where would they

03:09:55.860 --> 03:09:59.780
[Guest]: look, what should they be able to pick up, I thought about these things.

03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:05.260
[Guest]: So what that does is, it makes me think about my art not as the artist.

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:08.900
[Guest]: I have to externalize it, I have to look at it dispassionately.

03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:12.020
[Guest]: Why should they look at this piece, why should they look at that piece, is this going to

03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:15.940
[Guest]: be interesting to someone, why would they be interested in this, would it be simply

03:10:15.940 --> 03:10:19.400
[Guest]: because I enjoyed drawing it, that can't be the criteria.

03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:21.980
[Guest]: This is a useful exercise if you're an artist to get into.

03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:24.420
[Guest]: This is a useful exercise if you're a creative to get into.

03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:28.740
[Guest]: Even as a writer, you'd love your writing maybe, but you should think about the other

03:10:28.740 --> 03:10:32.400
[Guest]: person who's going to read it and why should they give a damn, because there is so much

03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:33.720
[Guest]: they can do.

03:10:33.720 --> 03:10:38.100
[Guest]: You can buy excellent cheese in Wisconsin, you don't need to buy my art.

03:10:38.100 --> 03:10:42.460
[Guest]: I had to price my art a certain way, I had to put that dollar value, and I thought about

03:10:42.460 --> 03:10:47.340
[Guest]: what is it that I want to be doing here, what is my objective here, what do I want to learn

03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:53.500
[Guest]: from it, what is a win, is a win a dollar amount, tough, tough to put a dollar amount

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:57.420
[Guest]: and because you don't know what's good, what's bad, I can settle $200 is a great amount if

03:10:57.420 --> 03:10:58.800
[Guest]: I make that much sale.

03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:01.120
[Guest]: But what is that, how do I know that's good.

03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:04.060
[Guest]: So I have to have some notion of something that is good to me.

03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:08.700
[Guest]: So I set this benchmark for my first year, first summer that I was selling art, that

03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:11.680
[Guest]: I want to sell art for as cheap as possible.

03:11:11.680 --> 03:11:15.420
[Guest]: What I want to do is, so controlling variables here, right?

03:11:15.420 --> 03:11:18.460
[Guest]: So I want to make as many sales as I can.

03:11:18.460 --> 03:11:21.460
[Guest]: And I want to control the various variables around the sale.

03:11:21.460 --> 03:11:24.500
[Guest]: One variable is, I don't want to spend so much money.

03:11:24.500 --> 03:11:25.500
[Guest]: What is their budget?

03:11:25.500 --> 03:11:28.380
[Guest]: They are not here to spend money on art, right?

03:11:28.380 --> 03:11:33.740
[Guest]: So I had to think of the minimum amount of money that someone would take out of their

03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:36.820
[Guest]: pocket without a second thought.

03:11:36.820 --> 03:11:39.340
[Guest]: What is that number in this place?

03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:40.340
[Guest]: It is contextual.

03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:44.980
[Guest]: This is a rural place in Wisconsin, it's not Chicago City, Chicago, that number might be

03:11:44.980 --> 03:11:49.420
[Guest]: $20, India, that Bombay, that number might be 200 rupees, Calcutta, that number might

03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:54.100
[Guest]: be 100 rupees, Wisconsin, that number as I perceived it was $5.

03:11:54.100 --> 03:11:57.740
[Guest]: So my cheapest drawing needs to be $5, my most expensive drawing can't be more than

03:11:57.740 --> 03:11:58.740
[Guest]: $20.

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:03.860
[Guest]: With this idea, I am controlling for hesitation, financial hesitation.

03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:07.240
[Guest]: Now this is not a factor anymore in this game.

03:12:07.240 --> 03:12:08.340
[Guest]: What is a factor?

03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:11.600
[Guest]: Now the factor is only do I want it?

03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:14.940
[Guest]: Now I get to examine, do people want my drawing?

03:12:14.940 --> 03:12:16.840
[Guest]: I am not pricing anyone out.

03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:17.840
[Guest]: Anybody can buy this.

03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:23.060
[Guest]: $5, anybody can spend here and if they like my work, they might not buy the $20 piece

03:12:23.060 --> 03:12:25.540
[Guest]: but they will want to go away with the $5 piece.

03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:27.340
[Guest]: Once you have them, you have them.

03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:30.340
[Guest]: And they want to do something now because once they are interested, they actually want

03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:31.340
[Guest]: to spend money.

03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:32.340
[Guest]: They don't want to leave empty handed.

03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:34.020
[Guest]: It makes people feel bad.

03:12:34.020 --> 03:12:38.260
[Guest]: It's part of the psychology of spending money that you want to do something now.

03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:40.160
[Guest]: So $5.

03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:44.980
[Guest]: What this did was, now I started to think, what is the space that my art can occupy in

03:12:44.980 --> 03:12:46.980
[Guest]: someone's life?

03:12:46.980 --> 03:12:49.020
[Guest]: What is a $5 piece of art?

03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:51.740
[Guest]: It can't be a piece on a wall.

03:12:51.740 --> 03:12:53.860
[Guest]: It has to be a small print, maybe.

03:12:53.860 --> 03:12:56.540
[Guest]: How do people use small prints?

03:12:56.540 --> 03:12:59.020
[Guest]: Is it something that looks like a card?

03:12:59.020 --> 03:13:01.980
[Guest]: Maybe a sticker for their laptops?

03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:05.380
[Guest]: Is it something that maybe they can put in their wallets?

03:13:05.380 --> 03:13:09.420
[Guest]: So what art of mine does that purpose?

03:13:09.420 --> 03:13:13.700
[Guest]: I'm now thinking about my art in terms of how it means to someone in their life.

03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:15.580
[Guest]: $5 is what they pay for it.

03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:17.100
[Guest]: $5 is not what it means anymore.

03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:20.500
[Guest]: Now that it is there, why would they want it in their life?

03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:23.260
[Guest]: This is a useful exercise for all creatives also.

03:13:23.260 --> 03:13:27.340
[Guest]: Think about what place do you occupy?

03:13:27.340 --> 03:13:30.660
[Guest]: After one season of selling art in this way, I sold hundreds of prints this way.

03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:32.500
[Guest]: I got many commissions.

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:33.860
[Guest]: Lots of people were super happy to buy it.

03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:34.860
[Guest]: I sold stickers.

03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:38.380
[Guest]: So a bunch of students came one time who didn't want to spend even $5.

03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:41.100
[Guest]: For $1, I gave them 2-3 stickers.

03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:44.260
[Guest]: And they bought sets of stickers, not because they could only afford it.

03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:46.740
[Guest]: So somebody ended up spending $10 on stickers.

03:13:46.740 --> 03:13:48.740
[Guest]: Not because that's the only thing they can afford.

03:13:48.740 --> 03:13:51.080
[Guest]: But this is the way they want that art.

03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:54.580
[Guest]: So I learned that art has many final forms.

03:13:54.580 --> 03:13:56.460
[Guest]: I made a drawing in a sketchbook.

03:13:56.460 --> 03:13:58.460
[Guest]: Now it can be so many different things.

03:13:58.460 --> 03:13:59.800
[Guest]: It can be a print.

03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:03.180
[Guest]: It can be a print on a wall, like on fine art paper.

03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:05.000
[Guest]: It could even be a fabric print.

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:06.260
[Guest]: It can be a sticker.

03:14:06.260 --> 03:14:10.620
[Guest]: It can be a digital piece that somebody buys to make as a wallpaper or a phone wallpaper

03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:11.860
[Guest]: or something.

03:14:11.860 --> 03:14:17.100
[Guest]: All of these are various ways that people engage with art in their lives.

03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:22.980
[Guest]: We often dismiss people who don't buy fine art as Philistines or whatever.

03:14:22.980 --> 03:14:24.720
[Guest]: They don't appreciate things.

03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:29.460
[Guest]: But more people appreciate art than that.

03:14:29.460 --> 03:14:36.220
[Guest]: It is incumbent on the artist to think about the way that their audience engages with art.

03:14:36.220 --> 03:14:43.740
[Guest]: It is not the right approach, in my opinion, to make the art and then be like somebody

03:14:43.740 --> 03:14:45.540
[Guest]: owes you a sale.

03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:49.540
[Guest]: Somebody owes it to buy from you because you are so creative, you have done your job.

03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:51.020
[Guest]: That is irresponsible.

03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:55.860
[Guest]: That is, it's, I don't think in any field of work that is appreciated.

03:14:55.860 --> 03:15:01.300
[Guest]: But in terms of art, it's almost made into a virtue because people don't want to engage

03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:05.740
[Guest]: with this commercial side, which is ugly and demeaning.

03:15:05.740 --> 03:15:10.540
[Guest]: And for a long time, it's been that way because we haven't had the tools of commercial engagement

03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:11.540
[Guest]: in our hands.

03:15:11.540 --> 03:15:12.540
[Guest]: Right.

03:15:12.540 --> 03:15:17.500
[Guest]: Like somebody like Da Vinci and all the other big artists, they needed patrons at a time

03:15:17.500 --> 03:15:22.200
[Guest]: in Florence, in Italy, they needed the Medici family to patronize all these artists who

03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:23.980
[Guest]: became fantastic, great artists.

03:15:23.980 --> 03:15:26.420
[Guest]: So you need to please this person.

03:15:26.420 --> 03:15:30.220
[Guest]: Then he will put your work somewhere that hopefully other people can see it.

03:15:30.220 --> 03:15:34.180
[Guest]: And then maybe it lasts the test of time, blah, blah, blah, becomes a thing.

03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:39.340
[Guest]: But so over the last 20 years, that thing changed for us because of the internet.

03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:40.340
[Guest]: First there was no money.

03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:41.340
[Guest]: You can put your art there.

03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:42.340
[Guest]: There's no money.

03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:43.460
[Guest]: You can put it on Flickr, whatever, whatever.

03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:45.140
[Guest]: Then you can put it on Facebook.

03:15:45.140 --> 03:15:47.380
[Guest]: And then you can make these business pages.

03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:49.260
[Guest]: And then you can put it on Instagram.

03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:51.860
[Guest]: And now suddenly you have affiliate marketing.

03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:57.660
[Guest]: And suddenly you can reach an audience and build an infinite audience potentially.

03:15:57.660 --> 03:16:02.120
[Guest]: And you can get money from a few people who decide to endorse you affiliates.

03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:05.380
[Guest]: So brands and corporations who like, Oh, I'll give you a pen.

03:16:05.380 --> 03:16:09.660
[Guest]: I'll give you you only use my sketchbook, for example, use only my art supplies, my

03:16:09.660 --> 03:16:13.980
[Guest]: paints and tag us and we will then give you so much so much.

03:16:13.980 --> 03:16:16.540
[Guest]: And that have that works for a lot of artists.

03:16:16.540 --> 03:16:21.820
[Guest]: And now we have reached a point where even the means of monetization are distributed.

03:16:21.820 --> 03:16:27.460
[Guest]: You can gather small funds and micro payments from various various hundreds of fans.

03:16:27.460 --> 03:16:29.860
[Guest]: This is very freeing.

03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:34.420
[Guest]: This is super liberating because like you mentioned with the blogs, for example, now

03:16:34.420 --> 03:16:40.060
[Guest]: it's not 800 words or 1000 words or 5000 words, it can be 50 words, it can be microfiction,

03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:41.540
[Guest]: it can be haiku.

03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:47.740
[Guest]: If you have the fans, if you have the people who care, then you get to define the terms.

03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:50.020
[Guest]: Every artist should love that reality.

03:16:50.020 --> 03:16:55.100
[Guest]: You are not bound to make a fine art piece on canvas, which is eight feet tall or something

03:16:55.100 --> 03:16:56.100
[Guest]: like that.

03:16:56.100 --> 03:16:58.000
[Guest]: You can do whatever you want.

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:02.820
[Guest]: You can make a product out of the piece, you can make a product out of a cool photo of

03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:05.500
[Guest]: the piece, which is better than the piece itself.

03:17:05.500 --> 03:17:09.700
[Guest]: The experience of looking at art on Instagram is the experience you're offering the thing

03:17:09.700 --> 03:17:14.300
[Guest]: that you are offering the experience of watching you draw through a time lapse video of which

03:17:14.300 --> 03:17:16.220
[Guest]: I post many myself.

03:17:16.220 --> 03:17:19.140
[Guest]: That experience is the product you are offering.

03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:22.580
[Guest]: Suddenly the final piece that I drew and how it turned out is irrelevant.

03:17:22.580 --> 03:17:26.260
[Guest]: Just watching me draw set to some cool music on reels or tick tock.

03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:27.540
[Guest]: That is the product.

03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:29.740
[Guest]: I'm giving you that beautiful 30 seconds.

03:17:29.740 --> 03:17:32.900
[Guest]: You can replay it again and again and forever and enjoy it.

03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:33.900
[Guest]: And many people do that.

03:17:33.900 --> 03:17:38.840
[Guest]: They watch these videos again and again, again, huge freedom for the artist.

03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:43.900
[Guest]: You can do whatever you want and you can reach people who are okay with that.

03:17:43.900 --> 03:17:50.700
[Guest]: These freedoms come with the responsibility now that now you have to think about why they

03:17:50.700 --> 03:17:51.860
[Guest]: should care.

03:17:51.860 --> 03:17:56.300
[Guest]: Because if you can do whatever you want, anybody else can also do whatever they want, right?

03:17:56.300 --> 03:18:01.180
[Guest]: Why should they look at your art and not the art of some person in say, the other side

03:18:01.180 --> 03:18:02.180
[Guest]: of the world?

03:18:02.180 --> 03:18:04.980
[Guest]: If you live in Vancouver, why shouldn't they look at someone's art in Australia, like it's

03:18:04.980 --> 03:18:05.980
[Guest]: all Instagram.

03:18:05.980 --> 03:18:10.660
[Guest]: There is a fantastic artist I follow from Australia who does beautiful time lapse videos,

03:18:10.660 --> 03:18:12.580
[Guest]: huge audience way bigger than mine.

03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:15.580
[Guest]: And of course, people will follow her like it's all the same, right?

03:18:15.580 --> 03:18:19.660
[Guest]: I'm competing with her in a sense, you could, I could think that and then I could be like,

03:18:19.660 --> 03:18:21.080
[Guest]: oh, that's so wrong.

03:18:21.080 --> 03:18:23.500
[Guest]: But that's, that's not how this works.

03:18:23.500 --> 03:18:28.940
[Guest]: The responsibility that comes to me is that, how do I differentiate myself?

03:18:28.940 --> 03:18:30.100
[Guest]: I get to do that.

03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:33.020
[Guest]: This is also a freedom I have and but it's part of my responsibilities.

03:18:33.020 --> 03:18:37.100
[Guest]: I have to brand myself, I have to talk about myself in a certain way.

03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:39.300
[Guest]: Why should someone care about me?

03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:42.320
[Guest]: Is it because I'm the greatest artist in the world?

03:18:42.320 --> 03:18:47.380
[Guest]: So am I making it my business to compete with 5 million artists on Instagram?

03:18:47.380 --> 03:18:52.740
[Guest]: Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Michelangelo never had this kind of competition.

03:18:52.740 --> 03:18:58.100
[Guest]: They had to compete for the attention of one patron or two patrons or 10 patrons only with

03:18:58.100 --> 03:19:02.140
[Guest]: the people who are in that town, or somebody comes from outside.

03:19:02.140 --> 03:19:03.140
[Guest]: That's it.

03:19:03.140 --> 03:19:04.140
[Guest]: That's the competition.

03:19:04.140 --> 03:19:05.140
[Guest]: Right?

03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:07.420
[Guest]: They didn't have, nobody has ever had to compete with so many people.

03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:11.420
[Amit Varma]: It's like an artist in Versova competing with everyone else in Versova for the attention

03:19:11.420 --> 03:19:12.420
[Amit Varma]: of the king of Versova.

03:19:12.420 --> 03:19:13.420
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:19:13.420 --> 03:19:16.980
[Amit Varma]: In fact, even smaller, Yari Road, because the population in the town would be so much

03:19:16.980 --> 03:19:17.980
[Guest]: less.

03:19:17.980 --> 03:19:18.980
[Guest]: Yeah, right.

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:23.060
[Guest]: But if he makes it his job to be on Instagram and thinks that now he's in competition with

03:19:23.060 --> 03:19:27.460
[Guest]: everybody else who's on Instagram, then that's a losing battle again.

03:19:27.460 --> 03:19:29.240
[Guest]: It does not mean that you're not good.

03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:33.060
[Guest]: It does not mean that you don't deserve to make money off your art.

03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:36.980
[Guest]: Surely the point is not that one person should make money off art, like only the person who's

03:19:36.980 --> 03:19:38.620
[Guest]: right on top.

03:19:38.620 --> 03:19:41.340
[Guest]: So you have to demolish this whole structure.

03:19:41.340 --> 03:19:46.540
[Guest]: Why you is not about just how good you are, because that's a race you're not going to

03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:47.540
[Guest]: win.

03:19:47.540 --> 03:19:52.340
[Guest]: Why you is a question now of other things.

03:19:52.340 --> 03:19:54.860
[Guest]: Maybe it has to do with how you made your art.

03:19:54.860 --> 03:19:56.980
[Guest]: Maybe it has to do with who you are.

03:19:56.980 --> 03:20:01.180
[Guest]: Why should somebody in Versova care about an artist in Versova and not an artist in

03:20:01.180 --> 03:20:02.180
[Guest]: Australia?

03:20:02.180 --> 03:20:04.660
[Guest]: You have to give them that reason.

03:20:04.660 --> 03:20:08.380
[Guest]: They will like to talk, know an artist in Versova.

03:20:08.380 --> 03:20:09.380
[Guest]: Actually it's true.

03:20:09.380 --> 03:20:10.380
[Guest]: They would.

03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:12.620
[Guest]: But it is your responsibility to develop those reasons.

03:20:12.620 --> 03:20:18.660
[Guest]: It is your responsibility to woo them and to do the communication job that does this.

03:20:18.660 --> 03:20:23.560
[Guest]: So with these tools of monetization, these tools of distribution, these tools of audience

03:20:23.560 --> 03:20:29.100
[Guest]: outreach, comes the responsibility that now you get, you have to, you can do outreach.

03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:30.800
[Guest]: So now you have to do outreach.

03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:32.620
[Guest]: You can monetize from anybody.

03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:35.360
[Guest]: So now you have to think about what's going to monetize.

03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:37.100
[Guest]: What art do they care about?

03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:38.340
[Guest]: What kind of art do they care?

03:20:38.340 --> 03:20:40.300
[Guest]: How do they engage with art?

03:20:40.300 --> 03:20:42.980
[Guest]: What can you offer that somebody else can't?

03:20:42.980 --> 03:20:46.300
[Guest]: So there's this idea, you know, of how we should, originality, there's no such thing

03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:47.300
[Guest]: as originality.

03:20:47.300 --> 03:20:51.060
[Guest]: All of us, whether you're a writer or an artist, you're not original.

03:20:51.060 --> 03:20:56.420
[Guest]: You are borrowing, you are begging and stealing and copying from everybody else before you.

03:20:56.420 --> 03:21:00.980
[Guest]: And then you may be, if you're very lucky, you move one inch forward into something that

03:21:00.980 --> 03:21:01.980
[Guest]: nobody's ever done.

03:21:01.980 --> 03:21:06.100
[Guest]: Maybe, maybe a very tiny fraction, and then they move the whole thing forward for everybody

03:21:06.100 --> 03:21:09.420
[Guest]: else after them to copy that very easily.

03:21:09.420 --> 03:21:13.500
[Guest]: So I tell people, don't try to be original, try to be authentic.

03:21:13.500 --> 03:21:16.900
[Guest]: There's a very subtle difference between these two things.

03:21:16.900 --> 03:21:21.140
[Guest]: Authenticity is what you have that nobody else has, because it is authentic to you.

03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:22.140
[Guest]: Who are you?

03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:25.020
[Guest]: Talk like you say what your journey is.

03:21:25.020 --> 03:21:30.040
[Guest]: So tiny people drawings matter to people because not just because they're the best drawings

03:21:30.040 --> 03:21:31.040
[Guest]: of people on a street.

03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:33.460
[Guest]: No, there are far greater artists than me.

03:21:33.460 --> 03:21:36.820
[Guest]: It matters because of the story I make around tiny people.

03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:41.780
[Guest]: That story is unique, and that story gives value to these drawings that I make.

03:21:41.780 --> 03:21:47.260
[Guest]: The idea that tiny people are a non fungible moment in space and time that these people

03:21:47.260 --> 03:21:52.840
[Guest]: are a result of my observation from that street intersection that day while having that coffee

03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:54.940
[Guest]: and looking in this direction.

03:21:54.940 --> 03:21:57.980
[Guest]: And it can never happen again.

03:21:57.980 --> 03:22:02.260
[Guest]: Because those people will not be in the street at the same time dress that same way the weather,

03:22:02.260 --> 03:22:04.940
[Guest]: my ideas, my inclinations and my moods.

03:22:04.940 --> 03:22:08.440
[Guest]: Even if you bring all of those things together, maybe I'll just happen to look at different

03:22:08.440 --> 03:22:10.340
[Guest]: things then and draw different people.

03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:13.820
[Guest]: Because I drew someone and five other people passed by also that I didn't draw.

03:22:13.820 --> 03:22:15.300
[Guest]: Maybe I'll draw someone else.

03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:17.820
[Guest]: This moment can never be replicated.

03:22:17.820 --> 03:22:22.860
[Guest]: This drawing in this way, this collection of hundred people on this page can never ever

03:22:22.860 --> 03:22:24.360
[Guest]: happen again.

03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:27.180
[Guest]: It is from this day on this location.

03:22:27.180 --> 03:22:30.620
[Guest]: This creates value around what that piece is.

03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:33.860
[Guest]: This helps people understand the significance of that.

03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:38.700
[Guest]: And this is me talking because now I'm thinking about what do I think about things like existentialism

03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:40.300
[Guest]: phenomenology?

03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:44.860
[Guest]: What do I think about space and time and this idea of things coming and never repeating

03:22:44.860 --> 03:22:45.860
[Guest]: again?

03:22:45.860 --> 03:22:46.860
[Guest]: This is me talking right?

03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:50.560
[Guest]: This is make this makes it authentic to me that nobody else has.

03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:51.660
[Guest]: This gives it value.

03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:54.980
[Guest]: It's not about the technical skill of my drawing.

03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:59.600
[Guest]: So there is a lot of liberation in the idea of being a creative entrepreneur.

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:03.500
[Guest]: But we get bogged down in these things that all I'll have to do things and I don't want

03:23:03.500 --> 03:23:10.940
[Guest]: to do things like I just want to draw and as an outsider to art, I don't have much patience

03:23:10.940 --> 03:23:11.940
[Guest]: for this.

03:23:11.940 --> 03:23:16.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, before we proceed, I think since we both mentioned Warsaw a couple of times,

03:23:16.220 --> 03:23:22.060
[Amit Varma]: we should give a shout out to our mutual unseen friend, the founder, the 92 year old founder

03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:27.360
[Amit Varma]: of the Warsaw Mumblecore movement, which existed long before Warsaw did.

03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:30.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, the point you made is something that I tell people about all the time in my

03:23:30.840 --> 03:23:34.840
[Amit Varma]: course as well that you know, like I remember while I was teaching the podcasting course

03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:38.380
[Amit Varma]: in the first batch and somebody was like, trying to figure out where is a hole in the

03:23:38.380 --> 03:23:39.380
[Amit Varma]: market.

03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:43.180
[Amit Varma]: I was like, dude, the point is there are more than a million podcasts, any hole in the market

03:23:43.180 --> 03:23:46.020
[Amit Varma]: if it exists will be filled before you get there.

03:23:46.020 --> 03:23:49.260
[Amit Varma]: Interview podcasts are a dime a dozen policy podcasts are a dime a dozen.

03:23:49.260 --> 03:23:53.380
[Amit Varma]: The hole in the market is really you, you know, the only thing that makes a podcast

03:23:53.380 --> 03:23:57.700
[Amit Varma]: unique is you so you got to be authentic to yourself and that being authentic to yourself

03:23:57.700 --> 03:23:59.840
[Guest]: is the only thing that works.

03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:01.140
[Guest]: And it's a big enough challenge.

03:24:01.140 --> 03:24:03.220
[Amit Varma]: It's super difficult to do this.

03:24:03.220 --> 03:24:04.220
[Amit Varma]: It's super difficult.

03:24:04.220 --> 03:24:06.540
[Amit Varma]: But I think if you flick a switch, no, it's super easy.

03:24:06.540 --> 03:24:10.940
[Amit Varma]: You just have to flick that switch once like all the vlogs I watch, for example, on YouTube,

03:24:10.940 --> 03:24:12.580
[Amit Varma]: they're all people who are authentic to themselves.

03:24:12.580 --> 03:24:16.420
[Amit Varma]: I know exactly what they're like, or if someone listens to my podcast, I would imagine they

03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:19.380
[Amit Varma]: know exactly what I'm like, because what you see is what you get.

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:21.020
[Amit Varma]: You can't fake it for too long.

03:24:21.020 --> 03:24:24.020
[Amit Varma]: Even if you're on reality TV and a camera is on you, you know, you can't fake it for

03:24:24.020 --> 03:24:25.020
[Amit Varma]: too long.

03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:27.240
[Amit Varma]: Eventually you will relapse into being who you are.

03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:32.540
[Amit Varma]: So I think that there's something in that and you know, you spoke about sort of authenticity

03:24:32.540 --> 03:24:33.540
[Amit Varma]: being difficult.

03:24:33.540 --> 03:24:36.940
[Amit Varma]: And earlier you had mentioned that whenever people in public find you drawing something

03:24:36.940 --> 03:24:40.940
[Amit Varma]: that only appreciative, and I'm just thinking of what my instinctive reaction would be.

03:24:40.940 --> 03:24:44.380
[Amit Varma]: And it would also be appreciative regardless of the drawer or the drawing.

03:24:44.380 --> 03:24:49.660
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that would be that most of the ugly competition around us is people

03:24:49.660 --> 03:24:53.020
[Amit Varma]: constantly trying to project an image of themselves onto the world.

03:24:53.020 --> 03:24:54.980
[Amit Varma]: That's all that social media is.

03:24:54.980 --> 03:24:57.540
[Amit Varma]: It's just a constant battle of posturing.

03:24:57.540 --> 03:25:02.020
[Amit Varma]: And when someone is sitting lost in a drawing, what they're doing is exactly the opposite.

03:25:02.020 --> 03:25:05.540
[Amit Varma]: They're not projecting an image of themselves onto the world, but they're internalizing

03:25:05.540 --> 03:25:08.240
[Amit Varma]: something that they see and they're working on it.

03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:14.260
[Amit Varma]: And just that act itself, there's a certain beauty to it, which I kind of appreciate there.

03:25:14.260 --> 03:25:20.060
[Amit Varma]: So there is this mindset that on the one hand, you are seeking the zen like state that just

03:25:20.060 --> 03:25:22.260
[Amit Varma]: going out there and drawing what you see gives you.

03:25:22.260 --> 03:25:26.100
[Amit Varma]: At the other end, there is a hustle, like in one of your posts is also the picture of

03:25:26.100 --> 03:25:27.100
[Amit Varma]: you in a suit.

03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:29.980
[Amit Varma]: Like I think the Marriott commissioned you to do some paintings and they invited you

03:25:29.980 --> 03:25:33.260
[Amit Varma]: to this gig and you had a stall like thing where you're selling books and you're wearing

03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:34.860
[Amit Varma]: a suit and all that.

03:25:34.860 --> 03:25:36.740
[Amit Varma]: And again, that's not sneaky art.

03:25:36.740 --> 03:25:38.260
[Amit Varma]: It's non-sneaky selling.

03:25:38.260 --> 03:25:39.260
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

03:25:39.260 --> 03:25:42.740
[Amit Varma]: And you looked at technology for that in the sense you're very active on Reddit.

03:25:42.740 --> 03:25:44.140
[Amit Varma]: That's been a part of your gig.

03:25:44.140 --> 03:25:48.740
[Amit Varma]: You've been thinking fairly deeply about building communities like through Discord.

03:25:48.740 --> 03:25:52.740
[Amit Varma]: You've been examining mechanisms like, you know, the buy me a coffee thing.

03:25:52.740 --> 03:25:56.820
[Amit Varma]: And you're completely right that the remarkable thing is that, you know, 20 years ago, as

03:25:56.820 --> 03:26:02.060
[Amit Varma]: a creator, I would not be able to reach my audience directly, I would have to go through

03:26:02.060 --> 03:26:05.620
[Amit Varma]: an intermediary, there would be gatekeepers who would have the tools of publishing.

03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:09.060
[Amit Varma]: I think the blogging age made me kind of jump through that.

03:26:09.060 --> 03:26:13.580
[Amit Varma]: But even in the blogging age, even in the aughties, you know, while my readers would

03:26:13.580 --> 03:26:18.020
[Amit Varma]: place value on my work, because they're reading it, they're spending time, time is money,

03:26:18.020 --> 03:26:20.900
[Amit Varma]: I would not be able to capture any of that value directly.

03:26:20.900 --> 03:26:25.580
[Amit Varma]: And the only way to capture it was in a very clumsy way where intermediaries say, I write

03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:29.620
[Amit Varma]: for the Times of India, they accumulate eyeballs, they sell advertising, a very small chunk

03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:30.980
[Amit Varma]: of that comes to me.

03:26:30.980 --> 03:26:34.500
[Amit Varma]: And the remarkable thing about these modern times is today, that's changed completely,

03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:38.100
[Amit Varma]: you know, as I've experienced over the last year and a half as you've experienced.

03:26:38.100 --> 03:26:46.620
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit more about your feelings about what this new age holds for creators.

03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:51.340
[Amit Varma]: Like how do you think differently now about your art than say, when you started?

03:26:51.340 --> 03:26:57.580
[Guest]: So like, what is true today, is something that even with the tech could not have been

03:26:57.580 --> 03:27:04.140
[Guest]: possible before, like, you mentioned, say, 2005-2006, you didn't have the means of monetization.

03:27:04.140 --> 03:27:06.940
[Guest]: There have been services that have tried to do this before, there was this service called

03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:08.500
[Guest]: Flatter.

03:27:08.500 --> 03:27:10.660
[Guest]: And Flatter, the idea is beautiful.

03:27:10.660 --> 03:27:15.220
[Guest]: The idea is that if you are a Flatter user, say you're a reader who reads a lot, you have

03:27:15.220 --> 03:27:19.640
[Guest]: a Flatter account, and you would put in $30 a month.

03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:23.500
[Guest]: This is my patronage to various creators that I will find on the internet.

03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:27.100
[Guest]: Wherever you go, you find a YouTube video, you write, you see an article you like, if

03:27:27.100 --> 03:27:29.420
[Guest]: they have a Flatter button, you click it.

03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:34.620
[Guest]: And what it does is suppose you click 10 buttons over the month, it will split your $30 into

03:27:34.620 --> 03:27:36.220
[Guest]: 10 places and give it to these people.

03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:37.820
[Amit Varma]: If you click 500, then it will split it.

03:27:37.820 --> 03:27:40.460
[Amit Varma]: That's a fantastic concept, before its time, I'm sure.

03:27:40.460 --> 03:27:41.460
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:27:41.460 --> 03:27:43.580
[Guest]: The trouble with that was it was before its time.

03:27:43.580 --> 03:27:44.980
[Guest]: For various reasons, it didn't work.

03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:47.100
[Guest]: One was that you need to have a Flatter account.

03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:50.620
[Guest]: So every person who wants to endorse has to sign up with this service.

03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:52.820
[Guest]: That's a hurdle, won't happen.

03:27:52.820 --> 03:27:57.380
[Guest]: Secondly, what happened was that the notion of microtransactions did not exist in the

03:27:57.380 --> 03:27:58.860
[Guest]: way it does.

03:27:58.860 --> 03:28:02.260
[Guest]: So that needed many things to happen together.

03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:06.700
[Guest]: That needs firstly, it needs people to get tired of institutional content.

03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:09.980
[Guest]: It needs people to be tired of what the algorithm is throwing at them.

03:28:09.980 --> 03:28:14.260
[Guest]: So suppose all of this technology was possible in 2012, it would not work because people

03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:16.220
[Guest]: were too enamored by Facebook.

03:28:16.220 --> 03:28:20.420
[Guest]: What Facebook is throwing at them is still so fresh that why do I need to record is this

03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:22.500
[Guest]: I'm getting all this for free.

03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:27.220
[Guest]: So many forces had to come align in a sense, like so many stars had to align for this to

03:28:27.220 --> 03:28:32.180
[Guest]: be the right time for this to happen, that we are very of the algorithm, we are tired

03:28:32.180 --> 03:28:35.220
[Guest]: of the kind of content that is thrown at us.

03:28:35.220 --> 03:28:40.500
[Guest]: And we are seeing so much new content and so many incredible formats and all these random

03:28:40.500 --> 03:28:46.260
[Guest]: creators creating something extremely unexpected from so much like all this, all these TikTok

03:28:46.260 --> 03:28:50.340
[Guest]: creators, the kind of thing like, so that people dismiss TikTok, right?

03:28:50.340 --> 03:28:53.940
[Guest]: Like just think what TikTok is doing to Instagram.

03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:59.420
[Guest]: Instagram meant that if I make a piece of art, which is which maybe took me five months

03:28:59.420 --> 03:29:04.180
[Guest]: to make, I make an Instagram post of it, because that's the only place you can post.

03:29:04.180 --> 03:29:09.100
[Guest]: And people are just scrolling past, maybe I get point one seconds from somebody.

03:29:09.100 --> 03:29:14.140
[Guest]: That's it, if they really like me, maybe they give me one second, if they are absolutely

03:29:14.140 --> 03:29:16.740
[Guest]: in love with me, maybe they will read my caption.

03:29:16.740 --> 03:29:18.340
[Guest]: So five seconds.

03:29:18.340 --> 03:29:19.340
[Guest]: That's it.

03:29:19.340 --> 03:29:20.340
[Guest]: That's it.

03:29:20.340 --> 03:29:21.340
[Guest]: TikTok.

03:29:21.340 --> 03:29:25.980
[Guest]: If you do a decent job, you are asking and you are getting 30 seconds of engagement,

03:29:25.980 --> 03:29:30.340
[Guest]: you're getting 60 seconds of engagement, because now you can make 60 second videos.

03:29:30.340 --> 03:29:33.900
[Guest]: That is orders of magnitude more.

03:29:33.900 --> 03:29:38.540
[Guest]: And all it needs is for you to engage in its format, that same piece of art.

03:29:38.540 --> 03:29:40.420
[Guest]: If you just set it to music.

03:29:40.420 --> 03:29:44.580
[Guest]: And after you made it, you just make a video sort of moving over it and showing all its

03:29:44.580 --> 03:29:51.100
[Guest]: nuances to the right mood set by the right song within a 60 second clip, suddenly you

03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:56.340
[Guest]: are getting millions of people to engage with you for 60 seconds, they are in it for this

03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:57.340
[Guest]: experience.

03:29:57.340 --> 03:30:03.180
[Guest]: Like this is a result of its times and it is causing so much fantastic usage like this

03:30:03.180 --> 03:30:08.860
[Guest]: idea that you can use a song and you can repurpose it to show art or you can repurpose it and

03:30:08.860 --> 03:30:09.860
[Guest]: to dance to it.

03:30:09.860 --> 03:30:13.180
[Guest]: These are all these are not envisioned by TikTok founders.

03:30:13.180 --> 03:30:20.180
[Guest]: These are all things that innovative creators came up with to circumvent as they were thinking

03:30:20.180 --> 03:30:21.340
[Guest]: the systems.

03:30:21.340 --> 03:30:25.340
[Guest]: But what they did was they charted a new path of things that are possible to do.

03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:28.380
[Guest]: Then came this idea that, oh, I'll also imitate what this person did.

03:30:28.380 --> 03:30:29.380
[Guest]: And then there was this idea.

03:30:29.380 --> 03:30:30.380
[Guest]: Oh, now there are trends.

03:30:30.380 --> 03:30:34.540
[Guest]: You do dances according to TikTok, you do acts according to TikTok.

03:30:34.540 --> 03:30:37.700
[Guest]: All of that became a thing because hashtags will proliferate.

03:30:37.700 --> 03:30:42.940
[Guest]: So all of these systems, how they work organically to make things happen.

03:30:42.940 --> 03:30:46.320
[Guest]: It's never because of one thing or one person or one idea.

03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:49.220
[Guest]: It's because of all these various things aligning.

03:30:49.220 --> 03:30:53.740
[Guest]: And as a creator today, all of these various things are aligning in beautiful ways.

03:30:53.740 --> 03:30:58.260
[Guest]: So like I was saying before, like I have little patience for people who say that I'm just

03:30:58.260 --> 03:30:59.260
[Guest]: an artist.

03:30:59.260 --> 03:31:00.780
[Guest]: I don't want to think about the money.

03:31:00.780 --> 03:31:04.060
[Guest]: Because what you are saying is I want to go back to 2005.

03:31:04.060 --> 03:31:05.060
[Guest]: I don't want that to be.

03:31:05.060 --> 03:31:06.380
[Guest]: I don't care about social media.

03:31:06.380 --> 03:31:08.740
[Guest]: I don't care about monetization streams.

03:31:08.740 --> 03:31:14.900
[Guest]: I just want to make art and I want some gallery owner to love me and then sell my art to people.

03:31:14.900 --> 03:31:17.340
[Guest]: You are asking us to go back in time to those days.

03:31:17.340 --> 03:31:21.140
[Guest]: And therefore, you want to resurrect the gates and the gatekeepers.

03:31:21.140 --> 03:31:24.660
[Guest]: Your personal inabilities aside, I have no patience for that.

03:31:24.660 --> 03:31:25.660
[Guest]: I'm sorry.

03:31:25.660 --> 03:31:31.140
[Guest]: So hopefully we, but the future that we are thinking about, the future that we are starting

03:31:31.140 --> 03:31:34.120
[Guest]: to see is not a singular idea future.

03:31:34.120 --> 03:31:38.540
[Guest]: So hopefully that market will still exist and gallery owners will exist and curators

03:31:38.540 --> 03:31:41.660
[Guest]: will exist and you will hopefully continue to make sales.

03:31:41.660 --> 03:31:45.220
[Guest]: But since you will not, that is not the only market anymore.

03:31:45.220 --> 03:31:48.140
[Guest]: It will not be the way you envisioned it would be.

03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:51.860
[Guest]: And I for one, I'm glad for that because it allows people like me to be an artist.

03:31:51.860 --> 03:31:56.540
[Guest]: It allows people like me to be a podcaster and it allows people like me to reach 1,000

03:31:56.540 --> 03:32:00.980
[Guest]: true fans with a newsletter, things that would be impossible before.

03:32:00.980 --> 03:32:04.860
[Guest]: So this is just a glorious time to be a creator.

03:32:04.860 --> 03:32:10.900
[Guest]: Like I think it is the best time to, it's, it has, it has its risks because now that

03:32:10.900 --> 03:32:17.860
[Guest]: this idea is there, what it does is it takes away this, the beauty of anonymity and maybe

03:32:17.860 --> 03:32:21.540
[Guest]: this is me being nostalgic about what it used to be like.

03:32:21.540 --> 03:32:27.340
[Guest]: So maybe I'm wrong, but if you're a blogger before and you don't have an audience, there

03:32:27.340 --> 03:32:31.780
[Guest]: is a certain phase in your life when you need to not have an audience.

03:32:31.780 --> 03:32:36.100
[Guest]: You need to just like, so that cynical phase of me, when I was making jokes and getting

03:32:36.100 --> 03:32:40.380
[Guest]: things out, this got me in the flow of expressing myself.

03:32:40.380 --> 03:32:43.740
[Guest]: If I was getting reactions then and people telling me, how can you make this joke?

03:32:43.740 --> 03:32:44.740
[Guest]: How dare you?

03:32:44.740 --> 03:32:49.300
[Guest]: Or someone reading it and maybe not saying that, let's say nobody sends me those reactions,

03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:51.620
[Guest]: but I know 5,000 people are reading it.

03:32:51.620 --> 03:32:52.660
[Guest]: I might be affected.

03:32:52.660 --> 03:32:55.460
[Guest]: I might start thinking about, do I want to say this to people?

03:32:55.460 --> 03:32:59.340
[Guest]: Should I say to people, what if something happens, someone's self-conscious like me,

03:32:59.340 --> 03:33:04.860
[Guest]: if I had a notion of a vast audience, I would have trouble saying things like flip side

03:33:04.860 --> 03:33:11.800
[Guest]: of thinking that you can get an audience if you do the right thing, is that you don't

03:33:11.800 --> 03:33:14.540
[Guest]: enjoy the time that you don't have an audience.

03:33:14.540 --> 03:33:19.740
[Guest]: And I think a lot of creators and writers and artists should cherish the period when

03:33:19.740 --> 03:33:21.140
[Guest]: they don't have an audience.

03:33:21.140 --> 03:33:27.580
[Guest]: That's the time when you can put in like lots of work, not have a fixed image of yourself

03:33:27.580 --> 03:33:31.340
[Guest]: because once you have an audience, they have an image of you.

03:33:31.340 --> 03:33:36.420
[Guest]: And I just spoke, I recorded with somebody recently who did really well on Instagram.

03:33:36.420 --> 03:33:39.900
[Guest]: And she grew an audience to like 30, 40,000 followers.

03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:43.580
[Guest]: And what that did was it chained her, it bound her.

03:33:43.580 --> 03:33:46.780
[Guest]: Now she felt I have to give them what they want.

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:48.580
[Guest]: I can't do just what I want.

03:33:48.580 --> 03:33:52.140
[Guest]: This drawing that I wanted to make, I can't share it because that's not what clicked last

03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:53.140
[Guest]: time.

03:33:53.140 --> 03:33:56.580
[Guest]: So I have to do what clicked last time and things escalated and it became really bad

03:33:56.580 --> 03:33:57.580
[Guest]: for her.

03:33:57.580 --> 03:33:58.580
[Guest]: She worked a lot.

03:33:58.580 --> 03:34:01.540
[Guest]: She got into depression and anxiety, suffered from a burnout.

03:34:01.540 --> 03:34:05.700
[Guest]: And she had to kind of take these reins back in her hands.

03:34:05.700 --> 03:34:07.420
[Guest]: And we talk about that in our conversation.

03:34:07.420 --> 03:34:09.020
[Guest]: This episode is going to come out next week.

03:34:09.020 --> 03:34:15.100
[Guest]: In fact, that how important it is to engage with the audience in a new medium.

03:34:15.100 --> 03:34:20.500
[Guest]: So this is another aspect of the creator economy today, which is beautiful in that you can

03:34:20.500 --> 03:34:25.060
[Guest]: take your audience from one platform to another and engage with them in a different way.

03:34:25.060 --> 03:34:29.140
[Guest]: This is absolutely not answering the question you asked, but I see the internet as two kinds

03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:31.400
[Guest]: of places as a creator.

03:34:31.400 --> 03:34:37.100
[Guest]: So one is a place where metaphorically you cast a net, you catch attention and you people

03:34:37.100 --> 03:34:41.580
[Guest]: look at you, Twitter's like that, Facebook's like that, Instagram is like that, but these

03:34:41.580 --> 03:34:42.580
[Guest]: are also split.

03:34:42.580 --> 03:34:44.760
[Guest]: They look at you and then they look away.

03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:49.560
[Guest]: So you have one second at best to do something, play your trick.

03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:52.480
[Guest]: And that trick is to take them to the other part of the internet.

03:34:52.480 --> 03:34:54.780
[Guest]: These I think of as destinations.

03:34:54.780 --> 03:34:55.860
[Guest]: This is your blog.

03:34:55.860 --> 03:34:56.860
[Guest]: This is your newsletter.

03:34:56.860 --> 03:34:59.060
[Guest]: This is your podcast.

03:34:59.060 --> 03:35:03.620
[Guest]: And a small fraction of these people whose attention you catch will go with you over

03:35:03.620 --> 03:35:04.620
[Guest]: there.

03:35:04.620 --> 03:35:06.080
[Guest]: They will hit that link and they will go somewhere.

03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:11.040
[Guest]: But this is then your opportunity to engage with them on new terms.

03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:15.300
[Guest]: So a lot of people are frustrated with how things are today that, oh, the internet is

03:35:15.300 --> 03:35:18.060
[Guest]: such a terrible place for content and this and that.

03:35:18.060 --> 03:35:22.380
[Guest]: But it's because you're doing things on Instagram that can't be done on Instagram.

03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:24.180
[Guest]: You can't talk to people on Instagram.

03:35:24.180 --> 03:35:25.900
[Guest]: That's not what they go to Instagram to do.

03:35:25.900 --> 03:35:29.220
[Guest]: They go there to scroll and you are saying, don't scroll.

03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:32.420
[Guest]: Zuckerberg is making them scroll, giving them dopamine for scrolling.

03:35:32.420 --> 03:35:34.300
[Guest]: And you are saying, don't scroll.

03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:36.060
[Guest]: You're making it an unpleasant experience.

03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:40.740
[Guest]: They feel guilt whenever they see your post and therefore they avoid your post even more.

03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:43.760
[Guest]: So you have to take them to that platform where they will engage with you.

03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:47.020
[Guest]: So you must have seen this, like, like you were talking about how you were doing shorter

03:35:47.020 --> 03:35:50.980
[Guest]: form content before, because you thought there's no market for this, right?

03:35:50.980 --> 03:35:54.940
[Guest]: And in fact, one of the first times we had engaged with each other on Twitter, you had

03:35:54.940 --> 03:35:57.860
[Guest]: posted something about a short attention span.

03:35:57.860 --> 03:36:01.020
[Guest]: And I had replied saying that I don't think there is a short attention span.

03:36:01.020 --> 03:36:05.900
[Guest]: And that later became a blog post I wrote in, I formulated further ideas from it.

03:36:05.900 --> 03:36:10.060
[Guest]: Like I told you in that tweet, there's no short attention span because more PhD thesis

03:36:10.060 --> 03:36:11.980
[Guest]: are written today than ever before.

03:36:11.980 --> 03:36:17.520
[Guest]: And read more big books and big series are written today and read by more people.

03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:20.500
[Guest]: And more long TV series are binge watched.

03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:22.660
[Guest]: So that short attention span is not true.

03:36:22.660 --> 03:36:27.780
[Guest]: It's an observation bias because short attention span people make themselves known and float

03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:31.580
[Guest]: to the top and occupy all make a lot of noise because they have a short attention span.

03:36:31.580 --> 03:36:32.580
[Amit Varma]: That's a good point.

03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:35.940
[Amit Varma]: I don't remember the exchange at all, which I will pretend proves my point.

03:36:35.940 --> 03:36:39.540
[Guest]: So that was a mistaken way of thinking.

03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:43.620
[Guest]: So this exchange sort of became the first lines of a post I wrote about how there is

03:36:43.620 --> 03:36:45.780
[Guest]: not a short attention span problem.

03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:52.140
[Guest]: There is a short attention span, but we misinterpret the symptoms and we misdiagnose solutions.

03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:55.540
[Guest]: What we have is not a chronic short attention span problem.

03:36:55.540 --> 03:36:59.100
[Guest]: What we have is a short consideration span.

03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:04.340
[Guest]: And what I mean by that is the amount of time somebody will give you before considering

03:37:04.340 --> 03:37:07.040
[Guest]: whether to give you more time.

03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:08.960
[Guest]: Because there are so many things they can do.

03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:09.960
[Guest]: They can scroll away.

03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:13.740
[Guest]: There are other YouTube recommendations that are on the websites, there's Instagram with

03:37:13.740 --> 03:37:15.820
[Amit Varma]: other things, there's Twitter.

03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:19.820
[Amit Varma]: I think that might be only true at the first moment of discovery, the first time to discover

03:37:19.820 --> 03:37:20.820
[Guest]: you.

03:37:20.820 --> 03:37:21.820
[Guest]: I don't think it's true even after.

03:37:21.820 --> 03:37:26.540
[Guest]: For example, if someone is reading an article, if you have a long chunk of text, they will

03:37:26.540 --> 03:37:29.540
[Guest]: simply close the tab, they'll do something else instead.

03:37:29.540 --> 03:37:30.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:37:30.540 --> 03:37:32.980
[Amit Varma]: But if it's Tim Hufford, I'm going to read the full thing, even if it's a long chunk

03:37:32.980 --> 03:37:34.380
[Amit Varma]: of text, because it's Tim Hufford.

03:37:34.380 --> 03:37:35.380
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:37:35.380 --> 03:37:38.740
[Guest]: So you have a prior notion of the reward that that person will give you for sticking with

03:37:38.740 --> 03:37:39.740
[Amit Varma]: their text.

03:37:39.740 --> 03:37:40.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:37:40.740 --> 03:37:44.780
[Guest]: But a lot of new readers will simply not do it because in today's time, there are other

03:37:44.780 --> 03:37:46.540
[Guest]: things they can consider.

03:37:46.540 --> 03:37:50.620
[Guest]: And therefore it will maybe, maybe they need somebody to tell them who this person is.

03:37:50.620 --> 03:37:54.900
[Guest]: And maybe they need somebody to validate this person from before somebody who respect tweeting

03:37:54.900 --> 03:37:58.460
[Guest]: this person out and saying that, Hey, this is worth your time, give it time.

03:37:58.460 --> 03:37:59.860
[Guest]: And then they go to it, whatever.

03:37:59.860 --> 03:38:05.460
[Guest]: But generally a good writer who doesn't do things to recalibrate the consideration of

03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:07.700
[Guest]: his readers is going to lose readers.

03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:12.220
[Guest]: So there are many people who write newsletters now who say have a chunk of long text and

03:38:12.220 --> 03:38:14.260
[Guest]: they don't get the readership.

03:38:14.260 --> 03:38:18.940
[Guest]: And the good advice around it is that you need to every few minutes or every whatever

03:38:18.940 --> 03:38:23.700
[Guest]: reading time, you need to give them another reason why they should keep reading.

03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:28.580
[Amit Varma]: I think this way of thinking is an example of a model that is useful, but not necessarily

03:38:28.580 --> 03:38:29.580
[Amit Varma]: the whole truth.

03:38:29.580 --> 03:38:33.700
[Amit Varma]: Because the way I look at the content I discover and the things I listen to, and typically

03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:37.020
[Amit Varma]: a lot of it will come when a friend will recommend something highly and say, Hey, check this

03:38:37.020 --> 03:38:38.020
[Amit Varma]: out.

03:38:38.020 --> 03:38:42.380
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, regardless of my attention span or consideration span, I'll trust that

03:38:42.380 --> 03:38:43.500
[Amit Varma]: judgment and go with it.

03:38:43.500 --> 03:38:46.860
[Amit Varma]: And if it is someone whose work I'm familiar with, which is actually most of the content

03:38:46.860 --> 03:38:52.340
[Amit Varma]: we consume, or at least I consume, I'm not sure this would be necessarily an issue.

03:38:52.340 --> 03:38:53.980
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so here's the thing.

03:38:53.980 --> 03:38:58.260
[Amit Varma]: I was like number one to respond to what you said earlier, I kind of agree with you like

03:38:58.260 --> 03:39:02.780
[Amit Varma]: one of my guests on the show in an episode I've already recorded, but will release next

03:39:02.780 --> 03:39:04.340
[Amit Varma]: week, December 6.

03:39:04.340 --> 03:39:09.900
[Amit Varma]: But before this episode releases is also a former writer of Gussaki Maaf, which is Abhinandan

03:39:09.900 --> 03:39:12.140
[Amit Varma]: Sekri, who runs News Laundry.

03:39:12.140 --> 03:39:16.740
[Amit Varma]: And he and I were chatting about how if when we were 20, if we posted what we thought on

03:39:16.740 --> 03:39:19.820
[Amit Varma]: Twitter, we would have been cancelled for sure.

03:39:19.820 --> 03:39:23.560
[Amit Varma]: We would, you know, screenshots of that time would surface today, and we'd be screwed.

03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:26.540
[Amit Varma]: Because you need this period of time, like you said, when you're anonymous, when no one's

03:39:26.540 --> 03:39:31.140
[Amit Varma]: reading you, when you can discover what you're doing, either in terms of your thinking or

03:39:31.140 --> 03:39:34.580
[Amit Varma]: your view of the world, or of your art and all of that.

03:39:34.580 --> 03:39:36.100
[Amit Varma]: And that's incredibly useful.

03:39:36.100 --> 03:39:40.700
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, like my blog, fortunately enough, right from the start had a pretty

03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:44.900
[Amit Varma]: big audience, so we're seen in the unseen us today, though it's now lost in the mists

03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:45.900
[Amit Varma]: of time.

03:39:45.900 --> 03:39:49.100
[Amit Varma]: But that was very useful for me, actually, because that kept me going.

03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:52.540
[Amit Varma]: The fact that like people would write to me, you know, at my peak, after I'd done five

03:39:52.540 --> 03:39:57.860
[Amit Varma]: years of it, like between 2004 and 2009, I did some five posts a day on my blog.

03:39:57.860 --> 03:39:59.980
[Amit Varma]: So I had 8000 posts in that period.

03:39:59.980 --> 03:40:06.180
[Amit Varma]: And at my peak, I had some 20,000 views a day, which was a lot of which was responsibility,

03:40:06.180 --> 03:40:10.260
[Amit Varma]: which was that, you know, people would write to me and say that, hey, I live in New Zealand,

03:40:10.260 --> 03:40:14.100
[Amit Varma]: and I don't read any of the Indian newspapers, I just go to India Uncut, and I see what's

03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:15.140
[Amit Varma]: happening there.

03:40:15.140 --> 03:40:18.620
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, was, you know, back in the day before social media really took off

03:40:18.620 --> 03:40:20.260
[Amit Varma]: before Twitter and all that.

03:40:20.260 --> 03:40:25.560
[Amit Varma]: So this was a great commitment device that I would write because I felt they were listeners.

03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:31.420
[Amit Varma]: The other aspect of this whole thing of artists needing to be salesmen, is that, yeah, I get

03:40:31.420 --> 03:40:33.380
[Amit Varma]: it that these opportunities are open to you.

03:40:33.380 --> 03:40:36.460
[Amit Varma]: And you can't just say, right, I'll do my art, you want it to reach someone, you want

03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:41.020
[Amit Varma]: it to have an effect, you want to do justice to the art that you produce and get it to

03:40:41.020 --> 03:40:42.380
[Amit Varma]: its audience.

03:40:42.380 --> 03:40:47.300
[Amit Varma]: But you know, one issue that can emerge with that is that people then start depending too

03:40:47.300 --> 03:40:52.340
[Amit Varma]: much on validation, that they'll do something, and they'll market it, and they'll say, shit,

03:40:52.340 --> 03:40:57.620
[Amit Varma]: I'm getting 10 views, I'm getting 13 views, or like Puneet Superstar in the earlier discussed

03:40:57.620 --> 03:40:59.500
[Amit Varma]: story, three views per video.

03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:01.980
[Amit Varma]: And then you say that I'm not going to do this anymore.

03:41:01.980 --> 03:41:06.380
[Amit Varma]: And that's disastrous, because the advice I give young creators is that find something

03:41:06.380 --> 03:41:11.220
[Amit Varma]: that you love doing for its own sake, and then just stick to it and don't look for validation

03:41:11.220 --> 03:41:12.780
[Amit Varma]: for a long, long time.

03:41:12.780 --> 03:41:17.220
[Amit Varma]: Because creators tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term.

03:41:17.220 --> 03:41:22.940
[Amit Varma]: And if you're constantly making your production depend on validation, and validation will

03:41:22.940 --> 03:41:28.580
[Amit Varma]: not come early on, one, because it takes time to organically build an audience and two,

03:41:28.580 --> 03:41:32.180
[Amit Varma]: because you will suck at the start, like I'm sure even your old drawings suck.

03:41:32.180 --> 03:41:35.820
[Amit Varma]: So you'll suck at the start, you got to keep doing it again and again, to become good.

03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:38.820
[Amit Varma]: So I think it can become a bit of a double edged sword.

03:41:38.820 --> 03:41:43.540
[Amit Varma]: But the important thing I would advise all creators, and in a sense, you've lived this

03:41:43.540 --> 03:41:47.740
[Amit Varma]: with through your work, is that bloody hell, just do something you love.

03:41:47.740 --> 03:41:52.540
[Amit Varma]: That's the starting point, you know, and then shit happens around it, you know, you build

03:41:52.540 --> 03:41:53.540
[Amit Varma]: something organically.

03:41:53.540 --> 03:41:57.940
[Amit Varma]: And yes, you can have a marketing mindset, a sales mindset, figure out how do I grow

03:41:57.940 --> 03:41:58.940
[Amit Varma]: my brand?

03:41:58.940 --> 03:42:00.740
[Amit Varma]: How do I build a community around me?

03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:02.180
[Amit Varma]: How do I monetize it?

03:42:02.180 --> 03:42:03.740
[Amit Varma]: But to me, all of those come later.

03:42:03.740 --> 03:42:05.940
[Amit Varma]: The first thing is that do something you love.

03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:07.340
[Amit Varma]: And if you love it, keep doing it.

03:42:07.340 --> 03:42:10.660
[Guest]: That's the whole point of loving something, absolutely, absolutely.

03:42:10.660 --> 03:42:14.540
[Guest]: And in fact, this is becoming easier today than before.

03:42:14.540 --> 03:42:20.700
[Guest]: Because while we were still in this earlier mindset that you need to appeal to these institutions

03:42:20.700 --> 03:42:25.700
[Guest]: that will sponsor you, you needed to therefore become viral, like that was the only means

03:42:25.700 --> 03:42:31.380
[Guest]: of success and virality meant appealing to millions of people, which means a broad denominator

03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:32.380
[Guest]: of people.

03:42:32.380 --> 03:42:35.340
[Guest]: And therefore, your work loses its unique charm.

03:42:35.340 --> 03:42:39.300
[Guest]: So maybe you sacrifice on the thing that you enjoy the most in the interest of fitting

03:42:39.300 --> 03:42:45.380
[Guest]: into a groove, which will go viral into formats that will go viral into styles that are trending.

03:42:45.380 --> 03:42:47.140
[Guest]: So therefore, I should do this.

03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:50.820
[Guest]: And therefore, it becomes less about your personal joy and more about these goals, which

03:42:50.820 --> 03:42:53.260
[Guest]: you need to reach in order to be able to do it.

03:42:53.260 --> 03:42:57.660
[Guest]: And then you sort of suspend your joy in the short term thinking, maybe once I reach this

03:42:57.660 --> 03:42:59.420
[Guest]: audience, then I'll be able to do these things.

03:42:59.420 --> 03:43:03.780
[Guest]: And then that never comes, because the never ending cycle, both of these points are true,

03:43:03.780 --> 03:43:05.260
[Guest]: like exactly, it's a double edged sword.

03:43:05.260 --> 03:43:11.340
[Guest]: So I was thinking about you getting 20,000 views in 2006 2007, the circumstance around

03:43:11.340 --> 03:43:17.780
[Guest]: that is so useful that there was no economy based on performative reactions.

03:43:17.780 --> 03:43:18.780
[Guest]: There was no Twitter.

03:43:18.780 --> 03:43:24.020
[Guest]: And therefore, I mean, yeah, so now because there is Twitter, there is a whole reputational

03:43:24.020 --> 03:43:30.580
[Guest]: economy based on reacting of virtue signaling and performative reactions to earnest content

03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:35.900
[Guest]: may be foolish, maybe wrong, maybe out of context, it is anathema even, but whatever

03:43:35.900 --> 03:43:42.380
[Guest]: something someone says, you are incentivized to take it out of context, you are rewarded

03:43:42.380 --> 03:43:47.460
[Guest]: for taking it to the worst possible attributions to those words.

03:43:47.460 --> 03:43:52.660
[Guest]: And whether or not you are right about it, there is a lot to gain from doing these things.

03:43:52.660 --> 03:43:57.620
[Guest]: And this just, it's not that these people are bad people, it's just that this algorithm

03:43:57.620 --> 03:44:02.660
[Guest]: is so rewarding if you do this, and it therefore it becomes the way that they interact with

03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:03.660
[Guest]: other people.

03:44:03.660 --> 03:44:05.220
[Guest]: Like I often think about why this happens.

03:44:05.220 --> 03:44:09.180
[Guest]: There are so many people who and you've spoken so much about and we've talked actually together

03:44:09.180 --> 03:44:14.900
[Guest]: about this kind of performative virtue signaling that happens on Twitter and why it happens.

03:44:14.900 --> 03:44:20.260
[Guest]: It's because I feel like we are so we've been thrust into the social media.

03:44:20.260 --> 03:44:27.580
[Guest]: And nobody is quite prepared for what it means that 1000 people will read what you are thinking.

03:44:27.580 --> 03:44:32.740
[Guest]: And those 1000 people are not in your locality, they are not 1000 people like you, who have

03:44:32.740 --> 03:44:37.860
[Guest]: had your education or your various socioeconomic parameters, a matchup, none of those things.

03:44:37.860 --> 03:44:41.180
[Guest]: They are from entirely different worlds.

03:44:41.180 --> 03:44:46.780
[Guest]: What social media is doing is, it is throwing these worlds together, these worlds are colliding

03:44:46.780 --> 03:44:49.780
[Guest]: to use George Costanza's phrase.

03:44:49.780 --> 03:44:52.380
[Guest]: And that's makes George angry.

03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:55.780
[Guest]: That's a terrible, unfortunate situation.

03:44:55.780 --> 03:45:00.780
[Guest]: Someone is young on Twitter, and they see somebody tweet something that hurts them.

03:45:00.780 --> 03:45:05.140
[Guest]: Maybe Amit says something about someone that they idolize, and they don't like it.

03:45:05.140 --> 03:45:08.660
[Guest]: Because that's not Amit talking to his people.

03:45:08.660 --> 03:45:13.740
[Guest]: This that is this entity who has entered their world, saying something about something that

03:45:13.740 --> 03:45:17.020
[Guest]: they feel a certain way about.

03:45:17.020 --> 03:45:23.020
[Guest]: And they don't have the wherewithal, the understanding or maybe the time and mental energy to put

03:45:23.020 --> 03:45:25.020
[Guest]: it in its own context.

03:45:25.020 --> 03:45:28.420
[Guest]: Because this whole game is about reacting in your context, you are reacting to your

03:45:28.420 --> 03:45:29.420
[Guest]: followers, right?

03:45:29.420 --> 03:45:30.900
[Guest]: This is how Twitter works.

03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:33.820
[Guest]: You are not saying something to the person.

03:45:33.820 --> 03:45:36.020
[Guest]: This is why I like Reddit so much as compared to Twitter.

03:45:36.020 --> 03:45:40.140
[Guest]: For example, you're not saying something to the person on Twitter, you are saying something

03:45:40.140 --> 03:45:44.020
[Guest]: for your people to hear you say to that person.

03:45:44.020 --> 03:45:48.460
[Guest]: So performativeness is not like this terrible thing they did.

03:45:48.460 --> 03:45:50.540
[Guest]: Performativeness is what they have been forced into.

03:45:50.540 --> 03:45:55.220
[Guest]: I respond to someone on Twitter, I typed out half my reply, and I think, you know, my followers

03:45:55.220 --> 03:45:56.220
[Guest]: are going to see this.

03:45:56.220 --> 03:45:58.220
[Guest]: Do I want people to see this?

03:45:58.220 --> 03:46:02.380
[Guest]: Do I care to say this if other people are going to see this and then they'll follow

03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:04.920
[Guest]: this thread and what will that say about me?

03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:08.100
[Guest]: So this, I am being forced into a performance.

03:46:08.100 --> 03:46:09.220
[Guest]: I didn't ask for it.

03:46:09.220 --> 03:46:10.220
[Guest]: I don't want it.

03:46:10.220 --> 03:46:13.380
[Guest]: I don't want to see what other people reply to other people's tweets.

03:46:13.380 --> 03:46:16.340
[Guest]: Like I literally just want to see people's tweets.

03:46:16.340 --> 03:46:17.980
[Guest]: I don't want to see what they like.

03:46:17.980 --> 03:46:19.340
[Guest]: I don't want to see who they follow.

03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:21.620
[Guest]: I don't want to see who they reply to.

03:46:21.620 --> 03:46:24.660
[Guest]: Because sometimes you find out unpleasant things about people you're speaking to also

03:46:24.660 --> 03:46:27.020
[Guest]: and you don't want to shatter that image like you.

03:46:27.020 --> 03:46:28.420
[Guest]: I just want to know you as this thing.

03:46:28.420 --> 03:46:30.300
[Guest]: I don't care to know more about you.

03:46:30.300 --> 03:46:31.780
[Guest]: Please let's keep distance.

03:46:31.780 --> 03:46:32.900
[Guest]: But Twitter doesn't let you.

03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:38.020
[Guest]: It throws this performativeness and this really terrible situations at you.

03:46:38.020 --> 03:46:40.380
[Guest]: And people are reacting to it.

03:46:40.380 --> 03:46:43.580
[Guest]: Reacting is this privilege, you know, like we live in a hierarchical country.

03:46:43.580 --> 03:46:47.540
[Guest]: Like we were talking right at the start of this conversation about how the cynicism meant

03:46:47.540 --> 03:46:52.660
[Guest]: putting someone down, right, because in a hierarchical mindset, that's the way you have

03:46:52.660 --> 03:46:53.660
[Guest]: value.

03:46:53.660 --> 03:46:55.100
[Guest]: There is no objective value.

03:46:55.100 --> 03:46:58.580
[Guest]: There is only am I better than this or am I worse than that?

03:46:58.580 --> 03:47:02.740
[Guest]: So always we are trying to climb over someone else, because that's the only way we can get

03:47:02.740 --> 03:47:03.740
[Guest]: a sense.

03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:06.820
[Guest]: Like if I have climbed over this person, I am better than so many people.

03:47:06.820 --> 03:47:11.220
[Guest]: If I can dunk on Amit Verma on Twitter, then I can in front of my crowd look smarter than

03:47:11.220 --> 03:47:12.780
[Guest]: Amit Verma on Twitter.

03:47:12.780 --> 03:47:16.060
[Guest]: That does not take into account what Amit feels about it.

03:47:16.060 --> 03:47:20.660
[Guest]: That does not take into account whether I misread or correctly interpreted what Amit

03:47:20.660 --> 03:47:21.660
[Guest]: said.

03:47:21.660 --> 03:47:25.420
[Guest]: It does not care about these things, because in his world, in their world, this person

03:47:25.420 --> 03:47:28.220
[Guest]: is trying to climb a little bit higher.

03:47:28.220 --> 03:47:32.220
[Guest]: And these things are sadly incentivized.

03:47:32.220 --> 03:47:37.940
[Guest]: And these things, when someone gets the first chance to react to someone, again, in a hierarchical

03:47:37.940 --> 03:47:42.260
[Guest]: country, you don't get many opportunities to express yourself.

03:47:42.260 --> 03:47:43.420
[Guest]: Suddenly you can.

03:47:43.420 --> 03:47:45.220
[Guest]: You can respond not only to Amit Verma.

03:47:45.220 --> 03:47:47.620
[Guest]: You can even respond to Amitabh Bachchan.

03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:51.580
[Guest]: And you can make fun of, oh, you put tweet numbers, ha ha ha, old man.

03:47:51.580 --> 03:47:52.580
[Guest]: And whatever.

03:47:52.580 --> 03:47:53.580
[Guest]: You can.

03:47:53.580 --> 03:47:57.060
[Guest]: Everybody's in that stage that I was in, that cynical stage, like nobody else matters.

03:47:57.060 --> 03:47:58.460
[Guest]: I am the only real person.

03:47:58.460 --> 03:48:00.260
[Guest]: These are all figments of my imagination.

03:48:00.260 --> 03:48:01.260
[Guest]: All these are the humans.

03:48:01.260 --> 03:48:02.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:48:02.260 --> 03:48:04.540
[Amit Varma]: And I can behave in a way that I would never behave in real life.

03:48:04.540 --> 03:48:05.540
[Guest]: Absolutely not.

03:48:05.540 --> 03:48:08.260
[Amit Varma]: In real life, I would never be rude to Amit Verma if I come across him.

03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:13.740
[Guest]: But Twitter is giving you this license, ki bol do kuch bhi, kyunki ha ha ha hoga thoda.

03:48:13.740 --> 03:48:17.180
[Guest]: And then you can close the app and then you can go back to your real world.

03:48:17.180 --> 03:48:18.180
[Guest]: This is all fake.

03:48:18.180 --> 03:48:19.260
[Guest]: These are not real people.

03:48:19.260 --> 03:48:22.900
[Guest]: So it reinforces this mindset that you are the only real thing here.

03:48:22.900 --> 03:48:23.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:48:23.900 --> 03:48:24.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean, two aspects of this.

03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:26.820
[Amit Varma]: And one is like you correctly pointed out.

03:48:26.820 --> 03:48:29.620
[Amit Varma]: If someone feels attacked, these are different worlds colliding.

03:48:29.620 --> 03:48:34.700
[Amit Varma]: If some worldviews are like religion, you know, if you attack somebody's God, of course

03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:35.700
[Amit Varma]: they will get offended.

03:48:35.700 --> 03:48:40.280
[Amit Varma]: So just as a question of politeness, I would not say bad things about somebody's religion.

03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:44.180
[Amit Varma]: But in a similar way, if you say something about that disagrees with someone's ideological

03:48:44.180 --> 03:48:48.020
[Amit Varma]: point of view or challenges that, you're basically doing exactly the same thing.

03:48:48.020 --> 03:48:49.020
[Amit Varma]: So it becomes personal.

03:48:49.020 --> 03:48:52.780
[Amit Varma]: But what is worse, and I think Jonathan Haidt pointed to it that, you know, the seminal

03:48:52.780 --> 03:48:57.620
[Amit Varma]: moment in all of this and social media becoming toxic was the Facebook like button and the

03:48:57.620 --> 03:48:59.300
[Amit Varma]: Twitter retweet button.

03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:01.380
[Amit Varma]: Because suddenly that validation becomes a big deal.

03:49:01.380 --> 03:49:06.500
[Amit Varma]: And if there is one trend I absolutely hate about Twitter, it's about dunking on people.

03:49:06.500 --> 03:49:12.060
[Amit Varma]: You know, we should be discussing ideas, we should be discussing things, policies, events.

03:49:12.060 --> 03:49:14.740
[Amit Varma]: Instead we are dunking on individuals all the time.

03:49:14.740 --> 03:49:18.260
[Amit Varma]: Like I see so many people dunking on Chetan Bhagat, for example.

03:49:18.260 --> 03:49:21.100
[Amit Varma]: Bhai, if you don't like him, don't read him.

03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:25.180
[Amit Varma]: There's no need to, you know, why are you giving him space in your head?

03:49:25.180 --> 03:49:28.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, and frankly, my sense of Chetan Bhagat, and I think I shared this in clear

03:49:28.820 --> 03:49:33.460
[Amit Varma]: writing group that we're both part of today, is that, you know, beyond the point, the bottom

03:49:33.460 --> 03:49:35.540
[Amit Varma]: line is he's right about the elites.

03:49:35.540 --> 03:49:39.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, he's gone out there, and he's done what he's done.

03:49:39.220 --> 03:49:43.540
[Amit Varma]: And he's a doer, he's writing books, he's changing the culture, no matter what we think

03:49:43.540 --> 03:49:47.040
[Amit Varma]: of the books he's writing or the way he's changing the culture, while we elites are

03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:48.500
[Amit Varma]: sipping up in our guladas.

03:49:48.500 --> 03:49:49.940
[Amit Varma]: He's also an elite.

03:49:49.940 --> 03:49:51.700
[Amit Varma]: He's also an elite, that's a different matter.

03:49:51.700 --> 03:49:54.020
[Amit Varma]: My point is that stop dunking on the guy.

03:49:54.020 --> 03:49:56.700
[Amit Varma]: If you think he's worth nothing, why waste your mind space on him?

03:49:56.700 --> 03:49:57.700
[Guest]: Life is short.

03:49:57.700 --> 03:49:59.180
[Guest]: You are correct about this.

03:49:59.180 --> 03:50:03.300
[Guest]: But you are correct because of a trajectory you have taken over time.

03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:05.100
[Guest]: And these other people are on their own trips.

03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:06.900
[Guest]: Remember, you are not real.

03:50:06.900 --> 03:50:09.220
[Guest]: You are a figment of their imagination in their world.

03:50:09.220 --> 03:50:10.220
[Guest]: True.

03:50:10.220 --> 03:50:11.220
[Unknown]: There are other people.

03:50:11.220 --> 03:50:12.220
[Amit Varma]: Not to them.

03:50:12.220 --> 03:50:13.220
[Amit Varma]: Not on Twitter.

03:50:13.220 --> 03:50:14.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:50:14.220 --> 03:50:17.500
[Guest]: If you spend enough time on Twitter, you stop thinking there are other people.

03:50:17.500 --> 03:50:18.500
[Unknown]: Yeah, exactly.

03:50:18.500 --> 03:50:20.300
[Guest]: They are all various forces.

03:50:20.300 --> 03:50:24.660
[Guest]: So you don't get to fight, say, fascism in real life.

03:50:24.660 --> 03:50:29.460
[Guest]: But if somebody tweets about fascism, this is your opportunity to fight fascism.

03:50:29.460 --> 03:50:30.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:50:30.460 --> 03:50:33.760
[Guest]: So fascism being an easy one, we can all agree upon, but any other idea.

03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:36.500
[Guest]: So you said, you know, you wouldn't dunk on someone's religion.

03:50:36.500 --> 03:50:37.900
[Guest]: But there are so many religions.

03:50:37.900 --> 03:50:38.900
[Guest]: It's not just religion.

03:50:38.900 --> 03:50:39.900
[Amit Varma]: It's not just Hinduism.

03:50:39.900 --> 03:50:40.900
[Amit Varma]: It's the only religion.

03:50:40.900 --> 03:50:41.900
[Guest]: Exactly.

03:50:41.900 --> 03:50:42.900
[Guest]: Cricket is religion.

03:50:42.900 --> 03:50:43.900
[Guest]: Football is religion.

03:50:43.900 --> 03:50:44.900
[Amit Varma]: Virat Kohli's religion.

03:50:44.900 --> 03:50:45.900
[Amit Varma]: Dhoni's religion.

03:50:45.900 --> 03:50:46.900
[Amit Varma]: I've been attacked by trolls of all these.

03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:47.900
[Amit Varma]: By fans of.

03:50:47.900 --> 03:50:50.500
[Guest]: I've been trolled by fans of all these people you just named.

03:50:50.500 --> 03:50:53.660
[Guest]: And this is this is simply because you are not real in their world.

03:50:53.660 --> 03:50:56.620
[Guest]: You are just this thing that has collided their universe.

03:50:56.620 --> 03:50:59.280
[Guest]: And now it is behaving in this way that they don't like.

03:50:59.280 --> 03:51:03.300
[Guest]: If you were to say this in person, you would be a real person.

03:51:03.300 --> 03:51:04.940
[Amit Varma]: And they would react to you in a more humane way.

03:51:04.940 --> 03:51:09.060
[Amit Varma]: I think at one level, see, some of the aggressive reactions come because you have challenged

03:51:09.060 --> 03:51:11.780
[Amit Varma]: the world view and you're from another world and they respond to that.

03:51:11.780 --> 03:51:15.260
[Amit Varma]: But I think part of it also comes from whether they have a world view or they don't have

03:51:15.260 --> 03:51:20.080
[Amit Varma]: it or they're pretending to have it or they're pretending to be part of a tribe, other incentives

03:51:20.080 --> 03:51:25.340
[Amit Varma]: of Twitter and Facebook, where you always want to raise your status within your in group.

03:51:25.340 --> 03:51:26.340
[Amit Varma]: And how do you do this?

03:51:26.340 --> 03:51:30.300
[Amit Varma]: You do this by abusing the people in the other group and abusing people within your own group

03:51:30.300 --> 03:51:33.220
[Amit Varma]: for not being pure enough, like you're kind of lucky you're not bigger than you are.

03:51:33.220 --> 03:51:36.780
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, there would be one set of vokes attacking you for not showing women in your

03:51:36.780 --> 03:51:39.660
[Amit Varma]: drawings because they saw a couple where there weren't any women.

03:51:39.660 --> 03:51:44.780
[Amit Varma]: And another set accusing you of being a voyeur because you just had women in your drawings.

03:51:44.780 --> 03:51:48.180
[Amit Varma]: You know, you can interpret anything anyway in bad faith.

03:51:48.180 --> 03:51:49.180
[Amit Varma]: And that's the problem.

03:51:49.180 --> 03:51:53.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, I would like to think that all arguments should be in good faith, you assume goodwill.

03:51:53.220 --> 03:51:56.980
[Amit Varma]: But if you assume that the other person is malicious, and if you have determined that

03:51:56.980 --> 03:52:01.200
[Amit Varma]: you're going to attack them to show your own virtue, I think it's a problem.

03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:07.180
[Amit Varma]: And I don't agree entirely with what you say, that they are not bad people in the sense

03:52:07.180 --> 03:52:12.820
[Amit Varma]: that inherently people inherently people aren't bad or good, responding to incentive.

03:52:12.820 --> 03:52:16.580
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, that's I think that's what I mean that I don't want to say they are inherently

03:52:16.580 --> 03:52:17.580
[Guest]: bad people.

03:52:17.580 --> 03:52:19.380
[Guest]: They are just responding to these incentives.

03:52:19.380 --> 03:52:21.500
[Amit Varma]: So for example, but we have the same incentives, right?

03:52:21.500 --> 03:52:26.460
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I would think that at some level, you have to judge a person according to their

03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:27.460
[Amit Varma]: actions.

03:52:27.460 --> 03:52:34.100
[Amit Varma]: I see people being incredibly rude and abusive in a way that they would not in real life.

03:52:34.100 --> 03:52:39.100
[Amit Varma]: I have seen people who know me in real life, randomly abusing me on Twitter or saying nasty

03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:40.100
[Amit Varma]: things.

03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:41.620
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, what is wrong with you?

03:52:41.620 --> 03:52:44.420
[Guest]: You know, would you say this to me on my face?

03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:45.420
[Guest]: Absolutely.

03:52:45.420 --> 03:52:49.060
[Guest]: So you said two things that I very deeply agree with both of them are statements of

03:52:49.060 --> 03:52:51.420
[Guest]: Sartre existence precedes essence.

03:52:51.420 --> 03:52:53.780
[Guest]: So your actions matter.

03:52:53.780 --> 03:52:56.180
[Amit Varma]: And that I didn't even say existence precedes essence.

03:52:56.180 --> 03:52:58.700
[Amit Varma]: You said that actions matter.

03:52:58.700 --> 03:53:02.260
[Guest]: And then you said that good faith arguments are not bad faith arguments.

03:53:02.260 --> 03:53:07.500
[Guest]: And both of these things like judging people by their actions and being militantly against

03:53:07.500 --> 03:53:08.500
[Guest]: bad faith arguments.

03:53:08.500 --> 03:53:10.900
[Guest]: It was very important to Sartre also.

03:53:10.900 --> 03:53:12.460
[Guest]: And I absolutely agree.

03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:17.380
[Guest]: Now, I don't want to suggest that it's the essence of people is good.

03:53:17.380 --> 03:53:19.300
[Guest]: So therefore, they are good.

03:53:19.300 --> 03:53:25.020
[Guest]: I just want to say that people are in different trips and different phases of different trips.

03:53:25.020 --> 03:53:29.900
[Guest]: So I have I have reached this understanding that Twitter is not useful this way.

03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:32.940
[Guest]: But that's because the rest of my world aligns in a certain way.

03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:37.780
[Guest]: And I think this, and I have this beautiful art that makes me appreciate other people.

03:53:37.780 --> 03:53:40.060
[Guest]: So therefore, I don't think of it in this way.

03:53:40.060 --> 03:53:43.660
[Guest]: But so I want to what I want to talk about, therefore, is that in this pursuit, I have

03:53:43.660 --> 03:53:45.940
[Guest]: discovered good ways of engaging.

03:53:45.940 --> 03:53:48.380
[Guest]: And that's why I like Reddit so much more than Twitter.

03:53:48.380 --> 03:53:51.920
[Guest]: And Reddit does these precise things differently from Twitter.

03:53:51.920 --> 03:53:55.940
[Guest]: You can't be performative to your audience because you don't carry your audience with

03:53:55.940 --> 03:53:56.940
[Guest]: you into Reddit.

03:53:56.940 --> 03:54:02.740
[Guest]: You talk inside subreddits, and therefore you talk within a context to a community.

03:54:02.740 --> 03:54:04.740
[Guest]: You don't talk to your people.

03:54:04.740 --> 03:54:05.960
[Guest]: You have to address other people.

03:54:05.960 --> 03:54:11.200
[Guest]: So you have to acknowledge their reality and their existence in your in in the real world.

03:54:11.200 --> 03:54:14.900
[Guest]: And you have to obey the laws of that engagement in that subreddit.

03:54:14.900 --> 03:54:20.060
[Guest]: And there are very strict rules enforced by voluntary moderators, which keeps things civil,

03:54:20.060 --> 03:54:23.140
[Guest]: which keeps things relatively normal.

03:54:23.140 --> 03:54:29.300
[Guest]: And what this does is the same kind of person who behaves a certain way on Twitter cannot

03:54:29.300 --> 03:54:32.500
[Guest]: behave that way on Reddit and get away with it.

03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:37.260
[Guest]: And people who are on Reddit have to engage in at least well, there are parts of Reddit

03:54:37.260 --> 03:54:38.300
[Guest]: where this is not true.

03:54:38.300 --> 03:54:43.700
[Guest]: But vast parts of Reddit, they have to engage in good faith arguments, they have to respect

03:54:43.700 --> 03:54:47.940
[Guest]: the sanctity of a subreddit topic, they can't just bullshit around it.

03:54:47.940 --> 03:54:52.220
[Guest]: It's disincentive not because it's good or bad, because it's disincentivized, because

03:54:52.220 --> 03:54:54.420
[Guest]: you will be downvoted into oblivion.

03:54:54.420 --> 03:54:57.060
[Guest]: The like button on Reddit does good things.

03:54:57.060 --> 03:54:59.980
[Guest]: The like button on Facebook does terrible things.

03:54:59.980 --> 03:55:05.260
[Guest]: The retweet button on Twitter does terrible things because you use it to perform it perform

03:55:05.260 --> 03:55:09.220
[Guest]: in front of your audience, not even retweet, maybe the quote tweet button, the idea that

03:55:09.220 --> 03:55:12.620
[Guest]: you just add a comment and then you put their thing and then it's like, Oh, this is about

03:55:12.620 --> 03:55:14.580
[Guest]: this and I'm dunking on them.

03:55:14.580 --> 03:55:15.900
[Guest]: So that does ugly things.

03:55:15.900 --> 03:55:19.580
[Guest]: Reddit has a cross posting function, which is just about taking from one subreddit to

03:55:19.580 --> 03:55:20.980
[Guest]: another subreddit.

03:55:20.980 --> 03:55:23.100
[Guest]: And that does not do that terrible thing.

03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:24.820
[Guest]: It is a it is a positive function.

03:55:24.820 --> 03:55:29.560
[Guest]: It helps, again, bring attention back to the work of that person and how it fits the notion

03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:31.260
[Guest]: of this other subreddit.

03:55:31.260 --> 03:55:35.960
[Guest]: So for example, some I drew a drawing and I posted it in our Vancouver, and somebody

03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:40.220
[Guest]: cross posted it to our slash mildly interesting.

03:55:40.220 --> 03:55:43.500
[Guest]: This is a mildly interesting thing I saw you might like it.

03:55:43.500 --> 03:55:44.500
[Guest]: This was good.

03:55:44.500 --> 03:55:45.500
[Guest]: It added value to my work.

03:55:45.500 --> 03:55:49.040
[Guest]: So I learned Oh, my work is mildly interesting.

03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:53.140
[Guest]: Since then I posted on mildly interesting myself, I went right to the top, I am proud

03:55:53.140 --> 03:55:58.180
[Guest]: to say that I am this year's among this year's top 10 most mildly interesting things on the

03:55:58.180 --> 03:55:59.180
[Guest]: internet.

03:55:59.180 --> 03:56:00.180
[Amit Varma]: Congratulations.

03:56:00.180 --> 03:56:02.940
[Amit Varma]: Now there is a degree to mildly.

03:56:02.940 --> 03:56:08.020
[Amit Varma]: I thought you at some point get promoted to extremely interesting, but no, I tried I try

03:56:08.020 --> 03:56:10.700
[Guest]: I posted to r slash interesting as fuck.

03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:12.460
[Amit Varma]: Oh, that's also there.

03:56:12.460 --> 03:56:15.140
[Amit Varma]: And people told me that you are not interesting as fuck.

03:56:15.140 --> 03:56:16.140
[Amit Varma]: You're mildly interesting.

03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:17.140
[Amit Varma]: You are mildly interesting.

03:56:17.140 --> 03:56:18.820
[Unknown]: So you're back to where you belong.

03:56:18.820 --> 03:56:24.140
[Guest]: I was told this and they are in fact, right in this case, I am happy to be mildly interesting

03:56:24.140 --> 03:56:25.140
[Guest]: instead.

03:56:25.140 --> 03:56:26.140
[Guest]: It does great good.

03:56:26.140 --> 03:56:29.900
[Guest]: It has brought me lots of fans and readers and hundreds of subscribers to the newsletter

03:56:29.900 --> 03:56:30.900
[Guest]: also.

03:56:30.900 --> 03:56:35.900
[Guest]: So this this aspect of the internet, you know, understanding what is good, what is bad.

03:56:35.900 --> 03:56:38.540
[Guest]: This also needs you to see the other aspects.

03:56:38.540 --> 03:56:42.700
[Guest]: This also needs you to maybe you need to be in the business of putting out content of

03:56:42.700 --> 03:56:44.060
[Guest]: sharing opinions.

03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:47.180
[Guest]: Once you have shared an opinion, you feel vulnerable about it.

03:56:47.180 --> 03:56:49.020
[Guest]: And you see how someone destroys it.

03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:52.780
[Guest]: Maybe you are less keen on destroying someone else's opinion.

03:56:52.780 --> 03:56:57.660
[Guest]: But if you don't, if you're not in the business of sharing opinions, then maybe you have not

03:56:57.660 --> 03:57:00.620
[Guest]: arrived at that understanding.

03:57:00.620 --> 03:57:04.060
[Guest]: The trouble with Reddit is not that these people behave in this way.

03:57:04.060 --> 03:57:09.220
[Guest]: The trouble with Reddit is that we are exposed to everything anybody does.

03:57:09.220 --> 03:57:15.020
[Guest]: And this exposure, this idea that all these worlds are colliding with us is just fundamentally

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.020
[Guest]: all wrong.

03:57:16.020 --> 03:57:17.780
[Guest]: Like it's, it's just terrible.

03:57:17.780 --> 03:57:22.100
[Guest]: It's bound to create these situations because it's not even malice, you know, like it's

03:57:22.100 --> 03:57:23.100
[Guest]: bad faith arguments.

03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:24.100
[Guest]: Right?

03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:25.100
[Guest]: It's bullshit.

03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:30.020
[Guest]: Like celebration of trolling as a valid form of dunking on someone like people say, Oh,

03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:31.020
[Guest]: we're just trolling.

03:57:31.020 --> 03:57:32.020
[Guest]: Why do you mind?

03:57:32.020 --> 03:57:34.140
[Guest]: And like, they don't see it as a negative thing.

03:57:34.140 --> 03:57:39.340
[Guest]: They see it as a just shit posting or just like, whatever, I did it for shits and giggles.

03:57:39.340 --> 03:57:40.340
[Guest]: So it's fine.

03:57:40.340 --> 03:57:46.060
[Guest]: But I think like platforms like this are just terrible to be on because if this is the only

03:57:46.060 --> 03:57:52.060
[Guest]: platform you're on, it makes you not see other people as real people, just as things for

03:57:52.060 --> 03:57:53.060
[Amit Varma]: you to use.

03:57:53.060 --> 03:57:54.060
[Amit Varma]: It dehumanizes them.

03:57:54.060 --> 03:57:57.740
[Amit Varma]: Like the categorical imperative you shared, like they're the means to an end.

03:57:57.740 --> 03:57:58.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:57:58.740 --> 03:58:01.220
[Amit Varma]: Why would you not send them to a gas chamber if things came to that then?

03:58:01.220 --> 03:58:02.220
[Guest]: Because they're not real people.

03:58:02.220 --> 03:58:03.220
[Guest]: They're not real people.

03:58:03.220 --> 03:58:04.220
[Guest]: They're not real people.

03:58:04.220 --> 03:58:05.220
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:58:05.220 --> 03:58:07.500
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to a bunch of final topics.

03:58:07.500 --> 03:58:11.220
[Amit Varma]: And first, you know, we've been speaking about web 2.2 all the time.

03:58:11.220 --> 03:58:12.220
[Amit Varma]: What is this bullshit?

03:58:12.220 --> 03:58:13.220
[Amit Varma]: It's so yesterday.

03:58:13.220 --> 03:58:14.620
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about web 3.2.

03:58:14.620 --> 03:58:18.380
[Amit Varma]: Listen, so one of the things that I was looking forward to when you agreed to come on the

03:58:18.380 --> 03:58:22.620
[Amit Varma]: show was you promised to explain NFTs to me.

03:58:22.620 --> 03:58:24.340
[Amit Varma]: So the platform is all yours.

03:58:24.340 --> 03:58:26.340
[Guest]: Kind of what the fuck are NFTs?

03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:29.940
[Guest]: Person disclaimer, I am not the best person to talk about it because I'm not fully on

03:58:29.940 --> 03:58:31.420
[Guest]: board with the idea.

03:58:31.420 --> 03:58:36.780
[Guest]: I oscillate wildly, I am sometimes enamored by them, and I want to get into it.

03:58:36.780 --> 03:58:41.500
[Guest]: And sometimes I'm disgusted by what I see, and I want to have nothing to do with it.

03:58:41.500 --> 03:58:44.100
[Guest]: But I have explored how I would enter it.

03:58:44.100 --> 03:58:48.320
[Guest]: And I have read a lot and thought a lot about what it means.

03:58:48.320 --> 03:58:52.420
[Amit Varma]: So explain it as if you're explaining it to a lame layperson, which I'm sure many of my

03:58:52.420 --> 03:58:56.340
[Amit Varma]: listeners would be in which I'm extremely close to being myself.

03:58:56.340 --> 03:58:58.660
[Amit Varma]: So NFTs, of course, stand for non fungible token.

03:58:58.660 --> 03:59:01.620
[Guest]: Now, just take it away from there.

03:59:01.620 --> 03:59:03.740
[Guest]: The basic idea, what is non fungible?

03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:05.700
[Guest]: So fungible is like currency.

03:59:05.700 --> 03:59:08.500
[Guest]: Suppose you have a 100 rupee note, you can exchange it for another 100.

03:59:08.500 --> 03:59:10.100
[Amit Varma]: We have a 500 rupee note.

03:59:10.100 --> 03:59:14.060
[Amit Varma]: The 1000 and 500 were demonetized and we had 2000 and new 500.

03:59:14.060 --> 03:59:15.300
[Amit Varma]: Oh, we have new 500?

03:59:15.300 --> 03:59:16.300
[Amit Varma]: We have new 500.

03:59:16.300 --> 03:59:17.300
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:59:17.300 --> 03:59:18.300
[Amit Varma]: I've been out of touch.

03:59:18.300 --> 03:59:19.300
[Guest]: Don't offend me.

03:59:19.300 --> 03:59:20.300
[Guest]: I'm very close to my 500 rupee note.

03:59:20.300 --> 03:59:24.340
[Guest]: So 500 rupee note can be exchanged for any other 500 rupee note for the same value.

03:59:24.340 --> 03:59:26.660
[Guest]: So it is fungible.

03:59:26.660 --> 03:59:30.460
[Guest]: Non fungible token is anything that cannot be exchanged for something just like it.

03:59:30.460 --> 03:59:32.540
[Guest]: It has its own unique value.

03:59:32.540 --> 03:59:38.800
[Guest]: So non fungible tokens have been mostly used in the term of art right now, but they have

03:59:38.800 --> 03:59:40.260
[Guest]: all kinds of uses.

03:59:40.260 --> 03:59:46.580
[Guest]: So a non fungible token can be simply your right to say an artist sells a non fungible

03:59:46.580 --> 03:59:48.780
[Guest]: token for something, something value.

03:59:48.780 --> 03:59:54.560
[Guest]: And now that token gives you the right, it works as a backstage pass to all their concerts.

03:59:54.560 --> 04:00:00.540
[Guest]: As long as you own that token, that NFT and hundreds of people might, you can go to all

04:00:00.540 --> 04:00:05.420
[Guest]: their concerts and you have a special seat and you can always get a backstage entry.

04:00:05.420 --> 04:00:08.100
[Guest]: So that thing does not have the same value always.

04:00:08.100 --> 04:00:09.520
[Guest]: Its value will keep changing.

04:00:09.520 --> 04:00:12.220
[Guest]: If the artist gets better, its value will increase.

04:00:12.220 --> 04:00:16.180
[Guest]: It will be traded by other people like maybe I don't care about this artist anymore.

04:00:16.180 --> 04:00:17.260
[Guest]: Why don't you buy it from me?

04:00:17.260 --> 04:00:21.020
[Guest]: I'll sell it to you for $10 million because now he's the biggest artist in the world.

04:00:21.020 --> 04:00:23.580
[Guest]: So this value is always fluctuating.

04:00:23.580 --> 04:00:26.500
[Guest]: So that's what makes it non fungible.

04:00:26.500 --> 04:00:32.100
[Guest]: Like it's not easily exchangeable for just something, there's no static value to it.

04:00:32.100 --> 04:00:39.460
[Guest]: Now what it rests upon is your notion of the value of digital content in the digital realm.

04:00:39.460 --> 04:00:45.220
[Guest]: Does digital art or a digital product have value in your life?

04:00:45.220 --> 04:00:49.440
[Guest]: It takes a lot of meaning from games, for example, in lots of games.

04:00:49.440 --> 04:00:54.220
[Guest]: If you are really vested in your character, what is what is called MMORPGs, massively

04:00:54.220 --> 04:00:56.580
[Guest]: multiplayer online role playing games.

04:00:56.580 --> 04:01:00.620
[Guest]: You have various characters that you build over time, they gain experience, they gain

04:01:00.620 --> 04:01:04.660
[Guest]: in these various medieval sort of setting universes.

04:01:04.660 --> 04:01:09.860
[Guest]: They get all these items of clothing or weapons, and you can set them up and you create and

04:01:09.860 --> 04:01:11.700
[Guest]: you give them some kind of value.

04:01:11.700 --> 04:01:14.860
[Guest]: And sometimes you have things that you can pay for.

04:01:14.860 --> 04:01:19.420
[Guest]: You can get this clothing, which is like this, this, this, but you pay $5 for it or you pay

04:01:19.420 --> 04:01:24.140
[Guest]: $10 for it or more like who knows whatever, but do you want to do it?

04:01:24.140 --> 04:01:28.060
[Guest]: It's not really you're not holding it, you're not actually possessing it.

04:01:28.060 --> 04:01:34.260
[Guest]: It's just in this realm, in this game, in this context, in this character, it's virtual.

04:01:34.260 --> 04:01:36.060
[Guest]: But it can have real value, right?

04:01:36.060 --> 04:01:40.020
[Guest]: Like it depends on how much time you spend on that game, how vested you are, how many

04:01:40.020 --> 04:01:44.360
[Guest]: what social networks you have within it, it can have real value to you.

04:01:44.360 --> 04:01:49.980
[Guest]: So if you could buy the blue tick on Twitter, for example, so that has real value, but it's

04:01:49.980 --> 04:01:50.980
[Guest]: a digital thing.

04:01:50.980 --> 04:01:52.380
[Guest]: It's not a real good.

04:01:52.380 --> 04:01:58.500
[Guest]: So if you believe in the idea that virtual worlds can have items that have real monetary

04:01:58.500 --> 04:02:03.620
[Guest]: value, then we are thinking about the ways that we interact with virtual worlds in the

04:02:03.620 --> 04:02:10.140
[Guest]: future and web 3.0 and metaverse and all these ideas are about more and more virtual worlds

04:02:10.140 --> 04:02:18.100
[Guest]: existing in our reality, whether it's virtual reality, whether it's augmented reality, and

04:02:18.100 --> 04:02:23.540
[Guest]: what is the value of getting something over there and flexing it or using it in some way.

04:02:23.540 --> 04:02:27.620
[Guest]: So this is where this is what NFTs offer you in art.

04:02:27.620 --> 04:02:36.260
[Guest]: At the moment, NFTs are or art or writing or audio, NFTs are a way of associating with

04:02:36.260 --> 04:02:42.780
[Guest]: an artist or a writer or a creator that you like because you own something that they have.

04:02:42.780 --> 04:02:44.920
[Guest]: So it's almost like buying a share.

04:02:44.920 --> 04:02:50.420
[Guest]: If someone could buy a share in Amit Verma, that share will always change in value, but

04:02:50.420 --> 04:02:54.260
[Guest]: they buy it with the idea that now they believe in you.

04:02:54.260 --> 04:02:58.140
[Guest]: Now they believe in what you are going to do in the future, and they expect it to appreciate

04:02:58.140 --> 04:02:59.140
[Guest]: in value.

04:02:59.140 --> 04:03:03.820
[Guest]: They might never sell it, but they expect it to not be a money thrown down the drain.

04:03:03.820 --> 04:03:08.980
[Guest]: Meanwhile, that money is money that you can use to become a better artist.

04:03:08.980 --> 04:03:11.020
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so let's look at it like this.

04:03:11.020 --> 04:03:16.220
[Amit Varma]: Let's say I buy a share in a company, I buy a share in a company because there are expectations

04:03:16.220 --> 04:03:20.100
[Amit Varma]: of all its earnings will be like this, these will be the dividends, you know, there'll

04:03:20.100 --> 04:03:23.780
[Amit Varma]: be a resale market for my share, it could go up, it could go down.

04:03:23.780 --> 04:03:28.980
[Amit Varma]: But what I hear a lot about on the internet, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it,

04:03:28.980 --> 04:03:33.380
[Amit Varma]: is that an artist will create an artwork which anyone can see and download, but they sell

04:03:33.380 --> 04:03:35.940
[Amit Varma]: the NFT to it, which one person will buy.

04:03:35.940 --> 04:03:40.940
[Amit Varma]: Now this is a digital artwork, anyone can download copies if they want, and yet one

04:03:40.940 --> 04:03:44.380
[Amit Varma]: person holds and has bought an NFT for it.

04:03:44.380 --> 04:03:48.540
[Amit Varma]: So what special privilege does he get from the NFT apart from having the NFT?

04:03:48.540 --> 04:03:52.740
[Guest]: Yeah, firstly, there's one aspect of the NFT world that says, oh, right clickers, as they

04:03:52.740 --> 04:03:56.700
[Guest]: are called right clickers are evil, and that is don't do it.

04:03:56.700 --> 04:03:58.820
[Guest]: And we need to disable right click.

04:03:58.820 --> 04:04:00.140
[Guest]: Some people are even doing that.

04:04:00.140 --> 04:04:01.140
[Guest]: That's not something I believe in.

04:04:01.140 --> 04:04:02.220
[Guest]: I think that's nonsense.

04:04:02.220 --> 04:04:03.620
[Guest]: That's never going to happen.

04:04:03.620 --> 04:04:06.460
[Guest]: You need to have value outside of this fact.

04:04:06.460 --> 04:04:10.220
[Guest]: Because the internet is not about not letting other people have content.

04:04:10.220 --> 04:04:15.020
[Guest]: Right click save is the essence of a lot of art I have absorbed and learned, you're not

04:04:15.020 --> 04:04:18.540
[Guest]: going to disable right click save, you're not going to disable screenshots and things

04:04:18.540 --> 04:04:21.420
[Guest]: like that, that has to always remain.

04:04:21.420 --> 04:04:25.300
[Guest]: It's the essence of knowledge and the promise of the internet that you are going to have

04:04:25.300 --> 04:04:26.300
[Guest]: this.

04:04:26.300 --> 04:04:29.500
[Guest]: So it has to have some other value in my mind, this kind of value is nonsense, this the demand

04:04:29.500 --> 04:04:31.180
[Guest]: for it is also nonsense.

04:04:31.180 --> 04:04:35.700
[Guest]: But there are there is other value being created around even an NFT of a blog post you wrote,

04:04:35.700 --> 04:04:36.700
[Guest]: for example, right.

04:04:36.700 --> 04:04:40.820
[Guest]: So you have 10,000 blog posts, every week, you write a newsletter post, and every week,

04:04:40.820 --> 04:04:42.940
[Guest]: somebody can buy an NFT of it.

04:04:42.940 --> 04:04:48.380
[Guest]: That thing can does not mean that nobody else gets to read that newsletter, or save that

04:04:48.380 --> 04:04:50.820
[Guest]: newsletter or print that newsletter.

04:04:50.820 --> 04:04:57.420
[Guest]: But within a context, there is a place there is a ledger, where you are acknowledged as

04:04:57.420 --> 04:04:59.380
[Guest]: the owner of that post.

04:04:59.380 --> 04:05:03.100
[Guest]: I suppose I buy that newsletters NFT that posts NFT.

04:05:03.100 --> 04:05:07.460
[Guest]: So I am acknowledged as the owner, there is a list somewhere in which I am there and those

04:05:07.460 --> 04:05:12.020
[Guest]: other right click people are not there, or those savers printers are not there.

04:05:12.020 --> 04:05:15.360
[Guest]: That list can have value if you use it that way.

04:05:15.360 --> 04:05:21.140
[Guest]: So if Amit decides that everybody who owns an Amit NFTs, we are going to all have brunch

04:05:21.140 --> 04:05:27.060
[Guest]: together, I get invited, right, the people who saved it don't get invited, you are incentivizing

04:05:27.060 --> 04:05:31.720
[Guest]: people to buy that NFT, and you are creating value around that NFT.

04:05:31.720 --> 04:05:34.500
[Amit Varma]: But I could achieve the same thing by another mechanism.

04:05:34.500 --> 04:05:38.740
[Amit Varma]: For example, I could say take a Patreon membership and all my members of this particular tier

04:05:38.740 --> 04:05:42.940
[Amit Varma]: get brunch with me and another particular tier gets whatever with me.

04:05:42.940 --> 04:05:47.340
[Amit Varma]: And I could do that also by that I mean, the point is, say I write a blog post and you

04:05:47.340 --> 04:05:51.600
[Amit Varma]: buy the NFT for it, you don't have the copyright for it, you are not going to get revenues

04:05:51.600 --> 04:05:56.340
[Amit Varma]: from it if I publish it in a book or something, you know, you don't stop it from being published,

04:05:56.340 --> 04:05:58.380
[Amit Varma]: you don't stop other people from reading it.

04:05:58.380 --> 04:06:05.660
[Amit Varma]: Although the NFT entitles you to is the ownership of the NFT, which only entitles you to the

04:06:05.660 --> 04:06:09.820
[Amit Varma]: ownership of the NFT, which only we can reach five hours this way.

04:06:09.820 --> 04:06:12.660
[Guest]: And ownership of the NFT on that blockchain.

04:06:12.660 --> 04:06:13.660
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:06:13.660 --> 04:06:14.660
[Amit Varma]: And then there are many blockchains.

04:06:14.660 --> 04:06:18.020
[Amit Varma]: Oh, so I can sell different NFTs on different blockchains.

04:06:18.020 --> 04:06:19.420
[Guest]: Of the same thing.

04:06:19.420 --> 04:06:20.420
[Guest]: On different blockchains.

04:06:20.420 --> 04:06:21.420
[Guest]: So are there many blockchains which have?

04:06:21.420 --> 04:06:22.420
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

04:06:22.420 --> 04:06:23.420
[Guest]: Oh, so as an artist, I could.

04:06:23.420 --> 04:06:24.420
[Guest]: Bitcoin is a blockchain.

04:06:24.420 --> 04:06:25.420
[Guest]: Ethereum is another blockchain.

04:06:25.420 --> 04:06:26.420
[Guest]: Okay.

04:06:26.420 --> 04:06:27.420
[Amit Varma]: Got it.

04:06:27.420 --> 04:06:28.500
[Amit Varma]: And there are hundreds.

04:06:28.500 --> 04:06:30.140
[Guest]: But most people are using Ethereum for this.

04:06:30.140 --> 04:06:32.660
[Guest]: Well, for art, the most popular one is Ethereum.

04:06:32.660 --> 04:06:33.660
[Unknown]: Okay.

04:06:33.660 --> 04:06:36.860
[Guest]: And for other uses, the most popular one so far is Bitcoin.

04:06:36.860 --> 04:06:39.540
[Guest]: But there is a lot of stuff on other blockchains also.

04:06:39.540 --> 04:06:43.140
[Guest]: And the Dogecoin is another blockchain, for example.

04:06:43.140 --> 04:06:45.820
[Guest]: And there's Solana and Cordana and whatnot.

04:06:45.820 --> 04:06:50.060
[Amit Varma]: This whole thing seems very perception based to me like you get some boasting value that

04:06:50.060 --> 04:06:56.060
[Amit Varma]: hey, I own the NFT of Amitabh Bachchan tweet number 8 million blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:06:56.060 --> 04:07:00.980
[Guest]: And so at the moment in this nascent stage, it does have only that.

04:07:00.980 --> 04:07:05.140
[Guest]: It doesn't offer very much more, which is one of the reasons why I'm very skeptical

04:07:05.140 --> 04:07:07.380
[Guest]: about a lot of aspects around it.

04:07:07.380 --> 04:07:09.300
[Guest]: You don't really own it.

04:07:09.300 --> 04:07:10.780
[Guest]: That is absolutely true.

04:07:10.780 --> 04:07:14.100
[Guest]: You only own a place in a ledger.

04:07:14.100 --> 04:07:19.820
[Guest]: That ledger can have value and that value can decrease and that value can increase.

04:07:19.820 --> 04:07:20.860
[Guest]: Just like how a game works.

04:07:20.860 --> 04:07:24.060
[Guest]: So this is part of my hesitations around the system also.

04:07:24.060 --> 04:07:28.660
[Guest]: So just like how a game works, that thing, that armor that you bought or that sword you

04:07:28.660 --> 04:07:32.340
[Guest]: bought has value in that game.

04:07:32.340 --> 04:07:36.180
[Guest]: Within that game, there is a scarcity of that item.

04:07:36.180 --> 04:07:40.900
[Guest]: So you have you are able to technologically impose the scarcity of that item.

04:07:40.900 --> 04:07:44.620
[Guest]: Similarly, on that blockchain, that NFT is unique.

04:07:44.620 --> 04:07:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but within the game, there is a utility of that item to exactly right.

04:07:48.920 --> 04:07:52.780
[Guest]: So there is a limited utility and there is a limited application.

04:07:52.780 --> 04:07:55.040
[Guest]: Within that, there is some real value.

04:07:55.040 --> 04:07:56.320
[Guest]: It is not universal.

04:07:56.320 --> 04:07:57.940
[Guest]: You cannot take it out of context.

04:07:57.940 --> 04:07:58.940
[Amit Varma]: You cannot take it.

04:07:58.940 --> 04:08:01.540
[Amit Varma]: I mean, besides bragging rights, what value would an NFT have?

04:08:01.540 --> 04:08:04.300
[Guest]: It is entirely up to you as the creator.

04:08:04.300 --> 04:08:06.020
[Guest]: You can give it various types.

04:08:06.020 --> 04:08:11.700
[Guest]: You can decide that, guys, I am sticking to this blockchain and I am putting all my art

04:08:11.700 --> 04:08:14.500
[Guest]: on this or my writings on this blockchain.

04:08:14.500 --> 04:08:17.820
[Guest]: And I, because you also want your NFTs to have value, right?

04:08:17.820 --> 04:08:21.260
[Guest]: Because you want people to buy it with the idea that it's going to be something so that

04:08:21.260 --> 04:08:25.180
[Guest]: you get something like the more value it has, the better it is for you.

04:08:25.180 --> 04:08:26.380
[Guest]: Because every time somebody.

04:08:26.380 --> 04:08:31.100
[Guest]: So one key aspect of NFT contracts is also that if somebody sells it forward, you get

04:08:31.100 --> 04:08:32.100
[Guest]: another cut.

04:08:32.100 --> 04:08:35.100
[Guest]: Oh, you get to put up to a 10% cut.

04:08:35.100 --> 04:08:40.020
[Guest]: So most of the value that artists are making on NFT sales are resale values that they are

04:08:40.020 --> 04:08:45.700
[Guest]: getting because they sold something like 10 pieces and then they became famous.

04:08:45.700 --> 04:08:49.860
[Guest]: So then the value of those 10 pieces went up huge and then somebody resold it.

04:08:49.860 --> 04:08:53.580
[Guest]: And then they got like a very bigger, that 10% turned out to be bigger than what they'd

04:08:53.580 --> 04:08:55.020
[Guest]: gotten before.

04:08:55.020 --> 04:08:57.580
[Guest]: So that's how a lot of people are making value out of it.

04:08:57.580 --> 04:09:00.500
[Guest]: So there is, it is all perception.

04:09:00.500 --> 04:09:02.180
[Guest]: You're absolutely right.

04:09:02.180 --> 04:09:08.980
[Guest]: But it like a sense of collective delusion that we are all signing up to within a limited

04:09:08.980 --> 04:09:12.500
[Guest]: context, collective delusions have value.

04:09:12.500 --> 04:09:13.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:09:13.500 --> 04:09:17.300
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, collective, I mean, the currency is just a very dismissive way of me to say

04:09:17.300 --> 04:09:18.300
[Amit Varma]: this.

04:09:18.300 --> 04:09:19.300
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

04:09:19.300 --> 04:09:20.300
[Amit Varma]: I get that.

04:09:20.300 --> 04:09:21.300
[Amit Varma]: You don't mean it in a pejorative way.

04:09:21.300 --> 04:09:25.180
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, a currency is also a collective delusion in terms of a story we've sold ourselves

04:09:25.180 --> 04:09:29.260
[Amit Varma]: or even a nation is a collective delusion in one manner of speaking.

04:09:29.260 --> 04:09:30.840
[Amit Varma]: So I completely get that.

04:09:30.840 --> 04:09:36.220
[Amit Varma]: But obviously, when you encounter something completely new, your initial instinct is distrust

04:09:36.220 --> 04:09:37.620
[Amit Varma]: and like, what the hell is this?

04:09:37.620 --> 04:09:38.900
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to fall for that.

04:09:38.900 --> 04:09:43.540
[Amit Varma]: I remember this old video in the 1990s, where Bill Gates is on the David Letterman show

04:09:43.540 --> 04:09:46.260
[Amit Varma]: and David Letterman is saying, what the hell is this internet?

04:09:46.260 --> 04:09:47.700
[Amit Varma]: And Gates is trying to explain.

04:09:47.700 --> 04:09:50.940
[Amit Varma]: And David Letterman is, hey, if I want to find out the baseball score, have you heard

04:09:50.940 --> 04:09:51.940
[Amit Varma]: of a thing called the radio?

04:09:51.940 --> 04:09:54.220
[Amit Varma]: I'll turn that on and so on.

04:09:54.220 --> 04:09:57.940
[Amit Varma]: So whatever Gates says about the internet, Letterman has repost and of course, we know

04:09:57.940 --> 04:09:59.260
[Amit Varma]: what the internet became.

04:09:59.260 --> 04:10:02.560
[Amit Varma]: So I don't want to make that kind of a mistake.

04:10:02.560 --> 04:10:06.700
[Amit Varma]: Why are you excited about it and why are you apprehensive about it?

04:10:06.700 --> 04:10:12.820
[Guest]: So part of the things that make me apprehensive are the early behaviors of a lot of people

04:10:12.820 --> 04:10:14.060
[Guest]: around it.

04:10:14.060 --> 04:10:20.100
[Guest]: And we were discussing this, that any revolutionary new activity comes with the people who just

04:10:20.100 --> 04:10:21.900
[Guest]: want to grab a lot of cash out of it.

04:10:21.900 --> 04:10:25.900
[Guest]: So maritime trade, for example, started with piracy.

04:10:25.900 --> 04:10:29.380
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean maritime trade is evil and we should not invest in it or we should

04:10:29.380 --> 04:10:34.140
[Guest]: not care about it or we should not do maritime trade or if you are a trader of goods.

04:10:34.140 --> 04:10:37.220
[Guest]: It is essential, but it started with piracy.

04:10:37.220 --> 04:10:41.820
[Guest]: So you can't allow those early adopters to define things.

04:10:41.820 --> 04:10:46.440
[Guest]: That is my answer to this apprehension also, that they don't get to define it.

04:10:46.440 --> 04:10:48.100
[Guest]: Maybe it can be redefined.

04:10:48.100 --> 04:10:49.780
[Guest]: Maybe they do end up like a part of me.

04:10:49.780 --> 04:10:52.900
[Guest]: The moralist part of me is that why should I enable them to make money?

04:10:52.900 --> 04:10:58.100
[Guest]: Because the more, if I use Ethereum, Ethereum gains value also as my contribution to it.

04:10:58.100 --> 04:11:02.420
[Guest]: Any trading in this currency gives value to the currency and these people who are sitting

04:11:02.420 --> 04:11:07.100
[Guest]: on it will use it for nefarious things, which is being done like a lot of cryptocurrency

04:11:07.100 --> 04:11:12.540
[Guest]: is used for terrible crimes and criminal activities because it's undocumented.

04:11:12.540 --> 04:11:16.980
[Guest]: But then, but then all money is, all money is, all money is, but it has never been this

04:11:16.980 --> 04:11:21.180
[Guest]: easy for someone to hold 4000 and for it to become 50,000 the next day.

04:11:21.180 --> 04:11:26.420
[Guest]: And today it is like Elon Musk needs to tweet once and that 50,000 becomes 1 million tomorrow.

04:11:26.420 --> 04:11:27.620
[Guest]: And then it can be used.

04:11:27.620 --> 04:11:30.980
[Guest]: And then day after tomorrow, that 1 million can be brought down to 30,000 again.

04:11:30.980 --> 04:11:38.020
[Guest]: So this kind of quick manipulation and globally impacting instantaneous quick manipulation

04:11:38.020 --> 04:11:39.460
[Guest]: is unprecedented.

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:43.860
[Guest]: It just makes me feel a little iffy about the way things like for a decentralized currency

04:11:43.860 --> 04:11:49.340
[Guest]: to be so dependent, so affected by the tweet of a crazy person is just ridiculous to me

04:11:49.340 --> 04:11:52.580
[Guest]: that he can affect it 30, 40% in value.

04:11:52.580 --> 04:11:54.940
[Guest]: What kind of insider trading must he be doing?

04:11:54.940 --> 04:11:55.940
[Guest]: And what does that do?

04:11:55.940 --> 04:12:01.860
[Guest]: So suppose I own, I have large Ethereum holdings and I have large Bitcoin holdings and Dogecoin

04:12:01.860 --> 04:12:05.620
[Guest]: holdings and Elon Musk is big on all of these things.

04:12:05.620 --> 04:12:10.140
[Guest]: In a sense, I'm beholden to Elon Musk, his reputation.

04:12:10.140 --> 04:12:14.140
[Guest]: If Elon Musk goes to jail, all of these things plummet.

04:12:14.140 --> 04:12:17.980
[Guest]: Do I not want Elon Musk to go to jail for crimes then after if suppose he commits a

04:12:17.980 --> 04:12:21.660
[Guest]: horrible crime in the future, anybody, any billionaire commits a terrible crime in the

04:12:21.660 --> 04:12:28.140
[Guest]: future, their holdings of a certain cryptocurrency can have impact on my life savings.

04:12:28.140 --> 04:12:34.940
[Guest]: So am I now their vassal in a sense that I don't want my overlord to be touched?

04:12:34.940 --> 04:12:38.980
[Guest]: It makes me think that there is this techno feudalism that we are entering into with this

04:12:38.980 --> 04:12:43.660
[Guest]: cryptocurrencies that we were beholden say until now with national currencies, you have

04:12:43.660 --> 04:12:45.840
[Guest]: beholden to a nation state, right?

04:12:45.840 --> 04:12:48.980
[Guest]: If that nation collapses, then that currency also collapses.

04:12:48.980 --> 04:12:53.900
[Guest]: But now cryptocurrencies are going to be managed by companies and venture capitalists.

04:12:53.900 --> 04:12:56.860
[Guest]: And they say decentralized, but I don't quite buy it.

04:12:56.860 --> 04:13:01.460
[Guest]: Because well, at least in this initial stage, my apprehension is that that's a cover.

04:13:01.460 --> 04:13:07.420
[Guest]: And the billionaires and the rogue capitalists and whatever these you know, like, I do doesn't

04:13:07.420 --> 04:13:10.020
[Guest]: make me doesn't make me their vassal.

04:13:10.020 --> 04:13:14.620
[Guest]: Am I now beholden to them and that thought is very deeply unsettling to me.

04:13:14.620 --> 04:13:16.220
[Guest]: One part of me doesn't want to invest in it.

04:13:16.220 --> 04:13:18.660
[Guest]: The other part of me is like, I don't want anything to do with you.

04:13:18.660 --> 04:13:19.900
[Guest]: I'm not going to help you.

04:13:19.900 --> 04:13:21.340
[Guest]: I don't need to make money off of you.

04:13:21.340 --> 04:13:22.580
[Guest]: I'll do my own thing.

04:13:22.580 --> 04:13:27.140
[Guest]: Like you said, with Patreon and other avenues, I'll buy Why can't I do it that way?

04:13:27.140 --> 04:13:28.780
[Guest]: Why do I need to do NFTs?

04:13:28.780 --> 04:13:33.900
[Guest]: So a large part of my excitement with NFTs is that not necessarily that I have to do

04:13:33.900 --> 04:13:39.460
[Guest]: NFTs, but that they are opening up people's minds to other forms of engagement and other

04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:41.500
[Guest]: forms of value creation.

04:13:41.500 --> 04:13:46.820
[Guest]: So the idea that value can be created by forming a community around a certain artist or an

04:13:46.820 --> 04:13:51.380
[Guest]: artwork, and that then it is expected that these communities will have these kind of

04:13:51.380 --> 04:13:55.740
[Guest]: exclusive events that sends a base value once people internalize that this sort of thing

04:13:55.740 --> 04:13:59.260
[Guest]: is supposed to be worth $100 a month, why not?

04:13:59.260 --> 04:14:01.500
[Guest]: Then they are open to paying you that money.

04:14:01.500 --> 04:14:06.180
[Guest]: Like as soon as people understood that, oh, $5 a month is something that is done to support

04:14:06.180 --> 04:14:07.180
[Guest]: an artist.

04:14:07.180 --> 04:14:11.460
[Guest]: Now I'm able to charge that money $5 a month and many, many people are paying me that and

04:14:11.460 --> 04:14:12.460
[Guest]: helping me thrive.

04:14:12.460 --> 04:14:19.100
[Guest]: So I have so many ideas around the ways I want to create value around my art.

04:14:19.100 --> 04:14:21.620
[Guest]: They are not bound to NFTs.

04:14:21.620 --> 04:14:30.420
[Guest]: In my case, but NFTs being the hot thing that they are mean that many, many more people

04:14:30.420 --> 04:14:35.620
[Guest]: are likely to jump into it if I if it is offered as an NFT, then if the same thing is offered

04:14:35.620 --> 04:14:37.300
[Guest]: in another platform.

04:14:37.300 --> 04:14:43.620
[Guest]: So then again, that tantalizes me that why don't I enter it because FOMO this this thing

04:14:43.620 --> 04:14:47.820
[Guest]: is important to me like I love playing games.

04:14:47.820 --> 04:14:52.820
[Guest]: All of my life life is just a bunch of different games and how we play these games and what

04:14:52.820 --> 04:14:57.460
[Guest]: games we play and what are the rules we formulate and what are the reward mechanisms.

04:14:57.460 --> 04:14:58.460
[Guest]: This is fun.

04:14:58.460 --> 04:15:02.940
[Guest]: This is what this is what the great kick of being an entrepreneur is you get to play games

04:15:02.940 --> 04:15:06.940
[Guest]: and you get to play what I call infinite games.

04:15:06.940 --> 04:15:10.300
[Guest]: So finite games are the ones that have an end.

04:15:10.300 --> 04:15:14.020
[Guest]: And so I used to play a lot of sports like I used to play badminton when I was in school.

04:15:14.020 --> 04:15:17.180
[Guest]: I played badminton for my college also.

04:15:17.180 --> 04:15:19.700
[Guest]: And I have also been a computer gamer.

04:15:19.700 --> 04:15:24.340
[Guest]: And I noticed this thing in all of these things that I'm very competitive, and I love being

04:15:24.340 --> 04:15:25.340
[Guest]: good at things.

04:15:25.340 --> 04:15:28.320
[Guest]: So I was very good at badminton and squash and things.

04:15:28.320 --> 04:15:31.140
[Guest]: But I don't care if I lose or win.

04:15:31.140 --> 04:15:33.380
[Amit Varma]: Like, it doesn't hurt me.

04:15:33.380 --> 04:15:38.460
[Guest]: The process is a point not the result, I play infinite games, like I enjoyed the fact that

04:15:38.460 --> 04:15:40.260
[Guest]: I played for two hours today.

04:15:40.260 --> 04:15:44.500
[Guest]: Maybe I lost five games, I won three games, but I had a hell of a two hours.

04:15:44.500 --> 04:15:45.840
[Guest]: That's what's fun to me.

04:15:45.840 --> 04:15:49.420
[Guest]: So the process of playing is the joy and the win is nice.

04:15:49.420 --> 04:15:50.420
[Guest]: It's great.

04:15:50.420 --> 04:15:51.420
[Guest]: Oh, I won, I beat this person.

04:15:51.420 --> 04:15:55.640
[Guest]: But then next time I feel like I need to do even better this person I can win against.

04:15:55.640 --> 04:16:01.960
[Guest]: So maybe it's almost not so good if I win like losing is a more useful trait than winning.

04:16:01.960 --> 04:16:07.020
[Guest]: Because it keeps you focused and enjoying and learning, learning and doing appreciating

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:09.820
[Guest]: and you know, getting into it with more vigor next time.

04:16:09.820 --> 04:16:12.540
[Guest]: And so these infinite games are interesting to me.

04:16:12.540 --> 04:16:14.780
[Guest]: And as an artist, I play infinite games.

04:16:14.780 --> 04:16:17.060
[Guest]: I'm in the business of playing infinite games.

04:16:17.060 --> 04:16:21.580
[Guest]: I'm figuring out my not Patreon, but my buy me a coffee, my sub stack members, I call

04:16:21.580 --> 04:16:26.060
[Guest]: them sneaky art insiders, because I play infinite games with them.

04:16:26.060 --> 04:16:27.060
[Guest]: It sounds so manipulative.

04:16:27.060 --> 04:16:31.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, if they're listening to this, they'll be like he's toying with us.

04:16:31.060 --> 04:16:35.580
[Guest]: So the games are things like I share content with them that I have not put out outside.

04:16:35.580 --> 04:16:39.680
[Guest]: So right now my podcast is just conversations I have with other artists.

04:16:39.680 --> 04:16:45.300
[Guest]: But now I'm doing some more impromptu self conversations with myself.

04:16:45.300 --> 04:16:49.060
[Guest]: I am reading out stories that I'm creating around my art.

04:16:49.060 --> 04:16:52.360
[Guest]: I am doing what I call post script conversations.

04:16:52.360 --> 04:16:56.480
[Guest]: So once these list of questions and ideas run out, the guest and I just sort of lean

04:16:56.480 --> 04:16:58.620
[Guest]: back and we're like, Oh, okay, how was that?

04:16:58.620 --> 04:16:59.620
[Guest]: How did that go?

04:16:59.620 --> 04:17:03.580
[Guest]: You know, there's this very long goodbye, like, okay, let's talk later.

04:17:03.580 --> 04:17:07.420
[Guest]: But there's one more thing and then you end up talking for a half hour, 45 minutes more.

04:17:07.420 --> 04:17:09.500
[Guest]: So I call this a post script.

04:17:09.500 --> 04:17:14.720
[Guest]: And I record this also now and if it's nice, I share this with so my insiders are my focus

04:17:14.720 --> 04:17:20.580
[Guest]: group with whom I played what I call these games is that I share my vulnerable media.

04:17:20.580 --> 04:17:22.660
[Guest]: I'm not so sure how it is.

04:17:22.660 --> 04:17:24.180
[Guest]: Please tell me.

04:17:24.180 --> 04:17:26.680
[Guest]: I am not so confident in doing these things.

04:17:26.680 --> 04:17:30.420
[Guest]: Please tell me what you think like me talking just into a mic and telling you a story is

04:17:30.420 --> 04:17:34.980
[Guest]: not something I'm kicked about sharing with my general podcast audience yet.

04:17:34.980 --> 04:17:37.640
[Guest]: But with you, I will because you are my true fans.

04:17:37.640 --> 04:17:41.060
[Guest]: You really care about my work and what I'm another thing I'm doing right now, which has

04:17:41.060 --> 04:17:45.940
[Guest]: been really fun and very gratifying and coming to the point of what you said about blogging

04:17:45.940 --> 04:17:47.380
[Guest]: with an audience.

04:17:47.380 --> 04:17:51.440
[Guest]: So this is a small audience, my insiders, not my broad audience, but I am writing my

04:17:51.440 --> 04:17:52.620
[Guest]: book with them.

04:17:52.620 --> 04:17:56.500
[Guest]: I share passages of my next book, which is going to be sneaky out of Vancouver, and I'm

04:17:56.500 --> 04:18:00.620
[Guest]: going to self publish it, but I'm writing it and I every month I share a new passage

04:18:00.620 --> 04:18:02.140
[Guest]: with them.

04:18:02.140 --> 04:18:05.780
[Guest]: And what this does is it puts me on a monthly schedule every month, I have to have a substantial

04:18:05.780 --> 04:18:08.900
[Guest]: amount written, it has to be about my art, it has to be about Vancouver.

04:18:08.900 --> 04:18:12.660
[Guest]: So I'm incentivized this month to explore Vancouver in some new way, which could add

04:18:12.660 --> 04:18:13.940
[Guest]: to that book.

04:18:13.940 --> 04:18:17.460
[Guest]: And I'm sharing it with this audience that is paying me to read it.

04:18:17.460 --> 04:18:19.660
[Guest]: They are my insiders, they care about my work.

04:18:19.660 --> 04:18:21.420
[Guest]: So they give me excellent feedback.

04:18:21.420 --> 04:18:25.220
[Guest]: They tell me what they like, they tell me what they didn't like, they I'm open to all

04:18:25.220 --> 04:18:28.620
[Guest]: kinds of criticism from them, because I know that they're coming from a they're vested

04:18:28.620 --> 04:18:29.620
[Guest]: in me.

04:18:29.620 --> 04:18:30.620
[Guest]: Right?

04:18:30.620 --> 04:18:34.140
[Guest]: Same similarly about like, you could imagine, oh, if you have people who own your NFTs,

04:18:34.140 --> 04:18:37.780
[Guest]: you know that these people really they are completely vested in you because financially

04:18:37.780 --> 04:18:42.140
[Guest]: they were like NFTs will rise in financial value, the better you do.

04:18:42.140 --> 04:18:46.460
[Guest]: So they are deeply incentivized to ensure your success.

04:18:46.460 --> 04:18:52.140
[Guest]: You are almost recruiting a team to do PR for you also, because they are deeply incentivized

04:18:52.140 --> 04:18:55.980
[Guest]: to always talk about your work, because they own a part of your work, and that will go

04:18:55.980 --> 04:19:01.140
[Guest]: up in value, just like a patron of old, like if they have a painting of yours, it helps

04:19:01.140 --> 04:19:05.060
[Guest]: them if you sell paintings to other people also, because then their painting also goes

04:19:05.060 --> 04:19:08.460
[Guest]: up in value, or you sell painting somewhere else.

04:19:08.460 --> 04:19:13.660
[Guest]: So similarly, with my insiders, I'm playing these little games, which I'm enjoying a lot.

04:19:13.660 --> 04:19:16.540
[Guest]: And they give me feedback, it's useful feedback.

04:19:16.540 --> 04:19:21.540
[Guest]: And it makes me a better writer for my general podcast for my general newsletter, it makes

04:19:21.540 --> 04:19:27.820
[Guest]: me a better thinker, it forces me it incentivizes me to put my thoughts in order.

04:19:27.820 --> 04:19:33.700
[Amit Varma]: And in a year's or six months time, it will lead to a finished book that will be published.

04:19:33.700 --> 04:19:34.700
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating.

04:19:34.700 --> 04:19:38.580
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I've you know, I've almost by happenstance without thinking too deeply about this stuff

04:19:38.580 --> 04:19:41.420
[Amit Varma]: been kind of successful at building different kinds of communities.

04:19:41.420 --> 04:19:45.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's a clear writing community, obviously, you know, more than 1500 people

04:19:45.380 --> 04:19:48.140
[Amit Varma]: have done the course more than 800 people within that community.

04:19:48.140 --> 04:19:51.580
[Amit Varma]: So got to kind of revitalize that and do more things.

04:19:51.580 --> 04:19:54.540
[Amit Varma]: Plus, there's of course, a few 1000 people who follow my newsletter, even though I've

04:19:54.540 --> 04:19:56.480
[Amit Varma]: posted a handful of times.

04:19:56.480 --> 04:19:58.140
[Amit Varma]: So I really need to get regular.

04:19:58.140 --> 04:20:01.940
[Amit Varma]: And if you are listening to this, and you're a fan, you know, if I start a Patreon club,

04:20:01.940 --> 04:20:05.980
[Amit Varma]: do let me know what you'd like to see there, you know, maybe inside interactions on each

04:20:05.980 --> 04:20:11.500
[Amit Varma]: episode, maybe sharing my research and work process, whatever it is, let me know what

04:20:11.500 --> 04:20:12.500
[Amit Varma]: you'd kind of like there.

04:20:12.500 --> 04:20:16.140
[Amit Varma]: All this is, you know, fun to think about now you mentioned your writing.

04:20:16.140 --> 04:20:19.180
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about your writing because all this happened because you wanted to be

04:20:19.180 --> 04:20:20.500
[Amit Varma]: a writer.

04:20:20.500 --> 04:20:26.620
[Amit Varma]: And somehow you then became an artist and a salesman and a creator in the creator economy

04:20:26.620 --> 04:20:28.300
[Amit Varma]: and all of these things.

04:20:28.300 --> 04:20:29.980
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit more about the writing.

04:20:29.980 --> 04:20:33.380
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that still drives you something you want to do?

04:20:33.380 --> 04:20:35.140
[Guest]: And what kind of book are you writing?

04:20:35.140 --> 04:20:41.140
[Guest]: When I left my PhD program, I was going to write this book about a person who accidentally

04:20:41.140 --> 04:20:47.700
[Guest]: goes back in time and realizes that going back in time is not such a romantic notion

04:20:47.700 --> 04:20:48.700
[Guest]: after all.

04:20:48.700 --> 04:20:49.700
[Guest]: No air conditioning.

04:20:49.700 --> 04:20:50.700
[Amit Varma]: No air conditioning.

04:20:50.700 --> 04:20:51.700
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't go that far.

04:20:51.700 --> 04:20:52.700
[Guest]: Okay.

04:20:52.700 --> 04:20:53.700
[Amit Varma]: He goes from back in his own life.

04:20:53.700 --> 04:20:54.700
[Amit Varma]: No internet.

04:20:54.700 --> 04:20:55.700
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no internet.

04:20:55.700 --> 04:20:57.540
[Guest]: No internet is true in the story.

04:20:57.540 --> 04:21:02.140
[Guest]: So there are consequences to unlicensed time travel.

04:21:02.140 --> 04:21:04.820
[Guest]: That was the idea of the book.

04:21:04.820 --> 04:21:09.420
[Guest]: That book has gone through five drafts since I left my PhD program, not full drafts even

04:21:09.420 --> 04:21:17.700
[Guest]: 60% 50% 40% 40% 30% entire rewrites though, right from the start again, every time the

04:21:17.700 --> 04:21:23.060
[Guest]: story has changed, it started as a first person narrative, it changed to an outside narrative,

04:21:23.060 --> 04:21:26.780
[Guest]: the characters have changed, the premise has changed, the ending has changed.

04:21:26.780 --> 04:21:30.580
[Guest]: My idea for it, the scope of it has changed.

04:21:30.580 --> 04:21:38.700
[Guest]: And I just find that it's very difficult, this process of writing a novel is very unrewarding

04:21:38.700 --> 04:21:44.020
[Guest]: because how it works is that you write the whole thing.

04:21:44.020 --> 04:21:49.540
[Guest]: And then you go to somebody and they tell you if they like it enough in that zeitgeist

04:21:49.540 --> 04:21:53.700
[Guest]: of that moment, whether it's worth publishing for them.

04:21:53.700 --> 04:21:58.300
[Guest]: And you have to take a rejection from a bunch of people after finishing the whole damn thing,

04:21:58.300 --> 04:22:00.180
[Guest]: which is so difficult.

04:22:00.180 --> 04:22:03.340
[Guest]: And then maybe two years later, it gets out.

04:22:03.340 --> 04:22:07.820
[Guest]: And then maybe you do all the work around it and people are ready for it at that time

04:22:07.820 --> 04:22:10.180
[Guest]: and it sells.

04:22:10.180 --> 04:22:13.680
[Guest]: So much work goes into this thing.

04:22:13.680 --> 04:22:20.660
[Guest]: And it is dependent on so much luck and circumstance like it is bound to so many failures that

04:22:20.660 --> 04:22:25.980
[Guest]: have nothing to do with your ability or your the value of your work that I just hate this

04:22:25.980 --> 04:22:27.460
[Guest]: system.

04:22:27.460 --> 04:22:32.100
[Guest]: So my current plan is and I don't get this with my other creative output, right?

04:22:32.100 --> 04:22:36.220
[Guest]: So my podcast I hear every week from people, people tell me on buy me a coffee, they buy

04:22:36.220 --> 04:22:39.900
[Guest]: me coffee, they tell me how they like it, my guests are there, I get to learn, have

04:22:39.900 --> 04:22:41.900
[Guest]: a discord around my art and my podcast.

04:22:41.900 --> 04:22:46.140
[Guest]: So I get to hear every week from people how that's going, we talk on that and we interact.

04:22:46.140 --> 04:22:51.460
[Guest]: My newsletter has an audience of true fans also, and then they get it every week and

04:22:51.460 --> 04:22:54.980
[Guest]: thousands of readers who tell me what they think what they like.

04:22:54.980 --> 04:22:59.180
[Guest]: So I get this feedback, I don't run on this feedback.

04:22:59.180 --> 04:23:02.140
[Guest]: And like to your point before, we need to be self motivated.

04:23:02.140 --> 04:23:06.540
[Guest]: I'm very, very insistent on that, that the fuel has to be me.

04:23:06.540 --> 04:23:08.900
[Guest]: It cannot be relied upon on other people.

04:23:08.900 --> 04:23:13.660
[Guest]: But this helps, it helps you to think that you're not screaming into the void, which

04:23:13.660 --> 04:23:19.460
[Guest]: is what Facebook in 2014 felt like just screaming into the void, and nothing is coming back.

04:23:19.460 --> 04:23:26.180
[Guest]: So my plan for now is that I want to continue to do this, just like the way I decided that

04:23:26.180 --> 04:23:31.500
[Guest]: I'm going to accept the title of artist, because that meant that I'm not a writer first.

04:23:31.500 --> 04:23:37.500
[Guest]: And I did that because what is my USP in this new country, that I was living in Wisconsin,

04:23:37.500 --> 04:23:43.020
[Guest]: my USP is that I'm making this art that nobody has seen this kind of art.

04:23:43.020 --> 04:23:48.580
[Guest]: Art is easy to appreciate, it needs 10 seconds of time, at most, and people are hooked, writing

04:23:48.580 --> 04:23:53.860
[Guest]: needs way more time before somebody is hooked, hooked, and you need to do a it's a far more

04:23:53.860 --> 04:23:56.220
[Guest]: difficult job.

04:23:56.220 --> 04:24:03.460
[Guest]: So it gets me a broader audience, and once you have an audience, you can do many things

04:24:03.460 --> 04:24:05.140
[Guest]: with that audience.

04:24:05.140 --> 04:24:08.540
[Guest]: I do not like the traditional novel publishing route.

04:24:08.540 --> 04:24:13.420
[Guest]: I don't like the system where I have to beg and plead for attention.

04:24:13.420 --> 04:24:17.300
[Guest]: And after I have done my job, I have to now finish the job.

04:24:17.300 --> 04:24:22.600
[Guest]: Now I have to desperately seek rewards for it, and validation for it before those rewards.

04:24:22.600 --> 04:24:28.940
[Guest]: How I want to do it is that I want to use my platform as a sneaky artist, while continuously

04:24:28.940 --> 04:24:37.620
[Guest]: writing fiction, nonfiction, everything, and develop my name, develop my brand, be somebody

04:24:37.620 --> 04:24:41.980
[Guest]: who is in a more commanding position with their work to get that attention.

04:24:41.980 --> 04:24:45.420
[Guest]: I don't want to have to beg for attention for my finished novel.

04:24:45.420 --> 04:24:49.660
[Guest]: I want there to be a group of people who will care for it already, who are waiting to read

04:24:49.660 --> 04:24:53.220
[Guest]: it, who will be willing to be beta readers of it.

04:24:53.220 --> 04:24:57.340
[Guest]: That's the conditions under which I want to put in that much single sided effort.

04:24:57.340 --> 04:25:01.340
[Guest]: Because I know that the novel is not something that I want to share chapter by chapter and

04:25:01.340 --> 04:25:02.340
[Guest]: get feedback.

04:25:02.340 --> 04:25:04.460
[Guest]: I want to finish the whole thing.

04:25:04.460 --> 04:25:06.660
[Guest]: Doing that means disengaging from a lot of other work.

04:25:06.660 --> 04:25:08.940
[Guest]: I can't just also be doing it on the side.

04:25:08.940 --> 04:25:12.460
[Guest]: I will have to take time to do only that.

04:25:12.460 --> 04:25:15.300
[Guest]: And that means killing a lot of other momentum.

04:25:15.300 --> 04:25:20.180
[Guest]: And I am not in a position that I want to kill that momentum just yet.

04:25:20.180 --> 04:25:25.060
[Guest]: I want to keep this dream alive that my fiction novel will get published and I will be a writer.

04:25:25.060 --> 04:25:27.620
[Guest]: Maybe it turns out to be unnecessary by the end.

04:25:27.620 --> 04:25:28.940
[Guest]: And I don't end up doing it.

04:25:28.940 --> 04:25:34.820
[Guest]: But this process right now of the reward mechanism and the way the art works, I make a drawing,

04:25:34.820 --> 04:25:38.220
[Guest]: I post it and I get dopamine.

04:25:38.220 --> 04:25:39.580
[Guest]: I like it.

04:25:39.580 --> 04:25:41.900
[Guest]: My natural inclination is towards it.

04:25:41.900 --> 04:25:46.180
[Guest]: I used to draw a lot of comics and I drew some long form comics also.

04:25:46.180 --> 04:25:49.720
[Guest]: And it was a very excruciating process for me.

04:25:49.720 --> 04:25:50.860
[Guest]: And I love it.

04:25:50.860 --> 04:25:52.940
[Guest]: And I want to do more of those things.

04:25:52.940 --> 04:25:57.100
[Guest]: I have come to understand that that is not who I am naturally.

04:25:57.100 --> 04:26:04.140
[Guest]: I am the kind of person who wants to do things once and get something for it.

04:26:04.140 --> 04:26:06.340
[Guest]: For good and for bad.

04:26:06.340 --> 04:26:12.740
[Guest]: And art, the way I draw, lends itself to that more easily.

04:26:12.740 --> 04:26:16.420
[Guest]: It has a lot of value to a lot of people.

04:26:16.420 --> 04:26:22.060
[Guest]: And by being a writer around it, I can create more and more value around it.

04:26:22.060 --> 04:26:27.300
[Guest]: Like I was saying, my hope is that this lets me be a writer later with a little more ease.

04:26:27.300 --> 04:26:33.540
[Guest]: And my hope is that once I taste this success, that I will be a little more amenable to rewriting,

04:26:33.540 --> 04:26:37.860
[Guest]: redrafting, and the long form work of putting together a novel.

04:26:37.860 --> 04:26:41.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, increasingly, I'm like this whole sort of circle that you mentioned that you

04:26:41.700 --> 04:26:45.020
[Amit Varma]: finish the book, you go to a publisher gets published two years later.

04:26:45.020 --> 04:26:48.620
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when I look back at episodes that I read a year ago, I can't bear to hear

04:26:48.620 --> 04:26:49.620
[Amit Varma]: them today.

04:26:49.620 --> 04:26:52.620
[Amit Varma]: At the time, I might have liked them, and I refer them to someone and say, hey, I like

04:26:52.620 --> 04:26:54.040
[Amit Varma]: doing this.

04:26:54.040 --> 04:26:55.860
[Amit Varma]: But I'm not going to go back and actually listen to it.

04:26:55.860 --> 04:26:56.860
[Amit Varma]: It's in my past.

04:26:56.860 --> 04:27:01.620
[Amit Varma]: Like, honestly, Nishant, by the time this episode is out, it's out of my system, right?

04:27:01.620 --> 04:27:03.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'm on to new episodes.

04:27:03.820 --> 04:27:05.380
[Amit Varma]: That's the whole game for me.

04:27:05.380 --> 04:27:10.240
[Amit Varma]: And the other part of it is that what we've seen in all media is that intermediaries are

04:27:10.240 --> 04:27:11.240
[Amit Varma]: falling apart.

04:27:11.240 --> 04:27:12.240
[Amit Varma]: We don't need them anymore.

04:27:12.240 --> 04:27:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Right?

04:27:13.240 --> 04:27:16.860
[Amit Varma]: Our creators are reaching their audiences directly monetizing that directly.

04:27:16.860 --> 04:27:23.740
[Amit Varma]: Now at one level, the notion of the book as 100,000 word 150,000 word thing that you publish

04:27:23.740 --> 04:27:27.980
[Amit Varma]: in that particular packaging is I think the artifact of an earlier era.

04:27:27.980 --> 04:27:32.260
[Amit Varma]: That's number one, that writing doesn't have to be, you know, writing can be shorter or

04:27:32.260 --> 04:27:36.620
[Amit Varma]: longer or structured differently or sold differently, packaged differently.

04:27:36.620 --> 04:27:41.020
[Amit Varma]: But also publishing houses, I think are largely dinosaurs, they're like the gatekeepers of

04:27:41.020 --> 04:27:45.420
[Amit Varma]: old, they're just like the art galleries that we kind of discussed, you know, often following

04:27:45.420 --> 04:27:50.480
[Amit Varma]: fashions of the times and being restricted by the tastes of the people who kind of happened

04:27:50.480 --> 04:27:55.320
[Amit Varma]: to be there, which, you know, might close out many groups of people, especially less

04:27:55.320 --> 04:27:59.780
[Amit Varma]: privileged groups of people, for example, who just might not have that entry point to

04:27:59.780 --> 04:28:02.580
[Amit Varma]: begin with and less privileged in different ways.

04:28:02.580 --> 04:28:05.620
[Amit Varma]: So you've experimented with self publishing as well.

04:28:05.620 --> 04:28:07.500
[Amit Varma]: So what was that experience like?

04:28:07.500 --> 04:28:10.300
[Amit Varma]: Because when I was growing up in India, no doubt when you were growing up in India as

04:28:10.300 --> 04:28:14.820
[Amit Varma]: well, which is possibly a decade after me, self publishing was considered, you know,

04:28:14.820 --> 04:28:19.100
[Amit Varma]: people look down on it, like you couldn't find a publisher to TK, Calcutta had a famous

04:28:19.100 --> 04:28:21.900
[Amit Varma]: self publisher writers workshop run by P Lal.

04:28:21.900 --> 04:28:27.140
[Amit Varma]: So the whole gig was that, oh, you couldn't find a publisher to self publish, you know,

04:28:27.140 --> 04:28:30.380
[Guest]: so yeah, so there is this, again, there was this hierarchy, right?

04:28:30.380 --> 04:28:35.460
[Guest]: Because while there were institutions, the point of institutions is that they have perceived

04:28:35.460 --> 04:28:36.460
[Guest]: value.

04:28:36.460 --> 04:28:40.340
[Guest]: There is this esteem and this prestige that comes with being associated with say, Penguin

04:28:40.340 --> 04:28:43.620
[Guest]: or Harper Collins or whatever names there are.

04:28:43.620 --> 04:28:46.180
[Guest]: But that is falling apart in this new world.

04:28:46.180 --> 04:28:50.780
[Guest]: Increasingly, people, in fact, cherish the independent creator.

04:28:50.780 --> 04:28:57.660
[Guest]: They understand this idea of the privilege associated with having a publisher has reached

04:28:57.660 --> 04:28:58.660
[Guest]: a lot more people.

04:28:58.660 --> 04:29:02.840
[Guest]: This idea that it's not all merit, it's a lot of circumstance and it's a lot of privilege.

04:29:02.840 --> 04:29:04.900
[Guest]: It's about networks and contacts.

04:29:04.900 --> 04:29:10.180
[Guest]: Very often doesn't mean that published people are not good, but very often this is a factor

04:29:10.180 --> 04:29:12.300
[Guest]: of these other things also.

04:29:12.300 --> 04:29:16.060
[Guest]: And therefore, someone being independent is not inferior to a published person.

04:29:16.060 --> 04:29:19.340
[Guest]: This is the crux of what has been absorbed.

04:29:19.340 --> 04:29:23.940
[Guest]: And in fact, perhaps we need to value these underdogs who are putting out content.

04:29:23.940 --> 04:29:24.940
[Guest]: Thanks to YouTube.

04:29:24.940 --> 04:29:25.940
[Guest]: Thanks to Twitch.

04:29:25.940 --> 04:29:26.940
[Guest]: Thanks to Twitter.

04:29:26.940 --> 04:29:27.940
[Guest]: Thanks to TikTok.

04:29:27.940 --> 04:29:32.620
[Guest]: Also, these independent people have created a market for independent content.

04:29:32.620 --> 04:29:35.180
[Guest]: This is something that I really enjoyed.

04:29:35.180 --> 04:29:39.220
[Guest]: I really admired because I have always felt like an outsider.

04:29:39.220 --> 04:29:42.580
[Guest]: I didn't study English in like my bachelor's.

04:29:42.580 --> 04:29:46.300
[Guest]: So I did not spend time around people who were writing all the time.

04:29:46.300 --> 04:29:49.660
[Guest]: I didn't spend time around people who could tell me about the craft of writing.

04:29:49.660 --> 04:29:54.380
[Guest]: I'd therefore later, these people would end up joining publishing houses as editors or

04:29:54.380 --> 04:29:58.660
[Guest]: as readers or as publishers or whatever various capacities of that hierarchy.

04:29:58.660 --> 04:29:59.860
[Guest]: I don't know these people.

04:29:59.860 --> 04:30:01.820
[Guest]: So therefore I have none of those contacts.

04:30:01.820 --> 04:30:03.500
[Guest]: I'm not an artist also trained.

04:30:03.500 --> 04:30:08.940
[Guest]: So I have no contacts in any geographical region with curators or gallery owners, etc.

04:30:08.940 --> 04:30:11.140
[Guest]: So I'm an outsider in all of these worlds.

04:30:11.140 --> 04:30:15.180
[Guest]: And the only way things have worked for me is with the latest technology of the time.

04:30:15.180 --> 04:30:17.260
[Guest]: The social media worked for me at the time.

04:30:17.260 --> 04:30:22.100
[Guest]: And now the creator economy, media, and the services associated around that are working

04:30:22.100 --> 04:30:23.220
[Guest]: for me.

04:30:23.220 --> 04:30:30.140
[Guest]: So after I sold art, the first season of selling art in Wisconsin in 2018, I thought at the

04:30:30.140 --> 04:30:35.660
[Guest]: end of that season, what I'm going to do next year, because I was thinking that suppose

04:30:35.660 --> 04:30:40.180
[Guest]: someone has put my art on the wall, how much more are they going to buy?

04:30:40.180 --> 04:30:45.180
[Guest]: Even if they really like me, how much like how much wall space will someone give me man,

04:30:45.180 --> 04:30:50.540
[Guest]: limited hair, why shouldn't they patronize other artists and like, I'll run out of repeat

04:30:50.540 --> 04:30:51.540
[Guest]: customers.

04:30:51.540 --> 04:30:54.340
[Guest]: So now I need to occupy a different part of their home.

04:30:54.340 --> 04:30:59.660
[Guest]: Literally, this was the thought, a book can occupy a different part of their home.

04:30:59.660 --> 04:31:02.020
[Guest]: Book is a nice gift book is a nice thing to keep.

04:31:02.020 --> 04:31:04.940
[Guest]: Why don't I make a coffee table book.

04:31:04.940 --> 04:31:09.860
[Guest]: And I just thought I'll make it because there was no way that I could I couldn't even imagine

04:31:09.860 --> 04:31:12.100
[Guest]: getting someone interested in it.

04:31:12.100 --> 04:31:14.820
[Guest]: But this is what I did to really understand the process.

04:31:14.820 --> 04:31:18.600
[Guest]: I went to this writer's workshop in Chicago.

04:31:18.600 --> 04:31:20.660
[Guest]: And this was not a workshop to teach you to write.

04:31:20.660 --> 04:31:24.220
[Guest]: But this was a workshop about pitching to literary agents.

04:31:24.220 --> 04:31:28.620
[Guest]: And America has a very thriving independent publishing industry as well as the traditional

04:31:28.620 --> 04:31:30.860
[Guest]: and many different scales of it.

04:31:30.860 --> 04:31:35.740
[Guest]: So there are small publishers that are larger medium and larger publishers also.

04:31:35.740 --> 04:31:40.140
[Guest]: So all of these processes are therefore very formalized, and it's very good to be a new

04:31:40.140 --> 04:31:41.340
[Guest]: person getting into them.

04:31:41.340 --> 04:31:48.000
[Guest]: So I got a 20 minute session, or maybe it was a 10 minute session with a literary agent.

04:31:48.000 --> 04:31:51.420
[Guest]: And she just loved what I told her she loved my pitch.

04:31:51.420 --> 04:31:53.580
[Guest]: She loved my idea.

04:31:53.580 --> 04:31:58.140
[Guest]: And I took some samples of how my book might look like I printed out 10 pages and I showed

04:31:58.140 --> 04:32:01.440
[Guest]: this is what I want my art book to look like and she just loved it.

04:32:01.440 --> 04:32:02.700
[Guest]: So she was an instant fan.

04:32:02.700 --> 04:32:08.980
[Guest]: Like she said it in so many words that you've absolutely got me like I'm in but I don't

04:32:08.980 --> 04:32:11.300
[Guest]: think this should be traditionally published.

04:32:11.300 --> 04:32:12.700
[Guest]: That's what she said.

04:32:12.700 --> 04:32:16.860
[Guest]: And this was around the incentives of traditional publishing.

04:32:16.860 --> 04:32:20.340
[Guest]: And I think every writer like we are talking about whether you want to write a book or

04:32:20.340 --> 04:32:25.500
[Guest]: not every writer should also think about what is the reward of traditional publishing to

04:32:25.500 --> 04:32:27.620
[Guest]: them and then to the publisher.

04:32:27.620 --> 04:32:31.980
[Guest]: So a publisher will publish if they can see a financial reward which comes from 1000s

04:32:31.980 --> 04:32:32.980
[Guest]: of copies.

04:32:32.980 --> 04:32:35.220
[Guest]: It doesn't come from 100s of copies.

04:32:35.220 --> 04:32:40.420
[Guest]: It depends on like the large costs associated with their work, then they have to time it

04:32:40.420 --> 04:32:41.660
[Guest]: so that they can promote it.

04:32:41.660 --> 04:32:45.540
[Guest]: So it has to fit into their calendar, which has involves other authors and other things

04:32:45.540 --> 04:32:48.660
[Guest]: and things that they might perceive are competing with your book.

04:32:48.660 --> 04:32:51.640
[Guest]: So do they want to promote two things that might eat into each other.

04:32:51.640 --> 04:32:55.220
[Guest]: So now suddenly you are locked into a competition with someone that you don't intend you don't

04:32:55.220 --> 04:33:00.500
[Guest]: even know, but simply out of virtue of being associated with a publisher you are.

04:33:00.500 --> 04:33:05.900
[Guest]: So my circumstance in Wisconsin was that I want to make a book about this town in Wisconsin.

04:33:05.900 --> 04:33:07.980
[Guest]: The population is only 80,000.

04:33:07.980 --> 04:33:13.020
[Guest]: My largest market is 100,000 potential and 100,000 market doesn't mean 100,000 people

04:33:13.020 --> 04:33:14.020
[Guest]: will buy the book.

04:33:14.020 --> 04:33:17.840
[Guest]: 10% of this market will buy the book if I am lucky.

04:33:17.840 --> 04:33:21.300
[Guest]: So most likely I have 100s of copies to sell.

04:33:21.300 --> 04:33:23.140
[Guest]: Who cares which publisher will care about that?

04:33:23.140 --> 04:33:24.600
[Guest]: No publisher will care.

04:33:24.600 --> 04:33:27.800
[Guest]: But this doesn't mean that there are no rewards in it for me.

04:33:27.800 --> 04:33:31.340
[Guest]: The act of putting together a book is a fantastic learning exercise.

04:33:31.340 --> 04:33:33.300
[Guest]: That's a reward for me.

04:33:33.300 --> 04:33:38.060
[Guest]: The cost of self publishing and then the profit of selling all of those books.

04:33:38.060 --> 04:33:40.420
[Guest]: There is a financial reward for me.

04:33:40.420 --> 04:33:43.060
[Guest]: There is a reputational reward in having a book.

04:33:43.060 --> 04:33:45.380
[Guest]: It's something that I bring along to various people.

04:33:45.380 --> 04:33:49.260
[Guest]: Like when I give podcast conversations, I carry the book and I give it to podcast hosts

04:33:49.260 --> 04:33:53.340
[Guest]: before and then they look at it and they feel nice and then I feel nice and then they keep

04:33:53.340 --> 04:33:56.580
[Guest]: it and it occupies a space on their shelf.

04:33:56.580 --> 04:33:57.820
[Guest]: That is a reward for me.

04:33:57.820 --> 04:34:02.700
[Guest]: That is a non-monetary, but it is a very significant reward if I occupy that space in someone's

04:34:02.700 --> 04:34:03.700
[Amit Varma]: life.

04:34:03.700 --> 04:34:06.980
[Amit Varma]: I guess book owned by Amit Verma could be in the category of the Twitter accounts that

04:34:06.980 --> 04:34:09.260
[Amit Varma]: are followed by the Prime Minister.

04:34:09.260 --> 04:34:12.100
[Amit Varma]: Well, maybe not.

04:34:12.100 --> 04:34:13.100
[Guest]: Carry on.

04:34:13.100 --> 04:34:17.940
[Guest]: So she asked me to formulate a nonfiction book proposal and a nonfiction book proposal

04:34:17.940 --> 04:34:20.620
[Guest]: has these various criteria that you fulfill.

04:34:20.620 --> 04:34:25.820
[Guest]: Firstly you have to, so a fiction book proposal needs a full book, full book manuscript.

04:34:25.820 --> 04:34:28.340
[Guest]: But a nonfiction book proposal does not need that.

04:34:28.340 --> 04:34:32.740
[Guest]: It needs two chapters and an introduction and a table of contents.

04:34:32.740 --> 04:34:34.940
[Guest]: So my book doesn't have chapters because it's all art.

04:34:34.940 --> 04:34:39.620
[Guest]: So I just thought, okay, 20 pages and a table of contents or whatever, whatever the format

04:34:39.620 --> 04:34:40.620
[Guest]: is as I imagine.

04:34:40.620 --> 04:34:42.540
[Guest]: And I'll write the intro.

04:34:42.540 --> 04:34:44.820
[Guest]: So that I needed to do.

04:34:44.820 --> 04:34:48.740
[Guest]: And I needed to think of it as what the final product is going to be.

04:34:48.740 --> 04:34:53.660
[Guest]: Then another aspect of this is of preparing a book, a nonfiction book proposal is that

04:34:53.660 --> 04:34:57.660
[Guest]: you have to talk about your audience, who is your target audience?

04:34:57.660 --> 04:35:03.980
[Guest]: Not only that, oh, everybody who loves art, no, geographically, age wise, socially, various

04:35:03.980 --> 04:35:06.020
[Guest]: interests, numbers, use numbers.

04:35:06.020 --> 04:35:10.580
[Guest]: My audience is the kind of people who buy this kind of book, which sold 5 million copies.

04:35:10.580 --> 04:35:15.780
[Guest]: My audience is people ages 30 to blah, blah, blah, living in this part of the world.

04:35:15.780 --> 04:35:18.300
[Guest]: The population census number is this.

04:35:18.300 --> 04:35:21.940
[Guest]: So this is a, again, a dispassionate way to look at your work.

04:35:21.940 --> 04:35:23.700
[Guest]: It asks you to do this.

04:35:23.700 --> 04:35:28.940
[Guest]: Secondly, pitching like this means that suddenly you start to see who does it have value for?

04:35:28.940 --> 04:35:30.300
[Guest]: Why is this not my audience?

04:35:30.300 --> 04:35:31.980
[Guest]: Why is this my audience?

04:35:31.980 --> 04:35:33.020
[Guest]: What can it be?

04:35:33.020 --> 04:35:35.860
[Guest]: What can I do so that this is also my audience?

04:35:35.860 --> 04:35:39.980
[Guest]: Suddenly you're thinking not of changing your art, not of changing your craft, but of how

04:35:39.980 --> 04:35:41.740
[Guest]: you talk about it.

04:35:41.740 --> 04:35:44.460
[Guest]: How do I get these other people to be interested?

04:35:44.460 --> 04:35:46.540
[Guest]: So Eau Claire has a university.

04:35:46.540 --> 04:35:49.060
[Guest]: So there are parents of students.

04:35:49.060 --> 04:35:53.180
[Guest]: Why shouldn't the parents who live maybe in other states or other towns, why shouldn't

04:35:53.180 --> 04:35:55.700
[Guest]: they also, they should also care about this book.

04:35:55.700 --> 04:36:00.220
[Guest]: How can I make my book so that even they are part of my target demographic?

04:36:00.220 --> 04:36:02.740
[Guest]: Another part I had to write was your competence.

04:36:02.740 --> 04:36:05.860
[Guest]: Why are you the right person to write this book?

04:36:05.860 --> 04:36:08.140
[Guest]: Traditionally nonfiction would be say politics, economics.

04:36:08.140 --> 04:36:12.500
[Guest]: So you would have to cite your degrees or your experience to say that I have, I'm an

04:36:12.500 --> 04:36:14.700
[Guest]: authority on the subject.

04:36:14.700 --> 04:36:15.980
[Guest]: In this case, it was an art book.

04:36:15.980 --> 04:36:18.280
[Guest]: So I only had to say, I'm an artist.

04:36:18.280 --> 04:36:22.340
[Guest]: This book is from the perspective of somebody who has spent two years in this town and is

04:36:22.340 --> 04:36:24.460
[Guest]: not from this town.

04:36:24.460 --> 04:36:28.580
[Guest]: So I am the only person who can write this book effectively, because now I have changed

04:36:28.580 --> 04:36:33.780
[Guest]: what this book is also about to suit why I am the only person to write this book.

04:36:33.780 --> 04:36:35.620
[Guest]: Again, this slightly shifted.

04:36:35.620 --> 04:36:37.180
[Guest]: What does this book mean?

04:36:37.180 --> 04:36:39.660
[Guest]: How am I going to later talk about this book to people?

04:36:39.660 --> 04:36:42.620
[Guest]: How am I going to present this book to people in the introduction?

04:36:42.620 --> 04:36:46.780
[Guest]: That also shifted slightly because I had to figure out why I am the most appropriate person

04:36:46.780 --> 04:36:49.380
[Guest]: to write a book of art about Eau Claire.

04:36:49.380 --> 04:36:54.140
[Guest]: No, this is because it is a book of sneaky art about Eau Claire from somebody who is

04:36:54.140 --> 04:36:57.380
[Guest]: not of this town and is trying to understand this town.

04:36:57.380 --> 04:37:02.180
[Guest]: Therefore, the only person who can write it is somebody who is not from this town and

04:37:02.180 --> 04:37:04.440
[Guest]: who makes art like me, sneaky.

04:37:04.440 --> 04:37:07.580
[Guest]: So I sort of created these circumstances around it.

04:37:07.580 --> 04:37:10.140
[Guest]: And then there are a couple of other things you're supposed to write in a non-fiction.

04:37:10.140 --> 04:37:14.780
[Guest]: It's a roughly a 20 page proposal, but I filled out the whole thing.

04:37:14.780 --> 04:37:18.740
[Guest]: Didn't send it to anybody because by the time I wrote it, I concluded that self-publishing

04:37:18.740 --> 04:37:21.660
[Guest]: is what I need to do because there's nobody who's going to care.

04:37:21.660 --> 04:37:22.660
[Guest]: Like what did I say?

04:37:22.660 --> 04:37:23.980
[Guest]: 500 people will buy this book.

04:37:23.980 --> 04:37:24.980
[Guest]: I can't even see.

04:37:24.980 --> 04:37:25.980
[Guest]: I don't know.

04:37:25.980 --> 04:37:26.980
[Guest]: There are three bookstores here.

04:37:26.980 --> 04:37:30.020
[Guest]: What thousand people will these numbers don't matter to them.

04:37:30.020 --> 04:37:34.180
[Guest]: So they will not be interested, but that this book needs to exist because I want to occupy

04:37:34.180 --> 04:37:38.540
[Guest]: a new part of people's home and I want to create something and I want to see what it

04:37:38.540 --> 04:37:39.820
[Guest]: is like to do it.

04:37:39.820 --> 04:37:44.680
[Guest]: And all of these processes are amazing learning experiences around making a book.

04:37:44.680 --> 04:37:52.020
[Guest]: So I went to a independent press in the neighboring city in Minneapolis and I, they do independent

04:37:52.020 --> 04:37:53.640
[Guest]: book books.

04:37:53.640 --> 04:37:58.540
[Guest]: So what they do is that they have a formalized process of how to put this together.

04:37:58.540 --> 04:38:02.440
[Guest]: There are a bunch of six, seven meetings on different topics, but they get you in touch

04:38:02.440 --> 04:38:06.460
[Guest]: with a designer who might be skilled at the genre you are aiming at.

04:38:06.460 --> 04:38:11.140
[Guest]: And then there are associated fees for these various meetings, for this various things

04:38:11.140 --> 04:38:14.980
[Guest]: that they will do for you, like getting you an ISBN listing, et cetera, et cetera.

04:38:14.980 --> 04:38:19.860
[Guest]: The designers fees, the feedback and all the various interchange and meetings you'll have.

04:38:19.860 --> 04:38:25.080
[Guest]: So finally printing, deciding on what quality of pages you want, deciding on what size you

04:38:25.080 --> 04:38:26.080
[Guest]: want the book.

04:38:26.080 --> 04:38:27.080
[Guest]: Should it have a hard cover?

04:38:27.080 --> 04:38:28.260
[Guest]: Should it have a jacket?

04:38:28.260 --> 04:38:30.260
[Guest]: I made all of these calls myself.

04:38:30.260 --> 04:38:32.380
[Guest]: I want my book to be a square book.

04:38:32.380 --> 04:38:34.980
[Guest]: I don't want it to be long or tall.

04:38:34.980 --> 04:38:39.780
[Guest]: I wanted to have a hard cover with a dust jacket and I wanted to lay flat so that if

04:38:39.780 --> 04:38:43.860
[Guest]: I have these spreads, two page spread drawings, I want them, someone to be able to put it

04:38:43.860 --> 04:38:48.820
[Guest]: flat on their coffee table and see it without having to hold it.

04:38:48.820 --> 04:38:49.820
[Guest]: And I want to have that.

04:38:49.820 --> 04:38:52.900
[Guest]: So I was thinking about user experience around the book.

04:38:52.900 --> 04:38:54.440
[Guest]: How will they regard a book of art?

04:38:54.440 --> 04:38:55.700
[Guest]: How will they keep it in their house?

04:38:55.700 --> 04:38:58.260
[Guest]: If it can lay flat, it can be left flat.

04:38:58.260 --> 04:39:00.420
[Guest]: Maybe they leave it as an open page.

04:39:00.420 --> 04:39:01.420
[Guest]: That might be interesting.

04:39:01.420 --> 04:39:02.420
[Guest]: It's an art display.

04:39:02.420 --> 04:39:04.200
[Guest]: They can flip the page every day.

04:39:04.200 --> 04:39:05.700
[Guest]: So this thing stuck in my head.

04:39:05.700 --> 04:39:09.780
[Guest]: When I would later sell the book, I would tell people this, that look, this book lays

04:39:09.780 --> 04:39:10.780
[Guest]: flat.

04:39:10.780 --> 04:39:14.020
[Guest]: Every day you can turn the page and then 100 days you will have 100 pieces of art to look

04:39:14.020 --> 04:39:16.500
[Guest]: at because it's 112 odd pages.

04:39:16.500 --> 04:39:18.820
[Guest]: This again became a way for me to sell this book.

04:39:18.820 --> 04:39:21.520
[Guest]: Again it became a way for me to create value around this book.

04:39:21.520 --> 04:39:26.420
[Guest]: It became a way for me to see value around my art and my book and my work.

04:39:26.420 --> 04:39:27.420
[Amit Varma]: And what was the process?

04:39:27.420 --> 04:39:28.420
[Amit Varma]: Like where did you sell it?

04:39:28.420 --> 04:39:30.260
[Amit Varma]: How many copies did you sell?

04:39:30.260 --> 04:39:31.580
[Amit Varma]: Was it profitable?

04:39:31.580 --> 04:39:36.300
[Amit Varma]: And most importantly, can this model scale, like I understand for one person doing an

04:39:36.300 --> 04:39:40.420
[Amit Varma]: art book in a particular location, you can make it work for you.

04:39:40.420 --> 04:39:45.540
[Amit Varma]: But what are your thoughts on self publishing in general, like how far along has print on

04:39:45.540 --> 04:39:46.540
[Amit Varma]: demand come?

04:39:46.540 --> 04:39:50.740
[Amit Varma]: I keep telling young writers who want to write articles for Indian Express or Times of India

04:39:50.740 --> 04:39:54.540
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, that don't do that because for a number of reasons.

04:39:54.540 --> 04:39:58.340
[Amit Varma]: One is that you will not be writing enough because the gatekeepers won't approve you

04:39:58.340 --> 04:40:00.820
[Amit Varma]: enough and you need to write a lot to be good.

04:40:00.820 --> 04:40:03.020
[Amit Varma]: Two, your pieces will all be dispersed.

04:40:03.020 --> 04:40:05.980
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build a community of your fans, you can't do that.

04:40:05.980 --> 04:40:10.500
[Amit Varma]: Someone will read your piece in TOI and will say, oh, what a good writer and but then,

04:40:10.500 --> 04:40:14.500
[Amit Varma]: you know, whereas if you just write in a newsletter, if they like what you do, they can subscribe

04:40:14.500 --> 04:40:18.980
[Amit Varma]: to you, you build a community of your fans, your work isn't dispersed, it's in one place.

04:40:18.980 --> 04:40:24.620
[Amit Varma]: But that's what those kind of writers, whereas, you know, are there possibilities where is

04:40:24.620 --> 04:40:30.420
[Amit Varma]: print on demand advanced enough that people can, can someone write a bestseller today,

04:40:30.420 --> 04:40:34.620
[Amit Varma]: an actual bestseller, bestseller, without going through a publisher, just using Amazon's

04:40:34.620 --> 04:40:36.100
[Guest]: print on demand, for example.

04:40:36.100 --> 04:40:42.500
[Guest]: So for example, how I did this was that I printed 500 copies, we reached a number for

04:40:42.500 --> 04:40:45.780
[Guest]: that it was roughly $10,000 at that time for me.

04:40:45.780 --> 04:40:51.980
[Guest]: So roughly $20 per book, I decided to sell it at $30 because I wanted to put at the lowest

04:40:51.980 --> 04:40:57.860
[Guest]: price point that this town is not rich, that they'll buy it, but I'll make some profit.

04:40:57.860 --> 04:41:02.660
[Guest]: I broke even very quickly, not only the book, but when I started selling the book, the associated

04:41:02.660 --> 04:41:06.920
[Guest]: prints and things like that, within two months, I broke even with my 10,000, I made a lot

04:41:06.920 --> 04:41:10.780
[Guest]: of money very quickly, I did the job of distributing it myself also.

04:41:10.780 --> 04:41:15.820
[Guest]: So the marketing job, once you have the book, however, you there are lots of advisories

04:41:15.820 --> 04:41:20.380
[Guest]: on this, by the way, you can then so many resources, beautiful resources, reach out

04:41:20.380 --> 04:41:25.300
[Guest]: to local bookstores, local gift shops, tell them you're going to do a book launch, they

04:41:25.300 --> 04:41:29.140
[Guest]: will give you the space and the blah, blah, blah, and they will take a cut of the book.

04:41:29.140 --> 04:41:30.820
[Guest]: And you can call your fans there.

04:41:30.820 --> 04:41:36.180
[Guest]: I had people drive two and a half hours to come to buy the book from me.

04:41:36.180 --> 04:41:40.180
[Guest]: It was just it was unreal when that's when this person said to me that I drove 200 miles

04:41:40.180 --> 04:41:44.500
[Guest]: just for this just to buy the book from someone you didn't know before I had no idea.

04:41:44.500 --> 04:41:46.660
[Guest]: They came from 200 miles away.

04:41:46.660 --> 04:41:53.380
[Guest]: Because what I was offering was and again, I offered people that anybody who buys a book

04:41:53.380 --> 04:41:58.220
[Guest]: from me in person, I will draw a portrait of you right there and then in the first page

04:41:58.220 --> 04:41:59.220
[Guest]: of the book.

04:41:59.220 --> 04:42:01.420
[Guest]: This is my thank you to you for buying from me.

04:42:01.420 --> 04:42:02.700
[Guest]: The Marwari artist.

04:42:02.700 --> 04:42:04.820
[Guest]: Yeah, it's it's art.

04:42:04.820 --> 04:42:09.540
[Guest]: Art should not be like, oh, I only draw when I'm I don't believe all that stuff.

04:42:09.540 --> 04:42:11.640
[Guest]: And look at the self improvement aspect.

04:42:11.640 --> 04:42:13.780
[Amit Varma]: The more I draw people, the better I get.

04:42:13.780 --> 04:42:14.780
[Amit Varma]: It's a good exercise.

04:42:14.780 --> 04:42:15.780
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

04:42:15.780 --> 04:42:16.780
[Guest]: I want to get better at drawing portraits.

04:42:16.780 --> 04:42:17.940
[Guest]: Hey, let's draw portraits.

04:42:17.940 --> 04:42:18.940
[Guest]: Stand for me.

04:42:18.940 --> 04:42:19.940
[Guest]: Let's talk.

04:42:19.940 --> 04:42:21.660
[Guest]: And I'm talking to them for five minutes while I draw right.

04:42:21.660 --> 04:42:22.780
[Guest]: They're not silent.

04:42:22.780 --> 04:42:23.780
[Guest]: This is engagement.

04:42:23.780 --> 04:42:25.020
[Guest]: This creates deep.

04:42:25.020 --> 04:42:29.380
[Guest]: These people would become repeat customers by every commission me for art afterwards

04:42:29.380 --> 04:42:33.500
[Guest]: that I love this drawing you made of me in the book, I want you to draw a family portrait

04:42:33.500 --> 04:42:37.180
[Guest]: for me that I will send out as a Christmas card or whatever.

04:42:37.180 --> 04:42:40.060
[Guest]: So this is how I formed a bond with them.

04:42:40.060 --> 04:42:41.780
[Guest]: I had real conversations with them.

04:42:41.780 --> 04:42:42.780
[Guest]: Tell me about your life.

04:42:42.780 --> 04:42:44.040
[Guest]: What brought you down here?

04:42:44.040 --> 04:42:45.040
[Guest]: How are you doing today?

04:42:45.040 --> 04:42:46.040
[Guest]: Like what?

04:42:46.040 --> 04:42:47.040
[Guest]: What?

04:42:47.040 --> 04:42:48.700
[Guest]: Which cheese are you going to buy next door?

04:42:48.700 --> 04:42:49.700
[Guest]: Things like this.

04:42:49.700 --> 04:42:54.140
[Guest]: So the experience around this doing a launch event, being an introvert and doing a launch

04:42:54.140 --> 04:42:55.140
[Guest]: event.

04:42:55.140 --> 04:42:56.140
[Guest]: Wow.

04:42:56.140 --> 04:42:57.140
[Guest]: Super difficult.

04:42:57.140 --> 04:42:58.140
[Guest]: But you need to do this, right?

04:42:58.140 --> 04:42:59.780
[Guest]: You need to push out of these.

04:42:59.780 --> 04:43:02.100
[Guest]: You can't be locked inside your comfort zones.

04:43:02.100 --> 04:43:06.860
[Guest]: I have held this idea with me for a very long time that, you know, everything good is outside

04:43:06.860 --> 04:43:08.200
[Guest]: my comfort zone.

04:43:08.200 --> 04:43:12.260
[Guest]: My comfort zone is my coffin in a sense, like I'm just comfortable here.

04:43:12.260 --> 04:43:14.740
[Guest]: But this is not the place for me to exist.

04:43:14.740 --> 04:43:18.140
[Guest]: Even if just a little outside, I have to be outside it.

04:43:18.140 --> 04:43:19.460
[Amit Varma]: Who's comfortable in a coffin?

04:43:19.460 --> 04:43:20.460
[Amit Varma]: But I get your point.

04:43:20.460 --> 04:43:22.460
[Amit Varma]: No, it is not comfortable in a coffin.

04:43:22.460 --> 04:43:23.460
[Amit Varma]: I get your point.

04:43:23.460 --> 04:43:24.860
[Amit Varma]: You're making separate points.

04:43:24.860 --> 04:43:27.260
[Guest]: It is my comfort zone and it is the death of me.

04:43:27.260 --> 04:43:28.260
[Guest]: It is the death of me.

04:43:28.260 --> 04:43:29.260
[Guest]: Exactly.

04:43:29.260 --> 04:43:31.620
[Guest]: This is where everything finishes if I stay there.

04:43:31.620 --> 04:43:36.820
[Guest]: So doing these things gave me so much confidence.

04:43:36.820 --> 04:43:45.260
[Guest]: Like I know that in Bombay, in Delhi, in Calcutta, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in Chicago, USA,

04:43:45.260 --> 04:43:47.260
[Guest]: in Vancouver, Canada.

04:43:47.260 --> 04:43:51.700
[Guest]: I can do an event anywhere and I can get a hundred people to come to look at me, to talk

04:43:51.700 --> 04:43:53.700
[Guest]: to me, to listen to me, and I can talk to them.

04:43:53.700 --> 04:43:54.700
[Guest]: I did that.

04:43:54.700 --> 04:43:55.700
[Guest]: I introduced my book.

04:43:55.700 --> 04:43:59.740
[Guest]: I did a presentation, PowerPoint slide of the book, and I talked about my book for half

04:43:59.740 --> 04:44:00.740
[Guest]: an hour.

04:44:00.740 --> 04:44:05.180
[Guest]: I answered questions, all impromptu, because I need to go through this exercise.

04:44:05.180 --> 04:44:08.820
[Guest]: I need to go through this tough stuff that I don't know how to do, because then I will

04:44:08.820 --> 04:44:09.820
[Guest]: be a superman.

04:44:09.820 --> 04:44:13.540
[Guest]: The superman of Malegaon.

04:44:13.540 --> 04:44:16.660
[Guest]: It was so good to do this, like so much value.

04:44:16.660 --> 04:44:17.900
[Guest]: Monetary value is there.

04:44:17.900 --> 04:44:21.140
[Guest]: And this is a monetary value that you will not get as a traditional publisher.

04:44:21.140 --> 04:44:26.740
[Guest]: You will get your advance against royalties, but they don't tell you your sales.

04:44:26.740 --> 04:44:30.700
[Guest]: They don't tell you, like, you don't find out until you hit a big number that there

04:44:30.700 --> 04:44:32.700
[Guest]: are royalties coming to you.

04:44:32.700 --> 04:44:34.740
[Guest]: Who knows how much transparency there is?

04:44:34.740 --> 04:44:37.660
[Guest]: Who is to ensure there is honesty in this system?

04:44:37.660 --> 04:44:39.320
[Guest]: It is just insane.

04:44:39.320 --> 04:44:42.100
[Guest]: So what this does in my case is, now it's been two years, right?

04:44:42.100 --> 04:44:46.460
[Guest]: Like you mentioned, two months after the podcast release, you will have moved on, right?

04:44:46.460 --> 04:44:48.300
[Guest]: I have 100 copies left of my book.

04:44:48.300 --> 04:44:50.580
[Guest]: I have purposely not sold them.

04:44:50.580 --> 04:44:52.780
[Guest]: Because the more time I keep them, the more they increase.

04:44:52.780 --> 04:44:56.260
[Guest]: And today I sell that book of $30 at $50.

04:44:56.260 --> 04:44:57.260
[Guest]: Because the value has increased.

04:44:57.260 --> 04:44:58.260
[Amit Varma]: My value has increased.

04:44:58.260 --> 04:45:02.020
[Guest]: So the last copy you have will be like a couple of million and Elon Musk will buy it.

04:45:02.020 --> 04:45:04.700
[Guest]: And you will say, I have never called him a fool.

04:45:04.700 --> 04:45:05.700
[Guest]: Exactly.

04:45:05.700 --> 04:45:08.460
[Guest]: So I will always hold on to the last 10 books.

04:45:08.460 --> 04:45:11.220
[Guest]: For this reason, this is my first book.

04:45:11.220 --> 04:45:13.840
[Guest]: It's always going to have more and more and more value.

04:45:13.840 --> 04:45:15.300
[Guest]: Today I'm selling according to my worth.

04:45:15.300 --> 04:45:17.780
[Guest]: So my worth right now for the book is $50.

04:45:17.780 --> 04:45:21.020
[Guest]: Next year, it's going to rise again, inflationary times, unfortunately.

04:45:21.020 --> 04:45:24.300
[Guest]: But my point is that I am always incentivized to sell this book.

04:45:24.300 --> 04:45:26.060
[Guest]: But outside of this particular example.

04:45:26.060 --> 04:45:30.200
[Guest]: So now when we are talking about scaling, and you're talking about other things.

04:45:30.200 --> 04:45:34.100
[Guest]: So firstly, I want to put it to you that the idea of scaling again brings us back to the

04:45:34.100 --> 04:45:36.060
[Guest]: old idea of a book.

04:45:36.060 --> 04:45:37.820
[Guest]: Let it not scale.

04:45:37.820 --> 04:45:40.660
[Guest]: You are talking about having value as a writer.

04:45:40.660 --> 04:45:43.740
[Guest]: Value as a writer does not exist in the printed form alone.

04:45:43.740 --> 04:45:46.380
[Guest]: Let the printed book never scale.

04:45:46.380 --> 04:45:49.300
[Guest]: Let it always be 1000 copies.

04:45:49.300 --> 04:45:53.980
[Guest]: Let those 1000 copies be like the first edition of Charles Dickens.

04:45:53.980 --> 04:45:58.000
[Guest]: Let all the second and third and fourth editions exist digitally, because that's why your audience

04:45:58.000 --> 04:45:59.000
[Guest]: is reading.

04:45:59.000 --> 04:46:00.000
[Guest]: Why not?

04:46:00.000 --> 04:46:01.000
[Amit Varma]: There are now on...

04:46:01.000 --> 04:46:04.900
[Amit Varma]: That's actually not true, because people thought Kindle will kill print publishing.

04:46:04.900 --> 04:46:07.820
[Amit Varma]: I thought certainly, but that's turned out to be not the case.

04:46:07.820 --> 04:46:10.500
[Guest]: No, no, I'm not saying that there is no money in the other thing.

04:46:10.500 --> 04:46:15.140
[Guest]: I'm saying that you do not have to subscribe to that model as the only way to make money.

04:46:15.140 --> 04:46:19.340
[Guest]: I'm saying that if you don't want to do traditional publishing, it's not that now you can't make

04:46:19.340 --> 04:46:21.020
[Guest]: money if you don't scale.

04:46:21.020 --> 04:46:25.020
[Guest]: There are many ways to make money without scaling in printed form.

04:46:25.020 --> 04:46:29.580
[Amit Varma]: But what if a wannabe Chetan Bhagat comes to you and says, I want to scale, which is

04:46:29.580 --> 04:46:30.580
[Amit Varma]: perfectly noble.

04:46:30.580 --> 04:46:31.580
[Guest]: There's nothing wrong with it.

04:46:31.580 --> 04:46:35.320
[Guest]: So then there are so many people doing it on Amazon, there are so many now more services

04:46:35.320 --> 04:46:38.180
[Guest]: coming in also, there are umpteen ways to do it.

04:46:38.180 --> 04:46:42.180
[Guest]: And it's working out really well for lots of artists, lots of writers.

04:46:42.180 --> 04:46:45.980
[Guest]: Another thing people are doing now is they are they are serializing fiction also.

04:46:45.980 --> 04:46:48.940
[Guest]: So Substack is incentivizing this as well.

04:46:48.940 --> 04:46:50.460
[Guest]: And a lot of people are.

04:46:50.460 --> 04:46:56.180
[Guest]: So the model is that suppose you have 50 people who pay you $5 a month.

04:46:56.180 --> 04:47:02.860
[Guest]: So $250 a month for one chapter every month, you will end up making by the end of the book,

04:47:02.860 --> 04:47:05.540
[Guest]: you will make more than you would have gotten as an advance.

04:47:05.540 --> 04:47:09.540
[Guest]: And now you have printed copies that you print yourself to sell to more people.

04:47:09.540 --> 04:47:14.060
[Guest]: Meanwhile, these true fans are your PR, there are lots of you will end up making more money

04:47:14.060 --> 04:47:17.900
[Guest]: this way than you would with a standard advance as a first time author.

04:47:17.900 --> 04:47:20.460
[Guest]: And then all sales are your sales.

04:47:20.460 --> 04:47:25.980
[Guest]: Like the biggest point to me is that once you lose track of these numbers, you don't

04:47:25.980 --> 04:47:30.980
[Guest]: want why would I go to a launch event when I'll never see royalties, like kap dega, kitna

04:47:30.980 --> 04:47:35.260
[Guest]: dega, 10 dollar dega, dega hi nahi, kya pata, why would I do like I will lose interest and

04:47:35.260 --> 04:47:36.980
[Guest]: I will move on to my next book.

04:47:36.980 --> 04:47:40.860
[Guest]: But with the book I have, I always want to sell it because it's my money.

04:47:40.860 --> 04:47:41.860
[Guest]: It's my idea.

04:47:41.860 --> 04:47:42.860
[Guest]: It's my pitch.

04:47:42.860 --> 04:47:43.860
[Guest]: It's my thing.

04:47:43.860 --> 04:47:44.860
[Guest]: That makes me very proud.

04:47:44.860 --> 04:47:47.900
[Guest]: It comes with my inclinations and my personality.

04:47:47.900 --> 04:47:50.860
[Guest]: Maybe there are people who just simply don't want to indulge in these factors.

04:47:50.860 --> 04:47:53.220
[Guest]: And for them, the traditional path will always exist.

04:47:53.220 --> 04:47:54.820
[Guest]: It doesn't have to be one or the other.

04:47:54.820 --> 04:48:01.020
[Guest]: The beauty is that now there are options and options are good for everybody.

04:48:01.020 --> 04:48:07.220
[Guest]: Because once serialization starts to work, once independent people explore formats, then

04:48:07.220 --> 04:48:13.540
[Guest]: maybe publishers also these the dinosaurs also decide that achcha kuchh naya karte hain

04:48:13.540 --> 04:48:15.860
[Guest]: because this has been proven as a working model.

04:48:15.860 --> 04:48:18.460
[Guest]: And that becomes good for people who do the traditional route.

04:48:18.460 --> 04:48:19.460
[Guest]: Maybe they have more flexibility.

04:48:19.460 --> 04:48:23.300
[Guest]: 150,000 words nahi kar paya, chota hi kar rahe hain.

04:48:23.300 --> 04:48:24.700
[Guest]: Maybe that works out.

04:48:24.700 --> 04:48:29.940
[Guest]: So I feel like it's good times like I think it's it's and it's good to play games.

04:48:29.940 --> 04:48:34.460
[Guest]: So I just tell people like you should play games like what is it like don't put such

04:48:34.460 --> 04:48:40.620
[Guest]: a high premium on the act of doing something on the written word or the drawing like I'll

04:48:40.620 --> 04:48:46.180
[Guest]: only draw if I have my canvas and if I have all my paints no just be open just draw you're

04:48:46.180 --> 04:48:50.940
[Amit Varma]: a creative person play the game chatting with a publisher friend of mine who editor at this

04:48:50.940 --> 04:48:55.420
[Amit Varma]: large publishing house got a CEO on a call with me because they wanted to kind of think

04:48:55.420 --> 04:49:00.180
[Amit Varma]: about the creator economy a little bit and spoke to them for an hour give them a half

04:49:00.180 --> 04:49:04.180
[Amit Varma]: an hour presentation and all my thoughts on it and it's very interesting how open they

04:49:04.180 --> 04:49:10.660
[Amit Varma]: were and my central point was this that publishers today to move into the new age need to not

04:49:10.660 --> 04:49:17.060
[Amit Varma]: think of themselves as producers of this particular kind of package good but need to instead think

04:49:17.060 --> 04:49:23.260
[Amit Varma]: of themselves as custodians of creators who possess enormous knowledge enormous insight

04:49:23.260 --> 04:49:28.820
[Amit Varma]: and that can find many more outlets today than it could in the past and it doesn't have

04:49:28.820 --> 04:49:33.780
[Amit Varma]: to be this 200 page printed book or even a kindle version of that book there are so many

04:49:33.780 --> 04:49:39.540
[Amit Varma]: other ways to look at it and my sense is that the publishing industry as we know it today

04:49:39.540 --> 04:49:44.100
[Amit Varma]: will not exist 20 years later it will have morphed into something else entirely and some

04:49:44.100 --> 04:49:49.420
[Amit Varma]: people will adapt and some people won't so let's see how that goes now speaking of you

04:49:49.420 --> 04:49:52.780
[Amit Varma]: know before we come to the end of this I think this is going to be the longest episode on

04:49:52.780 --> 04:49:57.820
[Amit Varma]: the show so far so congratulations we are crossing five hours so here's the thing that

04:49:57.820 --> 04:50:03.140
[Amit Varma]: we've spoken about how the old model is breaking but it seems to me that a lot of the new model

04:50:03.140 --> 04:50:09.500
[Amit Varma]: is on shaky tenuous ground because it is dependent on these massive internet platforms which

04:50:09.500 --> 04:50:14.660
[Amit Varma]: are Facebook Instagram Twitter which also have big issues with them which behave in

04:50:14.660 --> 04:50:20.220
[Amit Varma]: arbitrary ways and which can make or break creators overnight I know this is something

04:50:20.220 --> 04:50:24.540
[Amit Varma]: that you've kind of spoken a lot about feel strongly about can you elaborate a little

04:50:24.540 --> 04:50:31.060
[Guest]: bit on this for me so about the nature of the big mega corporations well yeah so I had

04:50:31.060 --> 04:50:38.060
[Guest]: a I had a comics Facebook page which had 30,000 fans at one point of time and Facebook decided

04:50:38.060 --> 04:50:43.420
[Guest]: that they want my money now so I would post a drawing on it I would post a comic on it

04:50:43.420 --> 04:50:49.300
[Guest]: and it shows you how many people have viewed it and the number just plummeted to like 100

04:50:49.300 --> 04:50:56.140
[Guest]: if I did well maybe 200 some then it started plummeting to like 50 and lesser numbers like

04:50:56.140 --> 04:51:02.100
[Guest]: that so I would pay money into it and it would suddenly reach 10,000 people and the next

04:51:02.100 --> 04:51:07.500
[Guest]: day if I post it again and I didn't pay money it was back to 50 people so I quickly realized

04:51:07.500 --> 04:51:13.740
[Guest]: that firstly one like they're just extorting me and no matter what I do I can't actually

04:51:13.740 --> 04:51:18.620
[Guest]: just succeed anymore and because they know they've got me now they know that I have nowhere

04:51:18.620 --> 04:51:24.340
[Guest]: else to go and this sort of thing really it puts my back up you know like I I'm not going

04:51:24.340 --> 04:51:29.060
[Guest]: to cooperate anymore so I just I gave up that Facebook page I stopped putting money into

04:51:29.060 --> 04:51:34.500
[Guest]: it like just like I lost fans and whatever but what also happened was that I found that

04:51:34.500 --> 04:51:40.740
[Guest]: it was a no-win situation because not only are they taking my money and then giving access

04:51:40.740 --> 04:51:46.380
[Guest]: to fans but the only way I know who they are giving access to is also them opaque metrics

04:51:46.380 --> 04:51:50.540
[Guest]: I have no way of knowing if 10,000 people saw it it's just what Facebook is saying to

04:51:50.540 --> 04:51:57.660
[Guest]: me Facebook can say anything its idea it changed its definitions of views to impressions and

04:51:57.660 --> 04:52:02.140
[Guest]: it changed the definition of what impressions meant and then it changed how it started counting

04:52:02.140 --> 04:52:06.260
[Guest]: videos and it changed who it would show it to and whether they were relevant to it or

04:52:06.260 --> 04:52:11.340
[Guest]: not all of these things changed very very very quickly and in arbitrary ways and what

04:52:11.340 --> 04:52:18.140
[Guest]: that does is like you feel like you don't know what works you end up chasing after you

04:52:18.140 --> 04:52:21.260
[Guest]: know you're trying to chase after a herd you see something that has gone viral and then

04:52:21.260 --> 04:52:25.620
[Guest]: you're like and then you try to do that and maybe it works for you maybe it doesn't maybe

04:52:25.620 --> 04:52:29.860
[Guest]: it works for you once it doesn't work for you the second time and these are deeply unsettling

04:52:29.860 --> 04:52:35.340
[Guest]: things because it completely messes up the momentum and the journey of a creator if they

04:52:35.340 --> 04:52:39.460
[Guest]: feel like they need to be someone else tomorrow and they need to be that person again day

04:52:39.460 --> 04:52:43.620
[Guest]: after tomorrow and if they take a week then they've lost because the momentum has to stay

04:52:43.620 --> 04:52:47.620
[Guest]: and it has to be quick and it has to be funny and it has to be shorter all of these format

04:52:47.620 --> 04:52:53.900
[Guest]: changes style changes this changes that changes it's very oppressive and it was just the most

04:52:53.900 --> 04:52:58.220
[Guest]: terrible way to do work at that time they still hadn't implemented these policies on

04:52:58.220 --> 04:53:03.780
[Guest]: Instagram so Instagram was a super good medium and they had already bought it but they hadn't

04:53:03.780 --> 04:53:08.940
[Guest]: done these things and I think 2017 onwards they started messing up Instagram algorithms

04:53:08.940 --> 04:53:14.660
[Guest]: as well so I know so many artist friends who have massive followings but they can reach

04:53:14.660 --> 04:53:20.740
[Guest]: maybe 10 maybe 10 maybe 10% like if they're very very lucky they reach 10% of their audience

04:53:20.740 --> 04:53:26.020
[Guest]: and a large part of the audience is bought accounts and those bots are also allowed to

04:53:26.020 --> 04:53:32.420
[Guest]: freely proliferate even when Facebook knows that their bots so you're in this game where

04:53:32.420 --> 04:53:37.820
[Guest]: now that they have complete control over the marketplace they're making you jump invisible

04:53:37.820 --> 04:53:42.460
[Guest]: hoops to reach an audience that they tell you exists but you have no way of actually

04:53:42.460 --> 04:53:48.060
[Guest]: knowing exists and you're creating so much value for their platform but you're not getting

04:53:48.060 --> 04:53:56.580
[Guest]: anything for it Instagram exists because photographers put photos really high quality content artists

04:53:56.580 --> 04:54:02.860
[Guest]: cartoonists without a second thought they switch to videos let or from now it's deals

04:54:02.860 --> 04:54:08.340
[Guest]: they abandoned everybody who made Instagram what it is just overnight it wasn't a journey

04:54:08.340 --> 04:54:16.180
[Guest]: we're on it wasn't a weaning away it was just now it's this deal with it I don't like there's

04:54:16.180 --> 04:54:20.460
[Guest]: a lot of reasons why it had to be this way audiences are doing this audiences care about

04:54:20.460 --> 04:54:26.180
[Guest]: videos but I don't know how like I agree with it and I disagree with it because I don't

04:54:26.180 --> 04:54:30.060
[Guest]: know how valid it is to say that when you are the only people that they can get access

04:54:30.060 --> 04:54:35.140
[Guest]: to things from if you only do this then of course they can only see this now like for

04:54:35.140 --> 04:54:39.500
[Guest]: you to say that this is something that you're getting from the audience is a little unfair

04:54:39.500 --> 04:54:43.940
[Guest]: and it's not it's not so easy to make that statement while it may be true so a part of

04:54:43.940 --> 04:54:48.180
[Guest]: me says that maybe this is how it is and people need to deal with it I think the next step

04:54:48.180 --> 04:54:53.020
[Amit Varma]: that I'd like to see with these platforms is allowing users to choose simple versions

04:54:53.020 --> 04:54:58.120
[Amit Varma]: of algorithms like at one level I get that there is a timeline there is limited space

04:54:58.120 --> 04:55:02.420
[Amit Varma]: on that timeline and therefore they have the power to determine what goes there and one

04:55:02.420 --> 04:55:07.500
[Amit Varma]: day they decide to charge for it on another day like Facebook for example like I post

04:55:07.500 --> 04:55:11.420
[Amit Varma]: there because it's not even a very public thing is for friends and family who never

04:55:11.420 --> 04:55:16.160
[Amit Varma]: see my post because I don't post a picture I post a link so links to any site automatically

04:55:16.160 --> 04:55:20.420
[Amit Varma]: the algorithm ignores which is fine I know what it is it's kind of known to me but what

04:55:20.420 --> 04:55:26.300
[Amit Varma]: would be great is is if users can choose what which algorithm they want to decide the content

04:55:26.300 --> 04:55:30.900
[Amit Varma]: that goes to them so I if I am an Instagram user and I only want to see reels that's up

04:55:30.900 --> 04:55:36.300
[Amit Varma]: to me if I only want to see people I follow that's up to me if I only want to see we'll

04:55:36.300 --> 04:55:40.740
[Amit Varma]: stay in my echo chamber that's fine but if I want diversity that's fine and you know

04:55:40.740 --> 04:55:46.020
[Guest]: rather than this yeah one mega giving this kind of control back to users is what reddit

04:55:46.020 --> 04:55:51.220
[Guest]: does whenever you go to a subreddit you get to choose from so many different characteristics

04:55:51.220 --> 04:55:55.460
[Guest]: you want to see what's new you want to see what is the top you want to see things that

04:55:55.460 --> 04:55:59.780
[Guest]: are hot right now so then that can be something that is one day old and next to it is something

04:55:59.780 --> 04:56:04.140
[Guest]: that is 30 minutes old you get to see things in chronological order you get to see things

04:56:04.140 --> 04:56:09.180
[Guest]: that are controversial so they have not been they have almost as many downwards as upwards

04:56:09.180 --> 04:56:13.460
[Guest]: you get to sort of customize the algorithm in different ways according to how you want

04:56:13.460 --> 04:56:18.160
[Guest]: to do things giving this power to the user is a very big thing and this is something

04:56:18.160 --> 04:56:24.180
[Guest]: that these giants don't do because their revenue model is based on controlling the feed and

04:56:24.180 --> 04:56:28.940
[Guest]: showing you ads and taking you on this journey that they want to take you on so this giving

04:56:28.940 --> 04:56:34.300
[Guest]: power back is something that's antithetical to that idea but this is why it's it's the

04:56:34.300 --> 04:56:37.540
[Guest]: reason why people are jaded it's the reason why people keep scrolling it's the reason

04:56:37.540 --> 04:56:43.540
[Guest]: why attention is falling and it's also the reason why people are exploring new media

04:56:43.540 --> 04:56:49.620
[Guest]: now so podcasts are here because people are not getting conversations in other places

04:56:49.620 --> 04:56:55.980
[Guest]: that they want and newsletters because we want to read we want to give it time but simply

04:56:55.980 --> 04:57:02.020
[Guest]: the platform doesn't support it and an inbox is still chronological so far yeah yeah a

04:57:02.020 --> 04:57:08.020
[Amit Varma]: greater level of personalization maybe by 2030 so you know before we end this effort

04:57:08.020 --> 04:57:11.940
[Amit Varma]: you know listeners who are wondering how we got together to record in person Nishant came

04:57:11.940 --> 04:57:16.780
[Amit Varma]: all the way from Vancouver to Mumbai just to record with me in my home studio well not

04:57:16.780 --> 04:57:20.820
[Amit Varma]: quite he came to India and then he came to Mumbai too and we are having this recording

04:57:20.820 --> 04:57:25.100
[Amit Varma]: but I'll end the episode with a standard question I ask all my guests recommend some books for

04:57:25.100 --> 04:57:29.220
[Amit Varma]: my listeners and indeed for me like books that shaped you that changed the way you look

04:57:29.220 --> 04:57:33.820
[Amit Varma]: at the world or even books that you are so excited about at this moment in time that

04:57:33.820 --> 04:57:37.620
[Amit Varma]: you want to stand on a table and scream to the world read this read this please read

04:57:37.620 --> 04:57:44.100
[Guest]: right yeah sure fiction has been a big part of my life and I think we do such a disservice

04:57:44.100 --> 04:57:48.820
[Guest]: when people say that fiction is less important than non-fiction stories are the most important

04:57:48.820 --> 04:57:54.900
[Guest]: things in the world so the latest really cool fiction I read was Ted Chiang's exhalation

04:57:54.900 --> 04:58:01.860
[Guest]: those stories and the futurism of his stories actually has wedded me to the idea of certain

04:58:01.860 --> 04:58:06.580
[Guest]: inevitable technologies more than any amount of non-fiction newsletters that I would read

04:58:06.580 --> 04:58:10.700
[Guest]: advocating or pitching those technologies because once you have a story telling you

04:58:10.700 --> 04:58:17.260
[Guest]: something then you can see the world and then things become more concrete so that's a new

04:58:17.260 --> 04:58:21.260
[Guest]: thing that I read that I really want to recommend but I think everybody in the world should

04:58:21.260 --> 04:58:25.860
[Guest]: read Kurt Vonnegut to be a better human I think everybody should read Slaughterhouse

04:58:25.860 --> 04:58:31.180
[Guest]: Five and Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titan and Breakfast of Champions and all his other

04:58:31.180 --> 04:58:36.460
[Guest]: books he's just simply the one of the greatest writers ever we all grew up on British fiction

04:58:36.460 --> 04:58:42.380
[Guest]: in India Kurt Vonnegut taught me that you don't have to say very much to punch someone

04:58:42.380 --> 04:58:47.540
[Guest]: in the gut or to really just just move them beyond anything else you can do it with one

04:58:47.540 --> 04:58:54.220
[Guest]: paragraph with five word sentences another author who did this to me like just unexpectedly

04:58:54.220 --> 04:58:59.380
[Guest]: brilliant and insane and crazy was Joseph Heller for Catch-22 and I think everybody

04:58:59.380 --> 04:59:06.140
[Guest]: should read Catch-22 because the world is absurd and if this the world of Catch-22 seems

04:59:06.140 --> 04:59:11.620
[Guest]: absurd to you then reality is a little bit more absurd than that and some of the greatest

04:59:11.620 --> 04:59:16.900
[Guest]: passages that I've ever read in my life are from Catch-22 including there's this one passage

04:59:16.900 --> 04:59:23.380
[Guest]: which there's a character called Dunbar he is trying to do boring things and I'm paraphrasing

04:59:23.380 --> 04:59:27.220
[Guest]: I'm not quoting at all I'll just tell you what happens is that this other character

04:59:27.220 --> 04:59:31.820
[Guest]: is telling him why are you doing these silly boring things and he's saying that I'm trying

04:59:31.820 --> 04:59:39.460
[Guest]: to stretch time and he asks him why he's doing that and he says because I'm very old he's

04:59:39.460 --> 04:59:43.540
[Guest]: like you're not old you're young like me we're in the air forces they're in the air force

04:59:43.540 --> 04:59:50.060
[Guest]: and a second world war so you're not old and he says how much older could I be at my age

04:59:50.060 --> 04:59:59.500
[Guest]: every time we fly we are close to death how much older could I be at my age and he tells

04:59:59.500 --> 05:00:05.740
[Guest]: him that a long life the only way that he sees to have a long life is to fill it with

05:00:05.740 --> 05:00:12.560
[Guest]: boring moments and dull moments so he does dull and boring things and the other guy says

05:00:12.560 --> 05:00:20.340
[Guest]: but then in that case why would you want such a life and Dunbar says what else is there

05:00:20.340 --> 05:00:28.660
[Guest]: and Joseph Heller in Catch-22 does this to you he he gives you these ideas which just

05:00:28.660 --> 05:00:32.860
[Guest]: it take you apart suddenly they just break you down completely and you understand so

05:00:32.860 --> 05:00:37.660
[Guest]: much so everybody should read that graphic novels graphic novels are super important

05:00:37.660 --> 05:00:43.420
[Guest]: to me I think Alan Moore is one of the greatest people alive and everybody should especially

05:00:43.420 --> 05:00:48.660
[Guest]: now everybody should read V for Vendetta it's so important everybody should read Watchmen

05:00:48.660 --> 05:00:55.240
[Guest]: it's so important when with our ideas of what heroes are in nonfiction I think I've read

05:00:55.240 --> 05:00:59.540
[Guest]: some interesting things this year that I really liked I've always wanted to read philosophy

05:00:59.540 --> 05:01:04.220
[Guest]: but I find it very difficult and so I reached out to our writing group and I asked for ideas

05:01:04.220 --> 05:01:09.300
[Guest]: for ways that I could read about philosophy without reading the work of philosophers they

05:01:09.300 --> 05:01:14.460
[Guest]: recommended at the existentialist cafe by Sarah Bakewell and that was a brilliant brilliant

05:01:14.460 --> 05:01:19.500
[Guest]: book and I love it and I tell people to read it the other big book that really mattered

05:01:19.500 --> 05:01:23.860
[Guest]: to me and which makes me think about so this idea of the worlds that we were talking about

05:01:23.860 --> 05:01:30.740
[Guest]: in Twitter as well comes from Francis Fukuyama's identity and the way that we perceive ourselves

05:01:30.740 --> 05:01:35.060
[Guest]: the tribes that we think we belong to and we want to belong to and the idea even of

05:01:35.060 --> 05:01:40.980
[Guest]: not belonging to a tribe so even I how I feel like you see yourself like you want to not

05:01:40.980 --> 05:01:49.140
[Guest]: associate with tribes and that is also a consequence of of this age giving space to that idea in

05:01:49.140 --> 05:01:55.140
[Guest]: our minds and I have felt that for the longest time in my life but that book and I have felt

05:01:55.140 --> 05:01:58.620
[Guest]: this way that I don't want to have allegiance to any tribe and I don't want to have any

05:01:58.620 --> 05:02:04.340
[Guest]: labels that people can stick on me I am just me but that book allowed me to think about

05:02:04.340 --> 05:02:09.540
[Guest]: why other people are in other ways and what are their motivations and incentives and that

05:02:09.540 --> 05:02:17.180
[Guest]: was very useful to do what else I love history I love reading about history I read William

05:02:17.180 --> 05:02:24.260
[Guest]: Dalrymple's the Anarchy recently that I loved but also Roman history so I read Tom Holland's

05:02:24.260 --> 05:02:29.660
[Guest]: Caesar which was the time of the Republic being in danger and becoming a monarchy in

05:02:29.660 --> 05:02:35.180
[Guest]: lots of de facto ways and the five Caesars who ruled the family of Caesar that it became

05:02:35.180 --> 05:02:40.780
[Guest]: the house of Caesar and how that played out for like 200 years for Rome it has a lot of

05:02:40.780 --> 05:02:46.680
[Guest]: lessons for us and it's riveting and fantastic like the kind of things that happened so yeah

05:02:46.680 --> 05:02:51.980
[Amit Varma]: that fantastic recommendations in fact speaking of Fukuyama his two-volume book on the evolution

05:02:51.980 --> 05:02:56.100
[Amit Varma]: of the state it's just mind-blowing if you haven't read that already but takes a lot

05:02:56.100 --> 05:03:00.020
[Amit Varma]: of time to get through so thank you so much you remember Sergei Bubka a little before

05:03:00.020 --> 05:03:04.620
[Amit Varma]: your time 1980s pole vaulter won a bunch of Olympic golds oh right yeah so what Bubka

05:03:04.620 --> 05:03:08.340
[Amit Varma]: would do is that he broke the world record and then he broke the world record many many

05:03:08.340 --> 05:03:13.180
[Amit Varma]: times now the funda was that his sponsors or the Soviet Union or whatever would give

05:03:13.180 --> 05:03:17.540
[Amit Varma]: him a bonus every time he broke the world record so he would make sure that he doesn't

05:03:17.540 --> 05:03:22.020
[Amit Varma]: break the world record by too much so he can break it again by a little bit so what we

05:03:22.020 --> 05:03:26.060
[Amit Varma]: have done is we have broken the world record for the longest scene unseen episode and we

05:03:26.060 --> 05:03:30.860
[Amit Varma]: could easily talk for another five hours but I'm thinking that you know want to have another

05:03:30.860 --> 05:03:34.900
[Amit Varma]: yeah let me otherwise it'll be very hard for me to do a 10-hour episode with someone else

05:03:34.900 --> 05:03:39.340
[Amit Varma]: so you know let me have the satisfaction of making this at some point as well so thank

05:03:39.340 --> 05:03:43.180
[Guest]: you so much for being so patient thank you for having me like I wanted to tell you at

05:03:43.180 --> 05:03:48.700
[Guest]: the start what you've done is a very terrible thing that it took me half a decade to get

05:03:48.700 --> 05:03:53.500
[Guest]: over my imposter syndrome and just by inviting me to this podcast you have brought it roaring

05:03:53.500 --> 05:04:00.660
[Guest]: back I'm going to have to deal with the ramifications of that for several months it should be the

05:04:00.660 --> 05:04:04.300
[Amit Varma]: other way around and I think we're both at that stage when this should not matter but

05:04:04.300 --> 05:04:08.940
[Amit Varma]: having said goodbye to you I'll also end it with what will be a treat for my listeners

05:04:08.940 --> 05:04:13.340
[Amit Varma]: as well one of your favorite writers reading one of your favorite poems here's Charles

05:04:13.340 --> 05:04:18.420
[Unknown]: Bukowski with bluebird there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm

05:04:18.420 --> 05:04:25.220
[Unknown]: too tough for him I say stay in there I'm not going to let anybody see you there's a

05:04:25.220 --> 05:04:29.780
[Unknown]: bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I pour whiskey on him and inhale cigarette

05:04:29.780 --> 05:04:35.460
[Unknown]: smoke and the whores and the bartenders and the grocery clerks never know that he's in

05:04:35.460 --> 05:04:41.420
[Unknown]: there there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough for him

05:04:41.420 --> 05:04:47.180
[Unknown]: I say stay down do you want to mess me up do you want to screw up the works you want

05:04:47.180 --> 05:04:53.300
[Unknown]: to blow my book sales in Europe there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out

05:04:53.300 --> 05:04:59.380
[Unknown]: but I'm too clever I only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep I say I

05:04:59.380 --> 05:05:08.220
[Unknown]: know you're there so don't be sad then I put him back but he's singing a little in there

05:05:08.220 --> 05:05:16.540
[Unknown]: I haven't quite let him die and we sleep together like that with our secret pact and it's nice

05:05:16.540 --> 05:05:25.900
[Unknown]: enough to make a man weep but I don't weep do you

05:05:25.900 --> 05:05:30.060
