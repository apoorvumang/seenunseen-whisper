00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.880
[Guest]: My guest today is Shashi Tharoor and we are going to be talking about his new book, The

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.920
[Guest]: Paradoxical Prime Minister, which focuses on the many contradictions of Narendra Modi.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200
[Guest]: Now, Tharoor is an MP of the Congress Party, so you would expect him to write an anti-Modi

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
[Guest]: book.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.440
[Guest]: But this book isn't simplistic and one-sided at all.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.080
[Guest]: And the facts and arguments in them speak for themselves.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.560
[Guest]: He was very kind to give me an hour of his time on a very busy day for him.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.240
[Guest]: We recorded late at night over Skype and I overshot the time and couldn't ask him all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.580
[Guest]: the questions I wanted to.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.200
[Guest]: But he was very forthright in all his answers to what I did ask.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.720
[Guest]: We don't talk about only Modi in this chat, by the way, but also address multiple questions

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.600
[Guest]: about the nature of our politics, the idea of India and the paradoxes within the Congress

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.120
[Guest]: Party itself.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.160
[Guest]: But before we go to that conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.560
[Guest]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560
[Guest]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.840
[Guest]: Well, worry no more.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.480
[Guest]: Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.480
[Guest]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.380
[Guest]: best artists in India and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.680
[Guest]: These include wearable art like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.520
[Guest]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.160
[Guest]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.240
[Guest]: and artists get royalties on sale, just like authors do.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.040
[Guest]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.640
[Guest]: with some stunning motifs and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.440
[Guest]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo X Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.040
[Guest]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson and Pradeep Mishra.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.480
[Guest]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting, but even if you want to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.280
[Guest]: buy just for yourself or a friend, head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.480
[Guest]: That's colors with an OU.

[Guest]: And if you want a 20% discount, apply the code IVM20.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280
[Guest]: That's IVM for IVM podcast.

[Guest]: IVM20 for a 20% discount at IndianColors.com.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Tharoor, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Yes, hi, how are you?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.640
[Guest]: I mean, good to good to be with you.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640
[Guest]: Thanks so much.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.840
[Guest]: And I requested this interview really to talk about your wonderful book, The Paradoxical

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.520
[Guest]: Prime Minister, which I enjoyed reading a lot.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.200
[Guest]: But as it happens, we are recording on January 2nd.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.640
[Guest]: And yesterday, Mr. Modi gave a rather paradoxical interview as well.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.960
[Guest]: What did you think of that?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, I have to confess that I was actually doing something else myself and didn't watch

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.640
[Amit Varma]: But I read the excerpts in the newspapers and I've now got hold of the transcript, which

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.840
[Amit Varma]: I haven't fully read.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm a bit taken aback by both his very defensive tone and his the fact that he actually didn't

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.560
[Amit Varma]: offer any new compelling reasons why we should, as Indian voters, want to reward him for his

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.080
[Amit Varma]: five years in office.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all the Achyutini promise haven't come for anybody.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.520
[Amit Varma]: He is defensive about demonetization, which was a disaster for large numbers of our population.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And some of the vainglorious boasts about the love of crores of people for him make

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.480
[Amit Varma]: me wonder whether he's living in his own bubble and doesn't see the damage he's done in this

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480
[Amit Varma]: country.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And that's perceived by the voters of this country.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.680
[Guest]: One of the things that struck me about your book was the title of the book, where you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.200
[Guest]: called it the paradoxical prime minister and not the hypocritical prime minister, which

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.400
[Guest]: seems to indicate that you sort of gave him the benefit of the doubt to start with.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.000
[Guest]: And you yourself were befuddled by kind of what went wrong.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.200
[Guest]: So can you tell me a little bit about your journey of how you looked at Narendra Modi

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200
[Amit Varma]: over time?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.300
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, as I've described in the book, I mean, I obviously when I was in the States

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.000
[Amit Varma]: when 2002 happened, and I shared everybody's anger and shame and revulsion at the horrors

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.520
[Amit Varma]: that were perpetrated in Gujarat in 2002, and therefore the fact that Narendra Modi

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.200
[Amit Varma]: had presided over all of this and in many accounts was seen as culpable for having encouraged

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.440
[Amit Varma]: some of the worst elements, all of that made me look at him as scant.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.600
[Amit Varma]: I therefore didn't ever make any effort to meet him and met him entirely by accident,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of backstage at a lunch at the Prabhasi Bharatiya Divas in Chennai in January of 2009,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.880
[Amit Varma]: and was very pleasantly surprised because he was impressive, he was engaging, and what

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.600
[Amit Varma]: he had to say was not stuff that I could have expected from the, shall we say, the accounts

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.640
[Amit Varma]: of him that had demonized him.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.200
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if you want me to recount one of the tales, but I mean, I remember saying

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.240
[Amit Varma]: to him, for example, you know, why did you allow all this to happen?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And he said, I did everything I could.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.080
[Amit Varma]: I called in the army.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.080
[Amit Varma]: When there was no joy in that, I then went on to, you know, what the situation is today

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.880
[Amit Varma]: for Muslims in Gujarat.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.600
[Amit Varma]: I said, I believe a sort of ghetto has been created, a sort of mini Pakistan, as people

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.320
[Amit Varma]: call it, and is that healthy for the future of Gujarat?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And he said, they prefer it that way.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.400
[Amit Varma]: So that conversation wasn't going anywhere else, and then I said, well, look, you know,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.040
[Amit Varma]: one of the concerns is that you're not doing anything for Muslims in Gujarat in the aftermath

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040
[Amit Varma]: of all of this.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And he said, let me tell you a story.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And he said, you know, this is exactly the charge that was laid on me by a commission

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.440
[Amit Varma]: that had come from Delhi.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.840
[Amit Varma]: I assume this was the Sachar commission, but he didn't use the term.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.920
[Amit Varma]: And he said, these people came and they came to my office and they said, we hear you've

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.120
[Amit Varma]: done nothing for Muslims in Gujarat.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.640
[Amit Varma]: So he said, sit down and write.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.400
[Amit Varma]: And he said, they all took out their notebooks and their pens very dutifully.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And I looked at them and I said, you write, I'm saying this, I have done nothing for Muslims

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200
[Amit Varma]: in Gujarat.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And he says, they took out their pens and their notebooks and they started writing furiously

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.540
[Amit Varma]: that I've done nothing for Muslims in Gujarat.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.540
[Amit Varma]: And he's a very good storyteller.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.540
[Amit Varma]: So he paused dramatically.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And then he said, write this also.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.020
[Amit Varma]: I have done nothing for Hindus in Gujarat.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And then as they also looked up with surprise, he said, I have only worked for Gujaratis.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, I must say, that was a very effective story.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.000
[Amit Varma]: It's the kind of message you expect from a secular political leader.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And I thought that was a that was a.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.920
[Amit Varma]: So I went to a feeling there was something here about this guy that perhaps the earlier

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.960
[Amit Varma]: accounts of his conduct in 2002 and so on had not captured.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.760
[Amit Varma]: And then I saw another side of him, which I couldn't and my lawyers won't allow me to

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.040
[Amit Varma]: be explicit about what it was he said.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.160
[Amit Varma]: But when I was minister of state for external affairs a few months after this episode, less

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.960
[Amit Varma]: than a year after this episode, the UAE authorities in the country I was visiting asked me to

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.360
[Amit Varma]: intervene on an unusual problem they were having, which was that their company, Dubai

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.520
[Amit Varma]: Ports World, had bought up the British company P&O, which is managing a number of Indian

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520
[Amit Varma]: ports.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.040
[Amit Varma]: So all the contracts had to be rewritten to change P&O to Dubai Ports World.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.360
[Amit Varma]: It was basically the same people, the same staff and managers, but it was merely a legal

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360
[Amit Varma]: exercise.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.440
[Amit Varma]: And whereas in every state it had worked very smoothly, in Gujarat they were having a problem.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.640
[Amit Varma]: And could I do something about it?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.560
[Amit Varma]: So I, taking advantage of this earlier encounter with him in January, I called Narendra Modi,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560
[Amit Varma]: chief minister of Gujarat.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.880
[Amit Varma]: He was very prompt in taking the call.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.200
[Amit Varma]: And I said, look, this is what I'm doing.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm in the UAE on official visit.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And there seems to be this problem, you know.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.960
[Amit Varma]: It's a very routine matter.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960
[Amit Varma]: What's the issue here?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Why can't we just sign this and get it done with?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.840
[Amit Varma]: And he said something which, as I said, I'm not allowed legally to quote, but which made

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.680
[Amit Varma]: it very clear that he was not going to do so.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.880
[Amit Varma]: And he explained, he said, if you want the UAE to invest in my states, by all means,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.360
[Amit Varma]: tell them to come to the interior and I will give them land and electricity and good roads

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.960
[Amit Varma]: and drinking water and all the connections they want.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.640
[Amit Varma]: But I will not be giving them a port because I don't want to have Islamic terrorists running

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640
[Amit Varma]: around my state.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:05.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, this kind of thinking, this kind of talk was, to my mind, somewhat more revelatory

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.520
[Amit Varma]: of the Narendra Modi who I'd heard less sort of flattering things about.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.560
[Amit Varma]: And then, of course, we had the Narendra Modi of the election campaign a few years later,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.080
[Amit Varma]: the man who became the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, having really built up a reputation

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:29.960
[Amit Varma]: for somewhat incendiary campaigning in Gujarat that was hostile to minorities, that was hostile

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.640
[Amit Varma]: to that was very overtly Hindutva oriented.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And then he starts, particularly in the immediate aftermath of his victory, saying the most

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.160
[Amit Varma]: amazingly liberal things, the sabka saad, sabka vikas, for instance, or the assurance

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.000
[Amit Varma]: that I will be a prime minister for all Indians, or saying that the Constitution is my only

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.840
[Amit Varma]: holy book and the parliament is the temple of democracy, moving away from that aggressively

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.080
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva identity he had earlier cultivated.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.720
[Amit Varma]: And so, yes, I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt at that time, because

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.720
[Amit Varma]: my view was that, first of all, one has to respect the electorate, which has put him

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.040
[Amit Varma]: there and they've just put him there.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.400
[Amit Varma]: We can't act as if we have contempt for their electoral votes.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.120
[Amit Varma]: But equally, by applauding the sentiments that he's expressing, we are now laying very

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.320
[Amit Varma]: clearly the yardstick by which his future action should be judged.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.760
[Amit Varma]: We are applauding these things that you have said, these liberal pronouncements, and we

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.480
[Amit Varma]: will judge you by your ability to fulfill and live up to these yardsticks, these liberal

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.800
[Amit Varma]: pronouncements.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.960
[Amit Varma]: That was the spirit in which I welcomed his initial remarks.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, it wasn't very well understood in my own party, and I was pilloried and so

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.520
[Amit Varma]: on by many.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.040
[Amit Varma]: But within six months of his assent, I had recanted.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.440
[Amit Varma]: I published a book called India Shastra, Reflections on the Nation in Our Time, in December 2014.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.640
[Amit Varma]: I think the copyright page for publishers reads as January 2015.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But in that I wrote, in the introduction to what was a collection of essays that had been

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.520
[Amit Varma]: published over the preceding six or seven years, in the introduction I wrote that Mr.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.560
[Amit Varma]: Modi really represents a contradiction because he says all these very liberal things, but

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.720
[Amit Varma]: he rests for political support and viability on the most illiberal elements in Indian society,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.800
[Amit Varma]: the RSS types, the Hindutva types, the anti-science, the rewriting history elements, all of these

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.560
[Amit Varma]: because they love jihadis and the ghar wapasi types, all of whom had emerged from the woodwork

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.560
[Amit Varma]: in those first few months.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And I said that in this contradiction may lie the seeds of his future failure.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.720
[Amit Varma]: And this was published in December 2014.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.040
[Amit Varma]: So when I wrote the paradoxical Prime Minister, I was able to begin with the words, I told

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.320
[Amit Varma]: you so.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And to that degree, my own journey, as you put it, Amit, had in a sense been vindicated,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
[Amit Varma]: almost as if Mr. Modi spent four years proving me right.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.800
[Guest]: Which is very gracious of him.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.320
[Guest]: And in your book, you do a beautiful job of documenting, you know, the various paradoxical

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.320
[Guest]: aspects of Modi.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.400
[Guest]: You know, I noted down nine of them while reading the book.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.760
[Guest]: But before I ask you about them, I want to ask you some broader questions about broader

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.200
[Guest]: paradoxes to do with politics and India.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:28.680
[Guest]: And the first of those is that it has always seemed to me that the imperatives of politics

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:35.680
[Guest]: make it impossible for anyone who enters politics to actually hold on to whatever principles

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680
[Guest]: they might have.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.240
[Guest]: Because once you enter politics, you have to make compromises, you have to cater to

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.600
[Guest]: your interest groups who fund you, you have to cater to different vote banks.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.640
[Guest]: And you have to, you know, cynically pursue the end over the means.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.160
[Guest]: And it can even be morally corrosive.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.400
[Guest]: Now, as someone who himself has had a very distinguished career in public life at the

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.480
[Guest]: UN and as a novelist and a writer, and who joined politics rather late, is that something

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.200
[Guest]: you'd have any views on?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.640
[Guest]: Is it really what are the tugs on the pulse like?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.760
[Amit Varma]: So what you said is right, that to a great extent, any democratically elected politician

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.280
[Amit Varma]: has to be responsive to voters, to backers, to funders, all of these sources, everything

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.120
[Amit Varma]: you said is true.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.840
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't mean you sell your soul, because if you did, then what are you contributing

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.000
[Amit Varma]: to the nation's political values and the political discourse?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.760
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me that something I realized even at the UN was that you had to have ideals.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.640
[Amit Varma]: If you didn't have ideals, you shouldn't be at the UN because you may as well go off and

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.240
[Amit Varma]: be a banker or a lawyer or an accountant or whatever else, where you can mortgage your

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.600
[Amit Varma]: ideals to the service of your client and merely judge your success by the bottom line in your

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600
[Amit Varma]: bank account.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.200
[Amit Varma]: But if you are in an organization like the UN, and the same logic applies to politics,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.560
[Amit Varma]: you must have ideals, you must have principles, you must have things you seek to pursue, but

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.360
[Amit Varma]: you must have the maturity and the wisdom to realize you can only pursue them within

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.640
[Amit Varma]: the limitations of what is politically possible.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.840
[Amit Varma]: So the UN, I had to be responsive to 192 member states and the Security Council, the 15 very

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.240
[Amit Varma]: powerful countries.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.760
[Amit Varma]: I can't sit around acting as if I own the world.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.760
[Amit Varma]: I don't.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.920
[Amit Varma]: I am an employee of the United Nations organization, which is in turn controlled by 192 governments.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.760
[Amit Varma]: And there is an interplay of interests, beliefs, concerns, policy preferences of these governments

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.880
[Amit Varma]: in which I will have to make the right judgment as to what compromises to make.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And the judgments I make are essentially where my values and principles are tested.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.920
[Amit Varma]: Now you apply that logic to Indian politics, what happens is this.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.960
[Amit Varma]: There are some things, for example, that I find I cannot say because they're at variance

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.560
[Amit Varma]: with the policies adopted by my party.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Now if I were completely cynical, I'd swallow my own beliefs and mouth the party line.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:05.080
[Amit Varma]: If I say, look, I understand that it's important for the party to take the stand it's taking.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going to say what I don't believe.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.640
[Amit Varma]: I could have a very different approach in which where I speak, I speak of my own conviction,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.720
[Amit Varma]: and where I can't agree with my party, I just choose to stay silent.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.600
[Amit Varma]: That's one way of limiting the extent to which you're compromising your convictions.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Another example would come from when you're talking about responding to voters.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.520
[Amit Varma]: You listen to your voters.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.360
[Amit Varma]: That is extremely important.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And when you find that your voters feel strongly enough about something, you have all the more

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.600
[Amit Varma]: an obligation to listen to them because you are their representative.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.280
[Amit Varma]: If at the end of the day they personalize you, that their beliefs matter, then you do

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.880
[Amit Varma]: choose to compromise in your position.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Whereas if you find that they are wrongheaded, you can argue to them and try and educate

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.760
[Amit Varma]: them to see things in your point of view.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.840
[Amit Varma]: So I found myself both happening.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:05.400
[Amit Varma]: That is on Section 377, for example, the vast majority of my voters disagreed with me.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.320
[Amit Varma]: And I had to, in various occasions, to people from the church, to people of my voters, explain

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.880
[Amit Varma]: my position on 377.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I took care to stress this is not about sex.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.760
[Amit Varma]: It's about freedom.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.840
[Amit Varma]: It's about the rights of Indian citizens like you and me to be themselves.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.960
[Amit Varma]: And that argument I did not compromise on, even though had there been a poll taken, the

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.280
[Amit Varma]: vast majority of my voters would have been against my stand on Section 377.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.640
[Amit Varma]: But they came around in the end.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.140
[Amit Varma]: And once the court, the Supreme Court, took the decision it did, I actually looked good

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.480
[Amit Varma]: in retrospect in many of their eyes.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.120
[Amit Varma]: Then you take something like Sabarimana, where the vast majority of my constituents disagreed

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.160
[Amit Varma]: with my initial position.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And I came around to the realization that I had been wrong in framing the issue merely

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.360
[Amit Varma]: in terms of my familiar categories of principles of equality and constitutionalism.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And that when you're touching matters of religious faith, you are actually talking about something

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.120
[Amit Varma]: that goes very deep into the heart of people's beliefs and worship.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.880
[Amit Varma]: And so I came around to becoming an explainer of their concerns rather than somebody who

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.600
[Amit Varma]: would have stuck to what all my normal liberal constituency expected of me.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And as a result, of course, I have been denounced by the very people who on most other issues

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.160
[Amit Varma]: I would have seen as my friends.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.020
[Amit Varma]: Would I have come to that conclusion if I had not been an elected political representative

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:41.520
[Amit Varma]: in Kerala, meeting people every day who were expressing the passion of their views?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Very clearly, no.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.360
[Amit Varma]: If I had just been a liberal columnist or writer sitting either in New York or in New

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Delhi, I probably would never have changed my mind on Sabarimana.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:56.220
[Amit Varma]: So their politics did bring about a change, and it's part of the compromise that democratic

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.200
[Amit Varma]: representation involves.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.720
[Amit Varma]: But I don't see myself as having mortgaged my principles.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.500
[Amit Varma]: If their arguments had not convinced me of their own merit, I would not have changed.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.780
[Amit Varma]: But the realization that when you frame the issue as one of sanctity, that you're touching

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.100
[Amit Varma]: on profound matters of faith and of religious practice, that just south of Trivandrum is

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.040
[Amit Varma]: in Kanyakumari, the famous Kumari Amman temple from which Kanyakumari gets its name to the

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.720
[Amit Varma]: virgin form of the goddess, where men are not allowed in the inner sanctum.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.700
[Amit Varma]: And if for thousands of years men have not been allowed there, if you've applied the

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.580
[Amit Varma]: Supreme Court's gender equality principle, men will be able to go there.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.280
[Amit Varma]: And the day a man steps into that sanctum sanctorum, the sanctity of that temple for

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.100
[Amit Varma]: millions of women worshippers is completely destroyed.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.380
[Amit Varma]: And you have to ask yourself as a political representative what is right, the principle

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:53.120
[Amit Varma]: of gender equality or the meaning of this temple as a sanctified place to its believers

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.440
[Amit Varma]: and worshippers?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.800
[Amit Varma]: It becomes a very different debate when you think of it that way.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.560
[Guest]: Yeah, matter of colliding principles.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.560
[Guest]: I completely get that.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.980
[Guest]: And my sort of, I mean, I don't want to derail this by, you know, focusing on Sabarimala.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.840
[Guest]: So just moving on from there, my slightly related question there is that, is it then

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:17.140
[Guest]: entirely fair to judge politicians by how much they implement the promises they might

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.300
[Guest]: have made when the promises could have been fairly high minded?

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.480
[Guest]: But if you consider the incentives, once they get to power, they include in general, two

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.280
[Guest]: particular kinds of incentives, that is incentives of the interest groups, which put them in

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.480
[Guest]: power and which will want them to implement favorable policies.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.240
[Guest]: And number two, the incentives which come from whichever vote banks they might be cultivating,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.280
[Guest]: and their actions might run inimicable to the general interest.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.360
[Guest]: Because, you know, in one case, they'd be working on behalf of interest groups.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.280
[Guest]: On the other hand, they might have to cater to a certain kind of identity politics that

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.040
[Guest]: has dominated our discourse through the decades.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.720
[Guest]: And in the case of Modi, you could argue that there's even a sort of a third force, which

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.520
[Guest]: is the RSS, which he's always been part of, which is exerting its own kind of nativist

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.160
[Guest]: pressures.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.320
[Guest]: And is it even realistic to then assume that all of this high minded liberal talk, as you

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.480
[Guest]: put it, the commitment to pluralism, and so on, can actually, you know, play out in action?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.600
[Guest]: And would anyone in his place be able to do something?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:24.560
[Amit Varma]: OK, so as a general principle, I would say that most of the promises politicians make

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.960
[Amit Varma]: do not conflict with the interests of the majority of voters, or they wouldn't make

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.920
[Amit Varma]: So by and large, when a politician says something high minded or otherwise, it's because he

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.780
[Amit Varma]: knows his voters want to hear it.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And if he therefore is unable to fulfill it, he needs to explain to his voters why he hasn't.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.880
[Amit Varma]: I've stuck to that policy in my two terms in office.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.160
[Amit Varma]: I explain everything that I promised to do and how I've tried to do it.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And if I've failed, I explain why I failed and leave it to the voters to judge whether

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.160
[Amit Varma]: I should be blamed or not for that failure.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And that's, I think, an important part of political accountability.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.720
[Amit Varma]: But in the case of Mr. Modi, it was a more cynical exercise.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.300
[Amit Varma]: He actually knew that the core Hindu vote was his anyway.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.240
[Amit Varma]: That vote wasn't going to go away.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.720
[Amit Varma]: And so the so-called high minded statements you're referring to were made to attract the

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:17.440
[Amit Varma]: undecided voters who were not Hindutva oriented, who were possibly even directly negative about

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:23.760
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva, but who were attracted by the other aspects of his message, particularly the developmental

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.000
[Amit Varma]: message.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And the cynicism of that is, let me take you to a different political environment to give

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.920
[Amit Varma]: you a parallel.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:40.320
[Amit Varma]: In America, it is often critiqued that the Republican Party runs on a campaign involving

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.480
[Amit Varma]: guns, God and gays, the sort of cultural nationalism of the American right, and thereby attracts

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.080
[Amit Varma]: the votes of a lot of working class people, small town people, salaried people and so

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:59.040
[Amit Varma]: And having come to power on that, it then unmasks its real agenda, which is to put more

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.520
[Amit Varma]: money in the pockets of the plutocrats.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And it essentially devotes its political energy to financial and fiscal policies that benefit

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.120
[Amit Varma]: the tiny mass of their supporters and backers and funders.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.880
[Amit Varma]: That is, in other words, cultural nationalism becoming the bait.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And then you switch.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.640
[Amit Varma]: It's called bait and switch.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.600
[Amit Varma]: You switch to your real agenda, which is economics.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.920
[Amit Varma]: I would suggest that what we've seen with Mr. Modi is also bait and switch.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.840
[Amit Varma]: But it's the exact reverse of the Republican approach, which is that economics has been

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840
[Amit Varma]: the bait.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
[Amit Varma]: He's talked about Vikas.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.640
[Amit Varma]: He's talked about Gujarat Inc.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.080
[Amit Varma]: He's talked about how much he's been able to do and how much he's going to do for India.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080
[Amit Varma]: And people have voted for him.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And then having come to power, instead of focusing on results in that area, he has merely

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:53.080
[Amit Varma]: unleashed some of the most retrogressive forces of cultural nationalism across the country.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.960
[Amit Varma]: And the only conclusion one can inescapably draw is that that must have been his real

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:03.120
[Amit Varma]: agenda, that the economics was all talk and the real action is in cow vigilantism, is

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:11.320
[Amit Varma]: in car, Roper sees and love Jihad is in communal polarization, is in the murder even of Muslims

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.720
[Amit Varma]: for being too Muslim is in the compulsory ization of Bharat Mata, etc., etc., etc.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.840
[Amit Varma]: All of that cultural nationalism has been dominant articulation and priority of this

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:28.080
[Amit Varma]: government having won votes on the basis of something quite different.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080
[Guest]: I couldn't agree with you more.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.240
[Guest]: I think, you know, many of the people who might have been taken in by his promises of

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.640
[Guest]: development should now listen to his words and say that, you know, you fooled me once,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.080
[Guest]: shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.320
[Guest]: But my question was really more about a broader sort of question about politics in general.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.800
[Guest]: The next paradox I want to ask you about is a paradox of the idea of India.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.920
[Guest]: You know, Mr. Tagore's phrase and something that, you know, you bring up in your book,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.640
[Guest]: and you know, the objection that you know, at length, you quote the Indian upadhyay talking

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.280
[Guest]: about the constitution and railing against it.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.520
[Guest]: And I think there is a question there that must be addressed by liberal elites such as

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520
[Guest]: you and me.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.040
[Guest]: And it was in fact, liberal elites who framed the constitution and you could make a criticism

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.960
[Guest]: that look, the constitution didn't actually reflect the soul of the people.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.960
[Guest]: It was these westernized liberal elites in a sense, Nehru and Gang were really British

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.600
[Guest]: liberals in a sense, in you know, where their thinking came from.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.120
[Guest]: And I mean that in a good way.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:35.040
[Guest]: But one, there is that paradox that forcing a liberal way of life on an illiberal country,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.560
[Guest]: isn't that act itself illiberal, you know, and that's one paradox.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.640
[Guest]: And the other paradox that then is that if now and I'm not saying this is necessarily

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.740
[Guest]: the case, but if now the country is to assert its illiberalism and want the constitution

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.520
[Guest]: to reflect that, on what grounds are we to stand in the way?

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Well, that's a very interesting question.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:02.760
[Amit Varma]: I have to say that it's something which one doesn't have easy answers for, because I actually

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:08.740
[Amit Varma]: accept the critique that the constitution, as the Indian panther put it, is full of imported

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Western ideas written by Anglophile lawyers in English, which is not from his point of

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.640
[Amit Varma]: view, an authentic Indian language.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And in these circumstances, you're really looking at a question that says, I'm prepared

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:29.120
[Amit Varma]: to say, so what if these ideas are good, if these ideas are actually ideas that in many,

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.280
[Amit Varma]: many ways would improve the lives of Indians, why shouldn't we adopt them even if they've

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.740
[Amit Varma]: come from abroad?

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Is any culture truly pristine?

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Hasn't India been open to external influences since time immemorial?

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.800
[Amit Varma]: Didn't we welcome these outsiders when they came, whether it was the Jews fleeing the

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.520
[Amit Varma]: destruction of their temple by the Babylonians and then by the Romans, whether it was Islam

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.200
[Amit Varma]: coming to the south of India as a message, as it were, during the lifetime of the prophet,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.120
[Amit Varma]: whether it was Zoroastrianism, the Parsis coming as refugees fleeing Muslim persecution

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.160
[Amit Varma]: in Persia in the seventh century.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:11.960
[Amit Varma]: All of these examples suggest to me that you actually have a society which has had a lot

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.680
[Amit Varma]: of openness to various influences and which, as Swami Vivekananda argued, has always found

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.680
[Amit Varma]: the secret of its survival in the acceptance of difference, the acceptance that other people

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.960
[Amit Varma]: of other ways were doing things.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.560
[Amit Varma]: So it may be, in your view, a somewhat illiberal society, and if you look at caste relations

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.680
[Amit Varma]: and so on, it certainly does seem illiberal, but it has also been a society which, by the

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.120
[Amit Varma]: practice of acceptance, and I stress the word acceptance rather than merely tolerance, has

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:51.840
[Amit Varma]: actually allowed multiple forms of worship to exist and flourish on Indian soil.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.360
[Amit Varma]: And the strength of that is what I think makes India ripe for a liberal constitution.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.840
[Amit Varma]: It is not a liberal imposition on illiberal country.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:08.320
[Amit Varma]: It is a liberal overlay on a system which, because of its respect for difference and

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.840
[Amit Varma]: its acceptance for difference, permits, if you like, modern constitutional principles

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:19.000
[Amit Varma]: to be addressed in this older society.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.680
[Amit Varma]: One of the interesting distinctions that this causes is the following.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.000
[Amit Varma]: In Western democracies, the individual citizen is the only one who has rights.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Amit Varma]: In India, we have the individual rights that have come to us through Western democracy,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.560
[Amit Varma]: but we also have community and group rights.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.560
[Amit Varma]: We recognize things like personal laws of different religious communities, for which

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.560
[Amit Varma]: there is no equivalent in the United States or in most Western democracies.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, what does this mean?

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.000
[Amit Varma]: This means that you have got an overlay, but that overlay is not incompatible with the

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.480
[Amit Varma]: idea of rights that already pre-existed in that society, in our society.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.840
[Amit Varma]: So I don't consider it illiberal, and I'll take you back to the beginning of your initial

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840
[Amit Varma]: comment.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.880
[Amit Varma]: I would argue that the liberalism that you say might have been an imposition on this

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:14.200
[Amit Varma]: society is actually what has made a lot of the evolution of this society possible.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:22.920
[Amit Varma]: That without the constitution of 1950, a Mayawati, a Dalit woman, who for 3,000 years, it would

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:28.640
[Amit Varma]: have been unthinkable to see a Dalit woman ruling the land of Arya Vrata, this Dalit

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.680
[Amit Varma]: woman has been elected three times as chief minister of UP, thanks to that liberal constitution.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.280
[Amit Varma]: A man of very humble origins who sold tea on a railway station platform has become prime

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.400
[Amit Varma]: minister of India because of the liberal constitution and the institutions that were created and

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.920
[Amit Varma]: nurtured under it.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.160
[Amit Varma]: So I would argue that in fact, our society needs this constitution, needs these liberal

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.720
[Amit Varma]: values and is what it is because these values have shaped us for 71 years.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.560
[Guest]: I take your point, though I'm a little sceptical about how individual rights and group rights

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.460
[Guest]: can coexist, because it seems to me that there is a dissonance there, which eventually leads

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.460
[Guest]: to conflict.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.840
[Amit Varma]: But my other question there is that...

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.720
[Amit Varma]: Let me answer that before you move on from it, which is, to my mind, I've actually written

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.760
[Amit Varma]: an article in the Northern Journal of International Law about 30 years ago, making this point

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:24.400
[Amit Varma]: that they coexist only in a context in which the individual has the right to opt out.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.520
[Amit Varma]: In other words, culture means that, yes, you can have Muslim personal law, but it can't

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
[Amit Varma]: be coercion.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Culture should not be coercion.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:38.040
[Amit Varma]: If a Muslim woman chooses to marry a non-Muslim or marry a Muslim under civil law, she has

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.840
[Amit Varma]: the right to do so under our constitution.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's essentially the argument that says, for those who wish to abide by it, group rights

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840
[Amit Varma]: exist.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.880
[Amit Varma]: For those who wish to opt out, the constitution protects their individual rights.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And to my mind, that gives you the way in which the two can coexist.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.320
[Guest]: Fair enough.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.240
[Guest]: And, you know, if we accept that, let's say that to begin with, we have a liberal, relatively

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.280
[Guest]: liberal constitution, I still feel it's illiberal in many ways, in that it doesn't protect free

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.920
[Guest]: speech enough, and the right to property is not a fundamental right, and so on.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.020
[Guest]: But leaving that aside, if we accept that the constitution is more liberal than society

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:19.240
[Guest]: is even today, then, you know, the question that brings me to is a question, you know,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.560
[Guest]: how a society becomes liberal, is it a top down process, as you're saying it can be that

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.840
[Guest]: a constitution can play a part in that?

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.560
[Guest]: Or should it necessarily be a bottom up process?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.840
[Guest]: Like, for example, you're in the political marketplace, you're part of the supply end

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.920
[Guest]: of the political marketplace, and there is a demand and you're catering to, and it's

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.480
[Guest]: always seemed to me that you have to change the demand and first at the battle is first

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.640
[Guest]: a cultural battle, and then a political battle.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.200
[Guest]: And if you don't change the demand end, and if the demand end is largely illiberal, then

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.920
[Guest]: you're never going to get really liberal policies from the supply end, because politicians will

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920
[Guest]: reflect society.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes, and no, I mean, you're broadly right.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.640
[Amit Varma]: And I can't claim that the preponderance of evidence would be against your argument, your

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.720
[Amit Varma]: argument is actually right.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I have noticed, particularly in the context of 377, that the judiciary has far

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.360
[Amit Varma]: more courage than politicians, because politicians don't think beyond the prejudices of their

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.920
[Amit Varma]: government, whereas the judiciary has no such fetters and is free to advocate certain principles

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and values that it holds dear.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.160
[Amit Varma]: But you know, again, my counter argument involves precisely that, that the liberal constitution

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.160
[Amit Varma]: we have created has also created these different institutions.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not as if the only change in our society is a change that can be voted for by a majority

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.240
[Amit Varma]: of members of Parliament.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.320
[Amit Varma]: There are changes that are coming through the judicial route.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Many would argue that there's a flurry of Supreme Court judgments over the last 15,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.840
[Amit Varma]: 20 years have expanded the notion of women's rights in India way beyond anything that our

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.040
[Amit Varma]: society has known in the past, or that perhaps a government would have dared to introduce

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.000
[Amit Varma]: or a Parliament would have voted for.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.320
[Amit Varma]: So let's accept that in a democracy, there are many institutions of democracy.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.280
[Amit Varma]: The judiciary is one of them, and it sometimes thinks beyond what Parliament is capable of

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280
[Amit Varma]: doing.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.240
[Amit Varma]: But the media to which you belong is also an extremely important institution of democracy,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:24.480
[Amit Varma]: and it can help promote change by what it depicts of cultural practices and social values.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.400
[Amit Varma]: Certainly, the India in which I grew up and which I left at the age of 19 to go to graduate

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.960
[Amit Varma]: school in the West, and the India to which I returned at the age of 51, were very different

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:41.320
[Amit Varma]: Indias when it comes to things like, for example, sexual mores, when it comes to conspicuous

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.360
[Amit Varma]: consumption, when it comes to the overt public display of affluence, all sorts of things.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.800
[Amit Varma]: A cultural change had occurred, and I think it was a change that was enabled by mass media,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.080
[Amit Varma]: by media showing examples of all of these, by media showing that this was what was practiced

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.920
[Amit Varma]: elsewhere in the world, by media showing that the world was moving on and India should perhaps

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.800
[Amit Varma]: catch up, or some sections of India found it attractive to catch up with the rest of

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800
[Amit Varma]: the world.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.880
[Amit Varma]: So change comes in all sorts of ways, not just through politicians.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Politicians in some cases can only reflect what their voters are prepared to tolerate.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.600
[Amit Varma]: In some cases, they will have the courage of their convictions to take things forward.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And in some cases, the politicians are operating in domains in which the public themselves

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.880
[Amit Varma]: don't know really any better or any worse.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.320
[Amit Varma]: And so there is an educated role.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:38.360
[Amit Varma]: When Manmohan Singh stood up in Parliament in 1991 and said, as finance minister paraphrasing

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Victor Hugo, that no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come, what was he saying?

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.400
[Amit Varma]: He was basically saying at that point that the economic underpinnings of your normal

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.400
[Amit Varma]: life in India that you've always known are suddenly going to change.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, you can't say that a lot of voters would have asked for it, but they didn't know they

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.080
[Amit Varma]: could ask for it, as it were.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Most voters in India were living within the protected and somewhat overregulated economy

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.320
[Amit Varma]: that we had up to then.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.360
[Amit Varma]: But suddenly when everything became possible, when foreign goods could come in, when restrictions

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.920
[Amit Varma]: were lifted, when companies could expand, etc., etc., etc., the same people, the same

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.000
[Amit Varma]: voters embraced these things.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's only when it comes to matters that people are sensitive about, which are usually

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.520
[Amit Varma]: social, religious, cultural matters, that politicians are a bit more constrained.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.720
[Amit Varma]: When it comes to things like economic policy, when it comes to things like most of the foreign

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.920
[Amit Varma]: policy issues in our country and so on, the voters do give politicians the freedom to

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.960
[Amit Varma]: pursue their convictions and their beliefs.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.960
[Guest]: Fair enough.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:45.180
[Guest]: Before I move on to talking about your book per se, just one final general question.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.740
[Guest]: As your anecdote at the start about Modi indicated, where he said that I do nothing for the Muslims

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.320
[Guest]: of Gujarat, I do nothing for the Hindus of Gujarat, I focus on the Gujaratis, which is

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.260
[Guest]: a remarkable rhetorical turn.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.000
[Guest]: And he is a master of rhetoric.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.340
[Guest]: And it's often been said about him that he focuses purely on optics, that he's great

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.840
[Guest]: at campaigning and not so much governing.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.400
[Guest]: And one always assumed that this is going to come back and bite him at some point, maybe

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.660
[Guest]: 2019.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.800
[Guest]: But my counterpoint to that is that maybe he sees something we don't, which is that

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.160
[Guest]: maybe only the optics matters in the sense that what has happened over the last few years,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.360
[Guest]: exacerbated to some extent by social media, but not entirely, is that, you know, the journalist

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.160
[Guest]: Walter Lippmann in the early 1900s wrote a book called Public Opinion, where the first

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.180
[Guest]: chapter was titled, The World Out There and The World Inside Our Heads, where he pointed

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:40.320
[Guest]: out that people construct a world inside their heads, and then whether or not it corresponds

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.040
[Guest]: to the real world outside, they stick to that world.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.960
[Guest]: And it seems to me that social media makes it possible to meet like minded people, even

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.520
[Guest]: if they're fellow bigots or mythogenists or whatever, who might validate those worst impulses,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.940
[Guest]: and you know, strengthen your belief in them.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.320
[Guest]: And it's very easy to form echo chambers, and then be imprisoned in those narratives,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.120
[Guest]: which cannot be touched by reality.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.400
[Guest]: So once you believe that narrative, for example, if you believe in narrative that Hindu civilization

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.040
[Guest]: is under threat, and everything was glorious once and blah, blah, blah, then what is happening

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.040
[Guest]: outside doesn't really matter so much like after demonetization, which I thought was

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.760
[Guest]: a disaster and the biggest assault on property rights in human history, I was sure they would

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.960
[Guest]: lose in UP.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.520
[Guest]: But they won by a landslide.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.120
[Guest]: And it seemed to me that what had actually happened, the suffering that people had gone

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.480
[Guest]: through didn't affect the way they voted because it already made up a narrative inside the

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.520
[Guest]: heads.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.800
[Guest]: And if that is the case, maybe Mr. Modi is smarter than we think, because he knows then

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.800
[Guest]: on that only the narrative matters and the reality of things doesn't matter.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800
[Guest]: So to hell with governance.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's a very depressing thought.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Because I think the narrative worked for Mr. Modi in UP because it was very soon after

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.920
[Amit Varma]: the elections, very soon after the demonetization of the elections took place.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And there was still time for a very, very clever narrative to seize the imaginations

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040
[Amit Varma]: of people.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.320
[Amit Varma]: One of which, by the way, was oddly enough, the politics of class resentment.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.920
[Amit Varma]: It was basically saying, yeah, you've suffered.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, the rich have suffered much more.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.160
[Amit Varma]: The rich are the guys who've really got hit because of this.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.660
[Amit Varma]: So we did this for you.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And the poor said, wow, yeah, you're right.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, those rich guys have suffered.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's reward Modi.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.960
[Amit Varma]: But with time, that argument, that narrative doesn't hold, because the poor are able to

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.280
[Amit Varma]: see that they're the ones who lost jobs.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.760
[Amit Varma]: They're the ones who lost their savings.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.400
[Amit Varma]: They're the ones who suffered.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.760
[Amit Varma]: Whereas the rich are back to being rich again and are carrying on oblivious.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And they realize that that old narrative that Modi had sold them in the UP election doesn't

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760
[Amit Varma]: work.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.800
[Amit Varma]: And on top of that, that they've elected a deeply unsatisfactory government, which has

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:46.680
[Amit Varma]: let them down really in all sorts of ways, and which has created an environment in which

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:53.080
[Amit Varma]: the BJP's unpopularity is now being widely talked about in the regime of Yogi Adityanath.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.760
[Amit Varma]: And for these reasons, I think that you may be right about the whole management of narrative

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.000
[Amit Varma]: as an answer in the short term.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.840
[Amit Varma]: I don't believe it works indefinitely in the long term.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And I do think that we're going to find in the elections of 2019, Modi is going to find

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.760
[Amit Varma]: it very difficult to spin the same yarn twice.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.880
[Amit Varma]: How does a young man in Kanpur, who voted for Mr. Modi in 2014 because Modi painted

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.240
[Amit Varma]: this brilliant portrait of jobs sort of tumbling out of the woodwork for him because he's going

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.740
[Amit Varma]: to attract all this investment and create so much business, and he's going to get rid

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.520
[Amit Varma]: of all the sclerotic practices of the old regime, and jobs are going to be there, and

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.800
[Amit Varma]: this young man will have a job and five years later, the same guy doesn't have a job, none

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.320
[Amit Varma]: of the fantasies that were depicted for him have come true.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Why would he vote for Modi again?

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, how do you how long can a narrative be a substitute for the reality experienced

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.440
[Guest]: by the human person?

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.920
[Guest]: On that hopeful note, we'll take a quick commercial break.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.240
[Unknown]: Hello, everybody.

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you back to your show.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.760
[Guest]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.200
[Guest]: I'm chatting with Shashi Tharoor about his brilliant book on Narendra Modi called the

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.120
[Guest]: paradoxical Prime Minister.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.800
[Guest]: Mr. Tharoor, you outline a number of ways in which Modi is paradoxical in your book.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.000
[Guest]: And the first one which strikes me as very interesting and which I think gave some hope

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:13.680
[Guest]: to a lot of liberal people who voted for Modi in 2014 was you spoke about how in Gujarat,

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.680
[Guest]: like it's actually a triple paradox.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.600
[Guest]: He began as an RSS person.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.160
[Guest]: But when he was chief minister of Gujarat, he actually marginalized a lot of the extreme

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.240
[Guest]: Hindu elements like the VHP and so on.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.280
[Guest]: He fought with Togadia.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.600
[Guest]: He kicked out Gurdan Duffadia from his cabinet, though he's, you know, back in his good books

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600
[Guest]: again.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.000
[Guest]: And a lot of people assume that he might do the same when he is in power at the center

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.160
[Guest]: and that we won't go in this very Hindutva Bharat Mata ki Jai direction.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.560
[Guest]: And instead, he will live up to his promises on development and be Vikash Purush instead

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.600
[Guest]: of Hindu Riddhe Samrat.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.400
[Guest]: This I mean, did this take you by surprise?

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I actually did think, as you said, that that's what he he he might do, because first

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:02.560
[Amit Varma]: of all, Vikash Purush is was what he tried to depict himself as for the bulk of his time

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.420
[Amit Varma]: in Gujarat, and therefore that became his calling card for the nation.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:13.080
[Amit Varma]: But second, I thought that it's also a better thing to run for reelection on, because, you

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.280
[Amit Varma]: know, the temporary satisfaction you get from beating people of other religions on the head

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.520
[Amit Varma]: is unlikely to be a sustainable asset, whereas improving people's livelihoods and making

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.720
[Amit Varma]: them feel good about themselves will obviously be new votes against.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.040
[Amit Varma]: I was very much thinking that he would focus on that.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.720
[Amit Varma]: But as I realized, as I said, within six months of his coming to power, it couldn't work for

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.320
[Amit Varma]: him that way, because his support base, the very people who needed to go out and knock

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.220
[Amit Varma]: on those doors and win those campaigns for him, actually happened to be people for whom

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:50.220
[Amit Varma]: the only thing that mattered was the Hindu Hridaya Samrat's work.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And it is very, very sad in some ways that our own political and constitutional system

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of reinforced that, because we have elections somewhere or the other every six months, thanks

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.440
[Amit Varma]: to the vagaries of the parliamentary system.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.800
[Amit Varma]: Some stay to the others going to the polls.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And Modi, in his desire to consolidate power, became the nation's campaigner in chief, the

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Pradhan Pracharak, quite literally in the sense of campaigning, rather than the Pradhan

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Sevak that he claimed to be.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.640
[Amit Varma]: He was not doing Desh Ka Seva, he was doing Bhaja Pa Ka Prachar.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.880
[Amit Varma]: And in that process, what you saw throughout the country was a Modi who had to pander to

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.860
[Amit Varma]: the instincts of his followers, his campaigners, the guys who are going out knocking on doors

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.200
[Amit Varma]: and sticking up posters and banners, were the Hindutva elements, the RSS elements, the

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.000
[Amit Varma]: VHP and the Bajrang Dal.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.960
[Amit Varma]: These were the characters who were there to support Mr. Modi so he could win state election

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.680
[Amit Varma]: after state election.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, his message became tailored entirely to them.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.840
[Amit Varma]: And he was also handicapped in his ability to say something when they got out of hand

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.400
[Amit Varma]: and actually murdered people or flogged them on YouTube or stabbed them to death in a very

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.440
[Amit Varma]: disgracefully public manner.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Then instead of disavowing them, as one would expect any decent prime minister to do in

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.680
[Amit Varma]: terms of exercising the moral leadership of the nation, Mr. Modi went mysteriously silent.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.320
[Amit Varma]: But the reason was he couldn't afford to antagonize the very people without whose efforts he couldn't

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.860
[Amit Varma]: win all these states.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.680
[Amit Varma]: So the whole thing became circular, you see, in this way.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.360
[Guest]: And just as an aside, it's probably unfair to ask you this because you may not know him

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:28.280
[Guest]: well enough, but do you think he has any core beliefs of his own or is he sort of the quintessential

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.640
[Guest]: sociopath who'll do whatever it takes to further his immediate self-interest?

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.040
[Amit Varma]: That's a difficult question for me to answer because it's easy enough for an opposition

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.680
[Amit Varma]: MP to say the latter.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.720
[Amit Varma]: But you know, there's something there in this in this man that makes me hesitate to just

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.160
[Amit Varma]: dismiss the possibility of the former.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:54.640
[Amit Varma]: All I can say is his core beliefs seem to me to be much more to do with Hindutva rather

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.960
[Amit Varma]: than with the plus part.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And I've talked about Modi-twa as Hindutva plus.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:07.920
[Amit Varma]: But the plus part includes the Vikas Purush message somehow seem to be more tactical than

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920
[Amit Varma]: core beliefs.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:14.240
[Guest]: Another of your paradoxes actually feeds on from this and it's probably, you know, a natural

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.640
[Guest]: consequence of this, which is that he makes these pluralist statements once in a while

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.800
[Guest]: and you think, I mean, that's a fairly liberal thing to say.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.480
[Guest]: But that is counterbalanced by his very polarizing campaign rhetoric, you know, which can be

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.480
[Guest]: very communal and ugly.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.880
[Guest]: And at the same time, when he is in power as a prime minister and all of these things

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.940
[Guest]: happen, lynchings happen and so on, there is a silence that almost seems tacit.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.840
[Guest]: And all of these kind of contradict each other.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.420
[Guest]: But you know, as you said, this the pulls and pressures you just described explain this

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.420
[Guest]: as well.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, the pulls and pressures do explain this.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.760
[Guest]: You're quite right.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.520
[Guest]: And yeah, and they also explain another paradox where he talks of the Constitution as a holy

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.080
[Guest]: book, but the RSS is, you know, holds a Manusmriti as a holy book.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.560
[Guest]: So again, it's that paradox is also kind of explained by this.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.640
[Amit Varma]: But it's not just that, you know, he actually says that Dindayal Upadhyay is his hero and

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.240
[Amit Varma]: mentor when he came, became prime minister, he insisted that every single ministry hold

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.040
[Amit Varma]: a seminar on the thoughts of Dindayal Upadhyay and he put Dindayal Upadhyay logos on all

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.840
[Amit Varma]: the ministry letterheads and so on.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, the fact of the matter is Dindayal Upadhyay may have been a very interesting and inspiring

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440
[Amit Varma]: figure.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.160
[Amit Varma]: But one thing he was absolutely clear about was that he despised the Constitution and

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.280
[Amit Varma]: wished to tear it up and discard it.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:35.200
[Amit Varma]: So you cannot on hand say that the Constitution is a holy book and on the other hand say that

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.880
[Amit Varma]: you worship Dindayal Upadhyay.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.280
[Amit Varma]: The two thoughts are fundamentally incompatible.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Now one of these is insincere, and I believe it was the reference to the Constitution that

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.720
[Amit Varma]: was insincere.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:50.560
[Amit Varma]: I think that Modi is indeed schooled in the Dindayal Upadhyay kind of approach.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And ideally, he and his acolytes in the BJP do want to change the Constitution.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.760
[Amit Varma]: But until they have the numbers in both houses, as well as in the state assemblies to amend

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.040
[Amit Varma]: the Constitution, they can't do it.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, for the moment, tactically, it's useful to swear by the very Constitution

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.080
[Amit Varma]: that they're busy destroying the spirit of.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.400
[Guest]: But when he speaks of the Constitution as a holy book, who is he really speaking to?

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.320
[Guest]: I mean, is it the case that he is secretly, he really wants the affection of the Lutyens

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.080
[Guest]: elite who he disparages so much?

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think he wants the affection of the establishment, the media, the thinking classes

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.800
[Amit Varma]: and so on in this country.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Or he wanted it at some point.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.240
[Amit Varma]: I think he, my own view is that the gloves are going to come off in April of 2019.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.960
[Amit Varma]: And we no longer see that kind of talk.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.880
[Amit Varma]: But certainly I think he did want the affection of everybody.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.520
[Amit Varma]: But more important, he wanted to disarm them.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, he couldn't necessarily win over a lot of these people in terms of affection.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.800
[Amit Varma]: But he had to at least convey the impression that he was no threat to the fundamental consensus

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.760
[Amit Varma]: that had built this country.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:00.240
[Amit Varma]: And that's the only way, with the Vikas message and so on, that he could build up the support

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.560
[Amit Varma]: base around the country that would enable him then to amend the Constitution.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.640
[Amit Varma]: Don't forget that he succeeded to the tune of 20 state governments.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.140
[Amit Varma]: He's now lost three.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:16.640
[Amit Varma]: But he had 20 state governments in the BJP kitty as recently as the last month of 2018.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And that means that he was well on his way to fulfilling his dream.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.880
[Amit Varma]: He had, with the NDA, 333 seats in the Lok Sabha.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.220
[Amit Varma]: And thanks to the state assemblies he now controlled, he was gradually creeping up to

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.920
[Amit Varma]: a convincing majority in the Rajya Sabha.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:36.960
[Amit Varma]: With all of this, in say, three, four, five years' time, he would have been in a position

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.560
[Amit Varma]: to write the Hindutva constitution of his dreams.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Now the fact is that it looks like the nation is going to stop him before he gets there.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.080
[Amit Varma]: Or that even if he inevitably becomes the dominant party in the Rajya Sabha, that he's

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.160
[Amit Varma]: going to be stopped in the Lok Sabha in the 2019 general election.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.640
[Amit Varma]: So then my fears will again be dialed down.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.000
[Amit Varma]: But certainly I have no doubt, having looked at the convictions of the BJP and the Hindutva

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.840
[Amit Varma]: Brigade and the followers of Mr. Modi, that had he been able to retain this majority in

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:14.080
[Amit Varma]: the Lok Sabha and add to it in a few years a majority in the Rajya Sabha, that we would

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:19.480
[Amit Varma]: have seen him openly and nakedly saying, we need to strike certain words in the constitution,

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:25.440
[Amit Varma]: we need to make India Hindu Rashtra with the Hindu faith as the official faith of the country,

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.440
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.400
[Amit Varma]: All of these are things that he and his followers have long believed, and they would finally

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.280
[Amit Varma]: have been in a position to do it.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.440
[Amit Varma]: But the other talk was a means, it seems to me, to put themselves in a position to do

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.720
[Guest]: And you know, another paradox that is a big paradox, and I imagine both you and I would

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.200
[Guest]: be upset that it's a paradox at all, is that he said all these beautiful things before

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.360
[Guest]: the elections about minimum government, maximum governance.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.360
[Guest]: And as you point out, it's just the opposite.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.880
[Guest]: We've had maximum government and minimum governance where, you know, you talk about the ideal

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.480
[Guest]: size of the cabinet and you say that, you know, one sort of rule of thumb was that it

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.560
[Guest]: should be around 10% of the Lok Sabha or about 55 or whatever.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.280
[Guest]: And you even outline in great detail what you think the ideal number should be and why,

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.760
[Guest]: which is about 40-45, which, you know, the argument seemed very convincing to me.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:20.000
[Guest]: And you have a telling anecdote about his early days about why he was drawn to the RSS

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.320
[Guest]: because, you know, it seemed to him that here was a group where everybody listened to one

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:30.320
[Guest]: leader, which shows how his thinking from a very early stage is sort of a top down thinking.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.040
[Guest]: Now, you know, your expression of disappointment at him not living up to the slogan of minimum

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.960
[Guest]: government, maximum governance also leads me to another larger paradox, which is that

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.840
[Guest]: we have always been a nation of top down thinkers and large governments.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.360
[Guest]: I mean, Modi might have around 80 ministers right now, as you pointed out, but Manmohan

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.800
[Guest]: Singh at 78 before this, as you mentioned in your book yourself.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's also true that we're the only country which has actually had to create a guideline

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.240
[Amit Varma]: saying no more than 15% of the strength of the two houses, because otherwise governments

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.040
[Amit Varma]: would have gone on and on appointing ministers and deputy ministers and parliamentary secretaries,

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.680
[Amit Varma]: because ultimately the big flaw in the parliamentary system, one which I've decried in a different

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.600
[Amit Varma]: book, India Shastra, is the fact that you are electing a legislator in order to form

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:24.440
[Amit Varma]: the executive, which is a fundamental, to my mind, a flaw in the entire British system,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.400
[Amit Varma]: which we have taken on to ourselves.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.160
[Amit Varma]: And so what's happening is that once you get elected as part of the ruling party, what

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:35.920
[Amit Varma]: you want to do is become a monthly or at least hold some other position the government can

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920
[Amit Varma]: give you.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, the fact is that thanks to the official guideline of 15%, they can't do that.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:49.360
[Amit Varma]: But even then, it's very striking that we have this incredibly centralized situation

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:55.680
[Amit Varma]: where what Mr. Modi has realized is you hand out these various portfolios or SOPs to people,

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.880
[Amit Varma]: but you keep all real power to yourself.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.560
[Amit Varma]: So you have your 18 ministers in the Modi government, but of that only one, and that's

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Modi himself, actually has any power to decide anything.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Every other minister, first of all, has a secretary or a senior civil service that bypasses

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.840
[Amit Varma]: him and goes and reports to the prime minister's office under Mr. Modi.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.760
[Amit Varma]: And second, the decisions are made with Mr. Modi's stamp and not that of the minister

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:26.360
[Amit Varma]: himself or herself, with the result that ultimately it almost doesn't matter when you speak of

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.800
[Amit Varma]: minimum government and maximum governance, what you're seeing is maximum centralized

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.600
[Amit Varma]: government in the shape of the PMO, which is certainly the most top-down, most centralized

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.360
[Amit Varma]: PMO we've seen since Indira Gandhi's emergency.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And you have at the same time inefficient governance, which is actually not maximum

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.600
[Amit Varma]: governance or minimum governance, because a lot of decisions keep pending since the

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:56.360
[Amit Varma]: people in the PMO are human beings and there's a limit to how many files they can process.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.640
[Amit Varma]: And so this government has the worst record in the filling of vacancies in the history

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.960
[Amit Varma]: of democratic India, because every blessed vacancy has to be filled with the approval

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.120
[Amit Varma]: of the PMO.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.800
[Amit Varma]: And lots and lots and lots of vacancies, everything from administrative tribunals to the Information

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.640
[Amit Varma]: Commission to various other governmental bodies, pend and pend for weeks and months on end,

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.560
[Amit Varma]: because there just isn't time for the staff of the PMO who are making 2,000 other decisions

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.920
[Amit Varma]: at the same time to also deal with this.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.320
[Guest]: Now, when it came to your opposition to 377 or your equally principled opposition to the

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.400
[Guest]: death penalty, you were sort of like a lone voice in the political landscape.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.000
[Guest]: Is that also the case on the issue of minimum government?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.680
[Guest]: Or, you know, is there a chance that we'll actually see a much smaller ministry if the

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.080
[Guest]: Congress does come to power?

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.720
[Amit Varma]: No, sir, I'm afraid you won't, because I think the logic of the Congress party would be that,

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.000
[Amit Varma]: especially since it's going to be almost certainly a coalition government, and especially if

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.920
[Amit Varma]: it is a coalition government, that portfolios have to be sufficiently numerous in order

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.680
[Amit Varma]: to keep various constituent elements happy.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I don't think my ideas will go very far with a coalition government.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.720
[Amit Varma]: My most radical idea, which I am truly alone, but which I'm convinced would be beneficial

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:16.320
[Amit Varma]: for this country, is to scrap the parliamentary system altogether and go for clear separation

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.760
[Amit Varma]: of powers between the legislature and the executive, elect an executive president in

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.520
[Amit Varma]: the center and an executive chief minister or governor in the states, and an elected,

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.880
[Amit Varma]: by the way, mayor in the towns as well, who would actually be invulnerable to the whims

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:36.400
[Amit Varma]: of a legislative majority, but would be able to have a free hand, plus the free budgetary

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.920
[Amit Varma]: authority, to actually do whatever they promised in their campaigns to do and be held accountable

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.160
[Amit Varma]: four or five years later.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Well they would be challenged by a legislature.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.760
[Amit Varma]: The legislature would reflect all the diverse interests in India today.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And so you'd have more or less the same kind of parliament you have, except that parliament

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.080
[Amit Varma]: would not be constituting the executive.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it would be completely separate from the executive, would be questioning the executive

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.960
[Amit Varma]: and holding it accountable on a day-to-day basis.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And it would actually be a far, far better system for the diversity of our country, and

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.960
[Amit Varma]: at the same time a more efficient system, because the president could get on and get

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.960
[Amit Varma]: work done instead of spending all his or her time in staying in power, which is what Mr.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Modi has been doing with his five years in office.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.520
[Guest]: And do you think something like that will ever be possible?

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'm afraid, you know, major constitutional change of that nature requires a world-class

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.800
[Amit Varma]: crisis to come about.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.760
[Amit Varma]: I don't see it happening quite so easily.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:39.080
[Amit Varma]: But you know, if there ever were a national cataclysm, a nuclear war or something, God

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.440
[Amit Varma]: forbid, I don't want to want to ever happen, but if it did, and we literally had to build

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.440
[Amit Varma]: up the pieces from rubble, this option should present itself to any sensible rethink at

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.440
[Amit Varma]: that point.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.480
[Amit Varma]: And so I'm happy to lay it out there for posterity.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.560
[Guest]: I know we're running short of time and you have to get somewhere.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.720
[Guest]: So we'll quickly run through the rest of the paradoxes of Mr. Modi that you point out.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.880
[Guest]: Paradox to federalism, that there was a time where he claimed to be a believer in federalism,

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.720
[Guest]: especially when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, of course.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.000
[Guest]: But he's acted in quite contrary ways once he's actually come to power at the center.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Precisely.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, as chief minister of Gujarat, he opposed anything that he could see as an

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:22.080
[Amit Varma]: encroachment on state's rights, whether it was the counterterrorism center, whether it

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.480
[Amit Varma]: was the Aadhaar implementation, whether it was GST, which he said took away the state's

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.080
[Amit Varma]: rights to tax on the punish producer states, as he called them and so on.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.880
[Amit Varma]: The moment he becomes prime minister, somehow everything changes.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And as I joked, where you stand depends on where you sit.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.800
[Amit Varma]: He's sitting in Delhi in the prime minister's office and his stand is completely changed.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.560
[Guest]: That's really well said.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:51.160
[Guest]: Another Modi paradox is his desire to portray himself as a modern, tech friendly prime minister,

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.840
[Guest]: but at the same time, this constant harking back to a glorious past, which is, of course,

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.040
[Guest]: kind of mythical.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.960
[Guest]: And these two sort of collide in very awkward, uncomfortable ways, like his mention of how

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.840
[Guest]: we did the first plastic surgery, which was Ganesha and so on.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:10.720
[Guest]: My broader question really here is beyond this obvious contradiction is that why is

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.640
[Guest]: it that glorious past is such a key part of these kind of populist narratives, not just

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.320
[Guest]: in India, but elsewhere as well?

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.980
[Amit Varma]: Well, in India, there is a complete worldview which Modi has internalized and which is fundamental

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.640
[Amit Varma]: to his thinking about the nature of the country, which is that India was this glorious, you

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:35.280
[Amit Varma]: know, golden bird that got despoiled when the evil Muslims and then the evil Christians

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.280
[Amit Varma]: came in and blocked its wings and despoiled it.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:45.200
[Amit Varma]: And that now a Hindu Hriday Samaraj has come back to restore this forgotten glory.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, if that is your narrative and that's your basic view of the history of India, which

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm afraid it is, because when I wrote my book An Era of Darkness Attacking British

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.320
[Amit Varma]: Colonialism, Modi, while hailing it, was making speeches about 1,200 years of foreign rule,

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:03.480
[Amit Varma]: which I don't agree with, because to my mind, the Mughals and the other Muslim rulers before

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.760
[Amit Varma]: them came to this country, settled here, and even if they did exploit or loot, they spent

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.720
[Amit Varma]: the products of their exploitation and loot in India.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.480
[Amit Varma]: And they created some of the most beautiful buildings, architecture, monuments and cultural

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.280
[Amit Varma]: legacies of which we are all the inheritors today.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.400
[Amit Varma]: So to my mind, they're not foreigners.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Whereas the British as imperialists did drain our resources to build their country, and

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.720
[Amit Varma]: they didn't work in the interests of this country, but rather of their own.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.720
[Amit Varma]: So there is a difference.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Now, having said all of that, if Mr. Modi's view of Indian history is what it is that

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.880
[Amit Varma]: I've summarized to you, then a whole set of corollaries follow from it.

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.980
[Amit Varma]: Number one, that you've got to glorify that past, because it was so great.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.680
[Amit Varma]: So everything about it is made to look fantastic in order to diminish what followed.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Second, you have to demonize the successors of those whom you despise for having done

00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.720
[Amit Varma]: terrible things to your country, and therefore you demonize Muslims and Christians.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And third, you present yourself as the one who is restoring a gloried, fabled past.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.520
[Amit Varma]: So you are not merely sort of advocating something new.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.720
[Amit Varma]: You are coming back to ancient glories.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:19.760
[Amit Varma]: But you are doing so using all the technologies available to you in the 21st century, because

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.800
[Amit Varma]: India is not going to be second to anybody when it comes to technology.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:30.920
[Amit Varma]: So as I joked in the book, the image you sought to portray is of a leader who is comfortable

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.360
[Amit Varma]: clicking a mouse with one hand while brandishing a threshold with the other.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.640
[Guest]: That's a brilliant image.

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.900
[Guest]: I'll quickly run through three of the other paradoxes I noted, and then I can get to some

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.840
[Guest]: more questions to end the show with.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.560
[Guest]: The seventh paradox I found was where you, you know, you've quoted Modi saying to you,

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.600
[Guest]: in fact, that how much he likes criticism, and he wants people to criticize and that

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.560
[Guest]: makes the government stronger and all that.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.520
[Guest]: But at the same time, in practice, what we found is that he foments in-house trolls,

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:04.280
[Guest]: he can be very petty and vindictive when it comes to, you know, people who criticize him

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.320
[Guest]: and completely in the other direction.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:11.560
[Guest]: And a similar hypocrisy is when he speaks about how parliamentary debate is good, and

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.880
[Guest]: it strengthens the nation and so on.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:19.620
[Guest]: But at the same time, the BJP has been second to none in disrupting parliament over time.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:24.040
[Guest]: And you also point out that it's not entirely their fault that you know, the anti-defection

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:29.280
[Guest]: law of 1985 sort of made and I've had an episode on just that law in the past, and sort of

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.880
[Guest]: made it compulsory for parliamentarians to vote with the party whip.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:38.560
[Guest]: And the natural consequence of that would be that parliamentary debate would necessarily

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.660
[Guest]: go down because it became inconsequential.

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.840
[Guest]: You could actually taut up the votes according to an Excel sheet.

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.040
[Amit Varma]: So my many objections to the parliamentary system include that precise detail of the

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.920
[Amit Varma]: way it works in our country, where thanks to the anti-defection law, because that was

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:59.400
[Amit Varma]: of course passed with very good intentions to prevent unprincipled defections, we've

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.340
[Amit Varma]: now created a situation where the individual legislator is no longer allowed to speak his

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:08.640
[Amit Varma]: mind or vote his conscience, but is obliged to adhere to the whip of his party, failing

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.360
[Amit Varma]: which he could actually lose a seat in parliament that he's worked so hard to win.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore he swallows his words and bites his tongue in order to prevent that kind of

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800
[Amit Varma]: consequence for him.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: I do believe it's damaged the principle of representation very greatly.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.760
[Amit Varma]: But that's gotten you away from the paradoxes of Mr. Moody, which you're quite right to

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.320
[Amit Varma]: point to that he does have these various paradoxes.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:36.540
[Amit Varma]: You also should take the paradox of his great talent for publicity and self-promotion using

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.200
[Amit Varma]: the world media and his refusal to be accountable to the media in the form of a press conference.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.160
[Amit Varma]: He's the only prime minister in his entire five years who has never held a press conference.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.960
[Amit Varma]: He only wants scripted questions.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And when even in interaction with his own party workers, he was asked an uncomfortable

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.780
[Amit Varma]: question, his discomfort and his refusal to answer was an embarrassment.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:03.560
[Amit Varma]: This is very much at odds with somebody who claims to be an easygoing, frank, accessible,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.680
[Guest]: dissent-tolerating individual.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.520
[Guest]: And sort of moving on from the paradoxes, you also talk about how the Hindutva vision

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.400
[Guest]: of the world, which, you know, Moditwa also plays into is a very masculine vision where

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:21.480
[Guest]: he boasts about his 56 inch ki chhati and you know, for all the noises they make about

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.840
[Guest]: making India safer for women, their attitude seems very misogynistic in the sense that,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.360
[Guest]: like you said in your book, they view women as goddesses or mothers, both to be worshipped

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.800
[Guest]: and protected, but they have no concept of how to deal with women who are neither.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.800
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:45.080
[Amit Varma]: And this whole business of women's equality, and that's linked to women's safety as well,

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:51.560
[Amit Varma]: is exacerbated by the galloping onset of modernity because people are suddenly finding women,

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.680
[Amit Varma]: especially, you know, people moving from rural India, from relatively traditional lives to

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.520
[Amit Varma]: cities are seeing women dressed in ways that they've never seen, behaving in ways with

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.960
[Amit Varma]: a degree of freedom and autonomy that they've never seen or got used to, leading independent

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.480
[Amit Varma]: lives, walking alone and all of that.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And because they're unable to adjust to and cope with this, because they've never been

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.880
[Amit Varma]: trained to respect women as anything other than as mothers or goddesses, they've ended

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.680
[Amit Varma]: up, I'm afraid, assaulting many of these women.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So even women's safety is linked to this inability to recognize the equality of women.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.160
[Amit Varma]: And all of this is part of a social paradox that goes beyond Modi.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Modi's masculinity is actually partly affectation.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.880
[Amit Varma]: As I pointed out in the book, the 56 inch chest where an Atchikan needed to be stitched

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.960
[Amit Varma]: turned out to actually be 50.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.160
[Amit Varma]: So there's a lot of exaggeration there in that masculinity.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.400
[Amit Varma]: And certainly, you know, yoga rather than bodybuilding is his thing.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: So I don't think we need to detain ourselves too long on those tropes.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.440
[Amit Varma]: But part of this, called the muscularity that the Hindutva movement needs to advertise to

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.660
[Amit Varma]: show its inherent superiority to others.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:11.600
[Amit Varma]: So the masculinity is caught up in the muscularity, in the militaristic language and jingoism,

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.940
[Amit Varma]: in the praise for the army, often not matched by actual concrete support for the armed forces.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:24.040
[Amit Varma]: But all of these things are part of this Hindutva assertiveness, which is what passes for right-wing

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.280
[Amit Varma]: ideology in our country today.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.600
[Guest]: And you know, there's a quote from you in your book, which really struck me when you

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.640
[Guest]: were talking about the difference between Hinduism as it is and Hinduism as, Hinduism

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.000
[Guest]: as a different political parties kind of view it, where you talk about how the view of it

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.160
[Guest]: evolved, quote, from the soft Brahmanism of the Congress Party to the tough Kshatriya

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.240
[Guest]: warrior tradition, stop quote.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.360
[Guest]: And we've already discussed and agreed on why there is a problem with that tough Kshatriya

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.220
[Guest]: warrior tradition, so to say.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:57.640
[Guest]: But I also found the phrase soft Brahmanism of the Congress Party, you know, mildly disturbing,

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.080
[Guest]: which leads me to my next question.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.760
[Guest]: And I don't want to, you know, sort of put you in a sort of spot.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760
[Amit Varma]: But when we talk about…

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.720
[Amit Varma]: That wasn't my characterization, but the RSS's and Golwalkar say things like, you know, look

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.240
[Amit Varma]: at how all our Hindu gods are shown with weapons.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.320
[Amit Varma]: What is all this Gandhi and Ahimsa talk?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, we are a militaristic people.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.680
[Amit Varma]: So they saw this as soft Brahmanism.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.800
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, the principal Congress leaders were not only Brahmins.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Of course, Nehruji was, Panditji was a Brahmin, but Gandhiji and Sardar Patel were not.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I think one shouldn't generalize on the caste front of the Congress Party.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.360
[Guest]: That's my bad.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.360
[Guest]: I shouldn't have attributed that to you.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360
[Guest]: Apologies for that.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.040
[Guest]: It was my paraphrase of what they felt.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.040
[Guest]: Fair enough.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040
[Guest]: Fair enough.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040
[Guest]: I buy that.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.800
[Guest]: And, you know, my sort of larger question to you is that, aren't there paradoxes that

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.200
[Guest]: go beyond Mr. Modi to your own party?

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.080
[Guest]: For example, Rahul Gandhi talks of inner party democracy, but he's himself an unelected leader.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.040
[Guest]: They talk against the communalism of the BJP, but they are also pursuing that Hindu vote

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.240
[Amit Varma]: bank as you know, through the trips to Kedarnath.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.240
[Amit Varma]: There are differences there.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:10.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'll be brief because I am now well past the hour mark that we discussed.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.320
[Amit Varma]: But just to say that, number one, as far as the inner party democracy argument is concerned,

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.120
[Amit Varma]: you're right, absolutely, there is no widespread electoral process.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.240
[Amit Varma]: But you're wrong in the sense that anyone in the Congress will tell you that if you

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.760
[Amit Varma]: had a free and fair election tomorrow amongst Congress workers and put any Congress leader

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.720
[Amit Varma]: you can name against Rahul Gandhi, that person would lose to Rahul Gandhi.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:39.400
[Amit Varma]: The party, the party workers, the party organization wants a son of the Gandhi Nehru family to

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.480
[Amit Varma]: lead it.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And that is definitely the case.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And if there was a perception at one point that Rahul Gandhi was a reluctant leader,

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.520
[Amit Varma]: it's partially because he had been press ganged into this to a great extent by the demands

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.260
[Amit Varma]: of party workers.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.820
[Amit Varma]: So that's on the first point.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.760
[Amit Varma]: On the second point, I would disagree respectfully because I don't think what the Congress is

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.000
[Amit Varma]: doing is soft Hindutva, as has been alleged.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.880
[Amit Varma]: It is very much the advocacy of an inclusive Hinduism as opposed to the kind of exclusionary

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and bigoted Hindutva that the BJP practices and propagates.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:22.040
[Amit Varma]: So when the communal polarization is thought to be attempted by the BJP, though when they

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.880
[Amit Varma]: speak of Hindutva, we don't want to share that space with them.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.800
[Amit Varma]: But when they say we're the only party that respects Hinduism, Hindu culture and speaks

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.600
[Amit Varma]: up for Hindu interests, we turn around and say, what are you talking about?

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.560
[Amit Varma]: They go to temples, we go to temples too.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.600
[Amit Varma]: We worship and respect the same things you do.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.520
[Amit Varma]: So now that we've neutralized that argument, can we set that aside and talk about vikas?

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Can we talk about whether you're a chidinavakam?

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.360
[Amit Varma]: Can we talk about the kind of conditions that you've been reduced to by this government?

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.320
[Amit Varma]: So it's not Hinduism in the sense of Hindutva.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:56.760
[Amit Varma]: It is Hinduism as a tactic to neutralize a particularly potent part of the BJP's appeal

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.400
[Amit Varma]: in order to focus on the issues that we believe really matter to the Indian voter.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400
[Guest]: Fair enough.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.280
[Guest]: I won't ask any more follow up questions on this particular subject because I know we're

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280
[Guest]: running out of time.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.440
[Guest]: One final question before I end, which is really a two part question.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.120
[Guest]: Given both the politics of this country and given the social scenario where we have a

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.520
[Guest]: jobs crisis, we have an agricultural crisis and, you know, the demographic dividend, so

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.780
[Guest]: to say, is turning out to be a demographic disaster.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:26.200
[Guest]: Given all of this, what makes you hope and what makes you despair about India in the

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200
[Guest]: next 10 years?

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.640
[Amit Varma]: What makes me hope is the extraordinary capacity of the Indian people, you know, and I've lived

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.840
[Amit Varma]: around the world and I've seen Indians thrive and succeed everywhere, and there's something

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.440
[Amit Varma]: about us as a people.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:43.840
[Amit Varma]: We are by and large quick learners, hard workers, effective result producers, except it seems

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.840
[Amit Varma]: in India.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And we need to get our act together here better, partly because the systems have held us down.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.280
[Amit Varma]: We need to improve those.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.200
[Amit Varma]: But the second reason I'm hopeful is because I do see change.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, change has occurred.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.560
[Amit Varma]: As I said earlier, in a different context, the India I grew up in is not the India I

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.840
[Amit Varma]: return to, and it cuts right across the board in politics and economics and social and cultural

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.000
[Amit Varma]: relations, in caste equations, you name it.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.520
[Amit Varma]: There have been some real changes.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Some changes have been for the worse.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.440
[Amit Varma]: The growing communalization has shocked me because I hear things being said from public

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.120
[Amit Varma]: platforms that when I was young would have been impolite to express even behind closed

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.920
[Amit Varma]: doors in private living rooms.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.920
[Amit Varma]: So there is now a change in that communal discourse that I think is deplorable.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.520
[Amit Varma]: But for the most part, the changes that have occurred have been positive.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.160
[Amit Varma]: I find a very self-confident India that genuinely believes it can hold its own with the rest

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.360
[Amit Varma]: of the world.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not too worried.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And I think that the capacity for self-correction that our democracy gives us means that where

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.720
[Amit Varma]: we've gone wrong in the last five years, or if you want to say it, in the last 10 years,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.280
[Amit Varma]: can be corrected in the next five or the next 10.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.800
[Amit Varma]: And I think that the elections offer the Indian public a chance to correct that.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, striking one of the paradoxes you and I never discussed was the paradox that

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:01.880
[Amit Varma]: we have at the helm of the nation somebody who is perhaps the most eloquent rhetorician

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.840
[Amit Varma]: who has featured on the Indian political stage since independence, at least in Hindi, the

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.920
[Amit Varma]: most eloquent and compelling orator.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And yet, when some of the defining moments in the insecurity of our fellow Indians has

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.200
[Amit Varma]: occurred, the suicide of Rohit Memla, the flogging of those Dalits in Jaipur, the murder

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.440
[Amit Varma]: of Pahelwa Khan on YouTube, the murder of an Indian Air Force, Haridwar's father, Mohammed

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Lakhlaq on the suspicion of carrying beef, etc., etc., the horrendous number of cow vigilante

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Bob lynchings, all of these things have happened.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.500
[Amit Varma]: This eloquent rhetorician has gone mysteriously silent.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think that paradox points to one of the biggest defects of the Modi approach.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.180
[Amit Varma]: Modi is diagnosing the problems of India very effectively in his speeches, blaming them

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.900
[Amit Varma]: all on the past, of course, rather than on himself.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.700
[Amit Varma]: But then, when it comes to providing moral leadership through his words, he has gone

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:55.960
[Amit Varma]: silent on us.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.940
[Amit Varma]: I think what we need in this country is a leadership that is both inclusive and cooperative,

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:06.060
[Amit Varma]: that actually provides a certain moral direction, but that derives its strength from the Indian

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.320
[Amit Varma]: people.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.540
[Amit Varma]: Instead of a prime minister who portrays himself as sort of hero on a white stallion, charging

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:16.280
[Amit Varma]: down with upraised swords, saying, I know all the answers to all your problems, and

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.940
[Amit Varma]: I shall cut through the Gordian knots that are tying you down, and we've seen how well

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.080
[Amit Varma]: that has worked or failed to work in the last four and a half years, you have instead an

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.360
[Amit Varma]: alternative style of leadership that says, listen, I don't know all the answers, and

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm coming on foot.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.720
[Amit Varma]: I don't have a stallion to ride on.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.400
[Amit Varma]: But I'm going to listen to you telling me what your problems are, and I'll come accompanied

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.780
[Amit Varma]: by a very deep-bent strength of diverse, able, experienced people who will work with me and

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.120
[Amit Varma]: work with you to solve your problems.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.440
[Amit Varma]: That is the alternative the opposition and the Congress Party in particular is offering.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.940
[Amit Varma]: And that's what gives me hope.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:56.520
[Amit Varma]: I think that kind of collective, cooperative effort can genuinely produce a better India

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520
[Guest]: in the next decade.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.240

[Unknown]: Yep, you heard me right.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.960
[Unknown]: Advertising is dead.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.920
[Unknown]: We're all in the content business now.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.600
[Unknown]: Let's not call it news, TV, radio, etc, etc.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
[Unknown]: It's all content.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.280
[Unknown]: And we're in the middle of this weirdly exciting phase where all the borders and lines that

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.360
[Unknown]: have been drawn over decades has been swept away by this lovely thing called the internet.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.680
[Unknown]: Where I assure you, we don't dwell on just the stuff that is now, but rather the wider

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.680
[Unknown]: stuff about advertising, media, content and the whole goddamn circus surrounding it.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.800

[Unknown]: Did I just catch you on your way to work?

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.480
[Unknown]: Or did you end up pulling an all-nighter?

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.960
[Unknown]: Let me guess, you have a packed schedule for the day, the week, and probably the month

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960
[Unknown]: and the year.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.100
[Unknown]: That's a lot for your mind to handle, don't you think?

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.960
[Unknown]: This buzzing chaos also brings tons of negative thoughts, am I right?

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.520
[Unknown]: Try spinning that bottle in a positive direction with me, Chetna, on the Positively Unlimited

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.320
