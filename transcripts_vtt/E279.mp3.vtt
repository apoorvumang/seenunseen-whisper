00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
[Amit Varma]: The seen and the unseen would not exist if not for serendipity.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Five and a half years ago, I congratulated a friend on his podcast.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.040
[Amit Varma]: The owner of the network he was with said, Hey, why don't you try podcasting?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.040
[Amit Varma]: We started talking and the show was born.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.480
[Amit Varma]: I've elaborated on the origin story in episode 202 58 of the show.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.120
[Amit Varma]: The point is that it began because of a happy accident.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.820
[Amit Varma]: And I was open to that happy accident happening.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Since then, many episodes of the show have happened because I left space for serendipity.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.520
[Amit Varma]: As my guest today would say, I met someone interesting at a gathering, or I picked up

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.040
[Amit Varma]: a book casually somewhere, or I entered a rabbit hole and found an interesting person

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.040
[Amit Varma]: waiting for me.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Being an introvert who doesn't like to party, I don't quote serendipity as much as I would

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
[Amit Varma]: like to.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.640
[Amit Varma]: But so much that is good in my life began as a happy accident.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.360
[Amit Varma]: The friends I have, the books that shaped me, the ways in which I changed as a person.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.180
[Amit Varma]: So even though I often like to be alone, I also try these days to leave a little space

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.080
[Amit Varma]: for these accidents to happen.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.680
[Amit Varma]: John Lennon once said, life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.280
[Amit Varma]: I say let it happen.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.020
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.880
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Abhijit Bhaluri, who started off living a conventional life, made a little

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.000
[Amit Varma]: space for serendipity, kept himself open to new experiences, and shifted neatly from a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.320
[Amit Varma]: corporate career to the creator economy.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Abhijit has written many books on his journey, the latest being Dreamers and Unicorns, and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.880
[Amit Varma]: they all come as a culmination of a process.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.480
[Amit Varma]: First he leaves himself open to experiences, then he learns from them and forms frameworks

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.040
[Amit Varma]: to understand them.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.040
[Amit Varma]: After that, he applies those frameworks in other contexts to understand the world and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.920
[Amit Varma]: his own self a little better.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
[Amit Varma]: And finally, he teaches them to others, either in real or virtual classrooms or through books

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
[Amit Varma]: and videos.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.040
[Amit Varma]: I found this process fascinating, and I loved hearing about Abhijit's journey.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to that though, a public service message.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: The 23rd cohort of the online course I teach, The Art of Clear Writing, is now open for

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: registration.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.080
[Amit Varma]: It's spread over four weekends, has much interaction, exercises with feedback, and culminates in

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.120
[Amit Varma]: a vibrant online community featuring students from the 22 cohorts before this.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960
[Amit Varma]: It costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST, or around $150.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.360
[Amit Varma]: You can go to indiauncut.com slash clearwriting to register.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And even if you're listening to this late, I conduct the course every month, so go to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.240
[Amit Varma]: that link for more details, indiauncut.com slash clearwriting.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, let's take a commercial break before we talk to Abhijit.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
[Amit Varma]: All around us we hear about unicorns, and many of these unicorns create notional value

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.000
[Amit Varma]: in the world of bits and bytes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.200
[Amit Varma]: But the sponsor of today's episode is a giant company that creates real value in the world

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200
[Amit Varma]: of atoms.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.940
[Amit Varma]: KNST is an aluminium formwork company that was founded in 2014 and is today India's largest

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.240
[Amit Varma]: and the world's largest growing formwork company.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, what is formwork?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.920
[Amit Varma]: It's a building technology that makes construction more efficient, sustainable, and scalable.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Until recently, Indian real estate had to outsource this tech to foreign companies at

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.080
[Amit Varma]: crazy prices.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.800
[Amit Varma]: KNST changed the game with their state-of-the-art automated unit and the largest design team

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.880
[Amit Varma]: in the industry that uses virtual reality to make their customized aluminium products.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.360
[Amit Varma]: They've had a massive impact that is unseen in two ways.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.280
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, they make the building they are used for sturdier and more reliable.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.940
[Amit Varma]: Two, they've brought value to the entire industry, and not just the industry, but also the environment

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.040
[Amit Varma]: as projects that use KNST use less wood and are friendlier to the natural world around

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.080
[Amit Varma]: This shows that not only is sustainable development possible in these urbanizing times, but also

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.840
[Amit Varma]: that India can show the way in how it's done.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Their slogan goes, Desh Mein Bana, Desh Ka Apna.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.760
[Amit Varma]: And companies like this are the Atmanirbhar India I like.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.640
[Amit Varma]: They're already multinational, by the way, building not just for this country, but for

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
[Amit Varma]: the world.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.960
[Amit Varma]: To know more about KNST, check out knstaluform.com.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.400
[Amit Varma]: The link will be at the bottom of the show notes.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400
[Amit Varma]: KNST.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Technology, design, innovation, they all come together in KNST.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.040
[Guest]: Avijit, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.920
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for having me here.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, I really enjoyed reading your book and watching all your videos and all of that,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.720
[Amit Varma]: because you are doing something so well in that, that I kind of aspire to and try to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.720
[Amit Varma]: do myself, which is that you look at the world through broad frameworks, you've taken a step

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.360
[Amit Varma]: back, you know, most people, they're just involved in the everyday running of the world

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.560
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And you've taken a step back and you're looking, you're getting meta, you're looking at first

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.800
[Amit Varma]: principles, you're applying them to everything that you see.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.920
[Amit Varma]: It is not only in your field HR, which you're an expert in, but you can extrapolate any

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.240
[Amit Varma]: of them to a whole bunch of things like while reading your book, I was like, this is a thought

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.680
[Amit Varma]: I have had about that.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.780
[Amit Varma]: And now I see it in this context.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And all the dots are kind of joining.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.440
[Amit Varma]: So I'm really looking forward to our conversation today.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.880
[Amit Varma]: But the part of it that I'm looking forward to is really not about that, you know, these

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.640
[Amit Varma]: days, I love kind of getting into people's early lives and memories, their childhoods

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.960
[Amit Varma]: Because I think in this modern world, where we are always stuck in the immediate moment,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.600
[Amit Varma]: and we take everything, every change for granted, I think we often forget how much our lives

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.560
[Amit Varma]: have changed, like I'm 48.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.560
[Amit Varma]: And I look back on how I used to live in the 80s and 90s, and all of that, ki abhi toh

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.880
[Amit Varma]: we have all the music in the world available to us.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Tab matlab you managed to get a mixtape together, which you wanted, it was such an achievement.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, it was a way of wooing someone, in fact, making a mixtape for her, you know,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.600
[Amit Varma]: you're giving a part of your soul, you know, so I love to sit with guests of my vintage

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.280
[Amit Varma]: or older, and just kind of talk about those times, not just in terms of a nostalgia for

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.120
[Amit Varma]: artifacts, ki cassette toh after all is an artifact, it's but, you know, a certain way

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.160
[Amit Varma]: of living also, kyuki unn deno kya tha, you don't have a smartphone, you don't have constant

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.600
[Amit Varma]: distractions, you're forced into me time, you're forced into a kind of therav and all

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're forced to spend more time with yourself, you're forced to talk to people,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, one of the happy, one of the joys of doing this podcast is that I can sit with

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.360
[Amit Varma]: people and I can talk to them and I can make a connection.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.520
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, too much of the time we are on our laptop, with this illusion that ki hum

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.320
[Amit Varma]: toh connected hai, humare toh itne dost hai, but you know, it's getting more and more disconnected

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.600
[Amit Varma]: from the real world.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about your childhood, you know, when were you born?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120
[Amit Varma]: Where were you born?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: What were your early years like?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.560
[Guest]: When I think of childhood, it's almost like a collage of memories, you know, my father

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.240
[Guest]: was in the railways, while I was born in Kolkata, but you know, I spent the first four or five

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.360
[Guest]: years of my life in many different places in southern India, because dad was part of

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.600
[Guest]: southern railways.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.120
[Guest]: And by the time I was closer to, you know, four and a half, five, he got shifted to northern

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.400
[Guest]: railway and we started our life in the north.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.240
[Guest]: So we first went to Bikaner, we stayed there.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.000
[Guest]: I have a couple of snatches of memories from that.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.760
[Guest]: From there, we went to Delhi, which is where I went to school first.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.560
[Guest]: And then dad somewhere, you know, by the time I was in the fourth standard, he got transferred

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.200
[Guest]: to Jodhpur, which is where I, you know, spent about four years.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.480
[Guest]: And I also met my future wife there, you know, so I was all of 10 and that's the so yeah,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:02.520
[Guest]: no, I didn't start that early, but I met her there, then got back to Delhi again.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.160
[Guest]: And Delhi was where while dad changed, you know, within northern railway and the board

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.160
[Guest]: and all of that and multiple times, but I was there in Delhi and grew up, school was

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:22.040
[Guest]: in Delhi, went to college and Sriram College of Commerce, did economics, and then went

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.280
[Guest]: to XLRI Jamshedpur, which is where I fell in love with the place and came back to Delhi

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.120
[Guest]: when I started working, I did a degree in law in the evening.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.960
[Guest]: And well, then from there, it's been like in multiple cities, you know, so I was first

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.960
[Guest]: in Delhi, then I went to Kolkata, then I went to Jamshedpur, then I went from there to Ahmedabad,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:52.320
[Guest]: from Ahmedabad to Mumbai, Mumbai to Malaysia, Malaysia to US, US to Gurgaon, Gurgaon to

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.800
[Guest]: now Bangalore and Bangalore has been home for past almost 12 years now.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Did that early moving around, you know, in a sense, set you apart from the other people

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.920
[Amit Varma]: around you, because in that time, you don't have the internet, you don't have that exposure

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920
[Amit Varma]: to the world.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.840
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, you're limited and you're shaped by geography, what is around you and your

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.560
[Amit Varma]: peers and all that.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.840
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder for, you know, people whose parents are in the services or in the army, and they're

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.520
[Amit Varma]: moving around and all that.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.240
[Amit Varma]: Would you say that in some ways that, you know, you look at the world a little differently

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.280
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps you realize that only in retrospect, obviously, but do you feel that had any part

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.640
[Amit Varma]: in how you kind of develop?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:39.120
[Guest]: I certainly think that, you know, for me, I was a very deeply introverted kid, though

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.280
[Guest]: anybody who sees me today will cannot imagine that, but because of all this moving around

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:52.240
[Guest]: in different places in schools and, you know, localities, I was a person who found a lot

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.920
[Guest]: of friendship amongst books, not friends.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.120
[Guest]: So I had very few friends till the time I was in class 11, 12.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.920
[Guest]: And all my friends that you see, you know, are largely from the time either, you know,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.700
[Guest]: one or two from the times in school, but most of them are college and beyond.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.960
[Guest]: So when I think of friends, I really think of them more from, let's say, the time I started

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:23.040
[Guest]: doing my postgrad, you know, so that's where, so over time, I've developed deeper friendships.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.800
[Guest]: The most people say that it's harder to make friends when you grow older.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.500
[Guest]: My friend circle has sort of really grown much later.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.720
[Guest]: My childhood was really, you know, spent in a lot of reading.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:45.400
[Guest]: I read a lot of Bengali books first, and then I went on to reading the usual English literature,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.200
[Guest]: you know, which is common, you know, the usual classics and everything.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.160
[Guest]: I started discovering Hindi literature when I went into school, when I came back from

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.640
[Guest]: Jodhpur in class eight, when I started.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640
[Guest]: That's when I discovered Hindi literature and I, you know, spent, I think, eighth to

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.800
[Guest]: 10th was almost entirely only Hindi literature.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.040
[Guest]: And then went on to, you know, the usual other stuff and that's how it was.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.960
[Amit Varma]: So are you still trilingual as it were, like, my God, reading books in three languages is,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, one of the things I often think is that on the one hand, I'm extremely lucky

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.200
[Amit Varma]: to live in a multilingual country, like so many people in Europe can just speak one language.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.240
[Amit Varma]: And all of us can, you know, speak two or three comfortably and perhaps understand more

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.840
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.360
[Amit Varma]: So on one hand, there is that good luck, but on the other hand, I haven't made much of

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.160
[Amit Varma]: it because most of my engagement with the world will be in English, I'll be all my reading

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.400
[Amit Varma]: now is in English, and so on.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.840
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that that's a loss, because when I interact with guests, for example, who might

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.760
[Amit Varma]: have grown up in Hindi medium, and I realized that their view of the world is also just

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.400
[Amit Varma]: enriched by the extra angles that they see, it is not that, you know, one view is better

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.240
[Amit Varma]: than the other or anything like that.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.860
[Amit Varma]: But they've got an added layer.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And I had an opportunity to get the added layer, but I don't have the added layer.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.100
[Amit Varma]: And in some ways that constrains how I kind of look at the world.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.200
[Amit Varma]: And in a similar sense, the sense that I get by looking at your career arc or reading your

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.480
[Amit Varma]: books or watching your videos is that while you have sort of operated at that higher level

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.840
[Amit Varma]: of ideas, you know, that has been kind of given flesh by you're actually interacting

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.760
[Amit Varma]: with people all the time speaking to people all the time, you know, there's this moving

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.920
[Amit Varma]: story in one of your talks or books, I forget what but you know, you were in a train once

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.000
[Amit Varma]: you were traveling from somewhere to somewhere and you know, you fall asleep and when you

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.360
[Amit Varma]: wake up, the train is at a station there is absolutely nobody there.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.120
[Amit Varma]: It's a small mufasil thing where no one stops and you realize that the train must have broken

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.360
[Amit Varma]: down and maybe the next train will come tomorrow, you have no information, you have no idea

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.360
[Amit Varma]: what to do.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.320
[Amit Varma]: You go out, you meet a sadhu outside, he invites you to sit with him and then you sit with

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.160
[Amit Varma]: him and you chat with him and you talk with him and all of that.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And I found it such a charming and lovely story because to many of us, that sadhu would

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.400
[Amit Varma]: be unseen as it were, if you you know, look at the title of the show, the scene in the

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400
[Amit Varma]: unseen.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.120
[Amit Varma]: So you've engaged, but at the same time, you've taken a step back and thought and how much

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.720
[Amit Varma]: of that you know, what is the value of these kinds of engagements and what is the value

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.360
[Amit Varma]: therefore of being comfortable in these languages?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Because these languages really in a sense exist in different worlds, right?

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.680
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, you almost have to code shift sometimes.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know, tell me a little bit.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.680
[Guest]: When you live in different cities, you know, one of the first things that happens is you

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:46.160
[Guest]: begin to interact with people when you step out of the place and many of these were perhaps

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.080
[Guest]: not deep friendships in my case, you know, but I think that I lived in two worlds.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.520
[Guest]: If you look at what was seen was specifically the books that I was reading at that point

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.840
[Guest]: of time, I was a big fan of the radio, you know, because in our home, dad was very fond

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840
[Guest]: of music.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.840
[Guest]: My mother played Hawaiian guitar and classical Hawaiian guitar.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.600
[Guest]: And that's where I picked up my own love for music.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.400
[Guest]: So I used to sort of listen to a lot of it.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.360
[Guest]: I would read a lot of books.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.160
[Guest]: But I think the only conversations I would have would be with people that I would meet

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160
[Guest]: on the streets.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.940
[Guest]: And, you know, so if I would be sent to run an errand, then in which case I would stop

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.760
[Guest]: by and chat with the person who was the shopkeeper, some of the people who were there.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:43.240
[Guest]: And that's where I, you know, actually I have been to more homes of strangers in some sense.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.280
[Guest]: You know, then I have been to the homes of many friends for the simple reason that, you

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.080
[Guest]: know, somebody would say, come have a cup of tea and we continue our conversation and

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.600
[Guest]: chat with them.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:03.320
[Guest]: And because I was really always a fairly quiet introverted kid, I listened a lot to those

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.740
[Guest]: conversations and that I think shaped my world view, you know, understanding how people across

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.640
[Guest]: different sectors, different strata, how they lived and worked.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.880
[Guest]: I think that really shaped my world a lot in terms of what I thought the world was like,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.000
[Guest]: you know, it was formed by that.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.600
[Guest]: When you think about, you know, school and college friends, in many ways, when I look

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.640
[Guest]: at the school that I spent bulk of my time in, in Delhi, you know, most of the people

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.280
[Guest]: did come from varying backgrounds.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.440
[Guest]: But since I didn't have too many friends in school, I didn't really get to experience

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: that world a lot and, you know, a handful of people.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.700
[Guest]: So a lot of this happened through, you know, when I would go and talk to people for some

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.080
[Guest]: of the stuff that I was writing in school or college.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.960
[Guest]: And when I traveled with my parents, conversations with strangers, you know, that I would have

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.900
[Guest]: in the train, those would be long drawn conversations.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.240
[Guest]: And somewhere, I think my philosophy of living life without looking for a return on investment,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:21.240
[Guest]: you know, no ROI kind of a thing, that just didn't happen because, you know, you were

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.680
[Guest]: traveling together for a while and you shared each other's world, you shared food with each

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.680
[Guest]: other.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.320
[Guest]: So really, you know, for me, those conversations were really precious.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.480
[Guest]: So the incident about the sadhu that you mentioned, wasn't one of those things where the train

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480
[Guest]: broke down.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.600
[Guest]: I used to sleep, you know, I was a really deep sleeper.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.760
[Guest]: So I just slept off.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.800
[Guest]: I didn't realize that everybody had left.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.040
[Guest]: And so then I met this sadhu, as you mentioned, and I spent time on that completely abandoned

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040
[Guest]: railway station.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.400
[Guest]: You know, I think no trains stopped there, except for these goods trains and all that.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.280
[Guest]: So I spent time chatting with this sadhu from the street and learned about his life, you

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.400
[Guest]: know, what made him become a sadhu.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.920
[Guest]: And then, you know, when you are young, you're curious.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.040
[Guest]: So you ask a lot of those questions that, why did you become a sadhu?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.320
[Guest]: So how do you manage?

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.640
[Guest]: What happens when nobody gives you food to eat?

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.640
[Guest]: So you're right, somewhere it opens up a different world for you.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.440
[Guest]: For example, when you look at sadhus, that is evidence of the fact that there's a very,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.720
[Guest]: very large streak of generosity in people, because these guys, they don't work anywhere,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.960
[Guest]: they don't have a source of income, so to say, yet they live.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960
[Guest]: And not just one or two.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.440
[Guest]: I mean, there are thousands of people who do that.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:54.120
[Guest]: So there is an element of, you know, generosity.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.400
[Guest]: And this is something when I was back home chatting with my father, and I was explaining,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.920
[Guest]: you know, the tremendous experience of spending time with this sadhu.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.080
[Guest]: And this was my father's interpretation.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.400
[Guest]: He was saying that, you know, that's beautiful, because this is evidence that there is optimism

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.440
[Guest]: in people, in the world, that you can share, you know, that people can give without any

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.720
[Guest]: expectation of return or some such thing.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.760
[Guest]: And every, even though it's a momentary engagement, you still give to a stranger.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:36.240
[Guest]: So I think it was those kind of things and travel, you know, into the smaller towns,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.520
[Guest]: especially of Rajasthan.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.080
[Guest]: It was really precious, because I got a chance to, you know, sometimes a car would break

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.400
[Guest]: down as it was quite common those days.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.920
[Guest]: And you have some of the most fascinating experiences of your life, you know.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:59.360
[Guest]: So I remember we were going through, you know, close to Pokhran.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.480
[Guest]: That time, you know, the blast hadn't taken place, and it was a little further away from

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480
[Guest]: there.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.200
[Guest]: And it was a very tiny place called Badariya Latti.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:15.080
[Guest]: And so tiny that you probably, you know, you can't find it in a railway timetable.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.360
[Guest]: And the car had broken down, there were a couple of us, my cousins and I, we were there,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.680
[Guest]: my aunt, mother, father, uncles, all these guys were there.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:30.880
[Guest]: We were traveling together and, you know, the driver said, there's absolutely nothing

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
[Guest]: here.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.680
[Guest]: So we'll have to wait till sunrise and then wait for a car to come by and then get the

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680
[Guest]: tyre fixed.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.960
[Guest]: We were waiting there and, you know, there was a villager who was coming by, he was walking,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.120
[Guest]: perhaps going back home.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.200
[Guest]: And he stopped to ask, you know, what's wrong.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.800
[Guest]: And then he said, you know, I can take one person along with the tyre to the next village

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.480
[Guest]: where there's a person who can fix it.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.600
[Guest]: But then why don't all of you come and wait in my home?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.160
[Guest]: So he went there, he sent his brother off, you know, on a bike and he sent it off.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.680
[Guest]: So the driver went to get the tyre repaired.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.280
[Guest]: We waited there and he said, would you like to have food?

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.040
[Guest]: And we said, no, no, no, we'll, you know, get back and then we'll have some.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.520
[Guest]: So he said, no, no, you must have, you have come to my home for the first time.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.040
[Guest]: So the first time you've been here and you must have a meal with us.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.640
[Guest]: And we were waiting in the courtyard, there was, you know, the lady was perhaps inside

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.880
[Guest]: and she didn't come out, she was still in ghoonghat.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: And he sort of put a set of plates in front of us and said, you'll have to share plates

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.240
[Guest]: because there was, you know, I think there were three or four plates.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: So he did that and he said, I'll just be back, na bhi aaya.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.520
[Guest]: And he disappeared for almost like two or three hours.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.720
[Guest]: And we were really, you know, all kinds of emotions go through you that, you know, are

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.280
[Guest]: we in a safe place?

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.960
[Guest]: You know, what made this person do this?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.360
[Guest]: Why are we here?

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.040
[Guest]: You know, has he sort of gone off with the driver?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.720
[Guest]: And then how long is he going to take?

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.360
[Guest]: When is he going to be back?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:25.160
[Guest]: He came back after three hours and he came back and he apologized profusely and said,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:31.160
[Guest]: I had gone off to the village money lender because I didn't have money.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:37.600
[Guest]: So I had to first borrow money, pick up the stuff and then bring it home to cook.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.800
[Guest]: So I apologize for keeping you hungry.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.640
[Guest]: And I was, this is an incident I will never in my life forget that, you know, somebody

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.840
[Guest]: takes a loan to feed a stranger.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:59.600
[Guest]: So while the sadhus, you know, story is one story of hope and optimism and generosity.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.800
[Guest]: But I think that when you look at the generosity of the stranger who I've never met subsequently,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.920
[Guest]: who takes a loan, it's a different matter, you know, my parents sort of paid and all

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920
[Guest]: that stuff.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.480
[Guest]: But it's not about whether finally we paid for it or not.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.320
[Guest]: But the point was this person took a loan to feed a stranger.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.640
[Guest]: It can happen only, you know, in these places in India.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.320
[Guest]: And I have so many of these incidents.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.600
[Guest]: I grew up with the view of small town India.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.440
[Guest]: Some of the places I don't have that much of an exposure to villages.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:43.800
[Guest]: But when you travel, it gets you to, especially when you travel in a train, you get to have

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.360
[Guest]: the kind of conversations that you have.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:53.240
[Guest]: So every time I think of, you know, the visual that comes to my mind when I hear your podcast,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:05.240
[Guest]: that these 12-hour, 15-hour, 24-hour conversations are only possible in a train, you know, that

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:11.280
[Guest]: you are sharing a meal, you kind of, you know, you have a cup of tea, he or she shares a

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.560
[Guest]: story as you are getting off, you get a glass of water.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.880
[Guest]: So it's a very meandering, slow life.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.280
[Guest]: And because of my father being in the railways, we traveled quite a bit.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.120
[Guest]: I was privy to that world.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.400
[Amit Varma]: So much to think about here.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I had written an essay a while back, which I linked from the show notes talking

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.240
[Amit Varma]: about the relationship between form and content, where the point I was making is that, you

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.880
[Amit Varma]: know, if I was doing a five-minute interview podcast, I'd approach it completely differently.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.600
[Amit Varma]: I won't even have to read your book.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.680
[Amit Varma]: I could just, you know, ask you a couple of stock questions.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.960
[Amit Varma]: If I'm doing a half an hour podcast, and maybe I have to read your book, but I don't have

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960
[Amit Varma]: to read anything else.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And I don't have to think around it.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.280
[Amit Varma]: If I'm doing a four-hour podcast, it goes into a whole different territory, where I

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.020
[Amit Varma]: have to actually listen, where it's no longer about, you know, like one of the rules on

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.260
[Amit Varma]: my show is for me, there are no rules for the guests.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:12.280
[Amit Varma]: But one of the guidelines I set myself is never interrupt, just listen, because too

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.160
[Amit Varma]: many of us in the real world, we like, as Stephen Covey said, we listen to respond,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.300
[Amit Varma]: we don't listen to understand, right?

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.840
[Amit Varma]: So the ego is always involved in that act.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And my point was that the form not only shapes the content, it shapes a person, because I'm

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.400
[Amit Varma]: sure I've become a better listener and more patient and more open because I'm doing this

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.400
[Amit Varma]: week after week after week.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:43.440
[Amit Varma]: And what you just said is almost like an extension to that, taken off to an entire society, that

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.200
[Amit Varma]: you travel in trains, and you have these long expanses of time, and it's an age before smartphones

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200
[Amit Varma]: and you're surrounded by strangers.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.480
[Amit Varma]: So you talk to strangers and there is that curiosity and you talk about their lives and

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.960
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And modern life in the way that I live it is simply not like that those opportunities

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240
[Amit Varma]: are not there.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, I do this podcast, so I have these conversations outside of this, it's not there.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Outside of this, everything is instrumental.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.400
[Amit Varma]: You get into an Uber, you go somewhere, if you travel, you fly by plane, you're not talking,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.280
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned somewhere else that you always make it a point to chat with the person sitting

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.640
[Amit Varma]: beside you on a plane.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640
[Amit Varma]: I don't do that.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm in my shell, you know, that's kind of how it is.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.960
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, I kind of grew up extremely introverted as well, where, you know, Sartre's

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:32.760
[Amit Varma]: saying of hell is other people, that that was absolutely how I thought about it.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I kind of think about without being able to put it into practice,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.560
[Amit Varma]: that we need to get out more, we need to meet people more, we need to talk more, we need

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:47.000
[Amit Varma]: to be more open, because I think a lot of the fractures that I see around me, like why

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.400
[Amit Varma]: is social media the most toxic fractured place?

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.260
[Amit Varma]: It is because people aren't face to face.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, they aren't talking to another person, they are talking to some constructed idea

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.200
[Amit Varma]: of a person, and they are going down those lines.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what are sort of your thoughts on this then that it is not just a trivial

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.220
[Amit Varma]: detail that, okay, we had more time than we have less time now.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.800
[Amit Varma]: But I think just the different rhythms of life have made us different human beings.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.240
[Amit Varma]: They've made us different people, like, you know, one of my older guests Prem Panekar,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.720
[Amit Varma]: not one of my older guests, a guest I had a while ago, I don't want to call him old.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:33.160
[Amit Varma]: So I did a long episode with him, which beautiful episode where he really opened up.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And there also, he shared an example of a similar act of kindness as you experienced

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.760
[Amit Varma]: in a rural place somewhere.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud here completely.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.640
[Amit Varma]: But I wonder if you're more likely to see this in a smaller town and a rural place,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.620
[Amit Varma]: because your sense of time, and again, you spoke, you've spoken how different generations

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.040
[Amit Varma]: view time differently.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.280
[Amit Varma]: But even across spaces, it might be the case that people view time differently, because

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.160
[Amit Varma]: in a city, there are so many things you can do with your time.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And it can get frenetic, which may be in a quiet rural area or a village, there aren't

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.440
[Amit Varma]: so many things you can do with your time.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.180
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, it becomes more meaningful when a stranger appears somewhere.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And that human contact kind of takes on another quality.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.200
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of just thinking aloud, but what are your...

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:24.360
[Guest]: You know, I would say that when you look at the lives that we lead here now in the urban

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:31.000
[Guest]: areas, a lot of it is, you know, really like social media, Twitter.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.440
[Guest]: The conversations are Twitter conversations, you know, 280 characters.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.440
[Guest]: At best, you will ask a stranger, you know, where is this particular address?

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.840
[Guest]: Or, you know, how do I find this particular person or whatever?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.200
[Guest]: It's a very transactional conversation with strangers.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:56.960
[Guest]: I think the yardstick of, you know, the quality of life comes from the quality of conversations

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.600
[Guest]: you have with strangers, not just with people.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: Whereas in many of these places, as I've traveled through, you know, rural India, small town

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Guest]: India, etc.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.040
[Guest]: A lot of it has been with people who are strangers, but who have, in many ways, you know, opened

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.680
[Guest]: up their hearts when we have sat and traveled together for 24 hours.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.720
[Guest]: The train breaks down somewhere.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.440
[Guest]: And there's a, you know, accident somewhere ahead and you kind of, you know, you're stuck

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.140
[Guest]: in that compartment for another, you know, six, seven extra hours.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.360
[Guest]: And all of it is because of, you know, those conversations that made it so memorable.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:45.720
[Guest]: I think when you make space when you travel, so in my case, now, unfortunately, you know,

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.280
[Guest]: the number of times that I travel by train has almost dwindled to a zero.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:56.200
[Guest]: The number of times that I travel by bus has, you know, diminished.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:02.000
[Guest]: The result of that is your worldview becomes so homogenous.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.800
[Guest]: You know, you are not meeting people from different societies, different cultures, different

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.040
[Guest]: social strata.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.960
[Guest]: You're meeting all the people who speak the way you do, whose worldview is the same.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.680
[Guest]: They work in the same kinds of places.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:26.800
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think there is a poverty of experiences that, you know, you are limited

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800
[Guest]: by.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:34.680
[Guest]: You have to structure it consciously and say that, I am going to meet people, you know,

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680
[Guest]: who are different.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.640
[Guest]: And the only way that happens is when you build in a space for serendipity, you know,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.240
[Guest]: you try out different things without really thinking about this whole question, what's

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.880
[Guest]: the point of doing this?

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.880
[Guest]: I think a number of times we shut off our diverse experience because you ask this whole

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.120
[Guest]: question that, what's the point of doing this?

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:03.840
[Guest]: So when you think about this whole philosophy of living without looking for ROI in a conversation,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.520
[Guest]: in a relationship, in going to a place, and taking a road which is not the shortest distance

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.280
[Guest]: most efficient, but perhaps more interesting.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.500
[Guest]: So when you go to a city, I mean, there's one way to think about it is you can either

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.820
[Guest]: do those, you know, seven must-see places in so-and-so city.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.360
[Guest]: The other could be to actually, you know, step into a shop and strike up a conversation

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.440
[Guest]: with somebody and very often starts with a transactional question that, you know, what

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.560
[Guest]: do I do about this, that, and the other.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.880
[Guest]: I have seen that most of the times, you know, the strangers will start chatting with you

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.240
[Guest]: and tell you stuff which you will never find in a regular toolbox or whatever.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.480
[Guest]: So you discover, really, to use the phrase that you use, you move from the seen to the

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.520
[Guest]: unseen when you are seeing it through others' eyes.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.040
[Guest]: When you are looking at it from your eyes, you are constantly filtering.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.760
[Guest]: You don't actually get to experience too much of something which is new because you see

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.080
[Guest]: something, you say, yeah, okay, I know what this is.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:21.320
[Guest]: And if I had no exposure, let's say, to a setup like this, I would immediately, you

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.360
[Guest]: know, ask you 15 questions.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.360
[Guest]: What do you do with that?

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360
[Guest]: How does this work?

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.360
[Guest]: Why have you kept that?

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.800
[Guest]: So those are the questions I would have asked you.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.120
[Guest]: But the moment I know what the place is, even if there is something new, there's a great

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:43.200
[Guest]: possibility that, you know, I will miss it because I have predetermined in my head, oh,

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.700
[Guest]: I know this.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.120
[Guest]: So that's the curse of knowledge.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:55.040
[Guest]: You stop listening and you kind of assume a certain level for the other person too.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.800
[Guest]: And in that you lose out all the details and nuances.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.800
[Guest]: Then you are really talking in broad strokes because I assume you know what I'm talking

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800
[Amit Varma]: about.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is one of the things I talk to my writing students all the time about avoiding

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.320
[Amit Varma]: the curse of knowledge, that when you write something, you have a certain understanding

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.320
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.840
[Amit Varma]: So you assume there's a certain baseline understanding the reader has as well.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of take that for granted and you, I loved your phrase, poverty of experiences.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.880
[Amit Varma]: And I think this plays out across two dimensions.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.280
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, the dimension you mentioned that you're not talking enough to people.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.000
[Amit Varma]: So you're not seeing the world through their eyes.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.680
[Amit Varma]: And that constricts us like, you know, I did an episode with the writer Amitabh Kumar recently.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And he said one of the exercises he used to set himself as a young person was he would

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.560
[Amit Varma]: enter a room and when he would leave, he would ask himself, how much of the room can I remember?

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is, even the way our eyes take in information, we only actually notice a

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.920
[Amit Varma]: few things, but our brain fills in the rest, right, based on what we kind of expect to

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920
[Amit Varma]: be there.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think there was a cognitive science experiment, where, you know, a group of people

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.600
[Amit Varma]: were told, okay, here's a basketball game, you're going to watch a video of it, tell

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.080
[Amit Varma]: me how many times the ball bounces.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And actually, what happened was that they managed to count how many times the ball bounces,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.640
[Amit Varma]: but they didn't notice a gorilla.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And because in the video, there was a gorilla walking from one end to the other, that's

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.800
[Amit Varma]: chilling around, but they're completely focused on the ball.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.720
[Amit Varma]: So that's like the scene and the unseen, the unseen is a gorilla.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.120
[Amit Varma]: And I think about this in the context of our everyday lives also, that I might be at a

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.880
[Amit Varma]: traffic signal in my car, and my windows are rolled up and the AC is on.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Everything that's happening outside is unseen, there might be, you know, a beggar with his

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.980
[Amit Varma]: kids sitting on the pavement down below.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's unseen.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.840
[Amit Varma]: So I've trained myself to kind of not see that aspect of it.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, one way of getting past this poverty of experiences, like you said, is just talk

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.560
[Amit Varma]: to people.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Another way is by reading, by reading and showing that kind of interest in the world.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Like a friend and I were discussing recently, and I don't know if you've noticed this in

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.280
[Amit Varma]: the many companies you worked in, or whether the thought has ever crossed your mind.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.200
[Amit Varma]: And he's a CXO level person.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.120
[Amit Varma]: So he said that, you know, when I go out for lunch or dinner with my fellow leadership

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.160
[Amit Varma]: guys who are all running the company, I don't know what to talk about.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.360
[Amit Varma]: It's that same homogenous problem you mentioned, that they're all on that one track, and they'll

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.760
[Amit Varma]: talk about a basic set of cliched things, but he can't discuss books with them, he can't

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.400
[Amit Varma]: discuss movies with them.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, all of that is kind of out of bounds.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.320
[Amit Varma]: And for him, it was a lament that what is it with us, he asked me that, are we the freaks?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, reading is a way of sort of getting past the poverty of experience, like

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.760
[Amit Varma]: we are born to live one life, but through reading, we can live the lives of others.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's unlimited.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.240
[Amit Varma]: And you've mentioned that reading was a big part of your growing up in all these languages,

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.880
[Amit Varma]: first Bangla, and then English and Hindi.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.140
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about, like, first, do you have any additional thought on people

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:58.480
[Amit Varma]: having constrained lives in terms of interests, like, you know, in terms of the things that

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.560
[Amit Varma]: they care about, and like, for example, just to stay on this track a moment before we get

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.960
[Amit Varma]: to the books, earlier, you used an interesting phrase, where you were speaking about the

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.480
[Amit Varma]: sadhu, and you said, I spoke to him a lot, because the young are curious, I had the curiosity

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.600
[Amit Varma]: of the young.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's another thing I've noticed that, as we grow older, some of those things that

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.200
[Amit Varma]: we have as young people, we lose.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.120
[Amit Varma]: And some of it is, of course, energy is the biggest thing.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.320
[Amit Varma]: But that curiosity also, that, you know, you're always looking around and whatever, and at

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.400
[Amit Varma]: some point, you get jaded, and you lose that.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's a terrible, terrible thing.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.000
[Amit Varma]: There are other good things about growing up, perhaps, but that's a terrible, terrible

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Amit Varma]: thing.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.480
[Amit Varma]: So first, what's your sense of this, that do people just enter a lane and they become

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.960
[Amit Varma]: like really narrow in the way they look at the world?

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And two, then after that, if you have any thoughts on this, we can talk about the books

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.440
[Amit Varma]: you read.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:57.680
[Guest]: You know, when, when you look at a couple of different things that I've observed that

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.600
[Guest]: I did my master's from XLRH in Sheikhpura, I went and studied there.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.960
[Guest]: I did human resources.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.400
[Guest]: Actually, it was called personnel management and industrial relations at that point of

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400
[Guest]: time.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.400
[Guest]: Then that changed to HR.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.360
[Guest]: Then it's now more contemporary term is talent management because the view of how we view

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.760
[Guest]: people not just as resources or things, but how do you view them as talent?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.360
[Guest]: So that has changed.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:31.760
[Guest]: One of the things that I think what made XLRH at that point of time when I studied there

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.880
[Guest]: was the way the entrance exam was structured.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.160
[Guest]: You know, there was a lot of stuff, you had to write a little essay.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.940
[Guest]: There was a lot of quantitative stuff, a lot of convergent thinking, deductive logic, etc.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:52.520
[Guest]: But I think there was a place for, you know, we had people who had degrees in literature.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.520
[Guest]: You had people who had degrees in philosophy, you know, people who had degrees in naval

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.680
[Guest]: architecture, very diverse group.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.480
[Guest]: Today you see the entrance exam, 99% of the people in a class are homogenous.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.280
[Guest]: There are people who've done, let's say, engineering somewhere and they've come in.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:14.440
[Guest]: So I think when you look at, you know, bringing a lot of people who've been trained in convergent

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.440
[Guest]: thinking, because in science, there is only one answer, you know, that's the truth.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440
[Guest]: There's one truth.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.720
[Guest]: There's one, we are talking about data.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.880
[Guest]: There's one source of truth, whereas the arts lets you focus on insight.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880
[Guest]: It's not the data.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.160
[Guest]: You can say that, you know, 30% people, you know, do this.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.260
[Guest]: What does that really translate to?

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:43.280
[Guest]: So I think arts focuses on sensemaking a lot.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.600
[Guest]: And when you talk to people who are different, who are very different from the world that

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:54.600
[Guest]: you've inhabited, you begin to see a number of things which, from your perch, you just

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600
[Guest]: can't.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600
[Guest]: Yeah?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:04.280
[Guest]: So it's like, you know, when you are in, let's say, you are the product of this convergent

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:11.560
[Guest]: thinking and you start working, your entire focus is efficiency, which is such a killer

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.840
[Guest]: that, you know, you're really trying to do.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.640
[Guest]: So you always tell people, you know, today when you run workshops on storytelling, one

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.560
[Guest]: of the things that I notice people struggle with is when I'm talking to them about a story,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:33.280
[Guest]: their first thought is, but, you know, my boss always says, don't waste time with stories.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.400
[Guest]: Tell me what's the heart of the matter, the essence of it, the executive summary.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:45.600
[Guest]: All of it has taught us not to go beyond a curated version of life.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:53.240
[Guest]: So you don't really have an original point of view because you've not seen other dimensions.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:59.760
[Guest]: If everybody has had the same meal, you know, it's the same two things that have been, which

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: is why families are very homogenous in many ways, though between siblings, you will find

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.840
[Guest]: great differences.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.480
[Guest]: So when you sort of really look at that in organizations today, the survival process

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:19.160
[Guest]: is going to be about, you know, nurturing different people, the creative people, innovation,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.720
[Guest]: all those things.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:27.080
[Guest]: But the organization's cultures are not designed to make those things thrive because it's all

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.080
[Guest]: about, you know, a meeting is about efficiency.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.040
[Guest]: You kind of put three items on the agenda.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:37.680
[Guest]: There is no time to actually talk about, hey, but this is something that I heard in the

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.120
[Guest]: cafeteria.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.200
[Guest]: We don't do that.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.360
[Guest]: I've never seen an organization which they all do consumer research, yeah, because that's

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.280
[Guest]: where the money comes from.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:54.800
[Guest]: But, you know, I think the real source of insight would come from doing employee research,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.600
[Guest]: you know, and by that I don't mean, you know, employee engagement surveys, which are extremely

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.760
[Guest]: trivial and sort of fairly, you know, limited in their value.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.120
[Guest]: But if you really start to study the people, you won't have to run seminars to educate

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.000
[Guest]: your leaders about how do millennials think or Gen Z.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.640
[Guest]: First of all, these labels don't even apply to India.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.160
[Guest]: That's a different matter.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:24.080
[Guest]: But I'm just saying that you would form your own worldview when you speak to a cluster

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:30.640
[Guest]: of your people, not through task, but through relationships.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:36.760
[Guest]: That I first get to know who you are as a human being, and then we can decide to engage

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.760
[Guest]: together.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.680
[Guest]: You know, then I don't need to incentivize you by saying, if you did this task, you will

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest]: get this extra.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:48.760
[Guest]: You know, so the whole process of incentives and the way we structure, you know, tasks

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:55.560
[Guest]: in an organization has become very, very convergent and therefore limiting and very sort of inefficient,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:02.320
[Guest]: ironically, because the whole quest for efficiency has taken away the possibility of serendipity.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:09.160
[Guest]: You will never discover anything because the whole point is you put a research, you know,

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:17.600
[Guest]: you put a research department there, you fund it and say, by when will you produce the patent?

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.540
[Guest]: You can't, then the person is really completing the task.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.640
[Guest]: They are not really exploring, so you will not get something which is going to be amazing,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.320
[Guest]: and therefore you will feel disappointed.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.620
[Guest]: But guess who started the cycle?

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.860
[Guest]: So I think the opportunity for organizations is to really start building those kinds of

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:43.480
[Guest]: places where people can have unfiltered conversations because you build trust through unfiltered

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480
[Guest]: conversations.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.640
[Guest]: I can really tell you what I think and you listen without judgment and you tell me what

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.640
[Guest]: you think.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:55.400
[Guest]: Again, I listen without judgment and that's where you kind of, even though your point

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.380
[Guest]: of view may be a polar opposite, but we still build respect for each other, which is what

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.160
[Guest]: happens in childhood because, you know, you say, he's like this, you know, yes, I understand

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: that, but you know what, he'll always say this.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.440
[Guest]: You accept each other.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:16.800
[Guest]: That process of acceptance diminishes because you're beginning to narrow down on the field

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.320
[Guest]: of efficiency, and so you kind of say that if I network with you, you know, which is

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.880
[Guest]: the air quotes I'm using, networking is always with an end goal in mind.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:32.400
[Guest]: I network with you because it's going to, you know, benefit me somewhere, whether five

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.560
[Guest]: minutes later or five years later, it will benefit me.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:42.120
[Guest]: When you build a relationship, you are in a far more giving mode because without giving,

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.560
[Guest]: you can't build a relationship.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.120
[Guest]: As one of the guests on my podcast had said something really precious, he had said that,

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.840
[Guest]: you know, relationships are based on give and take.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.520
[Guest]: What you first give, then take.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.780
[Guest]: It comes first.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:01.440
[Guest]: And I think that in many ways was an aha moment because it sort of tells you that, okay, this

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:08.320
[Guest]: is how people, you know, have lived in the past, which is why, you know, those people

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:16.240
[Guest]: with whom I've had those conversations spread over 20 hours, 30 hours, have been things

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.560
[Guest]: that have enriched my life.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.040
[Guest]: It has led me to, you know, live a life which I have not experienced.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:31.120
[Guest]: I've heard about people, movies, books, instances, which I have not been privy to.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.360
[Guest]: And those are some of the things that, you know, have shaped me in terms of who I was.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:42.840
[Guest]: It's not been so much with, you know, my colleagues, et cetera, until much later because, you know,

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.160
[Guest]: that was different.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:51.360
[Guest]: Living in the hostel in Jamshedpur was a really very strong influence in my life because that's

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.920
[Guest]: a place where you meet people from all kinds of strata and you are, this is the two-year

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.320
[Guest]: train journey.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.400
[Guest]: You have many, many conversations with them.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.240
[Guest]: And so those are things which have, you know, shaped.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.840
[Guest]: So I think, I would sort of say that I'm a product of the conversations more than what

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840
[Guest]: I've read.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.600
[Guest]: I'm a product of conversations.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.920
[Amit Varma]: That's such a lovely phrase, a two-year train journey.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And I guess then the thing to aspire to is a lifelong train journey.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about the books now.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.080
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what was reading like?

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also interested because three different languages, right?

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680
[Amit Varma]: So what are you reading in Bangla?

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.680
[Amit Varma]: What are you reading in English?

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.240
[Amit Varma]: What are you reading in Hindi?

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.080
[Amit Varma]: What are the memorable books you remember from that time?

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:43.320
[Guest]: The very first book that I ever remember reading was, you know, a Russian book.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.200
[Guest]: Those days Russian literature used to be fairly accessible because they were, I guess, cheap

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.960
[Guest]: and readily available.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:57.040
[Guest]: And someone had gifted me this hardcover book with lots of drawings, you know, as very vivid.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.600
[Guest]: It was a pink colored cover and this title was When Daddy Was a Little Boy.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.960
[Guest]: So the story was about, you know, whoever's written their dad's childhood, you know, so

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:14.800
[Guest]: it was done through, I think it was illustrated by a kid because I, when I recall those drawings,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.640
[Guest]: they were not, or maybe it was done by an adult, but it was meant to be like that.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.840
[Guest]: That was the very first book I remember.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:27.440
[Guest]: And stories about Russia, you know, so, you know, that was one thing.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:34.240
[Guest]: In Bangla, simultaneously, it was, the very first book was Upendra Kishore Rai Choudhury,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.880
[Guest]: Satyajit Ray's, you know, grandfather.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.280
[Guest]: He wrote a book which was stories about a sparrow, Tuntu Dhirbhui.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.200
[Guest]: So it was, you know, stories about a sparrow who does a number of different things.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest]: So, and then from there, I think I read a lot through magazines, Bengali magazines like

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.080
[Guest]: Shuktara, you know, or for that matter, we used to get this literary magazine called

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:06.680
[Guest]: Desh, which is absolutely stunningly well edited and, you know, had all the writers

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:14.080
[Guest]: who I discovered, you know, in Bengali, were all people who wrote in Desh.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.520
[Guest]: And there was Shandesh, the magazine that Satyajit Ray edited.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:24.600
[Guest]: And I was, I used to sort of look at it more from the point of view of the illustrations

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:33.520
[Guest]: and kind of that was a big influence on the way that I got fascinated by, you know, illustrations,

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520
[Guest]: the way Ray did it.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:40.360
[Guest]: And I was a big fan of that, where I look at all the stories that he would write about,

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.440
[Guest]: you know, so I read those, the Feluda stories.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.800
[Guest]: So that was big.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.560
[Guest]: I also then started to read, you know, parallelly when I was reading Desh.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:56.240
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think there was a lot of, you know, children's literature, but I

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.920
[Guest]: also started, because Desh was available, I started reading a number of these novels,

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.600
[Guest]: perhaps a shade earlier than what I should have read, you know, if somebody had rationed

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.720
[Guest]: it out and structured it for me, I would have read.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.440
[Guest]: And I read, you know, the story of this artist called Milan, who wrote about his life in

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.440
[Guest]: Paris.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.320
[Guest]: He wrote about that.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:24.240
[Guest]: Travelling abroad was like just something, jisko kahde hain, wo hasrat thi.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.000
[Guest]: When you know that it's a dream which will never be fulfilled, so wo hasrat, khwaish

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.020
[Guest]: nahi thi, wo hasrat thi.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest]: So that element of travel, etc., I lived vicariously because they used to carry a lot of things

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.720
[Guest]: about when people travel, they would write about those travelogues.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:46.680
[Guest]: So that was one, but I, you know, would read all these novels that they would serialize.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:53.120
[Guest]: So you know, even though we lived in Delhi, you know, when I was reading these, I could

00:47:53.120 --> 00:48:00.000
[Guest]: sort of read, you know, Shri Shendu, Sunil Gangopadhyay, and Asha Poornadevi, and Navaneetha

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000
[Guest]: Devsen, a number of people, you know, you read, there was poetry of, you know, different

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.960
[Guest]: poets, from the classical to the contemporary, you know, so you kind of got a chance to sample

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.600
[Guest]: a lot of it.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:27.160
[Guest]: I was particularly, you know, fascinated by a number of Sunil Ganguly's, you know, writing.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.440
[Guest]: He remained, and one of my regrets is I never actually got a chance to meet him.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.640
[Guest]: I was supposed to do that.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.240
[Guest]: I was in Kolkata two days before he passed away, and it never happened, you know, one

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.440
[Guest]: of the regrets I'll always lament forever.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:49.960
[Guest]: But for me, that world was really this, you know, Tara Shankar, I read a lot of short

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960
[Guest]: stories of Bonaparte.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.400
[Guest]: I remember there were some six or seven volumes of his stories.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.800
[Guest]: So I would sort of finish each one of them during the summer vacations when I would go

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:05.240
[Guest]: to Kolkata, and I would read it at my, you know, my grandparents' place, maternal grandparents

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.240
[Guest]: were there.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240
[Guest]: And I would read those.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:14.560
[Guest]: I read Asha Poornadevi had written a sort of series, that was my one of the first exposure

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.280
[Guest]: to learning about the lives of women.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.480
[Guest]: She used to write a lot from the woman protagonist point of view.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:27.800
[Guest]: I read the usual Charu Chandra I read, and so those were some of the things that I would

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:32.520
[Guest]: say form bulk of my worldview when I was growing up.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:38.400
[Guest]: I started reading the usual English books.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:47.760
[Guest]: But when I moved to Jodhpur, when I went into Rajasthan, that's when I first realized that

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.600
[Guest]: I had not read much of Hindi literature.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:50:01.280
[Guest]: And that's when we started getting Dharmyog, Saptahik Hindustan, Chandamama, Parag, Nandan

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.600
[Guest]: and a literary book, a literary magazine called Navneet.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:13.640
[Guest]: And that's where I first read stories by Shivani or when I read many of the other people.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:20.560
[Guest]: I discovered the poetry of various writers in Hindi.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.520
[Guest]: I read a lot of Premchand, which I was very deeply moved by.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: And I sort of did that and that carried on all the way till I think I was in class 8,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
[Guest]: 9.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.200
[Guest]: It was again, so I would say until perhaps class 4, it was entirely Bengali and then

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.640
[Guest]: that stream remained.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:47.240
[Guest]: Then I layered on, you know, the Hindi literature at that point of time, somewhere Hindi literature

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.360
[Guest]: took a dip after I finished class 10, 11.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.640
[Guest]: I think perhaps from college, I didn't, you know, read as much.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.240
[Guest]: But I heard a lot of Hindi on radio.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.720
[Guest]: So radio was a passion for me, you know.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:11.440
[Guest]: So I started doing a little bit of work for All India Radio and, you know, as a kid, go

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.760
[Guest]: there and write little pieces which would be read out and feel really nice about it.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.240
[Guest]: And then I started, you know, learning some of these shows on All India Radio, which gave

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.160
[Guest]: me an opportunity to hear the voices that I had grown up listening to, you know, Devki

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:35.920
[Guest]: Nandan Pandey, Melville DeMello, Shorojit Sengupta, Lothika Ratnam, you know, Varun

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.040
[Guest]: Haldar.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.160
[Guest]: These were people I met in the newsroom.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.720
[Guest]: I used to read the news for All India Radio at some point of time.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:51.480
[Guest]: And then as I did that, then it opened up my interest in writing, media, drawing, all

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.720
[Guest]: of that started to come alive at that point of time.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.840
[Guest]: So I, you know, edited a Hindi magazine when I was in school in 11th and 12th, an interschool

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.200
[Guest]: Hindi magazine.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.640
[Guest]: And I would do interviews with musicians and write about that.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:13.720
[Guest]: So it gave me a legitimate opportunity to go and, you know, listen to all these concerts.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:20.760
[Guest]: So I heard a lot of, you know, some of the great, so one of the experiences was my spending

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.240
[Guest]: time with Pandit Ravi Shankar.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:28.960
[Guest]: I went across, again, I just said that, you know, I'm writing for the school magazine.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.600
[Guest]: And there were other, you know, people who were there from the regular, you know, big

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.880
[Guest]: newspapers, mainstream newspapers.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.600
[Guest]: But he sort of, you know, at that point of time, he was going to perform at the Swami

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.240
[Guest]: Haridas Festival.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:53.040
[Guest]: And he said that, you know, I'm going to rehearse, so if you don't mind, can we not do any interviews

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040
[Guest]: today?

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.420
[Guest]: I just want to get into the mood for that performance.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:02.240
[Guest]: And I had just finished reading his autobiography in Desh magazine in Bengali.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.080
[Guest]: It was called Raga Oor Raga, I still remember it so distinctly.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.200
[Guest]: And I had made clippings of that, the entire thing was stuck with a paper clip.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:15.360
[Guest]: And I said, I'm sort of disappointed that you won't speak to us, but you just sign this

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.640
[Guest]: because it's something I'll treasure.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.280
[Guest]: So he looked at it and said, where did you read this?

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.280
[Guest]: So I said, it's stuff that I've clipped, there are one or two episodes missing, but I think

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.080
[Guest]: it's the entire thing.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.000
[Guest]: He says, come, come, let's do it.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
[Guest]: I can't find a pen.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.600
[Guest]: And he sort of went inside and he said, why don't you sit down, are you in a hurry?

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.320
[Guest]: So I said, no.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.760
[Guest]: And who would be in a hurry if he was getting to spend time with Pandit Ravi Shankar?

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:50.480
[Guest]: And I sat down and we got chatting, he was playing, I kept listening, I was just completely

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.680
[Guest]: mesmerized by that.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.400
[Guest]: And he kept talking in between and about his life and this and that.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:02.600
[Guest]: And he talked about what is not there in the book and what he thought about music and has

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.720
[Guest]: a whole lot of things.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:11.200
[Guest]: It's a bit of a blur, unfortunately, in my head, because I was just pinching myself and

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.440
[Guest]: saying, this has to be a dream, this is not real.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.160
[Guest]: So this can't be happening to me.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.320
[Guest]: And then he said that, why don't you come in, I'll introduce you to some more of my

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.640
[Guest]: friends, come over in the evening for the concert.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.920
[Guest]: So I said, you know, we tried, but then there were no tickets available.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:32.320
[Guest]: So he says, no, no, you come as my guest, meet me at the gate and then, you know, I'll

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320
[Guest]: get you in.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.880
[Guest]: So I was standing outside Mablankar Hall in Delhi, and then his car came in.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.880
[Guest]: I was there, you know, an hour early and then his car came in.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:48.080
[Guest]: And he just signaled to me and I sort of went and had the privilege of seeing Pandit Bheem

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:55.640
[Guest]: Sen Joshi and Kishori Amonkar ji, and again, if I thought, you know, in the morning, if

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.840
[Guest]: I was thinking, this can't be real, then I thought this must be heaven.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.600
[Guest]: This is also hasrat, right?

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600
[Guest]: Bilkul.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:09.120
[Guest]: Yeh wo hasrat hai, kyunki kaun soch sakta hai ki aisa bhi ho sakta hai.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.880
[Guest]: So I think it's serendipity.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.560
[Guest]: It's you know, just going there, not with necessarily the idea of an interview and if

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: the interview didn't happen, you kind of say, okay, then what's the point?

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.360
[Guest]: And then what you get out of it, unfortunately, I didn't record it, there was only, you know,

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.800
[Guest]: in that camera, which I had, I borrowed my dad's camera, I didn't have time to check.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.640
[Guest]: There was only two shots left.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:42.200
[Guest]: So he had a student, you know, he told, I think his name was Kali Ghosh.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.680
[Guest]: And I don't remember, maybe I could be wrong on this.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.660
[Guest]: He said, why don't you click a photograph?

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:53.000
[Guest]: So he took two photographs and he said, oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to put on the flash.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.800
[Guest]: So one photo was gone, the other photo I said, okay, you know what, even if I'm not there,

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.800
[Guest]: let me click this.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:04.680
[Guest]: So I clicked a photo of his, which is I think the only photo that survived.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:12.320
[Guest]: But while I don't have something to show, but the memory of that day that I spent with

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:22.240
[Guest]: him was just so incredible and I kind of think that life was so unstructured that there was

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:28.920
[Guest]: place for these moments of serendipity and days of serendipity, not just moments.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.520
[Guest]: A day when he says that come sit down and so there is no end game that, you know, I'm

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.960
[Guest]: spending 15 minutes with you, I'm spending one hour with you, it's an open ended thing.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.280
[Guest]: And then at some point of time, I remember I cycled down home because it was like really

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.280
[Guest]: close by.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.320
[Guest]: I cycled down and I told my mother that I'm going to go off to this and he said, you haven't

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.320
[Guest]: had lunch?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.200
[Guest]: I said, doesn't matter.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:58.520
[Guest]: And I kind of took a bus, went across to Mavlankar and stood there, really hot sun and I waited

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.780
[Guest]: for him to come in, but what a reward.

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:08.560
[Guest]: So I think those were some of the things, as I said, that I'm a product of these experiences

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.760
[Guest]: and you know, all these things.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.160
[Guest]: So these, the Hindi magazine, you know, got me in touch with many of these people who

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:24.480
[Guest]: were writers, whether it was, you know, Pandit Anand Shankar or whether it was Ustad Amjad

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:30.540
[Guest]: Ali Khan who I got an opportunity, again, similar kind of a thing to spend time and

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:35.040
[Guest]: get just a conversation that when did you learn music and, you know, the stock questions

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.500
[Guest]: that one is tempted to ask.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:46.360
[Guest]: Those I think have been precious things which are unseen because, you know, it only resides

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:52.240
[Guest]: in my head and, you know, it's not on Instagram, it's not on this thing.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:58:00.400
[Guest]: Today, I think I would put it on Instagram and share it with other people, but there

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.960
[Amit Varma]: was no such thing.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And maybe if you did that, you would lose some of the charm in the moment instead of

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.320
[Guest]: being in the moment, you try to capture it.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320
[Guest]: Yeah, totally.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.440
[Guest]: I so agree with you.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.160
[Amit Varma]: What's the role music played in your life, played and plays?

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:23.940
[Guest]: A lot, you know, my father was, so I had this real funny contradiction.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:32.320
[Guest]: My father couldn't sing at all or, you know, couldn't play any instrument, but had a very

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.800
[Guest]: deep understanding and love for classical music or music in general, I should say.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.680
[Guest]: And you know, whenever we would go to Calcutta, you know, we would go to the HMV store and

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:51.760
[Guest]: pick up those 45 RPM EPs, then 78 RPM, you know, the other ones, mid range ones, and

00:58:51.760 --> 00:59:00.280
[Guest]: the long playing records at 33 and 1 3rd RPM, where, you know, I still remember it was all

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:08.680
[Guest]: of it was entirely either Hindustani classical, there was some bhajans of Pandit D. V. Paluskar

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:15.700
[Guest]: and, you know, Kumar Gandhar, Bhimsen Joshi, there was so these were people we heard both

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:22.660
[Guest]: on All India Radio, as well as, you know, on these albums.

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:30.140
[Guest]: Much later, I think we got the very first time I remember getting a piece of Hindi music,

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:37.220
[Guest]: Bollywood music was not from the, you know, so I used to hear it entirely on the radio.

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:44.700
[Guest]: The very first one was Dev Anand's Hare Ram Hare Krishna, you know, when that was there.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.980
[Guest]: And my dad was, he was quite quite experimental in his taste.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.020
[Guest]: So he sort of heard it and he said, well, it's pretty interesting.

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:59.300
[Guest]: And my mother had always been very fond of SD Burman's music, she would listen to a lot

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:05.140
[Guest]: of his old compositions, which he and his wife Meera Dev Burman wrote, Meera and SD

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.180
[Guest]: put to music.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:12.740
[Guest]: And that was, you know, another parallel sort of track which went in.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:18.380
[Guest]: In the evening, when dad would come back from work, so it was always quarter to nine was

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380
[Guest]: the news.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:24.700
[Guest]: Nine o'clock was the quarter to nine was the Hindi news, nine o'clock was the English news.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.940
[Guest]: And then we would switch to Hawa Mahal and listen to all these radio plays, which is

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:32.540
[Guest]: how I sort of became fascinated with the radio.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:39.380
[Guest]: And as I was sort of looking at that, you know, then when that would finish, he would

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:46.340
[Guest]: sit down and listen to classical music, or jazz or Western classical on some of the days

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.900
[Guest]: when there were days when they would play that in the evening.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:58.100
[Guest]: And I didn't like so much of the Indian classical music, I kind of never understood it.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.660
[Guest]: And it was something that had to suffer because, you know, he would say, no, you have to listen

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.820
[Guest]: to it before you develop the taste for it.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:11.380
[Guest]: And so I would suffer through that.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:19.540
[Guest]: It was only when I went to Jodhpur, that I got a chance to, you know, listen to all the

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:26.580
[Guest]: greats of, you know, Indian classical music, that suddenly one fine day, I suppose, it's

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.500
[Guest]: like compound interest, you know, for a very long time, you know, if you say that you will

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.940
[Guest]: double one paisa every day, and then as compared to, let's say, a 10 million that I could give

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:44.340
[Guest]: you today, what if it's compounded for a month, you know, every day, it's that whole process,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.780
[Guest]: I think in life, whether it's your skills, or your interest, or your knowledge, or whatever

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:53.340
[Guest]: it is, your worldview, it's a compounding process.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.100
[Guest]: So you hear a certain amount of it before it either makes sense, or you like it, or

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:05.060
[Guest]: you dislike it, or, you know, you start to categorize it as good, bad.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.780
[Guest]: But that listening to all that classical music, on the radio, and one of the things I wrote

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:21.300
[Guest]: about my website, the charm of Raghudesh, you know, so, you know, so he was playing,

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.260
[Guest]: it's in the morning, they would play Vande Mataram in those days, early morning, first

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.100
[Guest]: thing you would hear is that.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:36.420
[Guest]: And one day, he says that, you know, today evening, we are going to a classical performance.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.140
[Guest]: And I groaned, I said, Oh, my God, I mean, not again.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.420
[Guest]: And then we were at somebody's place.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:50.460
[Guest]: And you know, later on, I kind of discovered that this gentleman was Pandit Nikhil Banerjee.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:56.260
[Guest]: He was staying at this friend of my father's, he used to come and stay in their house.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.620
[Guest]: He was a very well known doctor, and he used to stay at that place.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.820
[Guest]: And he said, you know, he's one of the greats.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:12.780
[Guest]: So when he sat down to play, after dinner, he said, Kya sunna chayenge, he said that

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.780
[Guest]: in Bangla, Kishvanabhu.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.540
[Guest]: And my father said, if I can make a request, can you play Raag Desh?

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.940
[Guest]: He said, of course.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.020
[Guest]: And so he played.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:31.220
[Guest]: And for the first time, my dad whispered, this morning, you heard Vande Mataram.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.220
[Guest]: Can you see?

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:38.420
[Guest]: So when he's going to play this, he's going to be disguised, you know, but can you see?

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:42.260
[Guest]: And then at one point of time, it suddenly clicked.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:49.140
[Guest]: And I kind of, and I really enjoyed that performance, because I kept on, you know, trying to find

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.700
[Guest]: those same notes in classical.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.820
[Guest]: And for a very long time, that became the method by which I approached classical.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.940
[Guest]: That was like, you know, you hear, and many of the composers those days, you know, Noshad

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940
[Guest]: Saab, S.T.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:09.340
[Guest]: Burman, many of them would use, you know, pure classical music and convert them into,

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.340
[Guest]: you know, more accessible film music.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:20.140
[Guest]: And so that changed my relationship with, you know, the film music that I was listening,

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.060
[Guest]: because I would find the Raag in that film music and the film music in the Raag.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.100
[Guest]: So it sort of, in that sense, blurred the lines between these.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.820
[Guest]: So it was a lot of listening.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:42.140
[Guest]: But I also think that the way I view music, what has changed, you know, those days music

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.560
[Guest]: was collective.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.300
[Guest]: If you played music in one house, it was heard by everybody else and was considered to be

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300
[Guest]: okay.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.660
[Guest]: You know, so somebody likes to listen to Vivid Bharti.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.480
[Guest]: Somebody likes to listen to classical music.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.180
[Guest]: Somebody listens to bhajans in the morning.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:04.060
[Guest]: Even now, if you go to Calcutta in the morning, you can hear all of that, you know, from various

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.980
[Guest]: houses and all.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.980
[Guest]: That's what it was, it was very eclectic.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:19.220
[Guest]: It was, so I, my exposure to Western music was only when I came back to Delhi in the

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:25.900
[Guest]: eighth standard, when I came back and joined the school, I found that there was a set of

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:32.860
[Guest]: people who were listening to, you know, groups like the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Pink

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.340
[Guest]: Floyd and all of that.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.860
[Guest]: And we had a phenomenal guitarist in our class.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:45.140
[Guest]: And so, you know, he used to play these songs and that's the first time I heard Dylan.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.060
[Guest]: That's the first time I heard many of these people.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.300
[Guest]: And so that opened up another particular stream, you know, for me.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.020
[Guest]: And of course, All India Radio gave me an opportunity to learn from people who were

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.180
[Guest]: very accomplished people who would do these programs.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:06.820
[Guest]: I would sit in, you know, in the studios and listen to these guys and talk about it.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.460
[Guest]: So that was how I sort of picked up.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.780
[Guest]: I'm not that well-versed.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:19.060
[Guest]: I enjoy listening to Western classical, I enjoy listening to jazz and blues and all

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.060
[Guest]: of that.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:25.500
[Guest]: But I think people who are my friends is the Indian classical rags, you know, so that's

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.780
[Guest]: how I describe.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.940
[Guest]: And then, you know, in Bengali households, you listen to all those usual Bengali composers,

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:38.020
[Guest]: Ravindra Sangeet, of course, and then Nazrul Gaiti and Dijandralal and Rajinikanth, Atul

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.020
[Guest]: Prasad.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:45.860
[Guest]: These couple of these people, you know, this was very much a part of the musical diet that

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.980
[Amit Varma]: I grew up with.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.840
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned, and by the way, I found when daddy was a little boy with a pink cover.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.340
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, the moment you said the name of the book, I thought of the cover as

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.900
[Amit Varma]: well because shared experiences, right?

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.680
[Amit Varma]: If you're growing up in that time, and there are Russian books all around and, you know,

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.860
[Amit Varma]: so I remember that book as well.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.500
[Amit Varma]: And I just straight away Googled it and I was like, Oh my God, it's like, you know,

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.260
[Amit Varma]: a portal to my childhood.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.860
[Amit Varma]: I have to get this book.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:17.780
[Amit Varma]: And I'm interested in what you said, you know, that that point you made about shared experiences,

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:21.980
[Amit Varma]: that somebody plays a bit of music in the house, everybody's listening.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:27.700
[Amit Varma]: And there are like, there's a larger theme that I see today, which has to do with the

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:32.500
[Amit Varma]: crumbling away of shared experiences, but the frame that I've been looking at it is

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:39.060
[Amit Varma]: really in terms of the dissipation of the mainstream everywhere, like in media you had,

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, you had a consensus on the truth, and on what news was and all of that in the

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820
[Amit Varma]: 90s.

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:47.020
[Amit Varma]: And there's been a dissipation, there's been a decentralization.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And a net net, I think it's a good thing, obviously, you still have to deal with things

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.380
[Amit Varma]: like fake news, and the fact that we are engaged in narrative battles all the time, there is,

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.220
[Amit Varma]: you know, a more diffuse sense of what the truth is.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.460
[Amit Varma]: But net net, it's a great thing, because anybody can get into it, we have the means of production,

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.460
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And mainstream media is kind of dissipated.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.100
[Amit Varma]: Similar thing has happened in music, similar thing in various other fields, some could

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:17.080
[Amit Varma]: argue similar thing with even nation states, where governments no longer have the same

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.460
[Amit Varma]: kind of absolute control that they once did over the people, because we are all connected

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.780
[Amit Varma]: by we are all empowered by technology, we are connected by the internet.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.200
[Amit Varma]: We are, you know, almost by default, almost global citizens.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.380
[Amit Varma]: And this dissipation is kind of everywhere.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:38.460
[Amit Varma]: And on the one hand, there is this issue that those old shared experiences aren't there.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:43.300
[Amit Varma]: Like, one illustration of this is that I spend a lot of time on YouTube.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:48.860
[Amit Varma]: And at one point in time, I decided to understand the right wing fringe.

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.700
[Amit Varma]: But I don't want it to mess up my YouTube algorithm.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.880
[Amit Varma]: So I opened an incognito window, and under another account I signed in, and then I started

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.780
[Amit Varma]: exploring these things there.

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:03.340
[Amit Varma]: And then after a few days, I noticed something interesting, I noticed that my two YouTubes,

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.240
[Amit Varma]: as it were, are completely different, there is zero overlap.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.460
[Amit Varma]: One YouTube is just giving me one stream of content, the other one is just giving me another

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.100
[Amit Varma]: kind of content, and there is zero overlap.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:21.660
[Amit Varma]: So you think of a 15 year old growing up today, that 15 year old enters one kind of universe,

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:27.260
[Amit Varma]: and then the algorithms push the same thing to him and homogenize him in one particular

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.340
[Amit Varma]: way, while his neighbor in the other house could be getting homogenized in another particular

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.340
[Amit Varma]: way.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.020
[Amit Varma]: And these worlds aren't talking to each other.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.980
[Amit Varma]: So that shared experience, where, you know, you could tell me about when daddy was a little

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.640
[Amit Varma]: boy and immediately I connect, right?

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.860
[Amit Varma]: You can talk about Oh, Beatles and Dylan and whatever.

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:50.220
[Amit Varma]: And these are shared cultural sort of signposts for us that we can all connect.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:55.700
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that they sort of no longer exist, that everywhere, the mainstream has

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:59.380
[Amit Varma]: kind of dissipated and the old way of doing things no longer applies.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.360
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you've written at length in dreamers and unicorns and spoken about how

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.500
[Amit Varma]: this is especially true at the level of a company, which is a way that you look at a

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.660
[Amit Varma]: company that have been different phases.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.900
[Amit Varma]: But now it's completely different.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:16.140
[Amit Varma]: And there, in a sense, you also see that process of decentralization happening, you know, with

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:20.180
[Amit Varma]: the gig economy growing, you can work from anywhere, your work can be anywhere, you can

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.820
[Amit Varma]: get talent from anywhere.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:25.620
[Amit Varma]: So is this broadly something that you'd then agree with that?

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Yes, the mainstream is dissipating everywhere.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.140
[Amit Varma]: And the deeper question then is that, what does it mean for us?

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.260
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I can't figure out if it's a good thing or a bad thing that there are less shared

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.020
[Amit Varma]: experiences that, you know, so you, you know, when you say when daddy was a little boy and

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.460
[Amit Varma]: that pink cover comes into my head, it's a shared moment, it makes me smile, it creates

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.420
[Amit Varma]: a connection between us, right?

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.420
[Amit Varma]: As people.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:55.620
[Amit Varma]: And so I don't know what to make of this, that we are, on the one hand, our individuality

01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:00.420
[Amit Varma]: can express itself better in many particular ways, I'm not forced into a shared experience

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.880
[Amit Varma]: I may not want.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.780
[Amit Varma]: If somebody at home plays a bhajan in the morning, I don't have to listen to that I

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:11.060
[Amit Varma]: can listen to hip hop in my room, and no value judgment, they're completely separate things.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:15.340
[Amit Varma]: So it's a good thing that we can all find our individual selves.

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.900
[Amit Varma]: But number one, are those really individual selves with algorithms sort of playing such

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.940
[Amit Varma]: a big role in shaping us?

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:25.460
[Amit Varma]: And number two, you know, don't shared experiences matter.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:29.740
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of rambling, but I'm just thinking aloud, because you sparked off this thought

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:37.220
[Guest]: when you shared experiences do matter, because it gives us a chance to connect with people

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.740
[Guest]: at multiple levels.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:47.460
[Guest]: I mean, if you if you see, the game of Antakshari is so unique to India, because we've had a

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:53.020
[Guest]: shared experience of listening to the same songs on the radio, and then you know, whatever,

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.840
[Guest]: we've shared that kind of history.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.380
[Guest]: Even now, when you listen to most of the songs that people sing, you know, many of them are

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.380
[Guest]: old songs.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.980
[Guest]: Yeah, many of them just, you know, it's not to say that no new songs come in.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.300
[Guest]: But you know, you'll find that beyond a point of time, you will see the number of shared

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:18.560
[Guest]: songs that come in drops dramatically from the time when music became an individual experience.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.900
[Guest]: What I'm listening to in my headphone is not something you know, and you know, so it's

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:30.460
[Guest]: become and that fragmentation shows up in everything.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:35.100
[Guest]: So what happens is, therefore, we begin to live in our own bubble and the algorithms

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.100
[Guest]: feed that bubble.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.340
[Guest]: So it becomes that bubble becomes a cage at some point of time, you can't escape it.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.340
[Guest]: Right?

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:49.820
[Guest]: Whereas when you are indulging in shared experiences, you are very often stumbling into worlds,

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.940
[Guest]: which you did not plan or you didn't know they existed.

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:59.100
[Guest]: And when you do that, that's really what gives you a shared moment with the other person.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.700
[Guest]: You know, when I've traveled into places even today, you know, when I travel, I think that's

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:09.940
[Guest]: the habit that I've retained, that I will go in and, you know, just start chatting with

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.740
[Guest]: a stranger in a coffee shop somewhere.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:17.320
[Guest]: And then, you know, sit down and then when somebody else comes in, and their friends

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.540
[Guest]: come back, and then you sort of become part of this.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:29.220
[Guest]: And as you plan out for this unscheduled, unplanned travel, even when you go to a place,

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:34.020
[Guest]: so you might decide that you are going to spend five days in a particular city.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:39.700
[Guest]: But if you actually come to a time where you spend a little bit of time of that, going

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:46.060
[Guest]: to places at odd times, you know, in odd places and places where others are hanging around,

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:53.260
[Guest]: who don't look like you, who potentially don't think like you, you will discover that city

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:58.780
[Guest]: in a manner which will be impossible to replicate through any other experience.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.220
[Guest]: So I think when you look at that, every place has an underground culture, every place has

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:09.160
[Guest]: a sort of mainstream culture, a place has a culture for the elite few.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:16.140
[Guest]: So the social strata gets replicated everywhere in music and art and cinema.

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:22.540
[Guest]: And when we live in a homogenous world, we are letting our algorithms decide what we

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.460
[Guest]: should and should not read.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.340
[Guest]: Ironically, the group that fights most for individuality is the one which is most gauged

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.420
[Guest]: by the algorithm, yeah, because that's what you are consuming, that's what.

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:40.060
[Guest]: So I think, you know, so the other day I went in and watched a Tamil movie.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:49.980
[Guest]: And consequently, now my Netflix feed is sort of loaded with Tamil recommendations, which

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.660
[Guest]: may be good, which may not be good.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:56.220
[Guest]: And I kind of now think that, okay, what do I need to do, you know, to make sure that

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.900
[Guest]: I get a bigger variety.

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:03.420
[Guest]: So then I watch a Korean movie, if I do that, then it sort of gives me...

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:10.940
[Guest]: So then you have to always constantly battle, you know, the algorithm, the cage of the algorithm

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.660
[Guest]: that you do want to be part of, yeah.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:21.620
[Guest]: So I am a big believer in shared experiences, because, you know, the other day we were discussing

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:27.420
[Guest]: that, you know, the client of mine, he was talking about the number of people who showed

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.260
[Guest]: up for something.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:34.340
[Guest]: So this is the person working in a company outside of India, we were having this conversation

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.780
[Guest]: on Zoom.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:44.260
[Guest]: And I simply said, and the fact that you laugh at this, and that guy smiled at this, and

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:52.100
[Guest]: I said, oh, my God, you know, and, you know, this is a shared experience, which is impossible

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:56.660
[Guest]: to have even within the family today.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:02.020
[Guest]: Because experiences are not common, you don't listen to the same music, you know, most families

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:07.580
[Guest]: don't sit down and watch the same TV shows, or Netflix movies, or this, everybody has

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.840
[Guest]: their own account, you know.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:15.460
[Guest]: So it's good for the algorithm, because then they get to know what is the parent's, you

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.660
[Guest]: know, choice of movies versus, let's say, the kid's choice of movies, etc.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:26.100
[Guest]: But I think there is an element of human bonding, which is missed out.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:31.100
[Guest]: You know, you watch something together, some you understand, some you don't understand,

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:35.980
[Guest]: some which is, you know, disturbing content, and, you know, so it's all of that, it's a

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:36.980
[Guest]: shared experience.

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:43.380
[Guest]: Today, it's a very sanitized, structured, cleaned up antiseptic experience, which is

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.620
[Guest]: given to you pre-packaged.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:54.420
[Guest]: So yeah, and I think it's sort of become a part of our life today in so many ways.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:17:00.780
[Guest]: Music has become fragmented, movies have become fragmented, food at home has become fragmented.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:07.660
[Guest]: You know, it's just so many homes where there is no common mealtime, so there is no shared

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:12.940
[Guest]: conversation because one person eats in their room, another person eats at a different time

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:17.100
[Guest]: in their room, and some person is a vegetarian, somebody wants to try this out.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:22.900
[Guest]: So great from the point of view of individuality, but terrible from the point of view of a shared

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.660
[Guest]: experience in one.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:30.740
[Guest]: So I think, you know, those are some of the things I think are worth looking at because

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:36.460
[Guest]: shared experiences make you become generous towards people with whom you will never get

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.460
[Guest]: a return.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:42.900
[Guest]: You know, whereas when you meet people who are homogenous, there is always this whole

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:47.940
[Guest]: thing of networking, as I said, you know, what will I get in return?

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:55.140
[Guest]: So I think the opportunity to live that life is diminishing very rapidly unless you hold

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.140
[Guest]: on to it.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:01.100
[Guest]: So when you sort of, you know, if you really look at the number of people you have a conversation

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:07.260
[Guest]: with, how many of them are completely different from you?

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:14.260
[Guest]: How many of them have professions which you would strongly advise somebody not to pursue

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.300
[Guest]: for whatever reason?

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.660
[Guest]: How many of them are doing things which are fascinating?

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.580
[Guest]: How many of them are doing things which are dangerous?

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.940
[Guest]: How many of them are doing things which are terrible?

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.700
[Guest]: How much do you know about these elements?

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.940
[Guest]: Otherwise you are presenting the Instagram view of everybody.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.260
[Guest]: This is the view I want you to see of me.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.740
[Guest]: You are not really seeing the unfiltered.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.180
[Guest]: You are not really seeing the unseen.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.940
[Guest]: You just aren't.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:50.180
[Guest]: So I think that's where I view the shift that has happened in the way that we consume media

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.540
[Guest]: and the way that we meet people.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.340
[Guest]: That can only happen through relationships.

01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:00.260
[Guest]: When you build a relationship, stage one is trust.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.620
[Guest]: Without that, I'm going to tell you what I think you want to hear.

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:12.460
[Guest]: So I think it's only when you travel together, Sahyadri, it's only at that point of time

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:19.020
[Guest]: do you really start to discover a world where somebody says that, you know, which sometimes

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.220
[Guest]: makes you shocked and that's fine.

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.540
[Guest]: I mean, the whole world doesn't have to live by your values.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.100
[Guest]: I mean, even though I may disagree with that, I may say this is so patriarchal, this is

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.140
[Guest]: so this or that, whatever it is, that person, how do you know your world view is better

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.140
[Guest]: than that?

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:40.300
[Guest]: There are hundreds of things in my world view, which, you know, five years later, I might

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.620
[Guest]: be embarrassed that I had this.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:48.220
[Guest]: I do have plenty of things, you know, which I think, my God, I mean, there was just so

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:53.940
[Guest]: uninformed now that I know a little more, I've modified my views.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.940
[Guest]: It's the same thing.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:20:00.460
[Guest]: A person who's very different gives you a chance to challenge your own world view.

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:03.380
[Guest]: Now, you might say, why would I want to challenge my own world view?

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.260
[Amit Varma]: Then it's a different conversation altogether.

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.860
[Amit Varma]: No, I love your metaphor of antakshari in all of this, because that is like, that's

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.380
[Amit Varma]: such a perfect metaphor for the whole concept of shared experiences.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.420
[Amit Varma]: So I have never been someone who takes part in antaksharis because I don't listen to much

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.420
[Amit Varma]: Bollywood music.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.940
[Amit Varma]: But for the first time in my life, I think I've now appreciated it, that what a big deal

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.940
[Amit Varma]: it is.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:28.900
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about music also strikes a chord, like there was this essay Ted Joya

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.180
[Amit Varma]: had written a while back, and he's got this fantastic newsletter on music, which I linked

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:37.820
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes, where he speaks about how old music is dominating so much today.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.940
[Amit Varma]: And this has become a big problem for the music industry, because old music is vastly

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.220
[Amit Varma]: outselling new music, and what do new musicians do?

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:49.260
[Amit Varma]: And part of this is, of course, the sort of lack of imagination on the part of record

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.420
[Amit Varma]: labels.

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:55.340
[Amit Varma]: And part of it is, again, just, you know, the mainstream has, in a sense, dissipated.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:01.020
[Amit Varma]: And in an earlier episode, one of my guests gave me this excellent illustration, I think

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Chuck Gopal did in the episode I did with him, about how form is shaping content when

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.920
[Amit Varma]: it comes to music also, because Spotify pays you after 30 seconds of hearing.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.620
[Amit Varma]: So there are now musicians who are now optimising for 30 seconds, there's one Beatles cover

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.020
[Amit Varma]: band where every cover is 35 seconds or so.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.980
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, why give more, Spotify pays for 30 seconds.

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, similarly, a lot of new bands by record labels today are told that we don't

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:31.300
[Amit Varma]: care what the song is, or, you know, we don't care about any aspect of this, but give us

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.660
[Amit Varma]: a 15 second hook that can go on TikTok, so people can make videos with it.

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.980
[Amit Varma]: So your typical way of creation is that whatever else you do, you get that 15 second hook,

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.820
[Amit Varma]: and then you pay big influencers to do TikTok videos around that.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:49.060
[Amit Varma]: And if it takes off, it takes off, and that becomes a, you know, a mode of discovery.

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:52.860
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you earlier mentioned, you know, buying those long playing records from Calcutta

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.540
[Amit Varma]: when you went out there.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:22:00.740
[Amit Varma]: And those are also such an example of how form is dictated what we listen to your earliest

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.780
[Amit Varma]: form of the LP at the turn of the 20th century can only hold three minutes, so you have the

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:10.260
[Amit Varma]: three minute song, then you have, you know, it evolves till you can hold about 40 minutes,

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.540
[Amit Varma]: by which time the three minute has become the radio standard.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:18.060
[Amit Varma]: So there, therefore, it becomes a conventional form that, hey, if you want to hit song, it

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.180
[Amit Varma]: will take this much time, like this, the bridge will come here, this will come there, everything

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.700
[Amit Varma]: is a set formula.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:30.020
[Amit Varma]: And it also cuts to beyond durations, for example, you know, 1920s, the first advanced

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.440
[Amit Varma]: microphones come.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.940
[Amit Varma]: So now singers don't have to project anymore, because we can whisper into the microphone,

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.940
[Amit Varma]: right?

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940
[Amit Varma]: And that changes everything.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:42.140
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, a lot of that is kind of happening around us today.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.020
[Amit Varma]: And I find that interesting as well.

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:47.140
[Amit Varma]: But that's perhaps a bit of a digression.

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.740
[Amit Varma]: And as for individuality, you know, on the one hand, you want individuality.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.380
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you have algorithms forcing you into these directions, where that

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.500
[Amit Varma]: opportunity for serendipity to come in, which you mentioned isn't there.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:04.140
[Amit Varma]: Because if the first five things I watch on YouTube, are what then determines everything

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.900
[Amit Varma]: else, then there is no freewill, I'm just getting unless I physically search for something,

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.580
[Amit Varma]: yeah, I'm being forced onto a particular track.

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:15.140
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of my friends, Vasant Dhar, who was on the show talking about AI a long

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:20.380
[Amit Varma]: time back, he keeps saying that what we need to do is we need an option to be able to shape

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:24.580
[Amit Varma]: the algorithm as well, you know, give us a bunch of algorithms, we'll choose.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:29.140
[Amit Varma]: So if you if you just don't want to think you can take your default algorithm, but if

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.460
[Amit Varma]: you want to tweak it a little bit, you know, people like you and me should have the chance

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:38.820
[Amit Varma]: to do that 20% I want based on this and 25% based on this and 25% pure dumb luck, give

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.380
[Amit Varma]: me anything and so on and so forth.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:48.420
[Amit Varma]: And I think that would expand our bouquet of choices, but I don't know how kind of.

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:52.820
[Guest]: You know, one of the books that I've just finished reading, in fact, I'm talking to

01:23:52.820 --> 01:24:02.860
[Guest]: the author on, you know, shortly on my show, Luke Burgess, he's written this very incredibly

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.500
[Guest]: original book called Wanting.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.300
[Guest]: And it talks about mimetic desire.

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.300
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:16.380
[Guest]: You know, when I first saw the word mimetic, I had to look it up and say that, is it certain

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.460
[Guest]: it's to do with miming?

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.460
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:25.460
[Guest]: And the whole thesis that he has in this book is, if you are not conscious, you're likely

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:34.420
[Guest]: to not actually exercise individuality because you are sort of governed by what others are

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:39.220
[Guest]: doing through various kinds of models, road models, etc.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.140
[Guest]: And a model is always designed to be replicated.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:46.220
[Guest]: That's why it is a model by definition.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:54.540
[Guest]: And there are lots of very interesting examples that, you know, when you think about the fact

01:24:54.540 --> 01:25:00.820
[Guest]: that so many people during the pandemic got dogs, yeah, and that's sort of when I look

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:05.660
[Guest]: at the number of people who used to walk dogs and the number of my friends and people in

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.060
[Guest]: the neighborhood, etc., who got dogs.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.860
[Guest]: And each of them perhaps are individual decisions.

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.300
[Guest]: You know, they've decided that, okay, you know, I want a dog.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:21.900
[Guest]: And I'm, of course, a dog lover, but you will discover that, you know, there's this unspoken

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:27.140
[Guest]: wave which has told people that, well, this is something you should be doing.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:32.580
[Guest]: You know, a certain cuisine becomes popular because, you know, five role models or five

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:37.260
[Guest]: people who are super popular post it on Insta with 10 million views.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:40.180
[Guest]: And suddenly you say, oh my God, that's a restaurant I haven't eaten.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.300
[Guest]: I must go and eat there because 10 million people have said it's amazing.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:51.380
[Guest]: So I think a lot of our desire when we, you know, so that I think is in Dreamers and Unicorns

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:57.660
[Guest]: I talk about one of the big forces you have to really sort of look at is balancing polar

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:58.660
[Guest]: opposites.

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:04.620
[Guest]: You know, so you will see that paperbacks and e-books will coexist.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:09.940
[Guest]: You will see that, you know, this whole thing of collaboration and competition will coexist.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.020
[Guest]: It's a part of human nature.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:17.180
[Guest]: So when organizations put their reward systems to reward the individual, and then they are

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:22.460
[Guest]: wondering, you know, why don't we do a workshop on team building, you know, take everybody

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:26.820
[Guest]: out to the hills and sort of do that, and they put them in a classroom.

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:32.500
[Guest]: It is not going to, you know, get them a chance to really build deep, meaningful relationships.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.900
[Guest]: So how do you do that?

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:43.660
[Guest]: The only time to give them unstructured time, but the corporates are so enamored by efficiency,

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.260
[Guest]: this whole thing is, okay, what's the agenda?

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:50.940
[Guest]: We'll wake up at five o'clock, even if it is an activity, which is fun, you know, you

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:54.980
[Guest]: would say, okay, everybody has got to get up at six o'clock, five o'clock, and then,

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.700
[Guest]: you know, do yoga together, and then do this together.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:01.720
[Guest]: And then so it's everything is super structured.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:11.220
[Guest]: So when people are given unstructured time, the first thing that you experience is boredom.

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:14.700
[Guest]: Because your mind is not used to deciding stuff by itself.

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:20.100
[Guest]: Whereas, you know, when you look at the fact that most creativity comes when you're just

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:24.180
[Guest]: sort of lying down doing nothing.

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:28.940
[Guest]: And I can recollect when I think of, you know, drawing pictures from my childhood, so much

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:34.500
[Guest]: of it was just about just lying on the grass and looking at the sky, you know, literally

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.740
[Guest]: counting the stars.

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.420
[Guest]: I don't think I've done that in years now, yeah.

01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:46.100
[Guest]: There was a point of time when we lived in Rajasthan, we used to sleep on the terrace.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:50.820
[Guest]: And meant you experience the summer in its true form, you know, so, and you used to get

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:54.460
[Guest]: a little chilly in the early hours.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:28:00.220
[Guest]: And this whole notion of it being super hot during the day, it gets cool, then it becomes

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:05.060
[Guest]: cold, then it becomes pleasant, and then hot again.

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:11.100
[Guest]: In one day, you experience this diversity of, you know, the feel on your skin, it's

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.100
[Guest]: so different.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.580
[Guest]: Now, what happens is, everything is standardized, yeah.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:22.340
[Guest]: So you will walk in from one, you know, your car into the office, and it's all standardized

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340
[Guest]: temperature.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:32.060
[Guest]: So even weather has become impersonal, you know, so it's what everybody else is experiencing.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.500
[Guest]: Those are, I think, some of the things that shape people.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:44.820
[Guest]: So I consciously, I try to, you know, look for people who have views very different from

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820
[Guest]: mine.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:54.780
[Guest]: And I remember one of them used to say that, on Twitter, for example, if you go around

01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:02.100
[Guest]: and do a search on something, you know, like, I remember this very vividly, somebody had

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:09.340
[Guest]: recommended the name of a person and I typed the name wrong, you know, I misspelt it.

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:18.460
[Guest]: And it threw up a photographer who posts about fashion at funerals.

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.940
[Guest]: My first thought was, that's gross.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:27.420
[Guest]: I mean, why are you photographing people when they are in their saddest moments about fashion?

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.140
[Guest]: And you know, and he's written a number of, you know, short little things, he says, look

01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:35.220
[Guest]: at the fact that it's completely color coordinated.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:40.300
[Guest]: Look at the fact that, you know, they've taken the trouble to sort of add that little frill

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.340
[Guest]: and this and that, and posted a whole lot of this.

01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:47.300
[Guest]: Now, obviously, for me, it was an act of serendipity, I mistyped the guy's name.

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.500
[Guest]: And then I saw that.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:55.060
[Guest]: But that brief moment opened me up to the fact that such a thing was even possible.

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:59.460
[Guest]: But because I didn't follow the person, it's gone forever.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.460
[Guest]: Right?

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:05.700
[Guest]: So sometimes, I think that some of the best things that I've seen in my life, I have no

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:11.220
[Guest]: record of, I mean, this was one such example of that, or, you know, camera technology was

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:17.300
[Guest]: so primitive, that, you know, many of them, even in one of those cameras, which we had

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:22.900
[Guest]: access to, they were small, cheap cameras, you know, Agfa Click 3 kind of cameras.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.860
[Guest]: And I've experienced the sunrise at Tiger Hill, which is such a gorgeous experience.

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:35.300
[Guest]: I have no evidence of that, because my father used to say that, you know, I used to get

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.300
[Guest]: 36 exposures.

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:44.500
[Guest]: He would say that, 36 photographs of a vacation, what are you going to do with so many photographs?

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:50.500
[Guest]: So our notion of scarcity versus the time of abundance that we live in, also changes

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.980
[Guest]: how we view things.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:52.980
[Guest]: Right?

01:30:52.980 --> 01:31:00.460
[Guest]: So when you live in a world of abundance, you deal with things and experiences very

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.820
[Guest]: differently because you know, it'll come back again.

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:08.460
[Guest]: You don't hang on to something and make it part of your life.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.600
[Guest]: Because this is going to be back again.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.700
[Guest]: If I miss watching the movie, I know in like, you know, whatever, a couple of days, it'll

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.380
[Guest]: be on one of the OTT platforms, and I will watch it there.

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:23.940
[Guest]: So there's no hunger for a shared experience either, that in any case, the pandemic sort

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.300
[Guest]: of killed whatever little was left of it.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.060
[Guest]: You know, you don't go to a movie theater to watch something.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:33.260
[Guest]: You kind of say that, okay, I'm going to watch it, because I can sit in my living room and

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.220
[Guest]: switch it on when I want.

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.040
[Guest]: There is a freedom to it.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.540
[Guest]: And there is a certain experience of watching it with people laughing together.

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:47.100
[Guest]: And you know, when you watch movies in some of the smaller towns, you know, when you go

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:53.020
[Guest]: and watch a regional film, it's an experience that cannot be replicated, you know, at home.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.980
[Guest]: It will never be.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:59.860
[Guest]: Because you find, you know, that there's a person who's selling tea, who's also, you

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:07.220
[Guest]: know, got that little push pump stove, you know, used to pump into it and sort of making

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:10.020
[Guest]: tea out there to serve to people as it is happening.

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:14.260
[Guest]: And when there's a song which is there, people are sharing coins, they go up in front of

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.580
[Guest]: the screen and dance.

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:20.580
[Guest]: Where would you see it in a sanitized environment today?

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:30.620
[Guest]: So the homogeneity of experiences is where you are losing your ability to be creative.

01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:34.860
[Guest]: Creativity necessarily comes from a variety of those experiences, where you are living

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.100
[Guest]: life without an ROI.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:42.300
[Guest]: And you are connecting the dot maybe through a short form post or you're, that's different,

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.420
[Guest]: you are sort of drawing from those many experiences.

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:55.920
[Guest]: But it begins because you are having that kind of a time to explore or stuff like that.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:59.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, I love your phrase living life without an ROI.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.860
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just, you know, here's what sometimes happens, right?

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:10.360
[Amit Varma]: As I grow older, I am thinking that too often, too much of our lives, we live without being

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:15.860
[Amit Varma]: in the moment, not in the typical banal sense, but for example, like your thought about the

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.160
[Amit Varma]: sunset sparked it off, that you're there, you're watching a sunset.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.220
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, in the modern times, there is that imperative that I want to capture

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.780
[Amit Varma]: the sunset, right?

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:31.220
[Amit Varma]: So you put it on Instagram or wherever, or equally, so here you're experiencing something,

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.900
[Amit Varma]: but you feel that you want to also capture it.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:37.980
[Amit Varma]: And equally, you might want to do something, but you might feel you want validation for

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:42.300
[Amit Varma]: it, and you want people to kind of, you want their approval.

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:48.220
[Amit Varma]: And this added layer of wanting to capture wanting validation, I think takes away from

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:53.220
[Amit Varma]: the moment, it takes you out of the moment, because you want something else out of it.

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:58.540
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the sort of conclusions I have come to, and it's a double edged conclusion,

01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:03.020
[Amit Varma]: is that look, the only way to happiness, and I know you have detailed thoughts on happiness,

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:08.060
[Amit Varma]: we'll also discuss, but for me, the only way to happiness is really to be in the moment

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.740
[Amit Varma]: and take that happiness in the small joys.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:11.860
[Amit Varma]: And I cannot capture them.

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.860
[Amit Varma]: And even if I were to capture it, like, let's say I'm at my window, and I'm looking at out

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:17.940
[Amit Varma]: of the night sky, and I feel nice.

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.820
[Amit Varma]: And then I say, Oh, I got to capture this.

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:23.260
[Amit Varma]: So I take a selfie like this, me looking out of the night sky or whatever.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.220
[Amit Varma]: And then I see the selfie later.

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.940
[Amit Varma]: Does it make me happy to see the selfie later?

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:31.300
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm not even remembering a moment of happiness, because at the time of taking the selfie,

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:32.500
[Amit Varma]: I'm not there.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:38.140
[Amit Varma]: And my sort of complicated thought about happiness, which I can't figure out, is that, if you

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:42.580
[Amit Varma]: are happy, you, however you define it, you can't actually be conscious of it, the moment

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.620
[Amit Varma]: you think I am happy, you are out of that moment.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:51.260
[Amit Varma]: And it doesn't kind of work like this is very morbid, but a couple of days back, and I don't

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:54.540
[Amit Varma]: know why it comes to me, I met a bunch of my writing students.

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:57.460
[Amit Varma]: And we were chatting about a bunch of things.

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:05.420
[Amit Varma]: And I brought up the point that when someone dies, their whole life amounts to how they

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.980
[Amit Varma]: felt in that last second.

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:12.900
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that if I am going to die now, I'm on my deathbed, my whole body is screaming

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:15.420
[Amit Varma]: with pain, I'm feeling bad.

01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.420
[Amit Varma]: That's it.

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.340
[Amit Varma]: Everything before it really is meaningless, I could have had a happy life and contributed

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.340
[Amit Varma]: to a lot of people.

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.940
[Amit Varma]: But that is it at that moment, I'm reduced to that.

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.940
[Amit Varma]: And that's it.

01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:30.180
[Amit Varma]: And vice versa, which is why I sometimes think that the best way to go is just to go suddenly,

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.860
[Amit Varma]: you know, something happens and you're gone and there's kind of nothing there.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:38.580
[Amit Varma]: But it also tells me about how everything is transient.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:43.220
[Amit Varma]: And you can't actually, you know, what is a happy life then I mean, we have you look

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:48.900
[Amit Varma]: at happiness, always in retrospect, you build narratives in retrospect, that how that happened.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:56.700
[Amit Varma]: But I don't know if it even makes sense to talk of it in that manner.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:01.140
[Amit Varma]: Because for me, therefore, you know, if you think too much of happiness, if you overthink

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.180
[Amit Varma]: it, then it kind of doesn't work.

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:07.380
[Amit Varma]: It's a bit of a rambling, but I know you have far more structured thoughts on happiness

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:11.500
[Amit Varma]: and the distinctions between joy, contentment, happiness, all of those things.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:16.540
[Amit Varma]: But you know, with or without reference to that, what is your notion of happiness and

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:21.100
[Amit Varma]: how has it evolved over the years, like when you are a teenager, and you're thinking of

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:25.020
[Amit Varma]: yourself, what are the things that you would have then said that, huh, this will make me

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:26.020
[Amit Varma]: happy?

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:30.020
[Amit Varma]: Like, obviously, all the hasrat things I'm guessing going abroad or whatever, you know,

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:35.020
[Amit Varma]: meeting Bhimsen Joshi, but what would your conception of happiness have been then?

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:38.700
[Amit Varma]: And how has it developed now today?

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:46.220
[Guest]: So I think I didn't quite have a very formed view of happiness, I had things which I, you

01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:53.020
[Guest]: know, and it was in the whole range of things, things that I think some of the happiest things

01:36:53.020 --> 01:37:01.220
[Guest]: are that happen to us are when we don't record them, you know, because the act of recording

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:08.420
[Guest]: is performative, that you are now, as you said, that you watch the stars in the sky,

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.540
[Guest]: your first thought is boss, what an insta photo this will make.

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:21.100
[Guest]: So now your entire process of enjoying that, you know, starlit sky is gone.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:26.540
[Guest]: You are now trying to figure out if I do this, then I must, you know, reduce the exposure,

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:31.620
[Guest]: increase this, then it shines like diamonds, and I'm going to put a witty line, what would

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620
[Guest]: it be?

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.860
[Guest]: Would it be Lucy in the sky with diamonds?

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:41.380
[Guest]: And then you kind of say, okay, that would be fun, then I can put the track on that.

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:44.660
[Guest]: And that I think will get me more hits than if I didn't put.

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:51.700
[Guest]: So you know, you've stopped your engagement with the star finished long back.

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:58.500
[Guest]: And so the things that you experience, you know, there's sometimes when you, you know,

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:04.900
[Guest]: the people that I've never taken selfies with are some of my most precious relationships,

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:10.860
[Guest]: you know, my grandparents were such an integral part of my life, I don't have too many photos

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.860
[Guest]: of them.

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:18.820
[Guest]: Because, you know, many of those photos, for whatever reason, got lost over the years.

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:24.500
[Guest]: And therefore, I struggled the other day when some magazine or something said, you sent

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:27.660
[Guest]: me a photograph of yours from your childhood.

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:32.100
[Guest]: And I struggled with this, because, you know, so many of them have just that en masse bunch

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:34.060
[Guest]: of albums got lost somewhere.

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:41.060
[Guest]: So my childhood is completely undocumented in terms of photographs in that sense.

01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:46.860
[Guest]: But I think which is why I cling on so desperately to all my memories, you know, and I've seen

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:52.820
[Guest]: that with so many people who tell wonderful stories.

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:55.220
[Guest]: And many of this is completely undocumented.

01:38:55.220 --> 01:39:00.260
[Guest]: So you will see a version of life, which you have not seen, because you're experiencing

01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:04.180
[Guest]: that moment through this person's eyes and that, you know, when that person was eight

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.580
[Guest]: years old.

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:12.380
[Guest]: And when they talk about this, you begin to experience that world, which you were not

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.980
[Guest]: privy to, but you now see.

01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:20.020
[Guest]: And that happens when you have these unfiltered conversations.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:25.580
[Guest]: I have seen that when you talk to somebody who's a stranger, where you don't, you know,

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:31.420
[Guest]: check their phone number and email address, because you're not going to go back and connect.

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:37.260
[Guest]: That person maintains the anonymity and therefore opens up and shares so much, you know, and

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:43.620
[Guest]: that I think is the most fascinating thing that you meet people who share a part of their

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:49.220
[Guest]: life, knowing fully well that it's a gift I've left with you.

01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:52.220
[Guest]: And you've perhaps shared a gift back with them.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:57.380
[Guest]: And nobody's ever going to go back and say that I gave a more expensive gift as compared

01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:58.380
[Guest]: to the other.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.180
[Guest]: It's just that you've traded moments with each other, which are precious.

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:09.820
[Guest]: So I think when you look at your life as a collage of these precious moments, I think

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:14.580
[Guest]: that's, to me, what gives me happiness today.

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:18.540
[Guest]: Over a span of time, has it changed?

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.700
[Guest]: Things that I've aspired for have changed.

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:30.580
[Guest]: You know, I remember when I got my first salary, I bought myself a set of very good speakers.

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.620
[Guest]: You know, that was the first thing I purchased.

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:41.740
[Guest]: And then I was playing those tapes through a car, you know, stereo.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.900
[Guest]: And so then there's this friend of mine who came and hooked it up and, you know, he put

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.900
[Guest]: a little bit of something, something and put an amp, he put all this.

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:55.380
[Guest]: Those are all things that I gathered over a span of time, because at that point of time,

01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:56.380
[Guest]: this was a luxury.

01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.380
[Guest]: And I spent my entire first month's salary with that music system.

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:05.500
[Guest]: But it gave me so much joy, even though the quality of music, you know, the tapes used

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.500
[Guest]: to hiss.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:12.940
[Guest]: And when you created a mixed tape, it's not pristine quality that you get today, digitized

01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.020
[Guest]: and cleaned out.

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:22.300
[Guest]: But it is like the joy of eating at a roadside stall, you know, is it the world's most hygienic?

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.420
[Guest]: The answer is absolutely no.

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.040
[Guest]: But is it delightful?

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.260
[Guest]: The answer is absolutely yes.

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:36.820
[Guest]: So I think, you know, somewhere when you sanitize something over time, it sort of, you know,

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:45.660
[Guest]: loses its charm in some way, because the moment any experience becomes so sanitized, there's

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:52.140
[Guest]: nothing unique and distinctive about it, you know, so it is the same.

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:56.480
[Guest]: And I think that is the opportunity that we can still create.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:01.500
[Guest]: So it is possible to be happy, but you have to be happy on your own terms, you have to

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:06.580
[Guest]: be happy based on what matters to you, and how you would structure the day.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:13.580
[Guest]: And therefore, in some sense being without necessarily looking at a role model that all

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:18.620
[Guest]: my friends do this, you know, they're all signing up for ABC, I should be doing the

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.620
[Guest]: same, because I think they're doing the right thing and I'm not.

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:27.260
[Guest]: So I think each one lives on their own path.

01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:34.780
[Guest]: But when you're traveling on that individual path, you come across millions of travelers.

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.220
[Guest]: And those moments that you spend with them are the precious ones.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:44.780
[Guest]: But the moment you stop to take a selfie and record it, in some senses, yes, that selfie

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.740
[Guest]: will be shared and remembered for a long time.

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:56.820
[Guest]: But you know, and sometimes what it does is it makes you lazy, because you stop noticing

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.820
[Guest]: a lot of things.

01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:03.580
[Guest]: Because you know, you can always go back and look at the photograph and, you know, relive

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:04.580
[Guest]: that.

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.700
[Guest]: But you're reliving a very sanitized experience.

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.700
[Guest]: You're not reliving the smell of that place.

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.540
[Guest]: You're not reliving the temperature of that place.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.880
[Guest]: You're not reliving the sounds that were there.

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.460
[Guest]: So I think those are some of the things that you lose out as you're looking at this whole

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:32.680
[Guest]: notion of trying to do the perfect thing, the most well curated, which is, you know,

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.180
[Guest]: what are influencers doing, that's pretty much it.

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.820
[Guest]: They are telling you what you should be experiencing.

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:44.540
[Guest]: In some sense, you build a relationship of trust with the influencers.

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:48.700
[Guest]: Therefore, you say, if this guy is saying it, there must be truth to it.

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:54.740
[Guest]: Because there's such an abundance of everything that you always feel that, oh, have you heard

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:55.740
[Guest]: this?

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.740
[Guest]: Oh, you haven't.

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.740
[Guest]: You must hear it.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:59.460
[Guest]: Now, that's one reason for me to go back and listen to it.

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:04.420
[Guest]: So, you know, when you put the show notes, I take a lot of time to go through and click

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:09.220
[Guest]: on many of those, not necessarily all of them, because some of them are rabbit holes by itself,

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:12.420
[Guest]: you know, so you're going to get caught in that.

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:18.140
[Guest]: But there is this entire thing that you want to read about this person, be my guest and

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.580
[Guest]: watch it, read it, experiencing it.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:25.820
[Guest]: So I think those are some of the ways in which you can do that.

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:32.340
[Guest]: Today, of course, you have the advantage of reaching out to many people in unstructured

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:41.580
[Guest]: ways also, you know, so on an audio platform, you know, LinkedIn audio gives me an opportunity

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:46.860
[Guest]: to connect with people in an unstructured way, just switch it on and say, whoever is

01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.860
[Guest]: there.

01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.860
[Guest]: And it doesn't have to be that.

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:53.940
[Guest]: But the moment you announce it, yes, you are right that there might be 500 people in the

01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:58.900
[Guest]: room at that point of time, but the conversation of depth that you will have with that one

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:02.300
[Guest]: person is probably just as precious.

01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:09.620
[Guest]: So I think building space for serendipity without any structure, without anything is

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.540
[Guest]: probably the way I would define happiness.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:20.340
[Guest]: For me, those moments which have been completely unstructured have given me a world view, which

01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:25.300
[Guest]: I have not had the privilege of experiencing, good or bad.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:30.300
[Guest]: Even when somebody shares something which has not been perhaps the most pleasant human

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:36.620
[Guest]: experience, you're still getting the privilege of reliving vicariously that experience which

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:40.140
[Amit Varma]: you wouldn't have.

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:45.220
[Amit Varma]: Just thinking aloud, I was chatting with Amitabha Kumar in this recent episode.

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And one of the themes we discussed was how if you write every day, you're not only understanding

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:53.100
[Amit Varma]: the world a little better, you're deepening your sense of the self, you're growing as

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:56.580
[Amit Varma]: a person because you're reflecting on things you're writing that act as important.

01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:01.260
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, it struck me that every time you talk with a stranger, the same process

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.700
[Amit Varma]: is happening.

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:07.580
[Amit Varma]: Because you're getting a window into something else, which is outside of you at that moment.

01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:11.300
[Amit Varma]: And that interaction also can deepen your sense of the self and your understanding of

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.300
[Amit Varma]: the world.

01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:13.300
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.460
[Amit Varma]: And taking that Instagram selfie takes you in the opposite direction, it freezes you.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:22.100
[Amit Varma]: You know, you are no longer looking outward, you're like focused on that process, how to

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.100
[Amit Varma]: take a selfie.

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, since you praise serendipity so much, I will tell you a joke about happiness, which

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.180
[Amit Varma]: a friend told me yesterday, and I just thought of it.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:36.300
[Amit Varma]: And because you heard this joke serendipitously, you will perhaps like serendipity a little

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:37.860
[Amit Varma]: less because it is truly awful.

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.540
[Amit Varma]: But now I have to tell you, I thought of it when you said Lucy in the sky with diamonds,

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:46.460
[Amit Varma]: because this little joke about happiness is about two girls called Julie and Shuli.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.500
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so the joke goes like this, the story goes like this, the wise moral lesson goes

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.300
[Amit Varma]: like this, that Julie and Shuli are two sisters.

01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.300
[Amit Varma]: And Julie's beautiful.

01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.500
[Amit Varma]: She's just gorgeous.

01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:59.580
[Amit Varma]: Like, you look at her and time just stops.

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.260
[Amit Varma]: And Shuli is not so beautiful.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:06.260
[Amit Varma]: I mean, from inside, she's beautiful, but outside, she's not so beautiful.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:11.140
[Amit Varma]: So you know, everyone thinks that, oh, okay, are these two girls going to go in different

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.100
[Amit Varma]: directions and Shuli is also kind of conscious that this is going on.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:18.500
[Amit Varma]: Shuli's always got this complex that Julie is so beautiful and all that.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:22.180
[Amit Varma]: And this affects their personalities also, because Julie naturally more confident becomes

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:25.220
[Amit Varma]: outgoing, Shuli a little withdrawn into herself.

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:29.580
[Amit Varma]: So they go to college, and they go to college and already you can make out Julie as a happier

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:33.800
[Amit Varma]: person if you're talking about happiness, while Shuli's notion of happiness is tied

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:36.100
[Amit Varma]: up with her sister, right?

01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:37.660
[Amit Varma]: And they go to college.

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.660
[Amit Varma]: And Julie's popular.

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.780
[Amit Varma]: She's, you know, the belle of the ball and all of that.

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.780
[Amit Varma]: Everybody's wooing her.

01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:46.420
[Amit Varma]: Shuli's kind of randomly doing her thing in a corner, spending more and more time in the

01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:49.220
[Amit Varma]: library because a lack of confidence and all of that.

01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:52.940
[Amit Varma]: So they kind of drift apart in terms of personality also.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:56.500
[Amit Varma]: And eventually they find boyfriends and they get married.

01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:01.020
[Amit Varma]: And Julie, of course, marries this really rich hunk from an industrial family and he

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.220
[Amit Varma]: can have his pick of girls.

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:06.340
[Amit Varma]: But of course, he picks Julie because she's just so incredibly gorgeous, right?

01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:08.500
[Amit Varma]: And gregarious by now because confidence matters.

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.820
[Amit Varma]: So he married Julie.

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:16.420
[Amit Varma]: And Shuli marries, you know, a standard accountant kind of guy, not very rich, not very well

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.540
[Amit Varma]: to do, but it's like you settle, right?

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.940
[Amit Varma]: But she's obviously jealous of Julie, but she's like, okay, I'll settle.

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:28.020
[Amit Varma]: And then after their respective marriages, you know, Julie's birthday comes around and

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.860
[Amit Varma]: it's about 16 days before Shuli's birthday.

01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.100
[Amit Varma]: So on Julie's birthday, her husband gives her this beautiful diamond necklace, which

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.100
[Amit Varma]: is glowing.

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:39.900
[Amit Varma]: And it's like you turn off the lights and it's like, you know, it's a necklace of stars

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:41.980
[Amit Varma]: and it's just beautiful, it's gorgeous.

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:47.820
[Amit Varma]: So Julie shows it to Shuli and Shuli's happiness quotient just took a big dip because she's

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.940
[Amit Varma]: like, oh my God, diamond necklace.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:54.100
[Amit Varma]: So she tells her husband that, you know, and her husband's a really nice guy.

01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.220
[Amit Varma]: Maybe Shuli doesn't deserve the guy, but he's a really nice guy.

01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:57.940
[Amit Varma]: And he's like, no, I love her very much.

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I have to make her happy, again, notion of happiness.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.820
[Amit Varma]: So what does he do?

01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.580
[Amit Varma]: He mortgages his house, his ancestral home or whatever, whatever he had inherited, this

01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:12.100
[Amit Varma]: small sort of thing in a corner of the city, mortgages it, gets her that same necklace.

01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:14.980
[Amit Varma]: And at that moment, Shuli is happy.

01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:18.380
[Amit Varma]: And because Shuli is happy and her husband is a nice guy and he loves her, he is happy

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.380
[Amit Varma]: in her happiness.

01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.380
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:23.700
[Amit Varma]: It's a beautiful story so far developing.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:30.680
[Amit Varma]: Then a couple of years pass and then on another birthday, Julie's husband buys her this massive

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.740
[Amit Varma]: palatial house and it's just a beautiful house.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:38.100
[Amit Varma]: And she takes Shuli there and she says, look what a beautiful house and I will have a house

01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.880
[Amit Varma]: warming in this and that and all that.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.500
[Amit Varma]: And Shuli is now feeling horrible.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:48.500
[Amit Varma]: And her husband, a really good guy who genuinely loves her still, sees Shuli's unhappiness

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:52.260
[Amit Varma]: and therefore her unhappiness leads to his unhappiness.

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.380
[Amit Varma]: And he thinks I have to get her a house like this.

01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:57.900
[Amit Varma]: Now the point is, his existing tiny house is mortgaged.

01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.900
[Amit Varma]: What's he going to do to get a house like this?

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.900
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:01.900
[Amit Varma]: Tough times.

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.060
[Amit Varma]: He sells a kidney.

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.660
[Amit Varma]: He sells a kidney and he gets her a house like that.

01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:11.300
[Amit Varma]: So Shuli and Julie are now in the same swank neighborhood and Julie's got a beautiful diamond

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:15.340
[Amit Varma]: necklace and a big house and Shuli's got a beautiful diamond necklace and a big house

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:22.260
[Amit Varma]: and the husband has mortgages and one kidney less and whatever that shit happens.

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:28.540
[Amit Varma]: Then a couple of years later, Julie's husband buys her this incredible bus, right?

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:33.500
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like a home in itself, like you enter the bus and there's a living room, there's

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.340
[Amit Varma]: an area where you sit and there's actually marble inside the bus.

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:40.500
[Amit Varma]: It's like really swank, the bathroom fittings and all are incredible.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.740
[Amit Varma]: It's like being in a luxury five star hotel, like even beyond that.

01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:46.300
[Amit Varma]: It's like hasrat.

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.580
[Unknown]: It's hasrat, okay?

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:52.180
[Amit Varma]: That bus is like hasrat and there's beautiful pipe music playing everywhere, like not the

01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:55.380
[Amit Varma]: kind of crappy music you would have put in your car after spending a month's salary.

01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:57.420
[Amit Varma]: This is really good music, yeah?

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.740
[Amit Varma]: Incredible system, everything is like absolutely top class.

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:04.980
[Amit Varma]: And Julie's damn excited and she calls Shuli over to come and look at this.

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:09.260
[Amit Varma]: And Shuli is like, fuck, because no more does that diamond necklace give her happiness.

01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:12.240
[Unknown]: No more does that big house give her happiness.

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.420
[Amit Varma]: Now she wants a bus like this.

01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:20.500
[Amit Varma]: So she tells her husband and her husband who's finally, you know, mid career, whatever, he's

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:24.900
[Amit Varma]: doing things even with one kidney, he's kind of managing and things are okay.

01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:30.620
[Amit Varma]: He calls every relative and takes every loan he can, he goes to every bank, he does all

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:31.620
[Amit Varma]: kinds of things.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:34.560
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I should not tell you this, because it's confidential information.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.820
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of sad, but he defrauds his company in a way that is guaranteed to get

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:40.820
[Amit Varma]: him into trouble later.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:44.700
[Amit Varma]: But he does it because he thinks that I have to be happy.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.980
[Amit Varma]: My happiness lies in Shuli's happiness, the bus will make her happy.

01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:51.500
[Amit Varma]: So he buys this bus for Shuli, right?

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:57.620
[Amit Varma]: So now both the sisters have a diamond necklace, which sparkles like the stars in the sky when

01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:58.620
[Guest]: you turn off the light at night.

01:51:58.620 --> 01:51:59.620
[Amit Varma]: I kind of think I know.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:04.500
[Unknown]: Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, don't spoil it for the listener.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.460
[Amit Varma]: And they have this beautiful house.

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:08.340
[Amit Varma]: And they have these two buses.

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.340
[Amit Varma]: And one day Shuli says, you know what, I think both the couples, we should go on a vacation

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:15.340
[Amit Varma]: in this bus.

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:18.380
[Amit Varma]: And let's go somewhere, they name some cliff or whatever.

01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.740
[Amit Varma]: And they go on a vacation in the bus.

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:26.180
[Amit Varma]: And they leave the buses by the beach, and they go and they swim.

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.300
[Amit Varma]: And it's a beautiful time.

01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.300
[Amit Varma]: And they're in the moment.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:32.820
[Amit Varma]: There's no structure, they're not taking selfies, they're happy, Shuli is really happy.

01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.580
[Amit Varma]: And then they get back to the bus.

01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:40.020
[Amit Varma]: And both the buses have been stripped bare, thieves have broken in, they've taken everything,

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:44.580
[Amit Varma]: the carpets are gone, the marble is gone, the bathroom fittings are gone, the sofa is

01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:48.220
[Amit Varma]: gone, the piped music system is gone, who would take that?

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:51.620
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's just an additional logical hassle to install it somewhere else.

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.980
[Amit Varma]: But it's all gone.

01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:53.980
[Amit Varma]: Everything is gone.

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:57.700
[Amit Varma]: Both buses are completely bare.

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.820
[Amit Varma]: And Julie sitting there standing there by the beach looking out into the sea.

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:07.260
[Amit Varma]: And Shuli from behind walks through the sand, leaving footprints as one tends to do in the

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:10.740
[Amit Varma]: sand, you might be aware of this tendency of sand.

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.980
[Amit Varma]: And she goes over to Julie.

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:18.860
[Guest]: And what does she say to Julie?

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:22.020
[Guest]: Oh, God.

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:30.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking.

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.500
[Amit Varma]: You're thinking what have I gotten myself into?

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.500
[Amit Varma]: I need a break.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:37.180
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's take a quick commercial break and we'll come back and talk more.

01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:39.660
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:43.820
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:47.900
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays.

01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:50.900
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.480
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge?

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.980
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:58.100
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:05.060
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.780
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more.

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:13.220
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader.

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:16.940
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read.

01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:22.140
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.740
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:28.260
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:32.620
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out

[Amit Varma]: They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up to date with

[Amit Varma]: ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future.

[Amit Varma]: So head on over to CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com and use the code UNSEEN.

[Amit Varma]: Up level yourself.

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.140
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:11.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with my guest Abhijit Bahaduri, who just had a shared experience of a Bollywood

01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:15.300
[Amit Varma]: song before we came into the break.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.260
[Amit Varma]: So I don't think he's going to be raving about shared experiences that much after this.

01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:23.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, before we get back to your career track and get back to the linear track and

01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:24.740
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.580
[Amit Varma]: Another question I had with reference to your earlier days is that did you see yourself

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:33.820
[Amit Varma]: as a writer slash storyteller in the early days, because you're reading a lot, you're

01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:37.980
[Amit Varma]: reading in different languages, you are a creative person.

01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:39.980
[Amit Varma]: And you've gone on to write many books later.

01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:44.140
[Amit Varma]: But at that early stage, as you were growing up and all of that, and Bengalis do tend to

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:48.100
[Amit Varma]: see themselves a little bit as artists, I mean, I'm half bong, but I kind of consider

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.780
[Amit Varma]: myself more bong than anything else.

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:54.380
[Amit Varma]: So that thing is there in the culture that, you know, writing, creating, those are things

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.380
[Amit Varma]: that you do.

01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:56.980
[Amit Varma]: So how was it like for you?

01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:01.060
[Amit Varma]: What was that journey through?

01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:08.260
[Guest]: You know, when I was growing up, my father was, he had a master's degree in English,

01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.140
[Guest]: and he was a gold medalist from Calcutta University.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:17.420
[Guest]: He was really very fond of reading all kinds of languages, as I said, that I still remember

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:26.760
[Guest]: we had the fattest Hindi dictionary at home, you know, and so he used to sort of get me

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.380
[Guest]: to read a whole bunch of things.

01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:36.740
[Guest]: We used to get the illustrated weekly and I distinctly remember his method would be

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:41.940
[Guest]: that he would ask me to read some of these editorial pieces in a newspaper, or some specific

01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:46.700
[Guest]: writers, you know, Khushwant Singh, Mulk Rajan and various people who used to write for the

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:49.100
[Guest]: weekly in those days.

01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:54.620
[Guest]: And he would, you know, get me to summarize something, sometimes he would say write an

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.180
[Guest]: essay on a similar topic.

01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:02.540
[Guest]: And, and I used to find it so completely pointless that, you know, what is this even helping

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:06.660
[Guest]: me do, you know, but that was his obsession.

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:12.740
[Guest]: He just really wanted to inculcate a love for the language and reading and all that.

01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:19.620
[Guest]: And, you know, and this whole thing that I read a fair bit, but more importantly, he

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:24.940
[Guest]: would sort of correct all the errors and the structures, he would say this just so wordy,

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:29.420
[Guest]: I still think, you know, I write very long sentences, so I must take your course and

01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:32.260
[Guest]: improve my writing.

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:38.980
[Guest]: But yeah, that was, you know, the whole process, but I think that was the grammatical part

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.340
[Guest]: of learning the language and writing.

01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:48.580
[Guest]: But I think a lot of my writing was encouraged by my grandparents, you know, so when I would

01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:57.180
[Guest]: travel a lot, you know, in these little experiences, I would write about them to my grandparents.

01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:03.620
[Guest]: My grandmother would have a collection of these inlaid letters and, you know, envelopes

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:06.900
[Guest]: and sheets.

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:13.300
[Guest]: All of it, she would have it stuck in a file and she would mark them, some are sad stories,

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:16.980
[Guest]: some are funny stories, and she would have these little things.

01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:23.340
[Guest]: And she would, when she would get visitors, she would, you know, completely bore them

01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:28.220
[Guest]: to death by reading out some of these letters I wrote to them.

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:33.420
[Guest]: But that in some sense, encouraged me to write because she would say, you know, it was fun

01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:36.660
[Guest]: to read this and write about this.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:42.260
[Guest]: And then at a point of time, you know, when I started to draw a little bit, I would illustrate

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:48.500
[Guest]: those letters and draw little cartoons in the margins somewhere.

01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:55.460
[Guest]: So I started doing those, then I would occasionally draw and send them something and write a little

01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:58.220
[Guest]: stuff at the corners.

01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:05.060
[Guest]: So that was really a lot of the writing, which is for others to read.

01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:12.940
[Guest]: But I think I sort of had my first short story published when I was in, again, eighth or

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:18.340
[Guest]: ninth in school in Hindi, ironically.

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.420
[Guest]: So I wrote that, and I don't even remember what it was, except for the fact that when

01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:30.700
[Guest]: it got printed, suddenly I discovered that seeing something in print gave me a real thrill.

01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:37.580
[Guest]: So then I would draw for some of these magazines and newspapers and all that.

01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:42.180
[Guest]: So Hindustan Times, for example, used to have something called a children's corner, which

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:45.980
[Guest]: I used to, you know, submit some drawings for and all that.

01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.700
[Guest]: It was good fun.

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:52.500
[Guest]: So that was my indulgence that I would, you know, read something, try to illustrate it

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.820
[Guest]: and create those.

01:59:54.820 --> 02:00:02.620
[Guest]: Those were the pieces when I started editing the Hindi newspaper magazine, which I did

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.980
[Guest]: in school in the 11th and 12th.

02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:10.940
[Guest]: There was a time when I wrote, you know, a little more, edited a little more stuff.

02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:16.380
[Guest]: And then I started also writing in English at that point of time, you know, I was writing

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.020
[Guest]: little scripts for those radio plays, etc.

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:25.300
[Guest]: That, you know, got me to spend a lot more time writing English.

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:33.580
[Guest]: Bengali, unfortunately, my spellings in Bengali are terrible and, you know, so, and it's an

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:35.540
[Guest]: effort for me to write.

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:39.380
[Guest]: So I never really got down to writing in Bengali.

02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:46.580
[Guest]: But I think when I started reading and writing, I think there's a ratio, until you read a

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:50.220
[Guest]: certain amount, you cannot and should not be allowed to write.

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.700
[Guest]: So I think there's a little bit of that.

02:00:53.700 --> 02:01:00.900
[Guest]: And then, you know, progressively, I started writing for different kinds of magazines and

02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:02.820
[Guest]: things here and there.

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.940
[Guest]: And once you get published, I think you kind of get a feeling that, all right, now I should

02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:09.780
[Guest]: write some more.

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:13.780
[Guest]: So it's, it was that.

02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:19.780
[Guest]: I published my first work of fiction much later when I was already working and all that.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:22.460
[Guest]: So that was a much later journey.

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.460
[Guest]: But yeah, I wrote a lot of letters, I guess.

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:32.660
[Guest]: My father would insist on my writing, even though when I was living away from him.

02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:36.980
[Guest]: I used to call him every weekend.

02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:43.220
[Guest]: But he would always say that, no, I mean, it does not absolve you from this whole thing

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.220
[Guest]: of writing.

02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.820
[Guest]: He loved reading.

02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:48.660
[Guest]: So letters, he wrote extremely well.

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:52.600
[Guest]: So he would say, just write to me.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.060
[Guest]: And then there was a point of time when I found it a burden that I would tell him that,

02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:59.940
[Guest]: look, I can't be writing, you know, like long letters to you every week.

02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:02.740
[Guest]: That's not possible, because I'm also talking to you.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:08.180
[Guest]: And so much is not happening in my life that I can tell you that this happened, that happened.

02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:12.140
[Guest]: So he says, no, nothing has to happen for you to write.

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:15.980
[Guest]: You can write about whatever strikes your fancy, whatever you're thinking about.

02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:16.980
[Guest]: That's far better.

02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:21.460
[Guest]: I would rather you sort of did that rather than to be like a diary that today I went

02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:23.540
[Guest]: out to eat and tomorrow I...

02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:26.160
[Guest]: So it's not that.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.620
[Guest]: This whole process, I think, also, in some sense, built in this whole discipline of that

02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:37.580
[Guest]: writing demands, you know, so then you have to sort of have a routine.

02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:42.100
[Guest]: So I would feel very guilty if I didn't write to him because I knew he, at one level, he

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:46.540
[Guest]: would say, no, it's not something that I'm imposing on you, but I love to read what you

02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.380
[Guest]: write for me.

02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:54.780
[Guest]: And that, I think, built the discipline of writing, which I'm now, the grammar that I

02:02:54.780 --> 02:03:01.900
[Guest]: learned or, you know, the prose and exposure to various other great writers.

02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:09.780
[Guest]: That I think I owe to him, you know, whether it was my exposure to all the various novelists

02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:11.920
[Guest]: that I read.

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.180
[Guest]: But I also think that in parallel, I owe my love for music to my mother who would play

02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:21.300
[Guest]: a lot of these things.

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:27.020
[Guest]: So I think it was a great happy blend of literature and music in that sense.

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:30.060
[Guest]: Would I imagine that I would have wanted to be a writer?

02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:34.940
[Guest]: I don't think I ever thought I have a book that I can write.

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:40.660
[Guest]: I was happy being a columnist, you know, so the occasional thing that appears in a newspaper

02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:44.700
[Guest]: was good enough for me.

02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:50.700
[Guest]: Writing was, again, I stumbled upon it, you know, so that's why there are so many roadblocks

02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:51.700
[Guest]: in my writing.

02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:52.700
[Guest]: I only stumble.

02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:58.940
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what you're talking about, because I really enjoy Dreamers and Unicorns.

02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:05.100
[Amit Varma]: You know, one recent lament of mine has been that back in the 80s, 90s, we used to write

02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:06.580
[Amit Varma]: these wrong letters, right?

02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:10.820
[Amit Varma]: You sit down to write a letter to your friend, perhaps with actual pen and paper, which even

02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:16.260
[Amit Varma]: slows the process down further, there's a lot of consideration that goes into it.

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And more than that, there is this very touching connection you're making, in which by the

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.620
[Amit Varma]: act of writing a letter to someone and spending that time and sharing your thoughts, you are

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:31.060
[Amit Varma]: also telling them you are important to me.

02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:33.980
[Amit Varma]: And when they write to you, they are giving you the same message.

02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.060
[Amit Varma]: And that is a connection.

02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:40.060
[Amit Varma]: And today, in a world where so much is just instrumental, we are all the time in these

02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:44.240
[Amit Varma]: short crisp emails or WhatsApp messages, are you free at eight, or I hope you're feeling

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:46.140
[Amit Varma]: better and all of that.

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:51.660
[Amit Varma]: And we've kind of lost that, like I advise my students all the time to journal, which

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:56.420
[Amit Varma]: in a sense is, you know, writing to themselves and deepening their sense of themselves.

02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:59.820
[Amit Varma]: But you know, just thinking aloud, maybe I would add to that, that, you know, write to

02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:05.420
[Amit Varma]: someone you love, write letters the way they kind of used to be, because we don't do that

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:06.420
[Amit Varma]: enough.

02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:11.580
[Amit Varma]: And looking back, do you feel that, you know, the voice of the letters you wrote to whoever,

02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:16.420
[Amit Varma]: to your dad or to your friends or whatever, to your grandparents, the voice was different

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:23.420
[Amit Varma]: from what you would go on to publish and write later, because, you know, what was that like?

02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:27.900
[Amit Varma]: Because the good part of something like that, where you're writing a letter to your grandmother,

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:29.940
[Amit Varma]: is that you're not self-conscious.

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:33.420
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to posture, you don't have to pretend, you don't have to impress her.

02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:36.100
[Amit Varma]: You are her grandkid, she is impressed.

02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:37.420
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to do that.

02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:38.420
[Amit Varma]: What was your writing like?

02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:39.420
[Amit Varma]: Do you remember?

02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:47.140
[Guest]: Sir, a lot of it was, you know, my experience of meeting different kinds of people in different

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.140
[Guest]: places.

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:54.100
[Guest]: You know, so when you live in some of these smaller towns, my dad's work would take him

02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:56.500
[Guest]: to even smaller places.

02:05:56.500 --> 02:06:03.100
[Guest]: So you know, the experience of being in those kind of things where, you know, sometimes,

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:09.260
[Guest]: and photography was expensive, you know, it was certainly something that was reserved.

02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:14.140
[Guest]: So in some sense, I kind of think about it as, in those days, we used to hold our breath

02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:19.100
[Guest]: when a photograph was taken, so that it doesn't get spoiled, or you can sort of take a photograph

02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:24.100
[Guest]: of your big toe and put 35 of those photographs anywhere that you wish.

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:31.580
[Guest]: So we live in a world of abundance where you're far more careless with the resources.

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:36.620
[Guest]: Those days, you know, so what would happen is if, let's say, if I wrote on a white sheet

02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:42.980
[Guest]: of paper, and I would draw those railway, the signs of the platforms, you know, which

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:47.300
[Guest]: reads out in yellow and black, in different languages.

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:53.740
[Guest]: So suppose you were in some place where there's a third language, it's normally Hindi, English,

02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:56.780
[Guest]: and whatever regional language it's there.

02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:03.020
[Guest]: So when they do that, I would try and mimic that particular script.

02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:06.500
[Guest]: So it didn't make sense to me, of course, I knew what was the station which they were

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.020
[Guest]: talking about.

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:12.980
[Guest]: But I would sort of mimic that particular script and draw it out in that sense.

02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.180
[Guest]: And then I would color it yellow and sort of put that.

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:23.140
[Guest]: So a lot of those letters, it was a labor of love, you know, you spend a long time,

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:26.220
[Guest]: it would take a fraction of a minute to read.

02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:31.260
[Guest]: But a lot of care had gone into, you know, illustrating that and perhaps showing one

02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:32.620
[Guest]: person sitting there, etc.

02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:39.740
[Guest]: So this whole act of writing, drawing, writing, drawing is a very seamless process for me.

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:43.740
[Guest]: Because it was easier to draw than to take a photograph and put it there.

02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:47.220
[Guest]: And photograph would mean that, you know, you wait for the reel to finish and then that's

02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.220
[Guest]: rationed out.

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:50.860
[Guest]: And then you kind of, you know, give it for processing.

02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:55.060
[Guest]: And then that takes a couple of days, and then you come back and then suddenly you discover

02:07:55.060 --> 02:08:00.360
[Guest]: what you wanted to send that particular film has got, role has got spoiled.

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:04.740
[Guest]: So drawing was far more certain, I could do it there in the moment and that I think, you

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:12.420
[Guest]: know, and then I would do, I would copy a number of, you know, like, I started by copying

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:13.420
[Guest]: R.K.

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:16.980
[Guest]: Lakshman's drawings, caricatures, I would do that.

02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:22.060
[Guest]: And I would do a lot of Mario Miranda's drawings, and I started to discover that he was very

02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:27.420
[Guest]: good as an illustrator, not, I didn't like his cartoons so much, but I loved his illustrations,

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:30.500
[Guest]: you know, I just thought they were magical.

02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:36.180
[Guest]: And then, after a span of time, then I started getting fascinated with Ajit Nayanan, who

02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:41.740
[Guest]: I, you know, we had the privilege of spending a little bit of time because I was doing a

02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:48.820
[Guest]: series for this magazine called Target, which was then edited by Rosalind Wilson and had

02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:55.380
[Guest]: a phenomenal set of people who were very encouraging of, you know, people who are just beginning

02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:57.820
[Guest]: to write a little bit here and there.

02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:03.940
[Guest]: And I got a chance to do that kind of a series around drawing cartoons, how do you draw cartoons.

02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:08.340
[Guest]: And Rosalind said that, since this was part of the India Today group, she said, why don't

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:12.140
[Guest]: you go and spend some time with Ajit, you will enjoy chatting with him.

02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:17.780
[Guest]: That was my, you know, there's again one of those things which was phenomenal, because

02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:22.100
[Guest]: again, somebody whose art I tremendously admired.

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:28.180
[Guest]: So I think those are some of the things, finally, it comes together in the form of a book at

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:29.860
[Guest]: some stage.

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:36.580
[Guest]: But there is a whole lot of, you know, riyaz that goes into it before you actually write

02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:37.580
[Guest]: a book.

02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:41.960
[Guest]: So it's a much further down the path.

02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.180
[Guest]: So did I think of being a writer?

02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:46.300
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:49.620
[Guest]: I wanted to be a writer, but I didn't know I would write a book.

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:54.260
[Guest]: The format was not very clear in my head.

02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:55.740
[Guest]: I felt like writing a story.

02:09:55.740 --> 02:10:01.020
[Guest]: So I wrote a story, then at some point of time, wrote a sequel, then I wrote, you know,

02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:06.380
[Guest]: nonfiction as a way to challenge myself, then I tried to illustrate it and I wanted to do

02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:10.900
[Guest]: a graphic novel, but you know, there was so much of content that I wanted to write about.

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.620
[Guest]: So the book Digital Tsunami happened in that format.

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:20.100
[Guest]: Then of course, this one, Dreamers and Unicorns.

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:25.380
[Guest]: So that's been the progression of writing.

02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk about your journey now.

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:34.180
[Amit Varma]: But before we kind of begin talking about your career and your journey, one tendency

02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:39.740
[Amit Varma]: in a lot of your writing is that, as I said at the start of the episode, that you're taking

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:46.620
[Amit Varma]: a step back and you're kind of taking a broader view and building sort of frameworks.

02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:52.580
[Amit Varma]: And the question here is that, was that a tendency that was always in you to sort of

02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:56.580
[Amit Varma]: try and figure things out and therefore go back to first principles or try and figure

02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:59.140
[Amit Varma]: things out at a meta level and whatever.

02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:02.860
[Amit Varma]: And then if you have that kind of thinking or that habit of thinking like that, then

02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:07.700
[Amit Varma]: you can take a step back from anything and just look around and kind of apply those.

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.620
[Amit Varma]: So was that something that was there from the start?

02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.020
[Amit Varma]: Or is it something that evolved in the course of your career?

02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:16.900
[Amit Varma]: And you know, like when I think of HR, most people have a really bad impression of HR

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:17.900
[Amit Varma]: people.

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.980
[Amit Varma]: I have to confess still, till I saw your talks and I read your books, I was also like that

02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:27.740
[Amit Varma]: these are the, you know, I won't use the word, but yeah, no, no, never.

02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:33.300
[Amit Varma]: But the point being that, and this is true of everything, I guess, not just of HR.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:37.900
[Amit Varma]: The point being that you can approach a subject or a field in two ways.

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:44.100
[Amit Varma]: And one is that while learning it, you in a sense, learn it in a shallow superficial

02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:45.100
[Amit Varma]: way.

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:48.940
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of ratta maaro everything that you have to ratta maaro in the good Indian

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:49.940
[Amit Varma]: tradition.

02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And then when you get out of there and you join a company, you tick boxes, things are

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:58.660
[Amit Varma]: expected of you and you tick those boxes so that your boss is saying, okay, you've done

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:04.280
[Amit Varma]: your work or, you know, when it comes to what you expect from others, you are making them

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.860
[Amit Varma]: tick boxes and you're not kind of really thinking deeper and going beyond that.

02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:15.780
[Amit Varma]: And I think most people perhaps fall into the rut when it comes to simply thinking like

02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:20.800
[Amit Varma]: that, going through the motions, doing what has to be done in any field, not just HR.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:25.780
[Amit Varma]: And what others would do is kind of take the initiative, think a little deeper, think beyond

02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:30.160
[Amit Varma]: those boxes that you have to tick and ask that, does this really make a question?

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.500
[Amit Varma]: Is this justified in this situation?

02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:34.460
[Amit Varma]: Why are these boxes here in the first place?

02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:36.180
[Amit Varma]: Where have they evolved from?

02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:37.780
[Amit Varma]: You know, what can I do different?

02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:39.360
[Amit Varma]: How is the world changing?

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.360
[Amit Varma]: All of that.

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:41.360
[Amit Varma]: You've clearly done all of that.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.320
[Amit Varma]: That's your whole body of work that you've kind of come out of it.

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.860
[Amit Varma]: But when you started, were you kind of in the first category and you managed to move

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.860
[Amit Varma]: into the second category, do you think that some people perhaps get trapped in the first

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:53.860
[Amit Varma]: category?

02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:57.160
[Amit Varma]: Like maybe if you're studying a subject you don't like, then you don't want to do the

02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.160
[Amit Varma]: deeper thinking.

02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.320
[Amit Varma]: You're like, shit, okay, I'm doing this because I have to learn the skill and I have to make

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:02.920
[Amit Varma]: myself employable.

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:05.720
[Amit Varma]: So I can buy Shooli a bus later on down the line.

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:07.960
[Amit Varma]: So you know, a lot of circumstances.

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that.

02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.120
[Amit Varma]: Like I know it's all in retrospect, hindsight mein toh kuch bhi bol sakte hain, but looking

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:18.960
[Amit Varma]: back on yourself, were you that kind of person who is, you know, taking that cross disciplinary

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.640
[Amit Varma]: meta view, you're applying concepts from one thing to another thing.

02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And already your reading, as we discussed, has been broad, you know, so what is that

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.360
[Amit Varma]: like?

02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.600
[Guest]: Take me a little bit through.

02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:40.120
[Guest]: You know, when I got into XLRA to pursue a career in HR, personal management, as it was

02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:47.960
[Guest]: called at that point of time, I had absolutely zero exposure to corporate India.

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:55.800
[Guest]: And you know, as I wrote in my first work of fiction, Mediocre but Arrogant, the line

02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:01.880
[Guest]: that I used there was that I knew of three companies, Tata, Bata and Sunlight, you know,

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:05.040
[Guest]: so I was that naive about the entire thing.

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.660
[Guest]: My father was in the government, that's the only world I had seen.

02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:12.520
[Guest]: And I didn't want to be, you know, in the government.

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.400
[Guest]: And this was the new thing, in some sense, it was curiosity, not necessarily because

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.520
[Guest]: I had a great formed opinion about what it would be like.

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:27.360
[Guest]: And so then I kind of, you know, stumbled into it, again, from the point of view of

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.620
[Guest]: writing exams and this and that.

02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:40.400
[Guest]: And I was not very academically inclined when I was growing up in college, etc.

02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.600
[Guest]: College for me was one of the most enjoyable experiences.

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:54.080
[Guest]: And I think it sort of, you do meet an amazing range of people, you get to experiment a lot

02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.960
[Guest]: with your life.

02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:03.000
[Guest]: And it's done when you have no responsibilities, you know, college in India is such a unique

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
[Guest]: experience.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.480
[Guest]: Delhi University, at least the time when I grew up, was very not so much, you know, structured

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.260
[Guest]: that you now need to do this, that and the other.

02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:16.400
[Guest]: It was things that you did because you enjoyed.

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:21.920
[Guest]: So I spent a lot of time in theatre in college and, you know, I was part of the debating

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:22.920
[Guest]: society.

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:27.520
[Guest]: I got exposure to a number of people, I read, I traveled, I did all of that.

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.160
[Guest]: So it's really that.

02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:33.200
[Guest]: Academics was a very small part of what was there, you had to do that in order to survive.

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:38.280
[Guest]: So that was the way I look at it.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:44.080
[Guest]: It was when I started working for Tata Steel, when I went there, you know, I was part of

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:50.960
[Guest]: the setup, which was being run by Dr. Jitu Singh, who was then, you know, when I was

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.320
[Guest]: a student at Excel, he was teaching me, he was the Dean at Excel.

02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:00.120
[Guest]: He had moved to Tata Steel and I was part of that group he was doing.

02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:02.880
[Guest]: And I had never been in training and development before in my life.

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.280
[Guest]: You know, I had done regular HR, you know, industrial relations, factory strikes, all

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:10.360
[Guest]: that I was familiar with.

02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:16.340
[Guest]: But when I joined there, you know, so I was delighted to get the job.

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:20.100
[Guest]: For one simple reason, it was in the Excel campus.

02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:25.440
[Guest]: So it was just, you know, if you visualize a building shaped like a U, one wing of that

02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:29.360
[Guest]: one arm of that U was the XLRI library.

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:32.920
[Guest]: The other arm of the U was the office where I went.

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:39.600
[Guest]: So it sort of saunter in and out of, you know, that office and walk into the campus for a

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:46.040
[Guest]: cup of tea to have a cigarette and all of that was, you know, that just was the big

02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:48.400
[Guest]: motivation for me to take up this role.

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:54.320
[Guest]: When I went there, he sort of said that, why didn't you teach a course in learning and

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.320
[Guest]: development?

02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.640
[Guest]: Now, in retrospect, perhaps he did that because he realized that I was horribly illiterate

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:06.200
[Guest]: about what I was supposed to be teaching during my day job.

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.960
[Guest]: So while I protested, but he said, I've already committed to teach one semester and then we

02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.280
[Guest]: look at what can be done.

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:19.640
[Guest]: You know, that was a transformational experience for me because teaching people, you know,

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:24.240
[Guest]: where you've been on the other side of the bench, you realize that, you know, how the

02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:29.880
[Guest]: students can be completely cruel towards, you know, profs who don't know what they're

02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:34.520
[Guest]: talking about or who are sort of saying something which is obvious and mundane and all of that.

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.520
[Guest]: So you just put a tremendous responsibility on me, you know, that I just felt I had to

02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:43.600
[Guest]: make up for lost time.

02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:48.720
[Guest]: So during the period when I was to actually offer the course, I sat down and really structured

02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.720
[Guest]: my thoughts.

02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.240
[Guest]: I read and I created a coursework and all this stuff.

02:17:53.240 --> 02:18:00.320
[Guest]: I first tried to, you know, just look for the subject outline when I was a student.

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:01.940
[Guest]: And then I discovered that I didn't have that.

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:06.080
[Guest]: So I had to start ground upwards and put that.

02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.440
[Guest]: And the whole process of working with some of the other professors there, you know, who

02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:17.000
[Guest]: I became great friends with, and those were people who sort of I learned continuously

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
[Guest]: from.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.960
[Guest]: I had great colleagues who I learned from.

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:26.800
[Guest]: And of course, you know, this access to the Excel library where there was no requirement,

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:30.960
[Guest]: it was your own drive to, you know, that if I'm saying something and somebody says, how

02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.960
[Guest]: do you know that?

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:36.080
[Guest]: Can I at least go back and say, yes, I actually read that.

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.800
[Guest]: That I think was a real transformational phase for me.

02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:43.440
[Guest]: And I developed the love for reading business books.

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:49.520
[Guest]: That was when I first read, otherwise I had no exposure and no interest in reading any

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.760
[Guest]: business book whatsoever.

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:55.000
[Guest]: I think the very first business book that I would have read after Excel, it would have

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:59.800
[Guest]: been years later when I did In Search of Excellence or something to that effect.

02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:03.240
[Guest]: That was the first business book that I read.

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.600
[Guest]: Because the whole notion in my head was who reads business books for fun?

02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.320
[Guest]: I mean, how can that be anything?

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:15.360
[Guest]: Because for me, the yardstick was always, you know, the literature that I had gone through.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:22.320
[Guest]: And then I kind of thought that if I can bring literature and, you know, my love for movies

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:28.640
[Guest]: and all that into the teaching, it legitimizes my watching a movie, you know, while I'm sort

02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:30.360
[Guest]: of doing that.

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:33.480
[Guest]: And that's what I started experimenting with, you know.

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:44.960
[Guest]: So I remember trying to explain group formation, you know, to the class that I was teaching.

02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:51.200
[Guest]: You couldn't sort of just be pompous and talk about various models because I didn't know

02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:53.080
[Guest]: enough of them.

02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:57.320
[Guest]: And more importantly, they were like friends, you know, most of them were like my vintage,

02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:58.320
[Guest]: you know.

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.640
[Guest]: They may have been a year or two younger than me, but that was it.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:08.640
[Guest]: That forced me to sort of say, not talk down to them, but how do I translate it in a manner

02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:11.160
[Guest]: which connects?

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:17.720
[Guest]: So I started playing a lot of, you know, Bollywood movie clips and all that and started explaining

02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.720
[Guest]: for it.

02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:24.120
[Guest]: I distinctly remember playing Mirch Masala, you know, the final scene where, you know,

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:27.960
[Guest]: Smita Patil is locked up in that fortress and they're trying to sort of do that.

02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:35.080
[Guest]: And the conversation that it emerges from, or using Ek Rukav Gafesla, 12 Angry Men to

02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:39.160
[Guest]: explain group formation when you're looking at that.

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:45.000
[Guest]: I mean, those are ways in which I started to bring in a different discipline.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:51.160
[Guest]: And as you start looking at doing stuff like that, you know, I thought if I can bring in

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:55.520
[Guest]: my drawings and, you know, create cartoons on those little slides, you know, that would

02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:56.920
[Guest]: be fun to do.

02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:59.800
[Guest]: So I started doing all of that again.

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:05.440
[Guest]: So once again, you know, I carried back my movies and my drawing and my literature and

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:09.320
[Guest]: everything back into the business world that I was doing.

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:13.520
[Guest]: And I think that when you start to bring in a multidisciplinary perspective and try and

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:20.680
[Guest]: sort of explain it, you can make it interesting and simple to understand without really thinking

02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:22.560
[Guest]: that you have to dumb it down.

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:28.560
[Guest]: I also think that, you know, one of the things that I heard from one of my professors, he

02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:36.720
[Guest]: said, if there are 35 ways in which you can build something, you must know all 35.

02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:41.040
[Guest]: It is only then that you can simplify it and say, okay, forget all this.

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.880
[Guest]: Here is how you would do it.

02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:45.360
[Guest]: And that is something that has stayed with me.

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:50.720
[Guest]: I can't say that I can do it equally well all the time, but that's what I want to do.

02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:55.400
[Guest]: You know, so the sketches are really a method of simplifying that.

02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:57.800
[Guest]: This is how I've understood it.

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:01.320
[Guest]: And let me simplify this and make it accessible to you.

02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:10.560
[Guest]: So that's really the way I think, so it's more of multidisciplinary point of view, which

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:15.960
[Guest]: sort of gives you a very different interpretation and which is why I think if you really want

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:25.000
[Guest]: to do human resources or talent management, as we call it today, you must have a love

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.480
[Guest]: for reading sociology or anthropology and psychology and sort of bring all that in.

02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:38.280
[Guest]: Because it's only then that you understand that it's really all fitting into one common

02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:41.120
[Guest]: kind of big picture.

02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:46.800
[Guest]: And then you are less bothered about this is the rule, this is the thing, which I think

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:48.760
[Guest]: a lot of times people resent.

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:54.240
[Guest]: But one of the reasons why people resent HR people is because any function which is a

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:57.840
[Guest]: boundary-setting condition, we resent.

02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:01.320
[Guest]: We resent boundaries.

02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:07.120
[Guest]: So two functions in the organization, like finance and HR, they are both boundary-setting

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:08.120
[Guest]: conditions.

02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:11.960
[Guest]: Finance, for some reason, we believe because it impacts business that you can't go and

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:12.960
[Guest]: spend this.

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:16.760
[Guest]: No, I'll not let you buy this equipment or you can't get a second laptop because you

02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:19.280
[Guest]: just bought the last one a month back.

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:21.200
[Guest]: We understand those boundaries.

02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.200
[Guest]: People will put that.

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:24.840
[Guest]: There's a limit to what you can spend when you travel.

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:25.840
[Guest]: People get that.

02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:32.640
[Guest]: I think when it comes to organizational norms, a lot of these have actually been obsolete

02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:38.920
[Guest]: for a while because many of these norms and practices were set up at the time of the Second

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:40.240
[Guest]: Industrial Revolution.

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:46.640
[Guest]: And many of them are just little modifications of the same thing continuing.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:51.960
[Guest]: And when a lot of people protest those kind of things, that's a sign that it's probably

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:56.800
[Guest]: obsolete and it needs to be revisited.

02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:58.360
[Guest]: The pandemic was just that.

02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:02.840
[Guest]: I mean, it just challenged this whole view that you can't work from home.

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:08.760
[Guest]: Because the whole belief was that working from home means you don't want to spend your

02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.760
[Guest]: privileged leave.

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:14.800
[Guest]: You are just sort of telling your boss that there's an extra day off that you are giving

02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:15.800
[Guest]: me.

02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:16.800
[Guest]: And the bosses would say that.

02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:20.360
[Guest]: I've had bosses who said, you don't have to apply for leave.

02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:25.480
[Guest]: So work from home was meant to be taking a day off without applying for leave.

02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:28.340
[Guest]: Today, we know that that's not true.

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:35.680
[Guest]: So the whole notion as it has been challenged and it's gone off, now that this has disappeared,

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:39.360
[Guest]: now we can really sit down and say, what do we need an office for?

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.960
[Guest]: Do we need it to go and do our work, which I want to do in private because I'm much more

02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:45.960
[Guest]: efficient?

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.120
[Guest]: Or do I want to go to the office to socialize?

02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.920
[Guest]: If you sort of really look at that, educational institutions, the value of that no longer

02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:58.560
[Guest]: lies in the content that they share out.

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.540
[Guest]: It lies in the social interactions.

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:06.760
[Guest]: So whenever there is a workplace, then you are looking at the social side of work.

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:08.960
[Guest]: And that always is endearing.

02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:15.720
[Guest]: But to do the work in that setting is not necessarily a great option.

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:21.760
[Amit Varma]: So number of thoughts, one, I love what your boss did, where he made you teach as a way

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:22.760
[Amit Varma]: of learning.

02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Like, I, you know, the best way to learn something I have realized is to teach it.

02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:30.200
[Amit Varma]: So you know, these days, sometimes I do that I tried, I'm getting into something and I'm

02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:31.400
[Amit Varma]: trying to learn it.

02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.480
[Amit Varma]: And I tell myself, and I'm not actually intending it, but I tell myself that I will teach a

02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.480
[Amit Varma]: course on this.

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:40.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, because then that forces me to go into it with that depth.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:45.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, I have to understand it inside out from first principles and be able to answer

02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:46.800
[Amit Varma]: any question on it.

02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And so I think that's a very enlightened thing that your boss did by pushing you into that.

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about drawing connections, like when I was editing the policy magazine

02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:00.080
[Amit Varma]: Pragati, and we were, of course, writing about serious things, public policy, this, that.

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.720
[Amit Varma]: So I started this section called Houseful Economics, where the idea was, we would take

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.840
[Amit Varma]: cinema, and we would illustrate lessons of economics through cinema.

02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:10.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't remember specific examples.

02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I think Salman Khan in one of his films said, maine jo ek baar commitment karli toh main

02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:17.680
[Amit Varma]: apni bhi nahi sunta ho.

02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And we use that to illustrate the notion of constitutional rule setting, where it doesn't

02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:26.480
[Amit Varma]: depend on a person, but you have these other normative, whatever, some sounds complicated,

02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.080
[Amit Varma]: but it didn't sound so complicated, then I want to dig down on this very into this larger

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:38.560
[Amit Varma]: thematic question, where you spoke about how a paradigm that exists today, came about at

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.840
[Amit Varma]: one time because of a particular reason, but it's not relevant anymore, it's outdated.

02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you mentioned that, you know, workplaces or educational institutions can

02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.480
[Amit Varma]: be ways of either socializing, or if you're going to an Ivy League university, it's not

02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:54.520
[Amit Varma]: what you learn there, it's just, it's a signaling effect, it's a network that you build, it's

02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.720
[Amit Varma]: what that brand carries and all that.

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:01.680
[Amit Varma]: And schools, in fact, are basically the main function of a school is to be a daycare center.

02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:05.680
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, parents would go mad if they had to look after kids all the time.

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:09.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question is, is like, I think about education a lot.

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And what I see, I think all the edtech startups around me, all the edtech startups are missing,

02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:18.240
[Amit Varma]: are missing the key problem, they might be solving a small problem, they're missing the

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:19.280
[Amit Varma]: key problem.

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.680
[Amit Varma]: The problem that they're solving is they're just changing the delivery, that okay, you

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.480
[Amit Varma]: don't have to go to school, or we'll deliver education or knowledge in this new way.

02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.080
[Amit Varma]: But I think just the fundamental way in which we think of education is broken.

02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this whole thing, the whole current structure of education evolved in the early

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:43.640
[Amit Varma]: 19th century that okay, you will have 10 classes or 12 classes or whatever, standards, grades,

02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:47.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, kids of any particular age will all study together.

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.080
[Amit Varma]: These are the things they'll study geography, history, math, blah, blah, all the way down

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:52.200
[Amit Varma]: the line.

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:57.840
[Amit Varma]: And through inertia, and in an unthinking way, we've continued with that for 200 years,

02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:00.520
[Amit Varma]: where I think it's no longer relevant.

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.360
[Amit Varma]: If we had to sit down today and design something from scratch, that is not what we would design,

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:07.360
[Amit Varma]: we design something else entirely.

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not speaking in terms of delivery mechanism ki online class karenge, that's

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:14.560
[Amit Varma]: a entirely, that's an entirely different matter.

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And you've spoken about the same thing at length when it comes to companies, that you

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:23.640
[Amit Varma]: know, companies were once designed in a particular way, electricity made it possible for people

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.320
[Amit Varma]: to convene in a particular physical location and all of that.

02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:33.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of been changing all the way to the pandemic, where, you know, we've started

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.300
[Amit Varma]: working in different ways and putting it into practice in little ways.

02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:41.360
[Amit Varma]: But conceptually, when people think of an office, they're still thinking of a physical

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.360
[Amit Varma]: place where air conditioning where people are together, and there are cubicles and cabins

02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:46.360
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, so take me through a little bit of the evolution of this, that, you know, what were

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:53.960
[Amit Varma]: the conventional notions?

02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Why did they come about?

02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:56.700
[Amit Varma]: What has changed?

02:28:56.700 --> 02:29:01.440
[Amit Varma]: And especially in recent times, what has changed about, you know, workplaces and how we should

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.680
[Amit Varma]: think about them.

02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:09.720
[Guest]: So one of the things is, you know, you've got to look at three elements which are intertwined.

02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:16.800
[Guest]: So work, worker, and workplace, they will always be intertwined, and you sort of change

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:19.820
[Guest]: any one of them, and the other two have to change.

02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:23.280
[Guest]: So that's when the equilibrium is maintained again.

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:28.280
[Guest]: So for example, you're moving out from agriculture, and you're sort of getting into the first

02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:32.240
[Guest]: industrial revolution, the way of doing work is through steam.

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:35.400
[Guest]: So then that allows for a certain kind of work to be done.

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:41.880
[Guest]: It allows for you to lift a certain amount of machinery and not lift heavier than that,

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:42.880
[Guest]: etc.

02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:45.960
[Guest]: So that leads to a certain development of the workforce.

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:50.960
[Guest]: So work changes the worker.

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:55.480
[Guest]: And then when these people come together, you need to manage this particular process

02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:57.720
[Guest]: of the interaction of work and worker.

02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:02.840
[Guest]: You have the workplace norms.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:07.080
[Guest]: Fast forward 100 years, and you're looking at the second industrial revolution, and you're

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.380
[Guest]: looking at, you know, electricity.

02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:13.760
[Guest]: So work is being done through electricity.

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:20.280
[Guest]: What it means is it creates new kinds of roles for workers.

02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.000
[Guest]: For example, now that you have electricity, you can work at any time of the day.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.640
[Guest]: So it leads to the, you know, three shift kind of working.

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:32.680
[Guest]: And we have assumed that eight hours is the optimal way in which people can work.

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:34.880
[Guest]: And therefore, you kind of do that.

02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:41.080
[Guest]: And then when you work in shifts, you're looking at the shift supervisor.

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:46.080
[Guest]: Why is it possible to have a shift supervisor and the norms around the workplace develop

02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:47.080
[Guest]: like that?

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:51.640
[Guest]: Because you're optimizing for mass production.

02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.200
[Guest]: You're not making one unique thing.

02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:54.520
[Guest]: It's no longer handcrafted.

02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:55.520
[Guest]: It's mass produced.

02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:57.480
[Guest]: So you have many of the same things.

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:04.600
[Guest]: Therefore, you wanted to create a system where the individual worker is irrelevant.

02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:08.480
[Guest]: You can substitute one with the other, and that's Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is a

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:13.000
[Guest]: classic example of where he's explained it so graphically.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:19.560
[Guest]: And you look at that entire thing, and you say, okay, this is the workplace which needs

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:22.160
[Guest]: a different set of norms.

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:26.560
[Guest]: Because we are going to work around the clock, will one set of guys work around the clock?

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:32.480
[Guest]: I mean, you know, in the same common shift, late night shift or this and that?

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:35.400
[Guest]: What does it do to the worker?

02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:38.680
[Guest]: And then you kind of say that people get tired.

02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:41.560
[Guest]: For me, that was a warning sign.

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:46.560
[Guest]: We should have really asked ourselves, so why are people, if you look at the number

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:53.520
[Guest]: of times when you hear on the radio every Monday morning, this Monday motivation hashtag,

02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:59.040
[Guest]: you know, these are all signs that there is something drastically wrong where people dread

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:02.560
[Guest]: having to go back to work.

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:12.580
[Guest]: And you find the RJs are screaming, why do they feel this way?

02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:17.520
[Guest]: Why do they feel that, you know, it's something that we have to endure in order to do something?

02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:23.160
[Guest]: Because there's a parallel larger system, which has stagnated and been left out of this

02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:29.560
[Guest]: entire ambit, which is the education system, because that education system was feeding

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:33.120
[Guest]: the people who would go into that workforce, right?

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:35.580
[Guest]: And education was all about standardization.

02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:40.280
[Guest]: Everybody studied the same thing, everybody was, you know, therefore, you put people on

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:49.600
[Guest]: that machine, they can start doing everything slowly in order to break away from that.

02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:54.080
[Guest]: You kind of really have a scenario where somebody says, okay, this is mass produced, but this

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:56.520
[Guest]: is handcrafted.

02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:59.640
[Guest]: And because it was not an abundance, it became precious.

02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:03.160
[Guest]: So, you know, you kind of suddenly start to look at that.

02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:10.640
[Guest]: And then as manufacturing gave way to services, you are beginning to see a time where the

02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:14.680
[Guest]: importance of the individual who provides the service has started to go up.

02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:22.000
[Guest]: And many of the places, you know, when you see shifts, the arts and humanities sections

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
[Guest]: see it first.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:29.280
[Guest]: So you'll very often see that, you know, a writer would have written about something

02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:33.480
[Guest]: that has happened only, you know, 30 years later, 10 years later, one year later.

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:39.280
[Guest]: You see Contagion, the movie, you know, it's crazy how it sort of almost seems to have

02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.560
[Guest]: been like a documentary, which was made in advance, and I had never watched it earlier

02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:45.160
[Guest]: at that point of time.

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:50.800
[Guest]: But when you watch it during the pandemic, suddenly, you know, assumes a different meaning.

02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:56.480
[Guest]: So you sort of start to see that education has been left out of this entire change process.

02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.640
[Guest]: So education remained a little disjointed, shifted.

02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:08.120
[Guest]: And as work started to get more automated, technology started to get things done in very

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:09.680
[Guest]: different way.

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:12.840
[Guest]: Education became more and more distant from this.

02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:17.480
[Guest]: And it's still sort of, you know, at a point of time when I wanted to, you know, teach

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.320
[Guest]: in a certain college, which I shall not name.

02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:22.600
[Guest]: They said, yeah, it's great.

02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:26.120
[Guest]: And this is after I wrote the digital tsunami.

02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:31.320
[Guest]: And they said, why don't you come and teach, you know, HR in the college.

02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:32.840
[Guest]: And I said, I would love to do that.

02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:37.560
[Guest]: And when I drew up the course outline and said, we'll talk about how technology is changing,

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:42.040
[Guest]: they said, no, no, no, no, no, but that technology bit you can't talk about, because that has

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:44.220
[Guest]: to be done by another department.

02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:49.240
[Guest]: So then you have to be part of that department, but then you can't talk about HR.

02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:56.940
[Guest]: So this is, and I say that this is one of the most respected institutions.

02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:01.880
[Guest]: So then I said, well, I guess then I'll wait for my turn some other time.

02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:04.080
[Guest]: And I stepped out of that.

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:09.320
[Guest]: And then you have a scenario where, you know, there's this entire sort of set of academics

02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:16.200
[Guest]: who will say that if you don't have a PhD, you cannot teach.

02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:19.800
[Guest]: So now, of course, you do have something called a professor of practice and all that stuff.

02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:25.640
[Guest]: But you know, the academics all still will gang up and say, but you don't have a PhD.

02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:27.960
[Guest]: How do you know that this is right or wrong?

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:32.800
[Guest]: So this whole thing has meant that you've created two worlds.

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:42.080
[Guest]: So the best way to, you know, bring down somebody's thought process is to simply say, it's impractical.

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:44.000
[Guest]: This is not practical at all.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.880
[Guest]: Whereas, if you really look at the philosophy of, you know, education as it was created

02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:55.080
[Guest]: earlier, the greatest theories were drawn out of practice and greatest practices were

02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:57.520
[Guest]: drawn from theory.

02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:04.800
[Guest]: But today, you have a scenario where the most greatest compliment you can give to a person

02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:09.800
[Guest]: is to say, your work is extremely practical, there's nothing theoretical about it.

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:11.000
[Guest]: Think about the irony of that.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.880
[Guest]: So we have therefore, we've dismissed the value of learning and which is why you have

02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:17.720
[Guest]: the ROI based learning.

02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:22.920
[Guest]: You learn three questions, if you can clear that exam, it doesn't matter whether you understand

02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:25.320
[Guest]: the subject or not, you clear the exam.

02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.280
[Guest]: And that in turn opens up opportunities for you, that in turn opens up further opportunities

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:30.280
[Guest]: for you.

02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:35.160
[Guest]: So the entire basis has been, you know, how do you bypass the system, which talks about

02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:42.320
[Guest]: the massive culture of coaching classes everywhere, how do you, you know, crack the system.

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.000
[Guest]: So those are the kind of things that you, you know, there are classes which people have

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.120
[Guest]: for cracking how to appear in the Kaun Banega Crorepati game show, there are classes which

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.960
[Guest]: are had, where people will say, jawab baad mein soching aap, pehle when you press the

02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:01.360
[Guest]: buzzer, and you know, you are called up, you've got all those 10 seconds, while the others

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:05.200
[Guest]: are thinking of 10 seconds, you know, they are thinking of the answer and they are debating

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:09.160
[Guest]: whether it's the first one or the fourth one, you've already pressed the buzzer.

02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:12.600
[Guest]: Now you've got these additional 10 seconds where they say yes, so what would be your

02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:14.200
[Guest]: answer, Amit?

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.440
[Guest]: And you have had the answer.

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:16.840
[Guest]: So now you can do that.

02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:21.160
[Guest]: This one tip has put so many people into that game show.

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:28.280
[Guest]: So we are extremely good at finding how do you bypass that shortcut and take the shortest

02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:32.680
[Guest]: distance, which is why you have the thing of, you know, three easy lessons from this

02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:40.720
[Guest]: and it's a very popular theme, you will see that you win a match or you lose a match and

02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:46.040
[Guest]: next day LinkedIn is full of three lessons from this match, four lessons of leadership

02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:53.520
[Guest]: from this, four lessons from my dog, you know, this, this is, unfortunately, this is the

02:37:53.520 --> 02:38:02.600
[Guest]: version that we are looking at, because we've put education to be something which is terrible.

02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:05.880
[Guest]: It makes you theoretical.

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:10.720
[Guest]: And it is this whole process why, when you are looking at the nature of work as it has

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:17.160
[Guest]: changed, so many people are now getting displaced, because they've always been brought up to

02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:22.040
[Guest]: sort of declare very proudly, I'm a very practical guy, I don't waste time reading.

02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:28.840
[Guest]: It's a number of times I've heard, you know, people with many years of experience who say,

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:34.760
[Guest]: the last book I would have read would be Tinkle magazine, because I read it for my kid.

02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:40.080
[Guest]: Now, which may sound very cute when you're announcing it somewhere, but what it does

02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:46.000
[Guest]: is you shudder to think that this is the guy who's leading that corporation, you know,

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.040
[Guest]: so what options and choices would this guy have other than, you know, imbibed wisdom

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.080
[Guest]: that this is what I've tried.

02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:02.560
[Guest]: When you have leaders whose sole worldview is based on what I've tried and experienced,

02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.320
[Guest]: it works when the world is very small.

02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.040
[Guest]: So, there's only one way to, you know, make an omelet, because that's the only thing people

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.040
[Guest]: will have.

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.540
[Guest]: There's only one way to boil milk.

02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:17.600
[Guest]: But now you're talking of cuisine, that cannot come from just your experience.

02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:20.800
[Guest]: You have to watch stuff, you have to read stuff, you have to experience stuff, you have

02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:26.720
[Guest]: to do all this and connect the dots and sort of see how you can bring that in.

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:31.640
[Guest]: In this world of work, education has been completely divorced.

02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:35.880
[Guest]: So, therefore, I think the challenge that we are looking at when we are talking about

02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:40.240
[Guest]: what EdTech is trying to solve is that trying to figure out, okay, you don't need to go

02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:44.640
[Guest]: to school, you can get it through my app or my website or my this thing, we'll give you

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:47.360
[Guest]: a video version of the book.

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:50.920
[Guest]: That is really not the process.

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:56.520
[Guest]: And the whole process is around how do you build curiosity and build a multidisciplinary

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:59.360
[Guest]: view because that's where work is.

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:04.760
[Guest]: You can't solve, for example, you know, in the pandemic, a great example of this is,

02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:11.760
[Guest]: look at the irony of the scenario where the problem is not that you don't have a vaccine,

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:19.680
[Guest]: which at least supposedly solves the pandemic, you have a scenario where you're trying to

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:25.640
[Guest]: convince people to take the vaccine and the rich are holding several versions of the vaccine

02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:30.860
[Guest]: and it's going to waste and there are a vast number of billions who will not have access

02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:36.440
[Guest]: to it because it's, you know, people would rather throw it away than to donate it.

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:43.400
[Guest]: Now a lot of it comes from the fact that when you don't build empathy for a person who cannot

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:52.280
[Guest]: pay you back, back to the question of generosity, you cannot think that that's the right thing

02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:53.280
[Guest]: to do.

02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:58.520
[Guest]: Then you are only thinking in reductive processes.

02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:01.800
[Guest]: You are saying, how is it going to benefit me?

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:03.840
[Guest]: What is the ROI of this entire process?

02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:09.480
[Guest]: So I think this whole business of education being completely driven by exams is one such

02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:13.640
[Guest]: casualty that you don't have interdisciplinary thinking.

02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:21.320
[Guest]: You know, I can't go and teach something and draw in a reference from another, you know,

02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:28.400
[Guest]: discipline because then it sort of treads into the fiefdom of another department.

02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:34.520
[Guest]: So knowledge has become trapped in departments rather than being free and you solve a problem

02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:37.040
[Guest]: using whatever you do.

02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:40.360
[Guest]: This is really like saying that imagine if you had to build a house and you're told that

02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:43.900
[Guest]: boss, you can take one tool of your choice.

02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:45.640
[Guest]: It can be a screwdriver or a hammer.

02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:48.280
[Guest]: You can't have both.

02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:49.280
[Guest]: How would you build the house?

02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:50.280
[Guest]: You can't.

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:57.680
[Guest]: So I think that's where education is today, that you have these walls and it's very hard

02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:02.840
[Guest]: to find people who enjoy work because they're constantly told, this is not your work.

02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:05.080
[Guest]: This is not for you to worry about.

02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:12.440
[Guest]: So whereas problems are not created in one single discipline, problems are always multidisciplinary.

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:19.540
[Guest]: So for example, back to the vaccine example, it's a problem of science and storytelling.

02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:27.240
[Guest]: It's a problem of understanding human psychology and religion and culture of a country.

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:33.080
[Guest]: But if you don't have leaders who have read the history of a particular tribe for no reason

02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.560
[Guest]: not altogether, how would they ever do that?

02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:47.220
[Guest]: And so therefore, one of the pieces would be if we made literature and reading and humanities

02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:52.840
[Guest]: a lot more integral, it's not looked at as something like the other day somebody was

02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:59.720
[Guest]: saying, I don't know why my kid has to study geography and history, and he's got to study

02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:03.200
[Guest]: stuff like civics.

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:09.560
[Guest]: And this whole business that every piece that you are reading has to have an instant gratification.

02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:14.920
[Guest]: You are not giving time for the person to process it and merge it into their worldview.

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:20.440
[Guest]: It's very hard for people to find the value of that, which is why today when you find

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:25.520
[Guest]: that somebody doesn't understand history, you have a certain kind of a view.

02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:29.920
[Guest]: I remember just about a couple of days back, I was at a wedding and I was sitting next

02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.760
[Guest]: to somebody who teaches history in a college.

02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:44.400
[Guest]: And I was referring to the version of history that I learned by reading Manu Pillai.

02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:51.720
[Guest]: So the person says, one sec, one sec, one sec, Abhijit, Manu Pillai is not a historian.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:52.720
[Guest]: And I said, why do you say that?

02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:56.320
[Guest]: I said, because, you know, so he says, no, no, they are not researched.

02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:57.320
[Guest]: I said, you can't say that.

02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:04.040
[Guest]: He's got like 50 pages of references.

02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:09.600
[Guest]: But that person's book will never ever be prescribed by my college.

02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:16.760
[Guest]: I said, well, that's sad that, you know, your students would, I hope that they read some

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.960
[Guest]: of the stuff outside of your college curriculum.

02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:24.120
[Guest]: But I'm not even sure whether that's going to happen to a lot of people.

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.480
[Guest]: So it's horrible.

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:33.240
[Guest]: I think the greatest value that I see for work that you are doing, for example, in the

02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:41.840
[Guest]: podcast, is to make content available in a format which can be in, you know, in my head

02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.480
[Guest]: at some point of time.

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:50.280
[Guest]: And I don't need to worry about, you know, that I'm learning history, I'm just building

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:52.720
[Guest]: a worldview full of conversations.

02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:59.560
[Guest]: So I think if we focus more on conversations as a way of shaping worldviews, we would be

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:02.600
[Guest]: solving problems very differently.

02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:08.440
[Amit Varma]: So bunch of threads and one is, of course, the clearest illustration of how there is

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:14.200
[Amit Varma]: this massive mismatch between I mean, you'd imagine that in a marketplace of supply and

02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.760
[Amit Varma]: demand, you know, education would be at the supply end where you are training people who

02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:23.200
[Amit Varma]: are then actually doing useful things in the real world, whatever it may be, however you

02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.320
[Amit Varma]: measure it.

02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:29.440
[Amit Varma]: But the fact is that not only do we have a massive jobs problem in India, but many of

02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.200
[Amit Varma]: the people who are actually being churned out by the education system are unemployable,

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:39.240
[Amit Varma]: even when there are actually jobs because they're learning nothing of any value whatsoever.

02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And that Manu Pillay, first of all, he's been on my show many times, he's an excellent historian.

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:48.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, look at his rigor, look at his work, look at his, he's absolutely fabulous.

02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's one of the reasons, I mean, what that illustrates is one of the reasons

02:45:53.960 --> 02:46:00.920
[Amit Varma]: that many common people, I think, quite understandably have an anti intellectual attitude, quote

02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:07.880
[Amit Varma]: unquote, and are suspicious of academia, because academia has really gone into this whole,

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, warped space of its own where, you know, the bubble has become a cage, especially

02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:15.800
[Amit Varma]: in the humanities, not relevant to the real world anymore.

02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:19.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, I look at the academic world and I'm like, no, like, if you know, if I wanted to

02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:26.120
[Amit Varma]: educate myself, the university would be the worst place to do so if it comes to humanities,

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:28.040
[Amit Varma]: science and all, obviously, it's a different matter.

02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.280
[Amit Varma]: The best way to educate yourself is read a lot, maybe listen to podcasts, educate yourself

02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:37.720
[Amit Varma]: in different ways, you know, joining a humanities department in any modern university would

02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:41.920
[Amit Varma]: really set you back and make you useless for the real world, which is not to say that I'm

02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:47.240
[Amit Varma]: judging humanities, I'm judging academia, academia has completely failed and which leads

02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:53.200
[Amit Varma]: me to my next question, which is that, you know, in one of your talks, you give this

02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.920
[Amit Varma]: anecdote about how you were sitting in for this interview.

02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:01.400
[Amit Varma]: And the person who was interviewing someone with you, they asked the question to the young

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:04.880
[Amit Varma]: interviewee, that what is your favorite animal?

02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And that person said, Oh, dog.

02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually, the person who asked the question said, we'll take him and you

02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:11.680
[Amit Varma]: asked why?

02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.040
[Amit Varma]: And you said, because no, no dogs, loyalty and this and that.

02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.360
[Amit Varma]: And then he asked the question to another person that what is your favorite animal and

02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:19.360
[Amit Varma]: that person said horse.

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:23.080
[Amit Varma]: So he said, what kind of horse and that person said running horse.

02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:27.080
[Amit Varma]: And then your colleague rejected him because he said that running horse means high attrition

02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:28.080
[Amit Varma]: rate will run away.

02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:29.080
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:30.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is a classic example of hardcore overthinking, right, where, you know, there

02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.160
[Amit Varma]: is one kind of theory, which just comes from this kind of overthinking.

02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And there's another kind of theory, which interacts with practice, as you mentioned

02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.200
[Amit Varma]: earlier, and they feed off each other.

02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, those are frameworks that are based in what is happening in the real world.

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:56.680
[Amit Varma]: And you can apply them across disciplines, you know, as we'll also talk about after this.

02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:00.020
[Amit Varma]: And, and those are that's useful theory, that's useful frameworks.

02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:04.200
[Amit Varma]: My problem with a lot of academia is that a lot of your theories have no connection

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.480
[Amit Varma]: with the real world.

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:08.360
[Amit Varma]: And when they come in contact with the real world, they fall apart.

02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:14.480
[Amit Varma]: But do you feel that's also then a danger in, say, management studies or in the books

02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:19.400
[Amit Varma]: that are written about these subjects, because people may set out to write books, management

02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:22.240
[Amit Varma]: guides or self help books or whatever.

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.160
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes one wonders if there is a force fitting of frameworks, if you're trying to,

02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:31.160
[Amit Varma]: if you're overthinking it in this dog being loyal kind of way.

02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:36.960
[Amit Varma]: And is that then a danger that you find yourself warning yourself about, ki mujhe yeh nahi

02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.680
[Amit Varma]: hai, mujhe jo har cheez hai, it's, it's something I've learned from practice, and I can apply

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:44.280
[Amit Varma]: and I'm confident it's there, so.

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:52.040
[Guest]: I think both are important, you know, one of the one of the reasons why academics and

02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:56.320
[Guest]: the world of practice have fallen a little apart.

02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:04.000
[Guest]: I think it's a tragedy for both because when you see that the best theories are drawn out

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.480
[Guest]: of practices, that what is a theory at the end of it, you observe something, you know,

02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:13.640
[Guest]: and you find a pattern and you kind of put that together in a framework, which gets challenged

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:18.280
[Guest]: and there's further research and you sort of put it together, you modify it, it's a

02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:21.400
[Guest]: iterative process.

02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:29.480
[Guest]: It is when you kind of say that, if I cannot instantly apply whatever I've learned, then

02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:35.360
[Guest]: there is, then it is useless knowledge, then in which case you get to the version where

02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:43.920
[Guest]: let's say if, you know, I'm looking how to use a certain feature on my phone, I can look

02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:45.920
[Guest]: it up on YouTube and do that.

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:49.520
[Guest]: That does not make me an expert on the phone.

02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:52.800
[Guest]: I will not be able to fix it one more time again in future.

02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:57.080
[Amit Varma]: I think my point was not so much about a practical value.

02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:03.840
[Amit Varma]: My point was also about understanding something, you know, if you tell me the physics and the

02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:07.060
[Amit Varma]: electronics of a phone, I'll understand how it works.

02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:11.920
[Amit Varma]: If you tell me that the phone is a symbol of patriarchy, then I'm sorry, you've lost

02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:16.600
[Amit Varma]: me completely, you know, and that's the kind of area that we've sort of gone into in modern

02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:17.600
[Guest]: times.

02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:25.040
[Guest]: So, I think a lot of it has happened because not enough people are reading enough of literature

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:29.800
[Guest]: and having those conversations because that's the only way you build a worldview where you

02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:32.720
[Guest]: understand who you're building it for, yeah?

02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:38.640
[Guest]: So, for instance, while in India, you see a lot of people signing up for these online

02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:39.640
[Guest]: courses.

02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:44.440
[Guest]: Our rate of completions are very pathetically low because, you know, you are hoping that

02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:50.920
[Guest]: somebody is going to, you know, do something which will instantly get you the job, et cetera.

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:56.040
[Guest]: I think this whole obsession of knowledge with something that has to be instantly applied

02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:02.600
[Guest]: in totality creates a challenge that it doesn't give you time to build connections with other

02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:08.440
[Guest]: disciplines, your own life experiences, your observations, and that is where you begin

02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.440
[Guest]: to take borrowed wisdom and apply it.

02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:15.600
[Guest]: And then that gets concretized because, you know, you've done it and somebody else has

02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:16.600
[Guest]: done it.

02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:22.920
[Guest]: We are fortunately coming into a time where many of these conventions have been blown

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:24.800
[Guest]: apart, yeah?

02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:29.120
[Guest]: And education, for example, we talked about that briefly.

02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:36.120
[Guest]: If you look at this whole knowledge, you know, I wrote a short piece on my LinkedIn newsletter

02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:38.200
[Guest]: which I talked about degree inflation.

02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:45.520
[Guest]: So, the whole notion of, and I drew a cartoon which has somebody, you know, saying that

02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:53.720
[Guest]: wanted BA and then, you know, somebody just paints an M in front and says, wanted MBA

02:51:53.720 --> 02:52:01.560
[Guest]: because it's possible for a job which requires a fifth-grade pass out and the knowledge of

02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:02.560
[Guest]: how to ride a cycle.

02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:07.560
[Guest]: They are applying for a job of a messenger in UP police and it gets thousands of people

02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:12.200
[Guest]: who are, of course, graduates and thousands of people who are, of course, postgraduates

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:15.840
[Guest]: and a few thousand people who are PhDs.

02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:20.920
[Guest]: Now the question is, this is degree inflation in its classic sense.

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:28.020
[Guest]: So, if you take the person who is a PhD, are you being fair or unfair?

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:33.000
[Guest]: Because the job requires you to just have that basic level of knowledge.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:37.880
[Guest]: One sign that you might want to think about is why are so many people applying for that

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:41.400
[Guest]: job in the first place?

02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:47.320
[Guest]: But it also means that when you look at, it's not just in that level, you see it in so many

02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:48.520
[Guest]: places.

02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:53.400
[Guest]: You get an MBA simply because you can get an MBA to do the thing and therefore, you

02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:59.880
[Guest]: know, you are having proliferation of, you know, management schools, every corner sets

02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:02.880
[Guest]: up one and offers that thing.

02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:06.600
[Guest]: And suddenly, you know, people turn back and say, but, you know, this person doesn't know

02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:11.360
[Guest]: anything because you need a number of people to teach that way.

02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:18.800
[Guest]: And teaching has become one of the least attractive options when you sort of really look at who

02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:20.520
[Guest]: gets drawn into teaching.

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:26.680
[Guest]: When you look at that, and the moment you create educational institutions, the one place

02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:31.160
[Guest]: where you should be investing is having better teachers, teaching them how do you become

02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:35.400
[Guest]: more creative in the way that you, you know, teach, because today the students are not

02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:39.400
[Guest]: just exposed to books, they're exposed to movies, they're exposed to podcasts, they're

02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:43.400
[Guest]: exposed to YouTubes, they're exposed to Spotify.

02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:48.640
[Guest]: How do you teach a person who has that worldview is very different.

02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:54.160
[Guest]: So I would say that even the way that you read a book today, what I very often would

02:53:54.160 --> 02:54:00.680
[Guest]: do is I would read a book, and then I often would watch the person talk about the book

02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:06.680
[Guest]: on say, YouTube or Spotify or something, because I always find that when I've read the book,

02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:12.320
[Guest]: I may have thought of something as important, and somebody else who wrote the book found

02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:14.280
[Guest]: something else to be completely different.

02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:19.040
[Guest]: And I never even looked at that shade, you know, when I read through that whole book,

02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:21.360
[Guest]: this didn't even register, and I don't even recall.

02:54:21.360 --> 02:54:25.040
[Guest]: So then I'll go back and reread that segment that the person is talking about.

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:31.600
[Guest]: So in this process of engaging with a book, you know, one thing that I would sort of look

02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:38.480
[Guest]: at is, why don't we teach people to read books faster, and then summarize and write their

02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:42.640
[Guest]: own, you know, reflections on that book?

02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:45.420
[Guest]: Because again, the whole point is, what's the point of doing this?

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:50.840
[Guest]: So everything, you know, education is about doing lots of things which right now you can't

02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:56.680
[Guest]: see any relevance for, but you will connect the dots later, you know.

02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:02.400
[Guest]: So when you overlay many different elements, you see that if there is a country going to

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:05.920
[Guest]: war, you don't just take the common narrative that this guy is good, this guy is bad, and

02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:06.920
[Guest]: this one is terrible.

02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:12.760
[Guest]: You kind of say that, okay, there's a, you know, economic incentive to sort of do that,

02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:16.840
[Guest]: because I've had the privilege of reading economics.

02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:20.480
[Guest]: And they kind of also, you know, from the general reading of literature that I've done,

02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:25.360
[Guest]: you kind of say that all political systems will try and sort of do ABC, and you kind

02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.200
[Guest]: of begin to see that pattern.

02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:32.880
[Guest]: So reading broadly, especially for those who are in the corporate world, I think reading

02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.400
[Guest]: broadly, not just business books, but reading about music, reading about films, reading

02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:44.720
[Guest]: about this, actually helps you create a far more holistic thing, which, you know, is more

02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:50.020
[Guest]: human-centric, and therefore is not going to get into that resistance.

02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:54.160
[Guest]: You probably design work systems very differently, you know.

02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:58.880
[Guest]: So I think those are some of the possibilities that one should be, you know, exploring.

02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:02.200
[Amit Varma]: No, and one of the things to note is that hunger is there.

02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:05.400
[Amit Varma]: People want to know, people want to read, academia doesn't serve that.

02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:10.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you look at two historians who frequently been on the show, Ram Guha and Manu Pillay,

02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:15.280
[Amit Varma]: they're both looked down upon by academia, and constantly criticized by them.

02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:20.920
[Amit Varma]: But they are producing incredibly rigorous works of history, which has expanded people's

02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:25.640
[Amit Varma]: understanding of the world in so many different ways, and more power to them for that.

02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:29.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you mentioned degree inflation, and I'm just kind of thinking aloud, that,

02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:33.880
[Amit Varma]: okay, a degree is a signal, I want to hire someone, a degree is a signal that, okay,

02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:37.240
[Amit Varma]: this person has done an MA, this person has done a PhD, whatever.

02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:40.640
[Amit Varma]: But these signals have lost value, because anything that is...

02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:43.440
[Amit Varma]: If everybody has a PhD, how do you distinguish?

02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:44.440
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:47.820
[Amit Varma]: Anything that is a metric can be gamed, and they've completely lost all value.

02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:53.120
[Amit Varma]: So the question there is that, if you are looking for x, what is a good signal for what

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:56.080
[Amit Varma]: x actually is, and it is not the degree anymore.

02:56:56.080 --> 02:57:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, when people who do my course, a couple of times people have asked you to give a certificate.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, you know, I can do a Jugaadu certificate if you want, as I have for a couple

02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:06.800
[Amit Varma]: of people.

02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:07.800
[Amit Varma]: But why does it matter?

02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:08.800
[Amit Varma]: Why do you want a certificate?

02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:13.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, for me, whenever I try to learn something, I try to learn something for the knowledge,

02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.080
[Amit Varma]: for its own sake, or because I want to do something with it, irregardless.

02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:21.840
[Amit Varma]: But you know, why do certificates necessarily matter?

02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And the other aspect about reading books faster is something I completely agree with.

02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:29.880
[Amit Varma]: But I think the danger there is that that can also become a metric and that can also

02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:35.440
[Amit Varma]: become a goal, especially when you said something like, you know, read a book, write a summary,

02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:39.040
[Amit Varma]: then the summary becomes a goal, then you're rushing through the book to get to the summary.

02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:45.180
[Amit Varma]: Whereas what I try to stress in my course is that don't think of goals, think of processes.

02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.180
[Amit Varma]: Do you enjoy reading?

02:57:46.180 --> 02:57:47.180
[Guest]: Do you reach for a book when you…

02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:52.380
[Guest]: I don't look at, no, I don't look at writing the summary as a goal.

02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:58.080
[Guest]: So when I read books, very often I do the doodles because it just, you know, it helps

02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:00.320
[Guest]: me recollect the book much better.

02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:03.120
[Guest]: So to me, that's a summary.

02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:07.800
[Guest]: And then I'll watch the YouTube video, then I listen to this guy on two, three podcasts,

02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:08.880
[Guest]: then I'll think.

02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:15.400
[Guest]: So I have explored the book from my eyes and others eyes.

02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:17.080
[Guest]: And I've sort of done that.

02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:23.240
[Guest]: And then when you write something, you've actually, you've now between each of these,

02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:26.560
[Guest]: you've had the opportunity to sit back and reflect on some stuff.

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:31.440
[Guest]: And then when you write about it, it's potentially going to be a more thought through piece,

02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:33.240
[Guest]: which is a lot more comprehensive.

02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:35.080
[Guest]: It's not the metric.

02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:42.160
[Guest]: So it is not that, you know, I would say, I would always, there are books that you go

02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:46.720
[Guest]: back and reread, and there are books that you don't read again.

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:49.840
[Guest]: I mean, it's a one-time read and you kind of do that.

02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:55.800
[Guest]: But I find that all the books which have had a nuanced view, it is not painted in one single

02:58:55.800 --> 02:58:56.800
[Guest]: color.

02:58:56.800 --> 02:59:02.600
[Guest]: There's shades and hues, you discover patterns which you missed for the first time, or maybe

02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:04.400
[Guest]: even the third time.

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:10.600
[Guest]: So I think the ability to do that, if you're doing that, you're not really reading from

02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:15.600
[Guest]: a metric that I will notch it up and say, oh, you know, I read this book.

02:59:15.600 --> 02:59:23.160
[Guest]: But when you look at, when you've read multiple ways in which you can approach a problem,

02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:25.640
[Guest]: you have more choices.

02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:31.920
[Guest]: What Ram Guha or Manu Pillay and, you know, all these people are doing is, they've done

02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:36.440
[Guest]: all these, you know, like I said, if there are 30 ways to design an incentive system,

02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:39.120
[Guest]: you must know all 30.

02:59:39.120 --> 02:59:45.560
[Guest]: But then you have the liberty to say, I'm going to use option number six with you, and

02:59:45.560 --> 02:59:50.440
[Guest]: option number 14 with somebody else, and maybe with somebody I'll do half of three and half

02:59:50.440 --> 02:59:54.500
[Guest]: of 11, you know, because that's most appropriate.

02:59:54.500 --> 02:59:58.720
[Guest]: That option does not happen if you know only one way to do it.

02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:03.760
[Guest]: So when you have so many of these colleges which are supposedly giving you practical

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:05.960
[Guest]: education, what are they doing?

03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:10.120
[Guest]: They'll call a practitioner who will come and spend half the time talking about the

03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:12.680
[Guest]: great work their company is doing.

03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:18.920
[Guest]: When they do that, the students go back believing that is the only way, and especially if it's

03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:22.980
[Guest]: a company they aspire to do, you know, aspire to join.

03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:27.480
[Guest]: Then those big name companies, you get somebody who comes in and says, you know, we tell our

03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:34.480
[Guest]: people don't do A, B, C. They will look at that as the, you know, as gospel truth because

03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:37.360
[Guest]: they don't have an alternative point of view.

03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:41.800
[Guest]: So to be able to understand nuances.

03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:42.800
[Amit Varma]: What I'm saying is different.

03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:44.280
[Amit Varma]: I think you misunderstood me.

03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:45.280
[Amit Varma]: That's your process.

03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:46.760
[Amit Varma]: In your case, it's part of your process.

03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:51.280
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that if you set it out, if you have a class of 30 people, and you say,

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:54.520
[Amit Varma]: okay, all of you read this book and give me a summary at the end of it.

03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:58.880
[Amit Varma]: What tends to happen there is that they will treat it as a task to be done.

03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:03.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is, for me, this is really important that you should never think in terms of goals,

03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:05.920
[Amit Varma]: but only in terms of processes and habits.

03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:10.960
[Amit Varma]: You want to build a reading habit and that reading habit has to come from your sense

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:13.120
[Amit Varma]: of yourself as someone who reads.

03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:17.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, if I set a goal, you know, like, let's say, if I set a goal that every day

03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:22.160
[Amit Varma]: between six and seven, I'll read, you know, sounds really worthy, you can build your,

03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:26.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, you can become a reader that way, you'll do it one day, two days, three days,

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:29.560
[Amit Varma]: and you'll fall off the wagon, then you'll follow further, then you will tell yourself

03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:34.360
[Amit Varma]: ki yaar, I'm not a books kind of person, I'm a Netflix kind of person, or if you're gregarious

03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:39.080
[Amit Varma]: and Netflix and chill kind of person, right, and you fall off that and it becomes a vicious

03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:43.480
[Amit Varma]: cycle where your failure to achieve a goal affects your self image.

03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Whereas the point is that if you begin with your self image, if you say ki yaar, I am,

03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:52.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm the I'm a self taught polymath, or that's my self image of who I want to be.

03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:55.640
[Amit Varma]: And I am the kind of person who when I'm bored, I don't pick up my smartphone, I pick up your

03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:01.560
[Amit Varma]: book, then if you own that self image, then you will just be reading a lot naturally,

03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:05.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, you will be doing the summaries out of pleasure, not because it is a task

03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:06.620
[Amit Varma]: that has been set for you.

03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:12.160
[Amit Varma]: So I think the challenge really is in motivating people and helping them to build these habits,

03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:16.400
[Amit Varma]: rather than follow the whole school college system that this is your goal, do this, isko

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.760
[Amit Varma]: seekho exam dena, isko seekho summary.

03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:19.760
[Guest]: So that's what I meant.

03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:20.760
[Guest]: Yeah, I totally agree with you.

03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:23.760
[Guest]: I'm sorry, I misunderstood that whole thing.

03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:28.360
[Guest]: Yeah, you're right. I mean, I and I think you, you know, as long as you are able to

03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:33.520
[Guest]: craft your own process of doing something, yeah, you're right that, you know, there may

03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:39.460
[Guest]: be a time where, you know, you you take a break from writing altogether.

03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:44.560
[Guest]: And then there is a time when I kind of, you know, intensively will write for a for a long

03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:51.480
[Guest]: stretch, because all of them are important ways in which I structure my world, you know.

03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:57.760
[Guest]: So I don't necessarily, you know, subscribe to this whole thing that you must do it from

03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:02.760
[Guest]: the, again, it's the whole process of living without an ROI.

03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:05.360
[Guest]: The moment you have a goal, there is an ROI.

03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:06.360
[Guest]: This is my goal.

03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:10.540
[Guest]: I have to produce three book summaries for this course.

03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:13.160
[Guest]: Then that becomes the be all and end all of itself.

03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:14.360
[Guest]: You stop enjoying the course.

03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:18.360
[Guest]: It's the same pattern that you are saying when you take the selfie with the stars, you're

03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:22.960
[Guest]: not enjoying the stars, you're not looking at the patterns that are there, are they,

03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:27.980
[Guest]: is the, you know, in the sky when you see a whole lot of stars.

03:03:27.980 --> 03:03:32.560
[Guest]: As a kid, I very often used to, because I could read three alphabets, you know, I would

03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:38.600
[Guest]: say, does the sky write, you know, using Bengali or English or Hindi?

03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:41.960
[Guest]: And I would at some point of time, I would say, ye to Hindi mein likha hai.

03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:45.440
[Guest]: And some days I would notice Bengali and some days I would say, oh, no, that looks like

03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:48.760
[Guest]: a clear O, that's a U.

03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:50.120
[Guest]: So I think it's written.

03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:54.160
[Guest]: And then I would sort of really go through that whole process.

03:03:54.160 --> 03:04:01.920
[Guest]: This completely useless process, again, I'm using air quotes in this useless, is really

03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:05.360
[Guest]: what made me who I am today, you know.

03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:11.800
[Guest]: So the ability to sit down and, you know, just aimlessly lie on the grass and look at

03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:18.000
[Guest]: the cloud formation and say, that looks like so and so person's face, can I draw a caricature

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:19.000
[Guest]: of that?

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.280
[Guest]: Then I turn it and then I say, oh, the eyes are missing.

03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:22.360
[Guest]: And then you sort of do that.

03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:28.920
[Guest]: So it's always this whole process of dabbling in different things and bringing it all together

03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:30.120
[Guest]: at some stage.

03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:33.240
[Guest]: So there's a convergent stage and a divergent stage.

03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:34.720
[Guest]: Writing is always about that.

03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:39.120
[Guest]: You know, most people kind of say that, oh, it must be fun to be a writer.

03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:41.640
[Guest]: No, it's terrible to write, you know.

03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:43.880
[Guest]: I don't think it's a fun process at all.

03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:46.400
[Guest]: Fun process is the divergent process.

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:50.960
[Guest]: I meet a number of people, this conversation triggers a thought in my head, then I go and

03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:56.720
[Guest]: watch a film, I see that, then I notice the same pattern now out here and then I do this.

03:04:56.720 --> 03:05:02.080
[Guest]: Now comes a horrible part of writing the book, where you just have to sit down and go through

03:05:02.080 --> 03:05:06.520
[Guest]: that rigor of structuring your thoughts and say, you may have thought about 15 different

03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:09.880
[Guest]: things, but what do you want to say today?

03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:12.040
[Guest]: What is it that you are talking about today?

03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:17.360
[Guest]: And then it talks about convergence, simplifying, putting it together, and saying, am I being

03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:18.720
[Guest]: too wordy about this whole thing?

03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:23.080
[Guest]: You kind of delete it, you rewrite the whole piece.

03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:30.800
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, and for me, sometimes what happens is in my LinkedIn newsletter, for

03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:36.840
[Guest]: example, sometimes I have the idea, I know where I'm headed with this, this is the basic

03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:42.800
[Guest]: thing, but I fumble and struggle when I'm trying to put it together in writing.

03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:44.880
[Guest]: So then I'll draw.

03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:50.640
[Guest]: So I'll try and create a fancy banner, then I'll try and do an illustration of something.

03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:55.400
[Guest]: And then I will do this, then that triggers a thought and it builds a connection.

03:05:55.400 --> 03:05:58.000
[Guest]: I say, oh my God, how could I have even missed it?

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
[Guest]: And I'll go back and sort of look at that.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:09.440
[Guest]: And this whole process for me is about, then I'll go back and say, oh, you know something?

03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:18.440
[Guest]: Let's take a break and I'll listen to something or I'll watch some YouTube video or something.

03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:22.320
[Guest]: But all the time at the back of your head, you are thinking about whatever you're writing

03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:24.260
[Guest]: about.

03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:31.700
[Guest]: That whole process, writing therefore is not just an act of putting an idea onto paper,

03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:37.840
[Guest]: but it's a process of integrating your world and putting the essence of that, serving it.

03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:45.840
[Guest]: It's like cooking up a meal for a very large number of strangers and a few friends.

03:06:45.840 --> 03:06:54.720
[Guest]: So when you start doing that, you're always asking yourself, am I cooking only for my

03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:59.360
[Guest]: friends or should I be also cooking for some strangers?

03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:02.920
[Guest]: Because it's in that that you challenge your craft.

03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:05.080
[Amit Varma]: I love this framework of divergent, convergent.

03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:10.880
[Amit Varma]: I think when somebody asks me, what is it Amit, you were going to do so much writing,

03:07:10.880 --> 03:07:11.880
[Amit Varma]: what are you doing?

03:07:11.880 --> 03:07:12.880
[Amit Varma]: I don't see you writing.

03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:13.880
[Amit Varma]: I'll simply say, it's divergent.

03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:15.880
[Amit Varma]: It's divergent, convergent.

03:07:15.880 --> 03:07:16.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

03:07:16.880 --> 03:07:18.880
[Amit Varma]: Abhi toh hum chill kar rahe hain.

03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Aap mujhe skype pe dekh ke batao, kaunsi bhasha hai.

03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:23.520
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So, okay.

03:07:24.520 --> 03:07:29.880
[Amit Varma]: So my next question in a sense is a different kind of divergent, convergent, which is that

03:07:29.880 --> 03:07:36.460
[Amit Varma]: if you look at the thinkers of the 15th century, the 16th century and so on, they thought broadly

03:07:36.460 --> 03:07:40.820
[Amit Varma]: about a lot of things because our knowledge and everything was so limited that you could

03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:45.960
[Amit Varma]: think broadly that someone like an Isaac Newton was not only doing the physics that he did,

03:07:45.960 --> 03:07:50.720
[Amit Varma]: but was also interested in alchemy and was also teaching theology to pura sab tha.

03:07:50.720 --> 03:07:57.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, people like what Plato and Aristotle are doing is asking questions about a whole

03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:00.520
[Amit Varma]: lot of subjects rather than restrict themselves to anyone.

03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:05.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the way I define philosophy is like proto science.

03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:09.720
[Amit Varma]: It is asking big questions that come before science and over a period of time, science

03:08:09.720 --> 03:08:14.080
[Amit Varma]: will take over some of that area and some questions remain with philosophy and whatever

03:08:14.080 --> 03:08:16.120
[Amit Varma]: remains is philosophy.

03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:20.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, otherwise gradually science kind of takes things over.

03:08:20.040 --> 03:08:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, what has happened in the last four or five centuries is that fields get more and

03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:25.240
[Amit Varma]: more specialized.

03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:31.840
[Amit Varma]: Ki, you know, sociology ek ho jati hain, economics aur ek ho jati hain, wahan se further splits

03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:35.840
[Amit Varma]: till you reach a stage where today there will be an esteemed professor somewhere who is

03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:40.800
[Amit Varma]: like an expert in labor economics in Latin America and blah, blah, blah, which is a very

03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:41.800
[Amit Varma]: narrow field.

03:08:41.800 --> 03:08:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And they'll know that lane and they'll know nothing else.

03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:49.720
[Amit Varma]: But the trend that's been perhaps, I mean, I wonder if you'd agree that there's a little

03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:57.600
[Amit Varma]: sense that now it is expanding again, in the sense that now people see the value of stepping

03:08:57.600 --> 03:09:02.880
[Amit Varma]: back, thinking broadly, and applying common frameworks to different things, like the way

03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:07.040
[Amit Varma]: that you know, you've done in your books and like the way that I try to do, yeh framework

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:08.040
[Amit Varma]: hai.

03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:10.440
[Amit Varma]: For example, dissipation of the mainstream, decentralize ho raha hai.

03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:13.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not just about one field, it can apply to a lot of things.

03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And you apply it like that.

03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:20.240
[Amit Varma]: You look at some of the great public intellectuals of our times, like say, Steven Pinker, right?

03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Cross disciplinary, just, you know, getting great insight into a lot of work.

03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:25.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's fantastic.

03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:30.280
[Amit Varma]: I think that, you know, if you narrow down onto one damn subject, and you just drill

03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:33.320
[Amit Varma]: down deep on that, and all of that, that's great.

03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:35.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, we need people like that.

03:09:35.240 --> 03:09:36.240
[Amit Varma]: We need hedgehogs.

03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've sort of, I don't know if you've used a specific term fox with regard to yourself,

03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:44.280
[Amit Varma]: but I read you writing about yourself.

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, woh Isaiah Berlin ka jo fox in the hedgehog hai, that the hedgehog knows

03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:49.960
[Amit Varma]: one thing, a fox knows many things.

03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that you are a classic quintessential fox.

03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:56.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, I don't know if you were ever a hedgehog in terms of, you know, that particular

03:09:56.920 --> 03:09:57.920
[Amit Varma]: specialization.

03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:02.040
[Amit Varma]: But you're a classic quintessential fox, which is why these books are valuable, which is

03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:03.960
[Amit Varma]: not to say hedgehogs aren't valuable.

03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:05.800
[Amit Varma]: Of course, they are in a different way.

03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:07.800
[Amit Varma]: We need that kind of depth also.

03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:12.500
[Amit Varma]: But we also need this broad step back meta system syncing kind of approach.

03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:15.600
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your thoughts on this?

03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:21.400
[Guest]: You know, when you look at the world today, as it has become a lot more, so I, in my book

03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:26.760
[Guest]: Dreamers and Unicorns, I talk about five forces that you must use while designing anything,

03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:28.300
[Guest]: you know, today.

03:10:28.300 --> 03:10:31.400
[Guest]: One of them is about boundarylessness.

03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:35.240
[Guest]: You know, you talked about this whole thing that the world is so interconnected that the

03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:38.840
[Guest]: problems are also fairly interconnected.

03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:43.840
[Guest]: You can't solve a problem of one country without, you know, automatically impacting five other

03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:47.800
[Guest]: places where somebody somewhere else is going to get impacted.

03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:54.440
[Guest]: And you might turn back and say that, okay, let's go and, you know, put option A and,

03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:56.320
[Guest]: you know, push that country back.

03:10:56.320 --> 03:11:00.400
[Guest]: And suddenly you realize that your own cousin is stranded there and, you know, so you kind

03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:05.520
[Guest]: of, it's suddenly from being very abstract, it suddenly comes back to strike you.

03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:11.480
[Guest]: The pandemic, you know, when we've had, you know, tragedies in the past, you know, one

03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:15.720
[Guest]: of the things that very often people talk about is that the tragedy is a statistic in

03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:22.680
[Guest]: the newspaper until one of those people belongs to your family or is your loved one.

03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:26.920
[Guest]: Then it suddenly means something completely different, a disease means something different.

03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:34.360
[Guest]: So when you look at the world from a very personal point of view, you begin to see what

03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:35.680
[Guest]: matters only to you.

03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:40.320
[Guest]: But when you take a meta view, you begin to realize that all these things are fairly boundaryless.

03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:43.820
[Guest]: For example, the largest companies in the world today are boundaryless.

03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:45.800
[Guest]: You can never describe what is their core business.

03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:47.960
[Guest]: I mean, what is the core business of Amazon?

03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:48.960
[Guest]: It's not selling books.

03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:50.480
[Guest]: They stopped doing that long back.

03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:55.480
[Guest]: I mean, they still do it, but I'm just saying that it's a completely different planet altogether,

03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:59.520
[Guest]: what they are known for and where their revenue comes from and what they will do.

03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:03.600
[Guest]: And this employs, you know, such a huge number of people.

03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:09.800
[Guest]: And if you look at that ecosystem, it employs a huge number of people and sometimes some

03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:16.760
[Guest]: of these companies are bigger than the GDPs of many nations combined, yeah?

03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:23.160
[Guest]: So there is a subtle shift of power away from one kind of a system to another kind of a

03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:24.840
[Guest]: system.

03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:32.960
[Guest]: Somebody who has read philosophy or economics and history and a little bit of geography

03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:39.120
[Guest]: and civics can sort of map all this and say, oh gosh, this is a repetition of this particular

03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:40.120
[Guest]: process.

03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:48.280
[Guest]: So in economics, when you read Eco and SRCC, you also have to do political science.

03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:52.240
[Guest]: And I always thought, my God, why am I being made to read political science?

03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:55.280
[Guest]: I have no desire to pursue it ever in my life again.

03:12:55.280 --> 03:13:03.680
[Guest]: Now I look back how foolish I was because when you read about things like Hegelian dialectics,

03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:08.720
[Guest]: you learn about the fact that it's so powerful, thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, which is

03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:13.640
[Guest]: one of the things that is the second piece that I talk about in my design principle,

03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:17.240
[Guest]: that the world will exist as ants.

03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:23.600
[Guest]: You will never have any more of that one homogenous thing, whether in media, whether in society,

03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:28.200
[Guest]: whether in education, whether in the method of learning, it'll all be an ant.

03:13:28.200 --> 03:13:34.600
[Guest]: You will learn partly from college and from an individual and from YouTube and from Spotify

03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:36.380
[Guest]: and from a book.

03:13:36.380 --> 03:13:43.960
[Guest]: It's all of that, which then turns back to explain, oh, okay, it fundamentally means

03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:49.080
[Guest]: value is going to be created through intangibles, which is the third principle that one is talking

03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:50.080
[Guest]: about.

03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:54.000
[Guest]: Intangible things like brands become important, which is why you kind of say that, you know,

03:13:54.000 --> 03:14:00.000
[Guest]: suddenly you find a YouTuber who's like all of 10 years old, who has 10 million followers,

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:06.400
[Guest]: now employs his parents and, you know, runs a company and is featured on the magazine

03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:10.120
[Guest]: cover and, you know, makes more money than your CEO.

03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:18.240
[Guest]: Suddenly you kind of say, okay, hold on, is this the exception or is this the signal of

03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:22.600
[Guest]: something which is going to, it's a weak signal today, but that's where it is.

03:14:22.600 --> 03:14:32.100
[Guest]: And therefore, when you look at the fourth pieces about managing, understanding emotions,

03:14:32.100 --> 03:14:34.640
[Guest]: it has become so important.

03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:40.440
[Guest]: And if you see what is the element which is missing in this world of Zoom meetings, that

03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:42.840
[Guest]: you're missing the human connect.

03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:45.000
[Guest]: Could we have done this conversation over Zoom?

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:46.000
[Guest]: Yes, we would have.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:47.000
[Guest]: It would have been efficient.

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:51.200
[Guest]: We would have, you know, sort of put a time and then we would have done this conversation.

03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:53.240
[Guest]: Efficient, yes.

03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:59.480
[Guest]: Many of those nuances get missed because part of the response gets shaped based on your

03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:05.200
[Guest]: response to the thing and I observe, you know, the way you're looking or the nodding of the

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:11.220
[Guest]: head or, you know, when you're flipping something, all of that, it's a part of that larger signal.

03:15:11.220 --> 03:15:16.280
[Guest]: If you limit it to just one signal of what is being put across, you know, it becomes

03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:18.720
[Guest]: very, very limiting.

03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:23.420
[Guest]: So and then the fifth principle is, of course, it's in perpetual beta, so there isn't something

03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:25.280
[Guest]: called a new normal.

03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:26.280
[Guest]: That's a myth.

03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.000
[Guest]: It's never going to be something like that.

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:33.080
[Guest]: But when you combine all of this, so many of the things begin to make sense that there

03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:35.960
[Guest]: is decentralization.

03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:38.360
[Guest]: Decentralization is happening in media.

03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:44.000
[Guest]: Decentralization is happening in finance, you know, and you see the cryptos happening.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.600
[Guest]: Suddenly it all connects up, you know.

03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:51.440
[Guest]: So I think when you have a multidisciplinary point of view, you begin to experience the

03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:57.040
[Guest]: world very differently because you are using multiple lenses.

03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:03.160
[Guest]: And if you put in the lens of people, what does it mean for somebody who is, let's say,

03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:08.600
[Guest]: you know, in a blue-collar role or somebody who is earning below a certain threshold of

03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:09.720
[Guest]: money?

03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.400
[Guest]: What does this mean when you kind of do something like that?

03:16:13.400 --> 03:16:14.600
[Guest]: Is it good for them?

03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:15.600
[Guest]: Is it bad for them?

03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:16.600
[Guest]: Who's the beneficiary?

03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:17.840
[Guest]: What's the incentive?

03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:26.080
[Guest]: You suddenly start to use many different lenses when you create it, you know, when you build

03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:29.080
[Guest]: multiple disciplines in your head.

03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:31.880
[Guest]: So I think careers will also move in that direction.

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:38.180
[Guest]: It's no longer going to be about, you know, like I've used one of my highest views has

03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:44.600
[Guest]: come from this thing which I wrote, are you a career 3.0 person stuck in a career 1.0

03:16:44.600 --> 03:16:45.600
[Guest]: job?

03:16:45.600 --> 03:16:46.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:51.400
[Guest]: It simply means that you are going to be looking at a world where people will not just do one

03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:56.360
[Guest]: job, which is you're an engineer, you retire as an engineer, one employer, or maybe you

03:16:56.360 --> 03:16:59.480
[Guest]: change a couple of employers, but it's basically the same.

03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:06.600
[Guest]: Career 2.0 is trained as whatever, and then decided to go and open a cafe and or become

03:17:06.600 --> 03:17:12.080
[Guest]: a musician, you know, and that's the world that, you know, many people have taken on.

03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:13.840
[Guest]: That's career 2.0.

03:17:13.840 --> 03:17:16.240
[Guest]: It's like a fork.

03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:23.480
[Guest]: Career 3.0 is like a pizza, which is sliced into, you know, multiple things.

03:17:23.480 --> 03:17:29.720
[Guest]: You have multiple skills, which is monetized at varying levels.

03:17:29.720 --> 03:17:34.600
[Guest]: And that is the world that most people will live in because of a variety of reasons.

03:17:34.600 --> 03:17:39.400
[Guest]: One is, of course, we are living longer, you know, today, our average longevity is 72 years

03:17:39.400 --> 03:17:40.400
[Guest]: in India.

03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:42.880
[Guest]: In 1947, it was 32 years.

03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:44.680
[Guest]: You know, decades have been added.

03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:50.600
[Guest]: So when you look at that, if you pause and say, oh, that means when people talked about

03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:57.160
[Guest]: four ashrams, you know, Brahmacharya, Grahastha, you know, Vanprastha and Sanyas, when they

03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:03.040
[Guest]: are talking about this, you mean all of it had to fit in under 32 years or 30 years?

03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:08.600
[Guest]: That explains why people had to get married at age eight or 10, because you are already,

03:18:08.600 --> 03:18:12.480
[Guest]: you know, you are 50% down, you know, in terms of your lifespan.

03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:15.920
[Guest]: And so then, you know, you are building space for many other things.

03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:23.680
[Guest]: So when you suddenly look at many of these processes, a lot of things connect back.

03:18:23.680 --> 03:18:28.560
[Guest]: And now when you look at, you know, when people are going to live to be 100, this whole notion

03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:33.440
[Guest]: of retirement is such an irrelevant concept because, you know, it was done at a point

03:18:33.440 --> 03:18:39.160
[Guest]: of time when this hard labor and everything meant people sort of died at a certain kind

03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:40.160
[Guest]: of a pace.

03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:46.440
[Guest]: And you said, okay, you know, enjoy the last couple of years based on what you saved up.

03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:51.760
[Guest]: People today will not be able to do that because you are, you know, when you look at your savings,

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:56.240
[Guest]: what you will need based on inflation, just do the math and you will discover that, you

03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:00.920
[Guest]: know, you will have to perhaps work out of economic necessity for most people.

03:19:00.920 --> 03:19:07.960
[Guest]: Even if you don't want to do that, you are lucky enough that you made your whatever money.

03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:14.640
[Guest]: How much of Netflix will you watch for the next, you know, 40 years, 60 years?

03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:21.320
[Guest]: So the notion of time when it changes, your notion of your career will also change.

03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:25.320
[Amit Varma]: So I want to come to the notion of time because you've also spoken about that and I keep talking

03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:26.360
[Amit Varma]: to my guests about that.

03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:30.720
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, I loved that video of yours where you talk about the concept

03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:36.800
[Amit Varma]: of thinking in an and kind of way, becoming an and person and, you know, and the part

03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:42.240
[Amit Varma]: of it which I really liked, there was Chindogu, which is a Japanese for useless inventions.

03:19:42.240 --> 03:19:45.880
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just direct people to that, I'll link it from the show notes.

03:19:45.880 --> 03:19:49.920
[Amit Varma]: But there is, you know, I thought of one, I discovered one example recently who fits

03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:51.400
[Amit Varma]: perfectly into your framework.

03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of Miss Excel?

03:19:53.040 --> 03:19:55.400
[Guest]: Yes, she teaches Excel on Instagram.

03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, she teaches Excel.

03:19:56.400 --> 03:19:58.120
[Guest]: She's just an incredible person.

03:19:58.120 --> 03:19:59.120
[Guest]: Wow.

03:19:59.120 --> 03:20:03.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's the, that's the and, Excel plus EDM plus dancing.

03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:05.040
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

03:20:05.040 --> 03:20:07.480
[Amit Varma]: So that's your perfect and example.

03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:11.960
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's talk about time because this exact example about why people used to get

03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:16.240
[Amit Varma]: married young because you wouldn't live so long, I just chatted with, you know, one of

03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:19.880
[Amit Varma]: my guests in a recent episode, I mean, I've recorded six episodes in the week before this,

03:20:19.880 --> 03:20:25.120
[Amit Varma]: so I've forgotten who, but this exact thing that how does one's notion of time change

03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:30.480
[Amit Varma]: and in another way, I think of, you know, people like you and me, where we've reached

03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:38.200
[Amit Varma]: middle age, and, you know, when you're 20, it seems like time stretches out forever that

03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:44.000
[Amit Varma]: 30 is an old man and at 50 is a sit down uncle, you know, that's how it seems.

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:48.520
[Amit Varma]: But when you reach my age, it's like a couple of decades just went by in the flash of an

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:52.720
[Amit Varma]: eye and your notions of time changes, which is why you start thinking more in terms of

03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:55.240
[Amit Varma]: happiness and activity and what you want to do.

03:20:55.240 --> 03:21:00.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've got a video on this where you get played around with this one sentence,

03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:02.920
[Amit Varma]: which is I have worked there a very long time.

03:21:02.920 --> 03:21:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, not to give a spoiler, but to cut to the chase, you showed a picture of

03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:12.800
[Amit Varma]: an old man, you ask your audience that this old man says I have worked there a very long

03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:13.800
[Amit Varma]: time.

03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:17.720
[Amit Varma]: What do you think he means in like 20 years, 10 years, blah, blah, all of that.

03:21:17.720 --> 03:21:21.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you cut to a bunch of teenagers and for them, it's like seven months that someone

03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:24.600
[Unknown]: apparently I think you mentioned told you that I have worked there a long time and it

03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:26.600
[Amit Varma]: works seven months in a place.

03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And your point, which I found very provocative and worth thinking about, because I never

03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:34.560
[Amit Varma]: thought about it in this particular way, is that therefore two people who are working

03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:43.320
[Amit Varma]: together may in one sense, be completely incompatible, because their notions of time are completely

03:21:43.320 --> 03:21:44.320
[Guest]: different.

03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:47.200
[Guest]: Yes, that's very true.

03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:54.080
[Guest]: Because when you, you know, when you look at people, when they stay in a company for

03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:59.600
[Guest]: a long time, or they stay in a relationship for a long time, very often the unexplored

03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:06.600
[Guest]: assumption is that our notions of time are similar, which means when I say, yeah, let's

03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:10.320
[Guest]: do it quickly, you know, you and I roughly have the same thing.

03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:12.880
[Guest]: It's unspoken, but it's understood.

03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:21.080
[Guest]: The moment there is a mismatch of time expectation, it causes stress to either party and the relationship

03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:22.440
[Guest]: will not last.

03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:26.920
[Guest]: So therefore, when you look at attrition, when a lot of people, young people today are

03:22:26.920 --> 03:22:32.620
[Guest]: leaving jobs, it comes from a variety of reasons, multiple reasons.

03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:36.960
[Guest]: So it's not a single factor kind of a thing.

03:22:36.960 --> 03:22:42.640
[Guest]: But when you look at it, it comes from the fact that young people also have a sense of

03:22:42.640 --> 03:22:48.280
[Guest]: impatience because, you know, there is so much of time that they have spent.

03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:53.720
[Guest]: You may say that, oh, this fellow, you know, worked with us for six months and he left.

03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:56.600
[Guest]: You know, what an ungrateful person, we invested so much.

03:22:56.600 --> 03:23:00.600
[Guest]: But in that person's mind, I could have spent a very long time.

03:23:00.600 --> 03:23:04.440
[Guest]: I gave six months of my life to your organization.

03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:09.760
[Guest]: And they feel dejected that it's looked at as, you know, an act of betrayal because the

03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:16.800
[Guest]: people talking about this are older people whose definition of time is much older because

03:23:16.800 --> 03:23:23.120
[Guest]: they have come from a point of time where if you sent a letter and in that video I talk

03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:29.120
[Guest]: about that example in my ink talk that you write a, you know, letter to somebody in another

03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:32.400
[Guest]: country, it's going to take three weeks to reach.

03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:36.360
[Guest]: And if the person wrote back that very day and posted it, it will take another three

03:23:36.360 --> 03:23:37.360
[Guest]: weeks.

03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:41.200
[Guest]: So your instant response is six weeks away.

03:23:41.200 --> 03:23:45.880
[Guest]: And today you find people who are competing with everything that, you know, this is on

03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:51.840
[Guest]: demand, this is learning is on demand, your vegetables are delivered to you in 10 minutes.

03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:57.200
[Guest]: And at the end of the day, we are getting an inflated notion of how worthwhile our time

03:23:57.200 --> 03:23:58.680
[Guest]: is.

03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:02.280
[Guest]: And parallelly, the polar opposite is they are getting bored.

03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:08.280
[Guest]: I don't know what to do with my time, you know, because if you are not curious, long

03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:10.880
[Guest]: life can be a curse.

03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:17.640
[Guest]: So when we say, you live thousands of years, you are 50,000 years old, that is, you know,

03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:24.880
[Guest]: the worst thing to tell somebody who doesn't have the wherewithal to engage themselves,

03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:31.520
[Guest]: you know, in their own world for so many years, or who don't know how to build relationships

03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:33.640
[Guest]: beyond what they've been handed over.

03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:38.040
[Guest]: So they have no curiosity to spend time with strangers.

03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:42.080
[Guest]: Their own kids are going to, you know, go away and they lead their own life.

03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:45.920
[Guest]: And which is why so many people talk about emptiness, because nothing else has filled

03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:47.920
[Guest]: their nest.

03:24:47.920 --> 03:24:52.600
[Guest]: So you need to be able to figure out how do you structure time?

03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:54.120
[Guest]: What does that mean to you?

03:24:54.120 --> 03:24:59.760
[Guest]: And that's an essential component of happiness, because then you have a great view that, yeah,

03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:03.460
[Guest]: if I spend, you know, five years, you know, it's a great place.

03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:08.600
[Guest]: One of the places where I worked, where I, you know, completed five years, I happened

03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:11.720
[Guest]: to be working in the US at that point of time.

03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:17.320
[Guest]: And this is a company which has, you know, seen people working there for decades and

03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:21.200
[Guest]: come and spent a great place to be and all of that.

03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:28.280
[Guest]: And you know, when you complete five years, they give you some kind of a gift and some

03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:36.320
[Guest]: that's a very small gift, but you get to wear a small little label pin kind of a thing.

03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:42.080
[Guest]: So I found that, you know, my time was over and nobody made any reference to the fact

03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:46.540
[Guest]: that we should be having some kind of a celebration to mark your five years.

03:25:46.540 --> 03:25:50.320
[Guest]: And I was thinking maybe nobody knows me, which is true that nobody knew that I completed

03:25:50.320 --> 03:25:51.320
[Guest]: five years.

03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:55.420
[Guest]: They all thought I'd just joined and, you know, whatever.

03:25:55.420 --> 03:26:01.640
[Guest]: And so then finally, you know, I had dropped many hints to my, you know, teammates and

03:26:01.640 --> 03:26:05.680
[Guest]: they said, yeah, it's been a long time and these five years have just gone by and all.

03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:10.080
[Guest]: And nobody reacted, you know, because everybody was used to working there much longer.

03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:14.960
[Guest]: So five years didn't seem like, you know, something worth celebrating.

03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:20.840
[Guest]: It is really what, you know, I felt when I saw these days, you even have graduation ceremonies

03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:24.860
[Guest]: from prep to class one, you know, which was like, you know.

03:26:24.860 --> 03:26:26.520
[Guest]: So it was one of those moments.

03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:32.240
[Guest]: I went to somebody in HR and said, you know, I've completed five years.

03:26:32.240 --> 03:26:33.240
[Guest]: So now what happens?

03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:36.160
[Guest]: They said, oh, your gift should be on the way, you know.

03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:39.640
[Guest]: So then you can go and collect it from so and so person.

03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:44.200
[Guest]: So it was the dispatch office and I found that, you know, this guy was there and he

03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:45.200
[Guest]: said, yeah.

03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:46.760
[Guest]: So what can I do for you?

03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:48.640
[Guest]: And I said, I've completed five years.

03:26:48.640 --> 03:26:52.240
[Guest]: Oh, there was a box full of those little label pins.

03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:58.120
[Guest]: He picked up one and tossed it like that to me and said, okay, go wear it and flaunt it.

03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:01.000
[Guest]: I went so angry, I went and dumped it in the dustbin.

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:05.520
[Guest]: I said, nahi chahiye mujhe, is tarah se battameezi se de rahe hain.

03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:10.420
[Guest]: And then I kind of thought that, well, in that place, five years is really, my notion

03:27:10.420 --> 03:27:16.000
[Guest]: of time is not the same as the notion of time for this guy who's worked there for, you know,

03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:17.800
[Guest]: 34 years or whatever.

03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:19.440
[Guest]: For him, what is there to celebrate?

03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:25.360
[Guest]: It is the same thing, I can understand celebrating graduation as in university, but graduation

03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:29.400
[Guest]: from prep to one today seems the same equivalent, yeah?

03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:36.880
[Guest]: So I think over time, as our perception of time changes, how we view others who are different,

03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:42.200
[Guest]: you know, we start to look at them with a little bit of disrespect and, you know, don't

03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:46.160
[Guest]: take them seriously because after all, what has this guy seen?

03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:53.280
[Guest]: So a lot of it, in every culture, there's a premium placed on longevity of time, you

03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:54.280
[Guest]: know?

03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:55.280
[Guest]: Tumne kya duniya dekhi hain?

03:27:55.280 --> 03:28:01.360
[Guest]: Main tumse bahut baddi duniya dekhi hain, mere baal safed dhoop mein nahi hua hain.

03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:08.400
[Guest]: There are idioms, phrases, all of which celebrates that you spent a long time doing something.

03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:13.120
[Guest]: And yet if you look at, for many of the people who are entering their teens or, you know,

03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:17.400
[Guest]: people who are entering the early stages of work, they look at that as something which

03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:19.000
[Guest]: is not positive.

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:24.360
[Guest]: If you tell a company that we've got a long legacy of, you're doing something for the

03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:30.600
[Guest]: last 40 years, it's not something that a lot of people view with great, you know, notion

03:28:30.600 --> 03:28:36.040
[Guest]: that awestruck, oh my God, you've done it for 40 years, they say, okay, probably someplace

03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:38.380
[Guest]: I am better off somewhere else.

03:28:38.380 --> 03:28:43.720
[Guest]: So notions of time are, you know, very, very important that they're determined, you look

03:28:43.720 --> 03:28:48.680
[Guest]: at your friends, you probably have similar notions of time.

03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:53.280
[Guest]: And which is why when you can sit down with classmates, you know, you share the same experience

03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:54.280
[Guest]: of time.

03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:59.600
[Guest]: And you turn back and say, yaad hai aisa hota tha, when you think about nostalgia, nostalgia

03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:04.320
[Guest]: has no meaning for somebody from a different generation, it's boring.

03:29:04.320 --> 03:29:08.320
[Guest]: And if somebody says that, oh, you know, I lived in a time when there was only black

03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:09.320
[Guest]: and white television.

03:29:09.320 --> 03:29:14.740
[Guest]: A lot of people, they will say, my God, what a disgusting world to have lived in.

03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:22.920
[Guest]: So until and unless you begin to set aside your own judgment and, you know, evaluation,

03:29:22.920 --> 03:29:28.880
[Guest]: and you start to say, what was it like when there was, you know, one television channel?

03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:30.740
[Guest]: What did it really mean?

03:29:30.740 --> 03:29:35.080
[Guest]: And you refer to it that there was a homogenized view of what is the truth.

03:29:35.080 --> 03:29:36.080
[Guest]: And everybody shared it.

03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:40.800
[Amit Varma]: Then we knew a lot about agriculture because of Krishi Darshan.

03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:42.800
[Guest]: See another shared moment.

03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:46.720
[Guest]: We are just dating ourselves by doing all this.

03:29:46.720 --> 03:29:50.800
[Guest]: You know, Krishi Darshan was one of those, Chitrahaar was, you know, once a week and

03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:57.400
[Guest]: you got to watch a Hindi film clip, you know, once a week, and you kind of suffered through

03:29:57.400 --> 03:30:02.560
[Guest]: hundreds of ads just to see those, you know, five songs that would be played.

03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:06.920
[Amit Varma]: And the Pradeep Kishan film in which Annie gives it those ones written by Arundhati Roy,

03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:10.100
[Amit Varma]: that's famous for having aired only once on Doordarshan.

03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And I saw it and all my friends saw it, not because we knew about the film or we are waiting

03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:15.280
[Amit Varma]: for it or whatever.

03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:17.760
[Guest]: But you got to see one film a week on TV.

03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:19.480
[Guest]: And you didn't want to miss it for whatever reason.

03:30:19.480 --> 03:30:20.480
[Amit Varma]: You didn't want to miss it.

03:30:20.480 --> 03:30:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Toh sab jo bhi dikhate the dekhte the.

03:30:23.120 --> 03:30:24.120
[Guest]: Correct.

03:30:24.120 --> 03:30:28.520
[Guest]: So I started sort of showing regional films, you know, and then that's how I sort of, you

03:30:28.520 --> 03:30:32.480
[Guest]: know, again, because there was so much of dearth of entertainment, you watch regional

03:30:32.480 --> 03:30:36.440
[Guest]: films also, which was in some sense good, because it expanded my worldview beyond what

03:30:36.440 --> 03:30:37.720
[Guest]: I had seen.

03:30:37.720 --> 03:30:38.720
[Guest]: So it was lovely.

03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:43.240
[Guest]: I mean, so in that sense, it was doled out, rationed.

03:30:43.240 --> 03:30:44.320
[Guest]: It was precious.

03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:46.040
[Guest]: So smaller things made you happy.

03:30:46.040 --> 03:30:49.840
[Guest]: So you talked about ambition, ambition bahut chote hota tha, wahan toh koi ambition tha

03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:50.840
[Amit Varma]: hi nahi.

03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:55.080
[Amit Varma]: My father was an IAS officer back in the day, you know, and very sort of conventional in

03:30:55.080 --> 03:30:56.080
[Amit Varma]: his thinking.

03:30:56.080 --> 03:31:01.200
[Amit Varma]: So once I remember sometime in the 90s, after liberalization, he gave some talk about talking

03:31:01.200 --> 03:31:05.840
[Amit Varma]: about the good old days, saying ki now I turn on the TV, I don't know what to watch.

03:31:05.840 --> 03:31:07.320
[Amit Varma]: But back then we knew what to watch.

03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:10.640
[Amit Varma]: There was only one thing to watch and he was romanticizing that and I had an argument with

03:31:10.640 --> 03:31:11.640
[Amit Varma]: him.

03:31:11.640 --> 03:31:12.640
[Amit Varma]: I was like, what are you talking about?

03:31:12.640 --> 03:31:16.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, now I have so much, you know, I remember when star movies came and HBO came and you

03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:22.640
[Amit Varma]: have films all day boss, MTV jab aaya tha, all day paagal ho gaye the.

03:31:22.640 --> 03:31:29.720
[Amit Varma]: But I get what he's saying from the, you know, the mental equanimity point of view that you're

03:31:29.720 --> 03:31:34.320
[Amit Varma]: not just going from one thing to the other, like Jonathan Haidt recently made the point

03:31:34.320 --> 03:31:39.520
[Amit Varma]: that even though we are surrounded by so much information and knowledge and all of that,

03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:43.640
[Amit Varma]: everyone is consuming what was produced in the last three days.

03:31:43.640 --> 03:31:47.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's just so, such a frightening thought to me.

03:31:47.320 --> 03:31:51.360
[Amit Varma]: Speaking of time, by the way, I also, once in a while, I think of dogs, like how do dogs

03:31:51.360 --> 03:31:52.640
[Amit Varma]: suffer us?

03:31:52.640 --> 03:31:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Because dogs have a shorter lifespan, so their days are faster, the nights are faster, everything

03:31:58.360 --> 03:31:59.360
[Amit Varma]: is much faster.

03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:04.680
[Amit Varma]: So to them, their human masters or their human pets, maybe they think of us that way, are

03:32:04.680 --> 03:32:08.080
[Amit Varma]: such so ponderously slow.

03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:09.080
[Unknown]: Of course.

03:32:09.080 --> 03:32:15.640
[Amit Varma]: They're probably thinking that get a move on, throw the bloody ball, or how someone

03:32:15.640 --> 03:32:19.600
[Amit Varma]: might react if they meet me in real life, and they have to listen to me at 1x.

03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:23.320
[Amit Varma]: I can imagine a similar reaction.

03:32:23.320 --> 03:32:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about HR.

03:32:24.320 --> 03:32:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, what your book is, of course, much broader than that.

03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:34.520
[Amit Varma]: But in general, as far as the workplace is concerned, as far as companies are concerned,

03:32:34.520 --> 03:32:39.480
[Amit Varma]: and so on, what are the fundamental ways in which the world has changed, which people

03:32:39.480 --> 03:32:45.400
[Amit Varma]: don't get yet, where conventional wisdom hasn't caught up, like there is always a lag, the

03:32:45.400 --> 03:32:46.400
[Amit Varma]: world will change.

03:32:46.400 --> 03:32:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And then there'll be a lag and people will figure it out.

03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:52.360
[Amit Varma]: And big companies are actually the worst affected because they're the last people to figure

03:32:52.360 --> 03:32:56.240
[Amit Varma]: it out because of their ossified bureaucracies and all of that.

03:32:56.240 --> 03:33:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And some of them if they cope, you know, they survive and others go the way Kodak went,

03:33:00.680 --> 03:33:01.680
[Amit Varma]: you know.

03:33:01.680 --> 03:33:07.840
[Amit Varma]: So, if you have to speak to, say, your peers within companies or within HR or whatever,

03:33:07.840 --> 03:33:12.520
[Amit Varma]: and tell those guys, you don't see it, but take a step back, this is how the world has

03:33:12.520 --> 03:33:13.520
[Amit Varma]: changed.

03:33:13.520 --> 03:33:14.520
[Amit Varma]: This is what tomorrow will look like.

03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:15.520
[Amit Varma]: How would you put that?

03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:22.040
[Guest]: So, I mean, I don't think I have any great wisdom, which is different from what people

03:33:22.040 --> 03:33:25.040
[Guest]: have, you know, who are working in different companies.

03:33:25.040 --> 03:33:31.040
[Guest]: I would, of course, sort of say that, for me, one glaring gap that I notice is that

03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:37.840
[Guest]: most companies do not have any way of researching who their employees are.

03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:42.240
[Guest]: You don't, you see a lot of investment in consumer research, you know, you think about

03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:49.000
[Guest]: qualitative research, quantitative research, semiotics, yeh, woh, sab kuch hai.

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:55.220
[Guest]: Why don't the organizations have equal amount of investment in the people?

03:33:55.220 --> 03:33:59.600
[Guest]: If they did that, A, you would immediately begin to understand what makes them happy.

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:03.980
[Guest]: This particular bunch, and you are not limited by your own worldview.

03:34:03.980 --> 03:34:10.680
[Guest]: One of the problems of the current method of power structures is that rules are made

03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:17.720
[Guest]: by a set of people for the majority who they have no connection with, right?

03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:24.040
[Guest]: And they do meet them occasionally, you know, you kind of, the relationship is sort of really

03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:28.280
[Guest]: one of those occasional ones, you come home and you pat the little thing and the fellow

03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:33.360
[Guest]: goes off, and then you do your own thing, you read your newspaper.

03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:35.000
[Guest]: It's a lot like that.

03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:43.720
[Guest]: And I think the only way you can build organizations once again, is if you really start to engage

03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:48.040
[Guest]: with the people and really understand what are their deepest aspirations, what do they

03:34:48.040 --> 03:34:51.480
[Guest]: want, what are the things that they care about.

03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:56.880
[Guest]: And there are, you know, different places, of course, I'm still a big fan of reading,

03:34:56.880 --> 03:34:58.760
[Guest]: listening and all that.

03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:08.320
[Guest]: But those are some of the ways in which you can pick up what has changed because the medium

03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:15.160
[Guest]: has changed, you know, so one of the pieces that I do for some of my clients is this workshop

03:35:15.160 --> 03:35:23.400
[Guest]: called new media, you know, when you do that, most senior leaders have no way of engaging

03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:27.680
[Guest]: with people on, let's say, a social media platform, because social media doesn't really

03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:30.600
[Guest]: care about what an important guy you are.

03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:34.520
[Guest]: If you have nothing worthwhile to say, I am not going to follow you, and people can unfollow

03:35:34.520 --> 03:35:35.520
[Guest]: at a click.

03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:39.640
[Guest]: So, you know, yes, you might issue a diktat and say, tomorrow morning, I want all 30 people

03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:44.320
[Guest]: in my team to follow me, and day after they will unfollow you, you know.

03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:53.480
[Guest]: So it just, you know, media has evolved all around and the world is no longer like an

03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:55.200
[Guest]: aquarium, the working world.

03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:59.840
[Guest]: The organization is not like an aquarium where you are, you know, in this particular setup,

03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:04.840
[Guest]: you can get a view of the world outside, but, you know, this is pretty much a self-contained

03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:05.840
[Guest]: zone.

03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:15.920
[Guest]: Today, that aquarium is part of the ocean, so, which is why you find organizations in

03:36:15.920 --> 03:36:23.960
[Guest]: really awkward settings where they have to perhaps put a commentary on social events

03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:28.720
[Guest]: that are happening, social movements that are happening, political choices that people

03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:36.160
[Guest]: are making, the way they do ABC, where they sort of do that, the leaders are really awkward

03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:41.200
[Guest]: about the whole thing because they've never learned to have these dialogues, you know,

03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:46.720
[Guest]: with people who disagreed with them, and you begin to understand, well, I don't quite still

03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:50.800
[Guest]: change to your point of view, at least I understand what you feel about it.

03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:56.680
[Guest]: In the absence of that, it is going to be harder for people to lead others other than

03:36:56.680 --> 03:37:02.640
[Guest]: by force and diktat, which is going to happen in organizations where they say, yeah, you

03:37:02.640 --> 03:37:08.240
[Guest]: know what, I don't want to waste time doing this, you can find another place, which is

03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:10.280
[Guest]: what some of the companies have done.

03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:15.400
[Guest]: In my view, I think those are some of the ways in which, again, just as work, worker

03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:24.560
[Guest]: and workplace changes in tandem, leadership, talent, and culture also change in tandem.

03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:27.480
[Guest]: The leader must spot the trend that is happening.

03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:33.040
[Guest]: Now, most of the times, they can limit themselves to the product or the service that they're

03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:34.040
[Guest]: trying to create.

03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:36.880
[Guest]: So, most people are extremely buttoned up on that.

03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:43.080
[Guest]: They know that talent is still looked at as part of a problem that HR or talent acquisition

03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:44.440
[Guest]: is going to solve.

03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:47.680
[Guest]: And therefore, most leaders, again, get very distant from that, except for the fact that

03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:55.600
[Guest]: sometimes and hiring is one of the toughest decisions that you make ever in your life.

03:37:55.600 --> 03:38:00.280
[Guest]: And having done it for so many years, I still think I'm like really average or below average

03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:01.280
[Guest]: on that.

03:38:01.280 --> 03:38:05.400
[Guest]: And I think I get so many things wrong, my predictions about people, because hiring is

03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:09.920
[Guest]: really that, that you are making a prediction that this person is the best option for me

03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:12.880
[Guest]: to deliver ABC task.

03:38:12.880 --> 03:38:17.480
[Guest]: And that I have a way to reward and engage this person meaningfully.

03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:21.360
[Guest]: Very often the conversation is just about the task, but we forget that, will I be able

03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:23.520
[Guest]: to motivate somebody like this?

03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:32.800
[Guest]: So when you hire a person who is extremely creative and innovative, which is great, you

03:38:32.800 --> 03:38:33.800
[Guest]: can hire this person.

03:38:33.800 --> 03:38:35.880
[Guest]: Will you be able to manage a person like that?

03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:40.040
[Guest]: Because that person is good, is used to questioning everything and anything.

03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:44.760
[Guest]: And you will find it a drag because the other guys simply say, yes, sir, yes, ma'am and

03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:47.000
[Guest]: carry on with their life.

03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:49.480
[Guest]: This person is going to turn back and say, why?

03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:50.480
[Guest]: What do you mean by that?

03:38:50.480 --> 03:38:51.480
[Guest]: Why should I be doing this?

03:38:51.480 --> 03:38:52.640
[Guest]: Didn't we do this yesterday?

03:38:52.640 --> 03:38:54.000
[Guest]: Why should we be?

03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.360
[Guest]: And those are some of the places where people feel threatened.

03:38:56.360 --> 03:39:00.440
[Guest]: So the thing is, they will not hire somebody like that or the person doesn't survive in

03:39:00.440 --> 03:39:02.900
[Guest]: that organization system.

03:39:02.900 --> 03:39:07.080
[Guest]: And then the organizations worry about how do we stay more innovative?

03:39:07.080 --> 03:39:10.040
[Guest]: Then they do training programs around that.

03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:12.040
[Guest]: The answer doesn't lie in just the training programs.

03:39:12.040 --> 03:39:15.260
[Guest]: It has to be supported by the culture in which you operate.

03:39:15.260 --> 03:39:20.240
[Guest]: So leadership, talent and culture are again interlocked.

03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:25.000
[Guest]: And you can't change one without the other, the other two.

03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:31.720
[Guest]: So that is the other equation that I think is so basic that you have to be able to, you

03:39:31.720 --> 03:39:36.120
[Guest]: know, start leveraging it in the conversations.

03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:40.580
[Amit Varma]: And how has the pandemic affected all this across two margins?

03:39:40.580 --> 03:39:45.600
[Amit Varma]: One is, how has the pandemic actually changed the workplace and the things that companies

03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:48.160
[Amit Varma]: have to take into account about the way that they work?

03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:51.840
[Amit Varma]: And two, maybe there were things which were already changing, but we didn't realize it

03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:56.560
[Amit Varma]: and the pandemic made us realize it, that, oh, these things were redundant, but we didn't

03:39:56.560 --> 03:39:57.560
[Amit Varma]: know it.

03:39:57.560 --> 03:39:58.560
[Amit Varma]: But we now know that it's redundant.

03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:01.240
[Amit Varma]: Everybody doesn't have to come to office every day, for example.

03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:08.080
[Amit Varma]: So what are the different ways in which the pandemic has kind of shaken everything up?

03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:13.800
[Guest]: So I think a lot is written about how digital transformation has got sped up, you know,

03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:16.660
[Guest]: is fast forwarded during the pandemic.

03:40:16.660 --> 03:40:18.600
[Guest]: So a lot has been written about that.

03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:26.520
[Guest]: I think less has been written about the fact that, you know, the employees are not the

03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:27.880
[Guest]: same anymore.

03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:30.760
[Guest]: And I'll explain in a minute what that means.

03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:36.760
[Guest]: You know, very often when you see you have a teenager at home, very often you don't realize

03:40:36.760 --> 03:40:41.480
[Guest]: how they are changing, you know, they are getting taller, their voices are changing.

03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:45.880
[Guest]: You don't realize all of that until you find somebody who's seeing them after one or two

03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:55.440
[Guest]: years and say, oh, my God, you've grown so tall or you've, you know, changed so drastically.

03:40:55.440 --> 03:41:01.360
[Guest]: So what happens is, this is really a bit like the classmate effect.

03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:07.840
[Guest]: So the people you've been to school or college with have a certain picture of you at that

03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:12.040
[Guest]: point of time, you know, and they meet you once in a blue moon and they sort of perhaps

03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:17.640
[Guest]: get to know that Amit has got this podcast, he's doing this, that and the other.

03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:26.040
[Guest]: And all the successes and failures both surprise you because they are still looking at you

03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:28.720
[Guest]: with a picture that's frozen back in time.

03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:34.920
[Guest]: So if you are successful, then the constant thing is, that guy was so useless.

03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:38.800
[Guest]: How come that guy became, you know, ABC, that's so amazing.

03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:42.560
[Guest]: He was pretty useless, you know, I mean, he was not like this.

03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:46.320
[Guest]: And he didn't, he wasn't very good at telling stories.

03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:49.960
[Guest]: I don't know how he's become a writer.

03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:55.840
[Guest]: Because we fail to understand that people keep growing continuously.

03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:01.240
[Guest]: This is the adolescent kind of a thing that happens.

03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:05.680
[Guest]: Employers are facing the adolescent kind of a thing right now with employees, because

03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:09.280
[Guest]: for two years, they've worked out of their own home.

03:42:09.280 --> 03:42:16.680
[Guest]: And they are used to working in an unsupervised environment, where the boss, if I don't want

03:42:16.680 --> 03:42:20.440
[Guest]: to see your face, all I need to do is shut off the camera and then, you know, keep the

03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:21.440
[Guest]: headphone on.

03:42:21.440 --> 03:42:27.160
[Guest]: I'm, you know, responding to you, you have no idea, I'm not even sitting there, you know,

03:42:27.160 --> 03:42:32.840
[Guest]: so they are used, they are not used to the level of autonomy that the people have experienced.

03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:38.880
[Guest]: And that's going to be very hard for organizations to recreate the workplace where autonomy gets

03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:42.440
[Guest]: restricted.

03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:48.000
[Guest]: People are used to doing the work at the time that they do, yeah, and where they have, you

03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:51.760
[Guest]: know, found very rigid systems, they have quit.

03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:55.040
[Guest]: Lot of people have quit because they were unhappy, a lot of people have quit because

03:42:55.040 --> 03:42:59.440
[Guest]: they had no choice, a lot of people have quit because they're really reevaluating their

03:42:59.440 --> 03:43:05.960
[Guest]: purpose and saying, and tell me once again, why am I doing this work to pay the bills?

03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:10.240
[Guest]: Can I lower my standard of living and, you know, take a job which is not killing me like

03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:11.240
[Guest]: this?

03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:13.280
[Guest]: And a lot of people are doing this.

03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:19.840
[Guest]: The third is there is, you know, a big generational shift which is coming from the way that we

03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:22.000
[Guest]: view work.

03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:27.560
[Guest]: Because a lot of the people who are entering the workforce today, they have seen their

03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:32.960
[Guest]: parents work hard and still get laid off, they've seen that, you know, they've given

03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:36.080
[Guest]: their life, you know, they've not spent any time with the family, and one fine day the

03:43:36.080 --> 03:43:39.040
[Guest]: company decides to do that.

03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:45.160
[Guest]: Then in which case they have said, I'm not going to let the company decide and dictate

03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:51.040
[Guest]: terms with which I live and work, I will do it by myself.

03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:55.760
[Guest]: So the other day somebody was talking about a fact that when, you know, he asked somebody

03:43:55.760 --> 03:44:01.600
[Guest]: in his team who had just joined work and said that, you better complete it and give it to

03:44:01.600 --> 03:44:02.840
[Guest]: me on Monday.

03:44:02.840 --> 03:44:05.680
[Guest]: And the person says, I'm sorry, it's a Friday evening, I'm going out.

03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:10.960
[Guest]: So he says, okay, do it tomorrow at your convenience, he says, no, no, no, no, Saturdays and Sundays

03:44:10.960 --> 03:44:13.160
[Guest]: I sleep and spend time with my dog.

03:44:13.160 --> 03:44:17.440
[Guest]: He says, but you can do work, he says, no, but then who's going to spend time with my

03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:18.440
[Guest]: dog?

03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:25.560
[Guest]: Now, this is a question of, you know, people who worked for even 10 years, 12 years will

03:44:25.560 --> 03:44:27.560
[Guest]: not ask.

03:44:27.560 --> 03:44:31.640
[Guest]: They'll complain and say, you know, I've had to work over the weekend, and this is so terrible,

03:44:31.640 --> 03:44:33.560
[Guest]: but they'll do it.

03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:37.600
[Guest]: A lot of the younger people are going to turn back and say, hold on, I'm not going to kill

03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:43.120
[Guest]: my, you know, weekends for you, because I have to send some meaningless report which

03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:48.880
[Guest]: somebody's going to spend all of three seconds scanning over, for what, I'll do it on Monday.

03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:57.480
[Guest]: So I think production systems, workplaces, work is not designed with this degree of autonomy.

03:44:57.480 --> 03:45:04.000
[Guest]: It is being designed with that autonomy, which was taken away during industrialization, bus,

03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:08.160
[Guest]: my way or the highway, if you want to work in this factory, then you will jolly well

03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:12.440
[Guest]: come at this time before the siren finishes, I want you standing at the machine.

03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:20.000
[Guest]: Today, the person says, but I can't get up at 8.15, I can't, I'll go at 10, I can stay

03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:21.000
[Guest]: late later.

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:25.640
[Guest]: Now, that's inconvenient, because it's neither this shift, not that shift.

03:45:25.640 --> 03:45:31.920
[Guest]: So work has been, you know, created in little silos and boxes, which is very hard for people

03:45:31.920 --> 03:45:33.880
[Guest]: to manage now.

03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:39.200
[Guest]: So I think we are, this distance has been, you know, the shift has been happening for

03:45:39.200 --> 03:45:40.200
[Guest]: a while.

03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:45.960
[Guest]: It's a bit like what I've talked about in Dreamers and Unicorns with, you know, how

03:45:45.960 --> 03:45:53.000
[Guest]: when movies happened initially, we kind of thought that it's like theater, but there

03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:54.900
[Guest]: is a camera in front.

03:45:54.900 --> 03:46:04.440
[Guest]: So people still spoke in that exaggerated tone, why would you want to do that?

03:46:04.440 --> 03:46:09.440
[Guest]: We'd never spoke like this, because it was meant to be a performance.

03:46:09.440 --> 03:46:15.160
[Guest]: And then somebody said, hold on, why do we have only one camera static?

03:46:15.160 --> 03:46:17.480
[Guest]: And you know, why can't we move the camera around?

03:46:17.480 --> 03:46:19.000
[Guest]: What happens if we have that?

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:20.520
[Guest]: What happens if we have three cameras?

03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:22.360
[Guest]: What happens if we put the camera on top?

03:46:22.360 --> 03:46:28.440
[Guest]: What happens if we put a camera near the person's feet and show just the feet walking away?

03:46:28.440 --> 03:46:31.840
[Guest]: And a new format of storytelling emerges.

03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:38.760
[Guest]: It's the same process that is happening in organizations, and you are going to see that

03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:43.240
[Guest]: a lot of times people will behave as if it is still theater.

03:46:43.240 --> 03:46:48.400
[Guest]: They don't realize that, you know, the employees have moved further ahead.

03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:55.440
[Guest]: I think it's going to either mean a very different kind of a leader or the organization structure,

03:46:55.440 --> 03:46:57.240
[Guest]: and it will probably be both.

03:46:57.240 --> 03:47:02.800
[Guest]: It'll be far more decentralized because, you know, work today is done by networks and ecosystems.

03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:08.000
[Guest]: Whereas a lot of our reward systems, a lot of our development systems are still focused

03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:11.680
[Guest]: on the individual doing things for themselves.

03:47:11.680 --> 03:47:18.520
[Guest]: So the notion of leadership as somebody who manages an ecosystem, you know, needs a different

03:47:18.520 --> 03:47:20.160
[Guest]: mindset.

03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:24.240
[Guest]: An ecosystem is not just people who've had the same education as me.

03:47:24.240 --> 03:47:28.680
[Guest]: An ecosystem is the community, an ecosystem is the illiterate people, an ecosystem is

03:47:28.680 --> 03:47:33.840
[Guest]: the media, an ecosystem is, you know, everything else around me.

03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:41.600
[Guest]: So the importance of humanities as a foundation, without which you can't work, because work

03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:43.600
[Guest]: is no longer binary.

03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:46.600
[Guest]: You're either with me or against me, it's just not the model anymore.

03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:47.600
[Guest]: It is far more decentralized.

03:47:47.600 --> 03:47:54.480
[Guest]: The building of community is a massive skill which nobody has taught us.

03:47:54.480 --> 03:47:57.640
[Guest]: And yet that's where businesses are.

03:47:57.640 --> 03:48:03.600
[Guest]: So when you look at, so today's social shifts are moving ahead of where technology is taking

03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:04.600
[Guest]: us.

03:48:04.600 --> 03:48:10.240
[Guest]: Those social shifts have to be understood before they become completely divorced from

03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:12.040
[Guest]: what you're building.

03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:16.040
[Guest]: And people who are able to do that, so today if you see what's happening in the Indian

03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:22.800
[Guest]: ecosystem, you are looking at people who are, who have created products, that first wave

03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:30.000
[Guest]: of people who created stuff for the, you know, top 1% of India, is done and dusted and then

03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.320
[Guest]: now people are really building for the next 400 million.

03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:43.240
[Guest]: And this next 400 million have very different needs and expectations and problems than what

03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:45.080
[Guest]: the top 1% have.

03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:52.480
[Guest]: So it will give rise to a different set of startups and unicorns and all of that.

03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:58.640
[Guest]: But more importantly, you will find startup founders who come from that ecosystem, who

03:48:58.640 --> 03:49:01.240
[Guest]: are not building for an alien system.

03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:07.080
[Guest]: It's not, you know, a very fancy premium product being built for a third world country.

03:49:07.080 --> 03:49:12.320
[Guest]: So you kind of say, let's build down the cost a little bit, they can't afford it.

03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:15.080
[Guest]: It is going to be a different need altogether.

03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:18.640
[Guest]: And only somebody who has lived in that world can create that.

03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:22.000
[Guest]: And those kind of companies will have to be run in a very different way because they need

03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:23.800
[Guest]: different talent.

03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:27.080
[Guest]: You need talent which understands what they're doing.

03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:31.600
[Guest]: There, you know, like I was talking to one of the entrepreneurs and one of the VC members

03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:37.840
[Guest]: who said, very interesting example, she says that, you know, when you created the particular

03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:45.800
[Guest]: app that they have built, they said, the shopping cart, you know, checkout is through a shopping

03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:46.800
[Guest]: cart.

03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:48.720
[Guest]: You and I, we understand that.

03:49:48.720 --> 03:49:55.720
[Guest]: Now, a lot of people wondered what is that basket for?

03:49:55.720 --> 03:50:01.200
[Guest]: So then they suddenly realized that the shopping cart does not connect.

03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:02.820
[Guest]: So the visual language will change.

03:50:02.820 --> 03:50:04.200
[Guest]: So the apps will look different.

03:50:04.200 --> 03:50:09.320
[Guest]: The only person who can design something for that consumer is somebody who's lived that

03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:10.320
[Guest]: world.

03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:18.760
[Guest]: You know, it's funny because when you see a number of times when I look at cartoonists,

03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:22.920
[Guest]: they find it extremely difficult, Western cartoonists find it extremely difficult to

03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:25.280
[Guest]: do a good job of Indian faces.

03:50:25.280 --> 03:50:32.520
[Guest]: So if you sort of see Gandhi's face, you know, or you look at any of the Indian leaders who

03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:40.000
[Guest]: get drawn, you know, by Western cartoonists, for example, caricatures, they look completely

03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:44.920
[Guest]: different because the Indian face structure is different.

03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:50.200
[Guest]: In the same way, when I draw an Indian face, it is very different from drawing somebody

03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:54.320
[Guest]: who's, you know, Western.

03:50:54.320 --> 03:50:58.040
[Guest]: Face structures are different.

03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:02.160
[Guest]: A person from the African continent has a very different face structure and bone structure

03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:03.840
[Guest]: and body structure.

03:51:03.840 --> 03:51:10.880
[Guest]: When you look at these individual differences, suddenly you realize a lot of the products

03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:15.440
[Guest]: have not been made for people like this.

03:51:15.440 --> 03:51:22.800
[Guest]: You know, and so when you begin to see small weak signals from different parts of the world,

03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:24.840
[Guest]: you begin to do that.

03:51:24.840 --> 03:51:29.960
[Guest]: You begin to become aware of a world which is so different.

03:51:29.960 --> 03:51:33.080
[Guest]: And it may be a weak signal in your part of the world.

03:51:33.080 --> 03:51:34.920
[Guest]: It's already a mainstream trend.

03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:42.920
[Guest]: That's why when they say, if you are reading about something in the mainstream newspaper,

03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:45.000
[Guest]: it's already done and dusted, it's on the way down.

03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:52.780
[Guest]: So when you suddenly discover that, let me be part of it, it's already old school.

03:51:52.780 --> 03:51:57.800
[Amit Varma]: So there's actually a term for, like, first of all, what you say about, you know, artists

03:51:57.800 --> 03:52:00.960
[Amit Varma]: from outside drawing Indian faces differently is fascinating to me.

03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So the next time any of my foreign friends, you know, does a picture of me, I'll say,

03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:07.680
[Amit Varma]: dekhe, I am not fat.

03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:10.000
[Amit Varma]: The problem is with your gaze.

03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:11.880
[Amit Varma]: So I think that solves the problem.

03:52:11.880 --> 03:52:16.720
[Amit Varma]: No, there's actually a term which economists use called isomorphic mimicry, which is basically

03:52:16.720 --> 03:52:21.800
[Amit Varma]: you're transplanting something that has worked in another location and bringing it to this

03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:24.040
[Amit Varma]: context and expecting it to work here.

03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:28.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's really dangerous because you need to get really local and deep into it.

03:52:28.640 --> 03:52:32.880
[Amit Varma]: And also what you did, that shopping cart thing, which you described, that's in design

03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:37.160
[Amit Varma]: that's known as skeuomorphic design, where, you know, when Apple came out with their first

03:52:37.160 --> 03:52:39.140
[Amit Varma]: e-reader, they had a bookshelf thing there.

03:52:39.140 --> 03:52:43.320
[Amit Varma]: So people could relate or on many of these music editing softwares, you will have a knob

03:52:43.320 --> 03:52:44.320
[Amit Varma]: in the thing.

03:52:44.320 --> 03:52:49.600
[Amit Varma]: So people are turning a knob on the screen, you know, and email is still that envelope.

03:52:49.600 --> 03:52:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Email is still that envelope, who has last seen an envelope?

03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:52:53.480 --> 03:52:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:52:54.480 --> 03:52:55.480
[Amit Varma]: So all of that.

03:52:55.480 --> 03:53:00.120
[Amit Varma]: In your book, you've also thrown the provocative question that does the CEO have to be a polymath?

03:53:00.120 --> 03:53:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Something to that effect, which ties in with what you're saying, that the function of a

03:53:03.680 --> 03:53:07.760
[Amit Varma]: CEO has changed because the nature of the company has changed.

03:53:07.760 --> 03:53:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, one of the anecdotes that I recall from one of the talks you gave, which was really

03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:17.360
[Amit Varma]: interesting to me, was where you speak about this company, which made these instructional

03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:22.560
[Amit Varma]: videos for their employees, and then obviously, they can see when the videos have been opened.

03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And they sort of the videos are mostly being watched at times like 2am and all.

03:53:26.840 --> 03:53:30.280
[Amit Varma]: And this is very counterintuitive, because typically, you'd assume the training material,

03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:32.600
[Amit Varma]: they'll watch it in work hours and all that.

03:53:32.600 --> 03:53:34.080
[Amit Varma]: But it is not the case.

03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And this particular insight doesn't matter to me.

03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:41.300
[Amit Varma]: But what matters to me is that I value these kinds of counterintuitive insights wherever

03:53:41.300 --> 03:53:45.120
[Amit Varma]: they come from, because they give you insight into, you know, your employees, your readers,

03:53:45.120 --> 03:53:49.240
[Amit Varma]: your listeners, who, whatever the kind of case might be.

03:53:49.240 --> 03:53:55.040
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it really comes from machine learning, like, you know, you've spoken about

03:53:55.040 --> 03:54:00.080
[Amit Varma]: how machines are really good on three different margins that if the work is rule based machines

03:54:00.080 --> 03:54:01.080
[Amit Varma]: are great.

03:54:01.080 --> 03:54:05.480
[Amit Varma]: If the work is repetitive, machines are great for scale, machines are great.

03:54:05.480 --> 03:54:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'd go a little further.

03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'd say that when you when you look at the current state of machine learning, that

03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:18.520
[Amit Varma]: machines are actually capable of sitting back and coming up with counterintuitive insights

03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:22.760
[Amit Varma]: you wouldn't otherwise have considered like, the example I use for this is alpha zero and

03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:23.760
[Amit Varma]: chess.

03:54:23.760 --> 03:54:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Right?

03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, chess was dominated by computers for, you know, since 2003, they've been so far

03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:30.920
[Amit Varma]: ahead that it's not even close.

03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And humans really use computers for pedagogy, and for and you know, as a tool for learning

03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:41.840
[Amit Varma]: and your main program, there was something called Stockfish.

03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And alpha zero came and it took a very different approach.

03:54:44.400 --> 03:54:49.560
[Amit Varma]: It said we won't try for, you know, to solve the maximum number of, you know, calculations

03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:53.560
[Amit Varma]: we can we won't aim for scale or rule based or whatever.

03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:57.760
[Amit Varma]: The only mandate it was given was to play with itself and learn from that and form rules

03:54:57.760 --> 03:55:03.040
[Amit Varma]: according to that sort of teach itself how to think meta and build a framework.

03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And it did that for about a day.

03:55:05.080 --> 03:55:08.840
[Amit Varma]: And then it met Stockfish, which was until until then the strongest computer in the world

03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:10.400
[Amit Varma]: and destroyed Stockfish.

03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And the games are fascinating.

03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:16.880
[Amit Varma]: And what we also have is a sort of a record of how it taught itself.

03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:20.840
[Amit Varma]: And that record is incredible, because in that record, you see it try out every opening

03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:25.440
[Amit Varma]: humans have tried out, and is going through a similar kind of process, that there is a

03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:30.160
[Amit Varma]: period of time when it is playing the French defense a lot, and then it drops it completely.

03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:34.480
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually it evolves to the point where it is playing the Berlin defense a lot,

03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:38.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, and which is currently very popular among grandmasters as well.

03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:42.840
[Amit Varma]: But the key thing there is that when humans looked at chess, because it is so incredibly

03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:48.800
[Amit Varma]: complex, they built these heuristics, which were really good as first principles as ground

03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:54.200
[Amit Varma]: rules, for example, occupy the center, or initiative is important, and so on and so

03:55:54.200 --> 03:55:55.400
[Amit Varma]: forth.

03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And what AlphaZero demonstrated is that the weightages between these is different from

03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:07.400
[Amit Varma]: what we understand that the relationship between say initiative and material may be different

03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:12.160
[Amit Varma]: and that maybe initiative is, you know, more important than we thought it was and so on

03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:13.160
[Unknown]: and so forth.

03:56:13.160 --> 03:56:19.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, Magnus Carlsen's coach Peter Hein Nelson once said that I sometimes used to

03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:23.600
[Amit Varma]: think that if an alien from another planet, which is just a superior species in terms

03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:27.480
[Amit Varma]: of brain power, if they come and they play, how will they play?

03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And I found my answer when I saw AlphaZero play.

03:56:29.800 --> 03:56:36.800
[Amit Varma]: The point being that machine learning doesn't just sort of excel in all these specialized

03:56:36.800 --> 03:56:39.920
[Amit Varma]: tasks like you know, calculate numbers really well and so on.

03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:45.520
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't just specialized in these specialized tasks, but more and more what we see is that

03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:51.200
[Amit Varma]: they are going beyond that and taking over many other functions, higher level functions,

03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:53.720
[Amit Varma]: than we would have thought in the future.

03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:58.200
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your broad thoughts on this?

03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:01.440
[Amit Varma]: Because you've spoken a lot about this, you've written about this.

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:07.960
[Amit Varma]: What are sort of your thoughts on how the modern workplace will change because of machines?

03:57:07.960 --> 03:57:12.440
[Amit Varma]: And what is the role that humans can still play and the areas where they are still important?

03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:16.140
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what are the areas in which they will develop their skills?

03:57:16.140 --> 03:57:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Because then the education for this next generation needs to be completely different from what

03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:23.000
[Amit Varma]: it was for the previous generation.

03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Because a lot of the things we have to learn now will just simply be done by machines so

03:57:26.720 --> 03:57:30.800
[Amit Varma]: much better that we need to skip a level up.

03:57:30.800 --> 03:57:37.240
[Guest]: So you know, when you look at machines, and if you just sort of see that, where is the

03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:42.440
[Guest]: direction where machine learning and you know, this thing is moving, one of the principles

03:57:42.440 --> 03:57:48.360
[Guest]: that's happening is that it sort of has worked on this rule based repetitive and scale kind

03:57:48.360 --> 03:57:49.360
[Guest]: of a problem.

03:57:49.360 --> 03:57:52.340
[Guest]: That's one end of the system.

03:57:52.340 --> 03:57:57.200
[Guest]: The other end of the system is general intelligence, which is, you know, if you look at the other

03:57:57.200 --> 03:58:02.200
[Guest]: end, you kind of see that, if you want to teach a machine how to recognize pictures

03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:10.120
[Guest]: of a dog, then you not only have to, you know, show a particular dog, but you have to show

03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:13.440
[Guest]: the same dog from multiple angles, you have to show a puppy, then you have to show an

03:58:13.440 --> 03:58:18.020
[Guest]: older dog, then you have to show hundreds of breeds of dogs.

03:58:18.020 --> 03:58:25.800
[Guest]: But the human baby who sees a dog one time, you know, can instantly recognize another

03:58:25.800 --> 03:58:32.640
[Guest]: dog from a completely different species, and not think that, oh, that's like a table.

03:58:32.640 --> 03:58:35.560
[Guest]: But for a computer, you would have to instruct it.

03:58:35.560 --> 03:58:42.120
[Guest]: So the instructional process for creating that is, you know, as much as you are able

03:58:42.120 --> 03:58:48.000
[Guest]: to feed it, which is so the problem of that system is, if the database that you are feeding

03:58:48.000 --> 03:58:53.440
[Guest]: it from is not representative of the real world, you find, you know, bias creeping in

03:58:53.440 --> 03:58:59.560
[Guest]: and all of this happening, which is a massive problem that, you know, machines have to solve

03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:01.080
[Guest]: in the first instance.

03:59:01.080 --> 03:59:08.760
[Guest]: So for example, the moment I, you know, watch, you know, five Polish language films, Netflix

03:59:08.760 --> 03:59:13.880
[Guest]: will suddenly say that, oh, okay, so then you need to be shown only Polish language

03:59:13.880 --> 03:59:14.880
[Guest]: movies.

03:59:14.880 --> 03:59:18.580
[Guest]: Human beings are far more complicated than that.

03:59:18.580 --> 03:59:24.800
[Guest]: So I think one of the principles that we will sort of really look at is, you will start

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:30.920
[Guest]: with algorithms, but you have to burst your own algorithm, because what makes us human

03:59:30.920 --> 03:59:33.480
[Guest]: is our ability to burst the algorithm.

03:59:33.480 --> 03:59:38.680
[Guest]: That you, you know, like one kind of cuisine, but you also like something else.

03:59:38.680 --> 03:59:43.920
[Guest]: You eat non-vegetarian food, but in India, you know, non-veg has many shades.

03:59:43.920 --> 03:59:49.400
[Guest]: There are eight kinds of vegetarians and non-vegetarians we sort of look at it, you know.

03:59:49.400 --> 03:59:51.440
[Guest]: Some don't eat non-veg at home.

03:59:51.440 --> 03:59:53.200
[Guest]: Some don't eat it outside.

03:59:53.200 --> 04:00:00.160
[Guest]: Some will not have the sauce or the gravy, but not the meat, like all kinds of variations.

04:00:00.160 --> 04:00:07.960
[Guest]: This nuanced view comes from your exposure to different people.

04:00:07.960 --> 04:00:15.880
[Guest]: So the role of human beings will all come from generating insights from other people.

04:00:15.880 --> 04:00:20.520
[Guest]: And those are the kind of connections which a human being can make in an amazing kind

04:00:20.520 --> 04:00:26.360
[Guest]: of way, which machines will have to be taught, but that's a while away.

04:00:26.360 --> 04:00:32.120
[Guest]: So if you look at the next, I don't know, five, seven years for sure, the nature of

04:00:32.120 --> 04:00:36.360
[Guest]: where the opportunities will be, will be in the human side of it.

04:00:36.360 --> 04:00:42.320
[Guest]: It's not good, for example, you may be really brilliant at math, you know, so unless you

04:00:42.320 --> 04:00:50.320
[Guest]: are Shakuntala Devi, there is no way you can answer the question, you know, 19.7859 into

04:00:50.320 --> 04:00:53.440
[Guest]: 75.863.

04:00:53.440 --> 04:00:56.280
[Guest]: You will take a long time, even if you are really good at it.

04:00:56.280 --> 04:00:58.640
[Guest]: A calculator can do it quickly.

04:00:58.640 --> 04:01:05.000
[Guest]: And now you have a time when you will ask, but why would you need to know this, right?

04:01:05.000 --> 04:01:12.000
[Guest]: So I think the notion of information and knowledge and learning and all of this has to change

04:01:12.000 --> 04:01:15.160
[Guest]: depending on what technology makes it possible.

04:01:15.160 --> 04:01:19.360
[Guest]: You may have terrible handwriting, but it'll all get standardized and put in the form of

04:01:19.360 --> 04:01:23.920
[Guest]: a font on the computer, which hopefully if somebody designs it really beautifully, you

04:01:23.920 --> 04:01:25.520
[Guest]: will have great handwriting.

04:01:25.520 --> 04:01:30.880
[Guest]: And now you can choose the kind of fonts from your handwriting fonts to, you know, like

04:01:30.880 --> 04:01:36.160
[Guest]: a movie or this, you can do all of that.

04:01:36.160 --> 04:01:43.200
[Guest]: Yet at the same time, you will find that people who can write with that beautiful calligraphy

04:01:43.200 --> 04:01:48.240
[Guest]: will still get millions of views on Insta, you know, because you're fascinated by the

04:01:48.240 --> 04:01:52.040
[Guest]: fact that, oh my God, I mean, how can this guy write so beautifully?

04:01:52.040 --> 04:01:53.480
[Guest]: What is that all about?

04:01:53.480 --> 04:02:00.080
[Guest]: So I think those are some of the pieces that we will be sort of going towards.

04:02:00.080 --> 04:02:04.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm actually optimistic and I say optimistic, it might seem I'm on the side of the machines,

04:02:04.540 --> 04:02:05.880
[Amit Varma]: but there's no dichotomy.

04:02:05.880 --> 04:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: But I'm optimistic that, you know, that all of this progress, one, I think it's inevitable

04:02:10.560 --> 04:02:16.880
[Amit Varma]: and two, I think it'll come faster than we even realize it, even something like AGI artificial

04:02:16.880 --> 04:02:19.960
[Amit Varma]: general intelligence.

04:02:19.960 --> 04:02:23.680
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of broad questions, because you've been incredibly patient, and you've spent

04:02:23.680 --> 04:02:24.680
[Amit Varma]: a lot of time with me.

04:02:24.680 --> 04:02:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And maybe tomorrow, who knows in the future, you could have bots designed.

04:02:28.440 --> 04:02:32.160
[Amit Varma]: So there'll be a bot that talks like me and a bot that talks and things like you and we

04:02:32.160 --> 04:02:33.160
[Amit Varma]: don't have to do anything.

04:02:33.160 --> 04:02:37.360
[Amit Varma]: We can chill at home and look at the star and try to read Urdu in the sky.

04:02:37.360 --> 04:02:39.520
[Amit Varma]: But while our bots kind of do everything.

04:02:39.520 --> 04:02:44.680
[Amit Varma]: So my penultimate question is that, if you're a young person listening to this, right, and

04:02:44.680 --> 04:02:49.840
[Amit Varma]: you're thinking, okay, in this changing world, in the scary world, where, you know, the workplace

04:02:49.840 --> 04:02:54.560
[Amit Varma]: is shifting rapidly, paradigms are shifting, new technology is coming up, everything is

04:02:54.560 --> 04:02:59.920
[Amit Varma]: full of unknown unknowns, what are the sort of qualities that I need or what should I

04:02:59.920 --> 04:03:03.040
[Amit Varma]: focus on to get ahead and prosper?

04:03:03.040 --> 04:03:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And my very brief answer to this would simply be and you've described it as learnability.

04:03:09.720 --> 04:03:14.600
[Amit Varma]: But I'll think of it as attitude that if you have intellectual humility, you're willing

04:03:14.600 --> 04:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: to learn, you're willing to work hard.

04:03:17.200 --> 04:03:22.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a core thing, you definitely need that what else you build on top of that is different.

04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:23.000
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts?

04:03:23.000 --> 04:03:30.280
[Guest]: Yeah, it's, you know, learning actually has two, again, opposing elements.

04:03:30.280 --> 04:03:37.640
[Guest]: One is you need the humility to say, I don't know, because if I pretend that I know it

04:03:37.640 --> 04:03:42.680
[Guest]: all, then you know, this is one of the shifts that happens, that you need humility.

04:03:42.680 --> 04:03:46.200
[Guest]: But at the same time, you need courage to try it out, you know.

04:03:46.200 --> 04:03:50.280
[Guest]: So even when you're wobbling, if you're so self conscious that no, no, I will emerge

04:03:50.280 --> 04:03:55.120
[Guest]: only when I'm perfect, then by which time things will change and you will not be there.

04:03:55.120 --> 04:04:02.400
[Guest]: So I think it is managing this polar opposite ends, humility to say, I don't know, and I

04:04:02.400 --> 04:04:06.720
[Guest]: will learn from whoever it may be somebody who is much younger than me.

04:04:06.720 --> 04:04:09.320
[Guest]: And the person is going to say, I'm amazed you don't know this.

04:04:09.320 --> 04:04:12.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I will, you know, live with that.

04:04:12.120 --> 04:04:13.120
[Guest]: But then so what?

04:04:13.120 --> 04:04:16.000
[Guest]: I mean, there are millions of that's not the only thing I don't know.

04:04:16.000 --> 04:04:19.320
[Guest]: There are millions of other things I have no idea about.

04:04:19.320 --> 04:04:23.640
[Guest]: Once you get comfortable with this, then I think, you know, it allows your curiosity

04:04:23.640 --> 04:04:24.640
[Guest]: to be free.

04:04:24.640 --> 04:04:29.960
[Guest]: Being being able to, you know, stay curious means that you're open to learning things

04:04:29.960 --> 04:04:31.320
[Guest]: which you didn't know.

04:04:31.320 --> 04:04:37.760
[Guest]: Two, I think when you look at learnability, it's also about not necessarily learning only

04:04:37.760 --> 04:04:42.160
[Guest]: something that you can put into practice right now, this instant, you know, it's something

04:04:42.160 --> 04:04:47.560
[Guest]: that becomes part of your DNA, and you kind of know how to do this.

04:04:47.560 --> 04:04:54.640
[Guest]: It's the other way in which because, you know, when I did radio programs, for a long time,

04:04:54.640 --> 04:05:02.880
[Guest]: I did shows and when I was growing up in All India Radio and Yobavani or Delhi B, subsequent

04:05:02.880 --> 04:05:09.120
[Guest]: to that I when I went and worked, you know, in other places, I maintained my love for

04:05:09.120 --> 04:05:15.480
[Guest]: that, that this is something that I want to be able to I used to really enjoy editing

04:05:15.480 --> 04:05:20.600
[Guest]: those old spools and tapes and, you know, creating all those things.

04:05:20.600 --> 04:05:24.800
[Guest]: When I went across when I was living and working in US by which time technology had changed

04:05:24.800 --> 04:05:33.880
[Guest]: drastically, I learned how to edit and create, you know, little shows which I could do.

04:05:33.880 --> 04:05:38.920
[Guest]: And I got a chance to go and become part of a radio station in US and I used to do a show

04:05:38.920 --> 04:05:44.560
[Guest]: called movie magic, which I where I would talk about retro Bollywood and talk about

04:05:44.560 --> 04:05:47.360
[Guest]: some movie and play some songs and all that stuff.

04:05:47.360 --> 04:05:50.360
[Guest]: So this is what I did.

04:05:50.360 --> 04:05:56.040
[Guest]: Now when I look back and connect the dots, that prepared me for the world of podcasts.

04:05:56.040 --> 04:06:01.280
[Guest]: So then when podcasts came in, you know, this was a world I was, you know, fairly familiar

04:06:01.280 --> 04:06:06.320
[Guest]: with because I had done radio, and I had done this tape mixing and I had done all all of

04:06:06.320 --> 04:06:07.320
[Guest]: this stuff.

04:06:07.320 --> 04:06:12.040
[Guest]: It was easy for me to sort of pick up and technology only makes it easier, you know,

04:06:12.040 --> 04:06:18.120
[Guest]: but you have to have the desire to want to do this, you know, so today every other recipe

04:06:18.120 --> 04:06:19.120
[Guest]: is available.

04:06:19.120 --> 04:06:24.400
[Guest]: You can learn from, you know, the masters of, you know, you can learn how to chop an

04:06:24.400 --> 04:06:29.240
[Guest]: onion from Gordon Ramsay, he actually has a video with 7 million views on how to chop

04:06:29.240 --> 04:06:30.240
[Guest]: the onion.

04:06:30.240 --> 04:06:36.560
[Guest]: Now, those are things you have to understand that if you are not curious, you will not

04:06:36.560 --> 04:06:37.660
[Guest]: try it out.

04:06:37.660 --> 04:06:38.760
[Guest]: So that's one part of it.

04:06:38.760 --> 04:06:43.160
[Guest]: The second part of it is, I also think that there is one piece nobody talks about, which

04:06:43.160 --> 04:06:47.640
[Guest]: is being comfortable creating content in different media formats.

04:06:47.640 --> 04:06:51.320
[Guest]: You know, I think it's a very, very useful skill.

04:06:51.320 --> 04:06:56.800
[Guest]: The fact that you can do something like this, you can create a podcast, and tell a story

04:06:56.800 --> 04:07:00.080
[Guest]: and hold the attention of people for a while.

04:07:00.080 --> 04:07:04.800
[Guest]: That's a precious skill to have, you know, and there are people who do it through movies,

04:07:04.800 --> 04:07:09.680
[Guest]: there are people who do it through, you know, photos, paintings, whatever.

04:07:09.680 --> 04:07:17.640
[Guest]: So I think being able to engage people in a short duration of time and a long format

04:07:17.640 --> 04:07:19.580
[Guest]: is a precious skill.

04:07:19.580 --> 04:07:25.660
[Guest]: So those are some of the things that I think are going to be important in future.

04:07:25.660 --> 04:07:29.400
[Guest]: So besides, of course, what a lot of people have said that, you know, you are curious

04:07:29.400 --> 04:07:36.840
[Guest]: about other disciplines, you take a multidisciplinary point of view, you learn about many things,

04:07:36.840 --> 04:07:42.720
[Guest]: you try out many things, and even when you are not good at it, you stay at it.

04:07:42.720 --> 04:07:47.240
[Guest]: So resilience as a, you know, as a human skill.

04:07:47.240 --> 04:07:51.560
[Guest]: And of course, finally, this whole new media that has emerged has changed the world so

04:07:51.560 --> 04:07:52.560
[Guest]: drastically.

04:07:52.560 --> 04:07:57.400
[Guest]: So putting all of that together is going to be, you know, very important for the future.

04:07:57.400 --> 04:08:00.520
[Guest]: So that's my view of what I would focus on.

04:08:00.520 --> 04:08:05.520
[Guest]: And perhaps the way that we communicate will become more and more critical and important.

04:08:05.520 --> 04:08:09.960
[Guest]: So that's, to me, the way the world will shape up and evolve.

04:08:09.960 --> 04:08:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Lovely.

04:08:10.960 --> 04:08:12.760
[Amit Varma]: I feel like we have tons to talk about.

04:08:12.760 --> 04:08:17.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if we just barely started, it's horrible this, you can't achieve much in a four-hour

04:08:17.200 --> 04:08:18.200
[Guest]: conversation.

04:08:18.200 --> 04:08:19.200
[Guest]: No, no, no.

04:08:19.200 --> 04:08:20.200
[Guest]: Clearly.

04:08:20.200 --> 04:08:21.200
[Guest]: Because I'm used to 24-hour conversations.

04:08:21.200 --> 04:08:22.200
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

04:08:22.200 --> 04:08:26.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, yeah, I thought it's a long episode.

04:08:26.600 --> 04:08:28.040
[Amit Varma]: I hope Abhijit can manage it.

04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:29.040
[Guest]: But you are used to trains.

04:08:29.040 --> 04:08:30.040
[Guest]: That is why it is called a suffer.

04:08:30.040 --> 04:08:31.040
[Guest]: People suffer together.

04:08:31.040 --> 04:08:32.040
[Guest]: Listeners suffer together.

04:08:32.040 --> 04:08:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Sir, you, I mean, what can I say, you gave such a pun that, you know, people of my vintage

04:08:40.920 --> 04:08:42.840
[Guest]: get these kinds of puns, right?

04:08:42.840 --> 04:08:46.040
[Guest]: It's not necessary to be Punjabi.

04:08:46.040 --> 04:08:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

04:08:47.040 --> 04:08:52.200
[Amit Varma]: So my sort of final question for you, therefore, is, and I'll obviously recommend that readers

04:08:52.200 --> 04:08:55.960
[Amit Varma]: read all your books, Dreamers and Unicorns was great, made me think about a lot of things

04:08:55.960 --> 04:08:58.000
[Amit Varma]: which I'll continue processing in the days to come.

04:08:58.000 --> 04:09:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So everyone should absolutely buy that.

04:09:00.480 --> 04:09:05.680
[Amit Varma]: But where I'll sort of end by is my traditional question to my guests at the end, that can

04:09:05.680 --> 04:09:12.080
[Amit Varma]: you recommend some books, music, movies, anything for my listeners, things that are dear to

04:09:12.080 --> 04:09:13.080
[Amit Varma]: you?

04:09:13.080 --> 04:09:17.200
[Amit Varma]: Like either things that you feel that, you know, you've got an aha moment from it, or

04:09:17.200 --> 04:09:21.600
[Amit Varma]: just things that are dear to you that you want to share with the world?

04:09:21.600 --> 04:09:23.120
[Guest]: This is a really tough one.

04:09:23.120 --> 04:09:30.640
[Guest]: I think I just, when it comes to books, I have really enjoyed, you know, two people

04:09:30.640 --> 04:09:38.320
[Guest]: who influenced me hugely were Satyajit Ray, you know, his body of work.

04:09:38.320 --> 04:09:42.480
[Guest]: And by that, I don't necessarily mean only his movies, which a number of people may have

04:09:42.480 --> 04:09:44.280
[Guest]: seen.

04:09:44.280 --> 04:09:49.320
[Guest]: But if you sort of look at the way he composed music for many of these, you know, he's worked

04:09:49.320 --> 04:09:55.480
[Guest]: with Ali Akbar Khan Sahib and Ravi Shankar Sahib, you know, and he's also gone on to

04:09:55.480 --> 04:09:57.800
[Guest]: compose his own things.

04:09:57.800 --> 04:10:02.400
[Guest]: Really understood Western classical music as much as folk music and, you know, created

04:10:02.400 --> 04:10:05.360
[Guest]: his own format, very unique sound.

04:10:05.360 --> 04:10:08.800
[Guest]: He created the background score, incredible.

04:10:08.800 --> 04:10:11.400
[Guest]: And then he's got his drawings, which I'm a big fan of.

04:10:11.400 --> 04:10:19.400
[Guest]: And so, you know, so that's something that I really recommend, that it's really enriched

04:10:19.400 --> 04:10:22.840
[Guest]: to have read Ray at different points of time in my life.

04:10:22.840 --> 04:10:30.920
[Guest]: I in fact wrote, you know, about Ray in a book about Feluda when he turned 50, Boriya

04:10:30.920 --> 04:10:33.400
[Guest]: Majumdar brought out a compilation.

04:10:33.400 --> 04:10:45.320
[Guest]: So I got a kind of a worldview and translated Feluda for the benefit of Boriya's readers.

04:10:45.320 --> 04:10:47.560
[Guest]: That to me was great fun.

04:10:47.560 --> 04:10:52.520
[Guest]: Reading literature in general, whatever language and things, if you can read it in multiple

04:10:52.520 --> 04:11:01.480
[Guest]: languages, we've had such a rich variety of writers, you know, from poetry to prose.

04:11:01.480 --> 04:11:02.480
[Guest]: So many of them.

04:11:02.480 --> 04:11:07.200
[Guest]: You know, I think India's had a very, very rich tradition of storytelling.

04:11:07.200 --> 04:11:09.680
[Guest]: So you know, reading any of those people.

04:11:09.680 --> 04:11:18.160
[Guest]: So in Hindi, I mean, you know, Premchand was somebody I read a lot of, and I was very,

04:11:18.160 --> 04:11:21.880
[Guest]: very impressed with that.

04:11:21.880 --> 04:11:28.040
[Guest]: I read a number of people, you know, articles and all of, you know, many of these writers

04:11:28.040 --> 04:11:33.040
[Guest]: in Dharmyukh, Saptahik, Hindustan, they used to carry a lot of literary pieces in those

04:11:33.040 --> 04:11:34.280
[Guest]: days.

04:11:34.280 --> 04:11:40.280
[Guest]: So those are pieces that I think when you read long form, you kind of begin to develop

04:11:40.280 --> 04:11:45.080
[Guest]: a different taste and flavor and you get a chance to explore different worlds.

04:11:45.080 --> 04:11:49.840
[Guest]: It's really like if you see only an Instagram photograph of my room, you will not know what

04:11:49.840 --> 04:11:56.840
[Guest]: I, you know, am like, what is my home like, but it's only when you come in, spend time,

04:11:56.840 --> 04:11:58.040
[Guest]: you will sort of discover that.

04:11:58.040 --> 04:12:02.680
[Guest]: So that's, these books are available in translations.

04:12:02.680 --> 04:12:07.200
[Guest]: So you know, Arunabh Sinha has done a phenomenal job of translating so many of these.

04:12:07.200 --> 04:12:10.720
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Sunil Gangopadhyay, like you mentioned, Narayan Nidhidin Rathri, I think he did that

04:12:10.720 --> 04:12:11.720
[Guest]: translation.

04:12:11.720 --> 04:12:12.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

04:12:12.720 --> 04:12:13.720
[Guest]: Or Nidhidin Rathri.

04:12:13.720 --> 04:12:17.920
[Guest]: And, you know, so many of these things are available today for everyone.

04:12:17.920 --> 04:12:20.960
[Guest]: And you might say, you know, translation loses the essence.

04:12:20.960 --> 04:12:22.480
[Guest]: Yeah, it's okay.

04:12:22.480 --> 04:12:27.000
[Guest]: But at least you're reading, you know, 95% of it is right there.

04:12:27.000 --> 04:12:32.640
[Guest]: And I think, you know, so that's quite a myth, because it's a different, you know, book.

04:12:32.640 --> 04:12:35.840
[Guest]: When you see the book in a movie format, it's different.

04:12:35.840 --> 04:12:39.840
[Guest]: When I read Harry Potter, you know, it was very different from when I saw Harry Potter

04:12:39.840 --> 04:12:40.840
[Guest]: on screen.

04:12:40.840 --> 04:12:45.600
[Guest]: And I said, accha, Harry Potter looks like this, okay, so be it.

04:12:45.600 --> 04:12:48.000
[Guest]: It's somebody else's interpretation.

04:12:48.000 --> 04:12:50.520
[Guest]: So I think it's all of that.

04:12:50.520 --> 04:12:55.600
[Guest]: I kind of, I really read indiscriminately.

04:12:55.600 --> 04:13:00.200
[Guest]: So I don't really have a great one or two set of readers.

04:13:00.200 --> 04:13:05.680
[Guest]: But I've enjoyed listening to so many of your guests and the work that when you put those,

04:13:05.680 --> 04:13:09.320
[Guest]: I get a chance to go and read some of those things.

04:13:09.320 --> 04:13:13.360
[Guest]: And that has enriched, you know, whether it is Peggy Mohan's book, which I really enjoyed,

04:13:13.360 --> 04:13:19.400
[Guest]: incredible book, or, you know, Manu Pillai, who, you know, opened up a world which I was

04:13:19.400 --> 04:13:23.960
[Guest]: not familiar with, you know, all the history of the kings of the south and the southern

04:13:23.960 --> 04:13:24.960
[Guest]: states and all that.

04:13:24.960 --> 04:13:27.200
[Guest]: I mean, just so fascinating.

04:13:27.200 --> 04:13:33.680
[Guest]: So just reading a whole range of things, spending time doing that is one way in which I think

04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:36.040
[Guest]: I kind of do that.

04:13:36.040 --> 04:13:42.280
[Guest]: As far as music is concerned, you know, I just, I'm a big fan of Indian classical music.

04:13:42.280 --> 04:13:46.920
[Guest]: And if that sounds really daunting, then I think, you know, there's got so many formats,

04:13:46.920 --> 04:13:54.040
[Guest]: Thumri, Dadra, Khajuri, Chaiti, Ghazal, you know, there's like a whole range of things.

04:13:54.040 --> 04:14:00.200
[Guest]: So just enjoying the flavor of it and everything that you read or listen to, you don't have

04:14:00.200 --> 04:14:03.680
[Guest]: to be able to understand as long as you appreciate whatever is there.

04:14:03.680 --> 04:14:07.640
[Guest]: You know, there are many forms of music I don't quite understand, you know, because

04:14:07.640 --> 04:14:10.800
[Guest]: one just hasn't heard it enough.

04:14:10.800 --> 04:14:16.800
[Guest]: So I think as you listen to it enough, you develop a taste for it, which is how I learned

04:14:16.800 --> 04:14:21.000
[Guest]: how to appreciate Indian classical music.

04:14:21.000 --> 04:14:26.000
[Guest]: And every time there's a piece like, for example, you know, rap, I could initially never relate

04:14:26.000 --> 04:14:27.000
[Guest]: to rap.

04:14:27.000 --> 04:14:28.600
[Guest]: And I always had one complaint.

04:14:28.600 --> 04:14:33.520
[Guest]: If you can't put it and you can't play it on a musical instrument, it's not music.

04:14:33.520 --> 04:14:38.440
[Guest]: But now when you sort of look at it, and I say, why should I kind of look at that?

04:14:38.440 --> 04:14:40.560
[Guest]: It could be a new form is evolving.

04:14:40.560 --> 04:14:43.160
[Guest]: And why am I being rigid about the whole thing?

04:14:43.160 --> 04:14:47.920
[Guest]: So I think just being open to trying out many different things.

04:14:47.920 --> 04:14:53.700
[Guest]: The other day, somebody forwarded Mongolian rock video, and I was quite taken up by that.

04:14:53.700 --> 04:15:00.840
[Guest]: So I think as you open, if you don't break the algorithm, you tend to have a world which

04:15:00.840 --> 04:15:04.760
[Guest]: is very boring, because it becomes predictable.

04:15:04.760 --> 04:15:10.720
[Guest]: And I think the real challenge is to read people in different languages, try translations,

04:15:10.720 --> 04:15:13.820
[Guest]: short form, long form poetry.

04:15:13.820 --> 04:15:19.000
[Guest]: And if you don't like something, don't give up too easily.

04:15:19.000 --> 04:15:23.160
[Guest]: If you persist, then there comes a point of time when you can cycle be when you started

04:15:23.160 --> 04:15:25.280
[Guest]: to ride the cycle.

04:15:25.280 --> 04:15:27.680
[Guest]: In the initial days, you were wobbling.

04:15:27.680 --> 04:15:32.000
[Guest]: And that was a sign that you are going to build up the superpower that okay, now I am

04:15:32.000 --> 04:15:35.260
[Guest]: able to balance on two wheels and go anywhere.

04:15:35.260 --> 04:15:39.840
[Guest]: So that it's only when you get past that wobbling that you are able to, you know, take it on.

04:15:39.840 --> 04:15:43.880
[Guest]: So I would just look at today there is abundance.

04:15:43.880 --> 04:15:48.920
[Guest]: Listen to the writers talk about their books, listen to if you can't read, watch them on

04:15:48.920 --> 04:15:54.040
[Guest]: YouTube, you know, listen to them on Spotify, they give talks, there are podcasts.

04:15:54.040 --> 04:15:59.880
[Guest]: So we are in a world where there's abundance of content.

04:15:59.880 --> 04:16:03.960
[Guest]: So just changing different formats, and you suddenly might discover you enjoy listening

04:16:03.960 --> 04:16:08.880
[Guest]: to, you know, podcasts more than something else.

04:16:08.880 --> 04:16:12.640
[Guest]: And so then you sort of go with that.

04:16:12.640 --> 04:16:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Wise words and while you were speaking, I got the title for our episode, Abhijit Bhaduri

04:16:17.360 --> 04:16:21.240
[Amit Varma]: breaks the algorithm, which kind of sums up, you know, and it's great advice to young people

04:16:21.240 --> 04:16:22.760
[Amit Varma]: also break the algorithm.

04:16:22.760 --> 04:16:27.360
[Amit Varma]: So boss, thank you so much for your generosity of being so patient, sharing your insights.

04:16:27.360 --> 04:16:29.680
