00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.560
[Amit Varma]: literature do a fantastic job of illuminating and illustrating the human condition.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.080
[Amit Varma]: So who needs philosophy?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.920
[Amit Varma]: And hey, is that itself a philosophical question?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: If so, do we need to answer it?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.600
[Unknown]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.320
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.960
[Amit Varma]: The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once said that all of Western philosophy was nothing

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.440
[Amit Varma]: more than a series of footnotes to Plato.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.120
[Amit Varma]: From this, you can gather two things.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.040
[Amit Varma]: One, unlike other fields, philosophy does not seem to have made that much progress in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.320
[Amit Varma]: the last 2000 years.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I would argue, though, that this is not quite true.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.640
[Amit Varma]: The second thing that quotation tells you is that Plato was a rock star.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, while reading Rebecca Goldstein's superb book, Plato at the Googleplex, Why

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Philosophy Won't Go Away, I was struck by what a foundational thinker Plato really was.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.320
[Amit Varma]: He asked many big questions that still drive philosophical inquiry today, and he anticipated

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
[Amit Varma]: insights that were given proper shape many centuries later.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
[Amit Varma]: For example, we think of the social contract as a concept that was formulated during the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Enlightenment.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.460
[Amit Varma]: And the field of game theory is something that came about in the 20th century.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.440
[Amit Varma]: So my eyes almost popped out of my head when I read a dialogue of Plato in which Glaucon,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.200
[Amit Varma]: elder brother of Plato and a minor character in this dialogue, describes what is basically

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: a game theoretic argument for a social contract.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And Plato's dialogues, as I discovered in Goldstein's excellent book, are full of such

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: seemingly modern arguments and insights.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.920
[Amit Varma]: Plato at the Googleplex is a book that really has two intersecting parts.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.880
[Amit Varma]: Half the book is a series of illuminating essays on Plato, his times, his philosophy,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.320
[Amit Varma]: the impact of his work.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.500
[Amit Varma]: The other half is a series of fictionalized dialogues of Plato set in current times and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: modern venues like the Googleplex, and these are quite witty and entertaining.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Besides introducing us to Plato, the book really makes an argument that philosophy is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.560
[Amit Varma]: not an arcane academic discipline, but that it actually matters in this modern world,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.400
[Amit Varma]: in these crazy times that we live in.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.920
[Amit Varma]: I spoke to Goldstein in December 2018 when she was in Mumbai for the Times Lit Fest.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.440
[Amit Varma]: We recorded in a room given to us by the organizers and the venue was quite noisy.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.560
[Amit Varma]: So please do excuse the quality of the recording.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to it though, a quick commercial break.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.760

[Amit Varma]: Rebecca, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.800
[Guest]: It's very, very good to be here with you and to be in conversation with you.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.360
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of intimidating to actually have a dialogue with a woman who's written Plato's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.960
[Amit Varma]: dialogues as you have in your recent book.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.480
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to start by talking about what the philosopher Carl Jaspers calls the axial age,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.400
[Amit Varma]: which is where you point out in your book that between 800 BC to 200 BC, there was a

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.800
[Amit Varma]: sudden explosion of different quests to find answers to the question of what makes a life

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.960
[Amit Varma]: matter.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And it showed up in all the different normative religions, the monotheisms that sprang up

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and in philosophy in Greece.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.640
[Amit Varma]: But my sort of question was why during this particular period was there this sudden quest?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.440
[Guest]: So when I approached this question of why the ancient Greeks had this massive explosion

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.400
[Guest]: of creative ideas, you know, and they're credited with laying down the foundations of Western

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.240
[Guest]: civilization, you know what, it occurred to me that this didn't happen in a vacuum, that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.320
[Guest]: this was happening, you know, in many places on the globe.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.200
[Guest]: And that all of the normative paradigms, you know, meaning the paradigms that people refer

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.840
[Guest]: to when they're trying to give meaning and purpose to their lives, whether it's religious

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.720
[Guest]: or secular, were formulated during this period.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.400
[Guest]: It was actually a philosopher, a German philosopher of the 20th century named Jaspers.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.400
[Guest]: He was the first to notice and to name the Axial Age, that there was this great creative

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.040
[Guest]: normative ferment during this period.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.960
[Guest]: And so the question is, you know, why did it happen then?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.600
[Guest]: And social scientists are just beginning to look at this.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.480
[Guest]: There hasn't been a great deal of attention given to it.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.600
[Guest]: I mean, after all, it was one of those things that was pointed out by philosophers, that

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.440
[Guest]: something amazing was going on during this period.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:18.280
[Guest]: It seems like the most important variable was that, simply, the people were well-fed.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:26.880
[Guest]: Pascal Boyard in France has plotted the caloric intake all over the globe at that time.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.880
[Guest]: And indeed, the countries that participated in what we call the Axial Age, which was India,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.720
[Guest]: in Hinduism and Buddhism and Jainism, were formulated during this period.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.880
[Guest]: China, Confucianism and Daoism were formulated during this period, and Greece, philosophy

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:54.640
[Guest]: and tragic poetry, which was their response to this, to these questions of what it is

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.160
[Guest]: that gives meaning and purpose to our lives.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
[Guest]: These were all, and also the Judean hills, you know, where the Abrahamic approach was

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160
[Guest]: formulated.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.960
[Guest]: Persia, Zoroastrianism, all of these places that participated and forged these frameworks

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.040
[Guest]: that are still extant today, claiming all of us in one way or the other, including someone

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.400
[Guest]: like me, who's a secularist, you know, and so I trace my roots back to ancient Greece.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.520
[Guest]: They were all well-fed.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And what we learn from this is… Because of the shift to agriculture around

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.200
[Guest]: the 1000 BC. Exactly, exactly right.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.000
[Guest]: And so, you know, what we learn from this is, you know, when people don't have to be

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.480
[Guest]: preoccupied 24-7 and seeing another dawn and, you know, just getting enough food in their

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.280
[Guest]: bellies, they start thinking about this question of, you know, here I am and, you know, and

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.040
[Guest]: what is it that I ought to be doing with my life, you know, and so any of these questions

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.320
[Guest]: have that word ought in them, we call normative in philosophy.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:06.040
[Guest]: And it comes very naturally to our species as soon as we're freed from the, you know,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:13.120
[Guest]: the constant trials of simply surviving.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.320
[Guest]: These other features of the… You also pointed out that it correlates with

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.880
[Guest]: urbanization. Exactly.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.800
[Guest]: These were highly organized city-states and they had standing armies, they had coinage,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.520
[Guest]: they had slavery, they had trading, you know, this is so important, right?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.840
[Guest]: So they were mixing with different people, different cultures, different ways of thinking,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.360
[Guest]: which makes us humans think, well, what's the right way of thinking about our lives,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360
[Guest]: right?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.440
[Guest]: Here are these different traditions, different goals, what's the right way?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.600
[Guest]: It comes quite naturally to us.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.120
[Guest]: And also in these cities, there was more anonymity.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.760
[Guest]: I had the great privilege, I don't think I wrote about it in the book because I don't

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.000
[Guest]: think I'd had yet this experience, of visiting one of the last of the hunter-gatherer tribes,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.720
[Guest]: of spending a little time with them in Tanzania, the Hadza.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.520
[Guest]: And it was very interesting.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.400
[Guest]: First of all, they have to really, every day they wake up and they have to fulfill their

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400
[Guest]: caloric needs.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.720
[Guest]: I mean, and it's very difficult.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.760
[Guest]: But one of the things that was very clear is they lived in great intimacy with each

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760
[Guest]: other.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.960
[Guest]: Everybody clearly mattered in that village, right?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.000
[Guest]: It's sort of a, it's a family.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.520
[Guest]: It's how, this is what we have come from, of intimate village life.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.880
[Guest]: And when, in these big city states and there's more anonymity, this question also I think

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
[Guest]: is exacerbated.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.760
[Guest]: Well, you know, who am I?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.700
[Guest]: What can I do to achieve some sense of mattering in the universe?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.400
[Guest]: In the village life, you matter.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.160
[Guest]: You know, it's, everybody has their position.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.120
[Guest]: So all of these things come together.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.240
[Guest]: I don't think it's just a matter of caloric intake.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.000
[Guest]: I think it's more complicated than that, but we see it in all of these places.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.360
[Guest]: There was also a scribe class.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.680
[Guest]: So there was written language in all, you know, there was written.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And there was coinage, like you've pointed out in your book, so.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.960
[Guest]: Yes, there was coinage, exactly.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.600
[Guest]: Which is a way of also increasing the sense of sort of anonymity.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.040
[Guest]: When there's coinage, then there's disparities of wealth, but you know, we all have this

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.480
[Guest]: existential need, even the poor among us, right, of wanting our lives to mean something.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.680
[Guest]: They mean everything to us.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.240
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing about this Axial Age is that most, except one, most of the

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.740
[Amit Varma]: sort of normative traditions that were forming were teleological.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, they were, they had a god at their center or gods or whatever.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.480
[Amit Varma]: And the only exception really was the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480
[Guest]: Yes.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And is it because their gods were very messed up?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640
[Guest]: That's what I think.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:18.000
[Guest]: Their gods were really, I'm thinking of, I mean, they were, they're kind of assholes.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Can I say that?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Unknown]: Yeah, of course.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
[Unknown]: That's what they really were, right.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.760
[Guest]: And it was, it was extremely interesting, you know, we think of the Greeks as, you know,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.760
[Guest]: philosophers.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.680
[Guest]: Of course they weren't philosophers.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.480
[Guest]: They were not a society of philosophers.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.160
[Guest]: There's never been a society of philosophers.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.720
[Guest]: They gave, you know, certain among them were philosophers and they gave birth to this way

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.920
[Guest]: of approaching the normative questions.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.360
[Guest]: But we can never forget that it was the Athenian society, which is the best of the Greek city

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.480
[Guest]: states, right, that put Socrates to death.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.080
[Guest]: I mean, there was a democracy that voted, his fellow citizens voted to put him to death.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.280
[Guest]: So this was not a society of, they regretted it afterwards, right.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.440
[Guest]: But after his death, we find many little statues of Socrates, they regretted it.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.840
[Guest]: But because of certain things that had happened after they lost the Peloponnesian War, their

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:17.520
[Guest]: war with another city state, Sparta, they didn't have tolerance for Socrates with his

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.240
[Guest]: skeptical questions anymore, asking them or demanding that they question their own normative

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.480
[Guest]: values, which were not philosophical, but rather something that I call the ethos of

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:36.040
[Guest]: the extraordinary, that what they had produced was this view that in order to really matter,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:42.080
[Guest]: you have to make a name for yourself so that knowledge of your life will be replicated

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.360
[Guest]: in future generations or in your contemporaries.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.120
[Guest]: And this gives a certain moreness to your life, you know, so fame and glory, what they

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.000
[Guest]: call kleos.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.240
[Guest]: And so that this was, this was their way of pursuing it.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:03.320
[Guest]: Any way that you could be replicated in the minds of others, would make your life worth

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320
[Guest]: living.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.040
[Guest]: And he was attacking that, Socrates.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.880
[Amit Varma]: And I found it very interesting how you point out that because their gods are such assholes,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.520
[Amit Varma]: unlike other peoples elsewhere, you don't want the attention of your god, instead, you

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.000
[Amit Varma]: want to raise your own renown, like kleos, one way of translating, which I found very

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.600
[Amit Varma]: nice, acoustic renown is how you mentioned it's read more people hear of you.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.160
[Amit Varma]: So they aspire to this ethos of the extraordinary, where they want to do extraordinary things

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.960
[Amit Varma]: so that in their own society, they are famous.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Kleos kind of sounds like very Instagram, Twitter, kind of.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.000
[Guest]: And it's interesting because, you know, in some sense, we are post-theistic society,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Guest]: right?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.120
[Guest]: And the more educated we are, the more we don't think of our lives in terms of theism.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:02.080
[Guest]: But what we seem to have gone back to follow the default is the pre philosophical Athenian

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest]: of you, which is to be replicated in the minds of others.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.440
[Guest]: What's extremely interesting, I'm writing about this in my new book, but you know that

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:18.640
[Guest]: we are, we're a species that really looks for attention one way or the other, right?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.400
[Guest]: That this is, and in fact, even the way we've evolved, we can, we have, you know, neuroscientists

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:31.120
[Guest]: have now shown us that we have special areas of the brain, special neurons that are devoted

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.480
[Guest]: to being able to see when people are looking directly at us, those neurons will fire.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.480
[Guest]: If people's eyes are directly on us, a few inches, a few centimeters, either way, other

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480
[Guest]: neurons will fire.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.160
[Guest]: So we have this detection system, right, of when people are paying attention to us.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.520
[Guest]: And I, you know, I've had experience with little babies, my own, and other little babies

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.640
[Guest]: at such an early age, they are making eye contact, extreme eye contact.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.720
[Guest]: We're so dependent, we're a gregarious species, we're very, very dependent on the care of

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.680
[Guest]: others for a very long time, we have a very long childhood and adolescence, it gets longer

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:16.480
[Guest]: and longer, I know 45-year-olds now who are still adolescents, but that's another story.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:25.200
[Guest]: But so this dependence on our own kind makes us very susceptible to attention.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:32.040
[Guest]: So what we see in the Axial Age with these gods that most of, you know, how do we want

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.800
[Guest]: to feel that we matter, it's put in terms of, you know, sort of the gods, but the Greeks

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:45.040
[Guest]: were very special because the way that their stories of their gods develop, you don't want

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.360
[Guest]: too much attention from these gods.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.360
[Guest]: Something bad always happens when a god pays too much attention to you.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.840
[Guest]: So you want to be glorious, but not so glorious so that the gods feel that you're competition.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.920
[Guest]: I think of them because I have older brothers and sisters, you know, that the Greek gods

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.720
[Guest]: are sort of like older brothers and sisters, you know, they want you to emulate them and

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.120
[Guest]: to revere them, but then if you start to surpass them, they're going to slap you back into

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.120
[Guest]: your place very, very quickly.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:21.440
[Guest]: So it's, the Greek gods are something like this, so they develop this kind of, it was

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.440
[Guest]: a highly religious society, saturated with religious rituals, but those were mostly to

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.520
[Guest]: appease the gods, you know, to their apotropaic, that is warding off evil.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.960
[Guest]: You don't, you know, so don't pay too much attention and I'm paying proper respect to

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960
[Guest]: you.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.080
[Guest]: But in terms of what they wanted, the attention that they wanted to make them feel like they

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.840
[Guest]: matter was from fellow citizens and from future generations.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:52.720
[Guest]: So do something big so that the poets will sing of you, which was their social media

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720
[Amit Varma]: of the day, the poets.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And sort of the fascinating turning point, which is also at the heart of your book Plato

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.600
[Amit Varma]: at the Googleplex, is when from kleos we come to the concept of areta.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.320
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:13.200
[Guest]: So areta is, you know, what excellence, our word aristocracy, you know, comes from this

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.800
[Guest]: world, the rule of the excellent.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.120
[Amit Varma]: Benjamin Javid translated it as virtue, but as you pointed out, that doesn't capture

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120
[Amit Varma]: all its favors.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.560
[Guest]: So it originally had meant this, you know, sort of excellence.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:31.040
[Guest]: You could talk about the areta of a knife or of a horse, you know, so it was the excellence

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.000
[Guest]: of this thing in ancient Greek.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.600
[Guest]: And it's really the influence of the philosophers, of Socrates and of Plato, how it comes to

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:54.920
[Guest]: mean virtue rather than any kind of excellence, because part of the attack of the philosophers

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:03.880
[Guest]: on the normative framework of their society, why Socrates was put to death, was that the

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.520
[Guest]: claim is, you know, not just any kind of kleos will do the trick.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:17.160
[Guest]: It has to be areta, it has to be true excellence, and what they argue for is that true excellence

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:25.640
[Guest]: consists in knowledge, wisdom, virtue, justice, courage, you know, the virtues.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.280
[Guest]: So the term undergoes this transformation.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:36.680
[Guest]: And you know, by the time we get to the Gospels, you know, written in Greek, areta simply means,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.760
[Guest]: you know, virtue.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.920
[Guest]: It just means virtue.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.880
[Guest]: This is the transformation that these philosophers who are writing, well not Socrates, he didn't

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:52.120
[Guest]: write, but Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers who follow them, that this was a transformation

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.120
[Amit Varma]: of the word.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you point out how, you know, Plato's Socrates sort of begins to take areta away

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.960
[Amit Varma]: from kleos or the recognition and sort of shows that it can exist independent of recognition

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.120
[Amit Varma]: that you can be virtuous even if no one else sees your virtue.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:15.560
[Amit Varma]: And I want to quote a great, a very nice passage that kind of illustrates that from your book.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.560
[Amit Varma]: Start quote, in the Gorgias, is that the right way to pronounce it?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.800
[Amit Varma]: In the Gorgias, Socrates is presented as asserting something so radical that his hearers think

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.280
[Amit Varma]: it has to be a joke.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.240
[Amit Varma]: He would, he says, rather be treated unjustly than treat others unjustly.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.600
[Amit Varma]: But if areta is conceived of as analogous to the health of the body, then Socrates'

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.720
[Amit Varma]: statement is hardly absurd.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.520
[Amit Varma]: The injustice that we do involves us far more intimately than the injustice that we suffer.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.400
[Amit Varma]: I don't only act out of character, my character reacts to my actions.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:59.760
[Guest]: And it becomes this, it gets transformed in the Socratic-Platonic attack on their own

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:07.160
[Guest]: society's values into, yeah, it's something internal.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.280
[Guest]: It's not the applause.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280
[Guest]: It's not outer attention.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.880
[Guest]: In fact, you know, you may be getting no applause whatsoever.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.760
[Guest]: You may be getting a brooming cup of hemlock as Socrates got, you know, and yet it's this,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:26.240
[Guest]: if your character is being transformed in the right direction, this, this is what, what

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240
[Guest]: counts.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.600
[Guest]: And, you know, and then the, the, the whole question becomes, well, what is the right

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600
[Guest]: direction?

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.880
[Guest]: What are the virtues?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880
[Guest]: How do we know?

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880
[Guest]: How do we judge?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.840
[Guest]: Uh, what are the right virtues?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.800
[Guest]: You know, which becomes, you know, a central theme of philosophy and what is really knowledge,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.800
[Guest]: you know, becomes a central theme of epistemology.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:54.920
[Guest]: So philosophy is often running with this transformation of, you know, from the, the attention and

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:03.340
[Guest]: approbation of your fellow citizens to know that that's not a reliable means of judging

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.760
[Guest]: whether you're living your life as you ought to live it.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.720
[Guest]: And in fact, it's something far more private, something that takes a tremendous amount of

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.480
[Guest]: striving, but not striving just to be replicated in other people's minds.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:22.440
[Guest]: In fact, you may be in the eyes of your fellow citizens, a nobody, a failure, a loser, um,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.720
[Guest]: to use one of the favorite phrases of our current president of the United States, you

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
[Amit Varma]: know, loser.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720
[Unknown]: Everybody's a loser.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720
[Unknown]: Sad.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720
[Unknown]: Sad.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.520
[Guest]: Um, you know, and, uh, yeah, so, you know, this is a very good example.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.360
[Guest]: I mean, I somehow, you know, being American, everything nowadays comes back to Trump, right?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.840
[Guest]: He colonizes our minds in a terrible way.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:53.560
[Guest]: But yet you look at this life, I mean, this is a person who is after, um, kleos, um, attention,

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.680
[Guest]: outward attention in the biggest way possible.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.400
[Guest]: He has to be thought of by every citizen, every citizen on the globe, every human, and

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.160
[Guest]: he is, um, is this a successful life by Greek standards?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.920
[Guest]: You know, by pre-philosophical, the Homeric ethos of the extraordinary, yes, he's an extraordinary

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
[Guest]: person, right?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.920
[Guest]: He is replicated in all of our minds.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.800
[Guest]: Um, you know, what would Socrates and Plato have to say about him?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.240
[Guest]: We know what Socrates and Plato would have to say about him.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.440
[Guest]: And the fact that so many of us would echo Socrates and Plato's opinion, um, of, of,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.760
[Guest]: of this kind of kleos, this outward domination of the world consciousness shows how much,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.160
[Guest]: um, philosophy has in fact, uh, infiltrated, uh, our minds.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.520
[Guest]: This is one of the theme, you know, this, the, um, subtitle of this book is why philosophy

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.040
[Guest]: won't go away.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.080
[Guest]: And this is an ongoing argument I have in my background is in science.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.280
[Guest]: I come from a science, you know, from physics and mathematics.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.820
[Guest]: Um, most of my friends and all of my husbands have been themselves scientists.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.960
[Guest]: And so this question of, um, what is philosophy adding here?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:13.120
[Guest]: And it's very hard to see philosophical progress because it's the progress with which we see,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.760
[Guest]: you know, those of us who are judging a person like Trump to be, you know, a failure, he's

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.800
[Guest]: calling everybody a loser, but that he's a loser himself in the true sense, in the biggest

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.560
[Guest]: sense, a waste of the human life, um, and a waste of tremendous privilege and resources.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.960
[Guest]: Um, why are we doing this?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:38.400
[Guest]: I mean, this, this, this is a, a, a kind of progress that was begun with Socrates and

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.880
[Guest]: Plato's, uh, argument with those values of their own society.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:49.040
[Guest]: And that has, uh, you know, continued and infiltrated all of our, in fact, a very funny

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.260
[Amit Varma]: illustration of this progress of philosophy in your book, where you have all these dialogues

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.000
[Amit Varma]: with Plato in modern settings is when he's at the Googleplex and he's surprised to learn

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.960
[Guest]: that slavery is no more.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.760
[Amit Varma]: He is charmed and beguiled by the arguments against slavery that the person who is with

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760
[Guest]: him gives him.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760
[Guest]: Yes.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.320
[Guest]: And, and, and she, of course, you know, I made her, it's a little bit of comic relief,

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320
[Guest]: right?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.240
[Guest]: But she's the meteor escort when a writer is on a book tour, somebody meets them in

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.800
[Guest]: each city and takes them around to all of their events.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.560
[Guest]: And um, and they, they tend to be usually, you know, very amusing people and, you know,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.920
[Guest]: charming, but you know, not, not intellectuals really.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.840
[Guest]: And I, so my media escort in this kind of telling how this very flaky kind of person

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.440
[Amit Varma]: is actually giving such a solid philosophical argument, which has come from Plato himself

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.760
[Guest]: in some sense, because how does philosophy make progress?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:47.840
[Guest]: We don't make progress in terms of, um, experiments or, you know, laboratory empirical, it's not

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.240
[Guest]: an empirical science clearly.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:57.080
[Guest]: Um, but the way we make progress here is, you know, we, we keep seeing the implications

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.520
[Guest]: of, um, commitments that we've already made and the strongest being commitments to our

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.960
[Guest]: own life that we ourselves feel that we matter, or in any case we want to matter, it matters

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.200
[Guest]: to us whether we matter.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.800
[Guest]: That is what it is to pursue a life.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.640
[Guest]: Your life has to matter to you in order just to pursue it.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.960
[Guest]: Um, what are the, what, what follows from this?

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.320
[Guest]: And, and so many times we don't see what follows from this and we were inconsistent and that's

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.920
[Guest]: exactly how philosophy makes progress by looking at things that we've already committed ourselves

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.360
[Guest]: to that we can't live our lives without committing ourselves to and seeing how we, how we are

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:41.040
[Guest]: inconsistent, that this has consequences, logical consequences, and you know, we don't

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040
[Guest]: see them.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:48.320
[Guest]: And that's, in fact, this was this, uh, this is why the reductio ad absurdum, this form

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.640
[Guest]: of argument was the favored form of Socrates, right?

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.640
[Guest]: He developed this, you know, here you're committed to this, here are your premises, and yet you're

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640
[Guest]: not committed to this.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640
[Guest]: Do you see the inconsistency?

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.480
[Guest]: And he, he would point out to people their inconsistencies, which didn't win him great

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480
[Amit Varma]: popularity.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.960
[Amit Varma]: And it didn't work out well for the poor guy and, and part of the reason why it didn't

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.200
[Amit Varma]: work out well for him is because the Athenian sense of Aretha was tied up with the state.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.400
[Amit Varma]: You had to have the validation of the state.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.760
[Amit Varma]: And there's another quote, which, you know, if you replace Athenian with say American,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.080
[Amit Varma]: the court might still make sense.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.320
[Amit Varma]: Start quote, Athenian superiority drew itself to more superiority, intensifying its sense

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.120
[Amit Varma]: of his own exceptionalism, which typically happens with imperial powers.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120
[Guest]: Stop quote.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.120
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120
[Guest]: Yes.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.760
[Guest]: And so, you know, it was a great, if you have a society whose, whose normative framework

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.960
[Guest]: is built on, you know, everybody has to be exceptional.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:49.240
[Guest]: Well, the big problem is, of course, most of us are not exceptional, right?

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.640
[Guest]: We're perfectly, but yes, I mean, by definition, we're ordinary, most of us.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.680
[Guest]: And so what, you know, what did you do?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.760
[Guest]: Well, you, I call it participatory exceptionalism.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:08.600
[Guest]: You know, you're participating in an exceptional city state and of course, Athens was the most,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:15.640
[Guest]: it was a given premise, a firm premise among all of the ancient Greeks of no matter what

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.040
[Guest]: city state that they were the best in the world, right?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.880
[Guest]: This comes very naturally to our species.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:28.040
[Guest]: And you know, in fact, their word for a foreigner is barbarian because, and it comes from their

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.400
[Guest]: word for blah, blah, blah, what, you know, just is bar, bar, bar, you know, you can't

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.360
[Guest]: understand what they're saying.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.200
[Guest]: So they're barbarians, right?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.720
[Guest]: And it simply meant not Greek speakers.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:47.520
[Guest]: And so, but there was that, that kind of implication, lesser, there are lesser people.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:54.200
[Guest]: And then among these exceptional Greek speakers, the most exceptional, the creme de la creme

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.480
[Guest]: were the Athenians, right?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: And it was, it was an imperial power.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.640
[Guest]: They were an imperialist over their fellow Greek city states.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:09.880
[Guest]: And they were also a great draw for their, for all of the most creative people.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:15.320
[Guest]: So you know, Aristotle was not born in Athens, he came to Athens, he came to Athens to study

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:23.040
[Guest]: in Plato's Academy, the first European university that was founded by Plato.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:30.640
[Guest]: And so there was this, this sense that the way you can achieve something big and extraordinary

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.680
[Guest]: is by being a citizen of an extraordinary state.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:44.080
[Guest]: So there's this nationalist fervor that is so strong because the whole existential longing

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.040
[Guest]: to make something of your life was tied, tied up in this.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.040
[Guest]: And this is a way, of course, that we all, it's a way we all try to do it, by the group

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.640
[Guest]: we belong to, you know, that this is a way of, rather than the values that we cultivate

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.800
[Guest]: within our soul, the group that we belong to.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.480
[Amit Varma]: And where Plato, Socrates kind of moved away from this was by saying that it was in a sense

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.000
[Amit Varma]: by rejecting the Athenian notion of arete, and saying that virtue comes not from belonging

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.640
[Amit Varma]: to an exceptional state, but from knowledge.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And I found it very fascinating where you talk about the sublime braid, which is the

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:26.080
[Amit Varma]: connection between truth and beauty and virtue, and the notion that from knowledge arises

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080
[Amit Varma]: virtue.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Can you explain that to me?

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:36.960
[Guest]: So it's, yeah, the truth, beauty and goodness are entwined with each other.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.320
[Guest]: This is so fundamental in Plato.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.760
[Guest]: One of the reasons I like Plato, although I do not think that everything he said was

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.160
[Guest]: right, clearly not right.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.680
[Guest]: But again, how could I think that philosophy makes progress and think that everything Plato

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.680
[Guest]: said was right?

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.440
[Guest]: No, we can, we've made so much progress, we can look back at Plato and say, no, you were

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.600
[Guest]: wrong about this, this and this, and many other things.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:08.640
[Guest]: But something that's very fundamental about him, he changed his mind many times.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:16.320
[Guest]: And this discipline that he really founded for us is a very self-critical, it's reason,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.520
[Guest]: but everything is open to reason.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.680
[Guest]: Everything has to be justified.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:29.200
[Guest]: And so there's a great self-critical capacity that has to be cultivated in order to be a

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200
[Guest]: philosopher.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.160
[Guest]: I feel that any philosopher who hasn't changed her mind many times over the course of her

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:43.600
[Guest]: life is really not being a good philosopher because this is critical, this self-criticism.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:49.480
[Guest]: So but one of the things that stays permanent with him is that, what I call the sublime

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:58.160
[Guest]: grade, the intertwining of these three most important things for him, truth and beauty

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:05.640
[Guest]: and goodness, and that they all are connected, they're embedded with each other.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.600
[Guest]: You can't achieve any one without the other.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.920
[Guest]: So for example, how can we tell that something is true?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.480
[Guest]: There has to be a beautiful explanation.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:27.680
[Guest]: So if we have, you know, two or more explanations that are, that can accommodate all of the

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.440
[Guest]: things that we're trying to explain, all of the evidence, we go with the most beautiful

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.520
[Guest]: one, the most elegant one, in some sense the simplest one.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:44.280
[Guest]: But there's an aesthetic evaluation of that as a criterion for truth.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:51.920
[Guest]: Now, I come from a background in physics and that is very, very apparent in physics.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:32:00.560
[Guest]: You know that when we, for example, turned away from the geocentric view, that the heavens

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.560
[Guest]: all revolved around the earth and moved the Copernican Revolution to the heliocentric

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:12.640
[Guest]: universe, both systems could accommodate all of the empirical evidence, the movements of

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.840
[Guest]: the planets and all of this, but one of them was really messy.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.600
[Guest]: You had to keep adding more and more epicycles.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:27.400
[Guest]: It was mathematically grotesque, right, and one, all you had to do was change the orientation

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:34.000
[Guest]: and make the sun the center with the earth moving and the, everything became, the explanation

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.240
[Guest]: itself became beautiful, became mathematically simple.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.400
[Guest]: We still, this is still the case, you know, so for, you know, all the way, you know, with

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.480
[Guest]: relativity theory, when Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, he had very

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.560
[Guest]: little empirical evidence for it.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:57.880
[Guest]: What he had was beautiful mathematics, the mathematics is stunning, the theory itself

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:05.320
[Guest]: is stunning and when it, it, it, he was proposed, the general theory was published in 1915,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.360
[Guest]: had to wait until 1919 until he had any empirical evidence for it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.360
[Guest]: They needed a complete eclipse, a solar eclipse so that they could see whether or not, I won't,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360
[Guest]: I won't go into it.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.960
[Amit Varma]: I, I, I get that connection between truth and beauty, that a certain truth about the

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.720
[Amit Varma]: universe is expressed beautifully by E is equal to MC squared, say, but how does knowing

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.600
[Guest]: that translate to virtue?

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600
[Guest]: To virtue.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: So here is what Plato believed.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:41.680
[Guest]: He believed that if we really assimilate truth, which takes, first of all, that itself takes

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.400
[Guest]: virtue.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.800
[Guest]: It takes taming of the ego, right?

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: Because we have a great tendency to believe what's true, what, if it most flatters ourselves,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.160
[Guest]: our place in society, our place in the universe, I mean, why did we think that the earth had

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.520
[Guest]: to be the center of the universe with all the heavens revolving around us, right?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.560
[Guest]: It flatters our, our sense of importance in the cosmos, you know, so just to be able to

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.400
[Guest]: attain the truth means you have to subdue the ego somewhat, right?

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:22.840
[Guest]: But that also, when we see the truth, our perspective is so broadened.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:32.320
[Guest]: We see ourselves in this greatest perspective, the grandest perspective, and that itself,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:39.320
[Guest]: you know, expands our virtue, gives us a tolerance, and we don't take ourselves so damn seriously,

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.320
[Guest]: right?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.760
[Guest]: I mean, this is, this is the aim of ethics to, we see ourselves in some perspectives

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:52.000
[Guest]: in regard with other, of our fellow citizens and fellow creatures and our planet itself,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: our cosmos itself.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.640
[Guest]: This is what it is to be virtuous.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.000
[Guest]: So yeah, so that's how these things all become intertwined.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.640
[Guest]: I just wanted to say this, this one thing that Einstein had said when he finally was

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:13.680
[Guest]: brought the evidence for the general theory of relativity, that yes, light, the mass of,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.040
[Guest]: the mass of the sun actually did shift light in the way that he had predicted, and it was

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.120
[Guest]: a huge, you know, success for this theory.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.140
[Guest]: And so a philosopher of science, Hans-Reichenbach, asked him, how did you feel when you finally

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.920
[Guest]: got news that your theory had been vindicated?

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.520
[Guest]: And he said, oh, no, I already knew it had to be true because it's so beautiful.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.800
[Guest]: So the empirical evidence just didn't even matter so much.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.600
[Guest]: So you know, this, and this we can trace all the way back to Plato.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.880
[Amit Varma]: On that elegant note, we'll take a quick commercial break.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.880
[Amit Varma]: We'll be back in a minute.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.040

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160
[Unknown]: it right.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.920
[Unknown]: On Simplified, Chuck and Srikant take another look at Brexit and the predicaments in store

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.600
[Unknown]: for the UK in March.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.260
[Unknown]: On Puliyabazi, the host is in conversation with Dr. Anil Shukla, who served as Deputy

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.360
[Unknown]: Election Commissioner to investigate the Indian electoral process.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.040
[Unknown]: On the Habit Coach podcast, Ashwin talks about how the technique of box breathing helps fight

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040
[Unknown]: anxiety.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.800
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue with your show.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the most revelatory points while reading your book was that way back

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:06.880
[Amit Varma]: then, when all the other normative religions were sort of taking root, you had Socrates

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.000
[Amit Varma]: basically demolishing the notion of God by asking Yutipro, I hope I'm pronouncing that

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: right.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Guest]: Yutipro.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Yutipro.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this fantastic question where he says, quote, is what is holy, holy because the gods

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.280
[Amit Varma]: approve it?

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Or do they approve it because it's holy?

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.160
[Guest]: Yeah, this is fantastic.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.400
[Guest]: It's one of Plato's early dialogues.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.680
[Guest]: And the argument that Socrates puts forth there, or that Plato has Socrates putting

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:42.240
[Guest]: forth there, has been repeated by freethinkers throughout the ages.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.920
[Guest]: You know, Spinoza, who's a great favorite philosopher of mine, the 17th century Jewish

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.680
[Guest]: rationalist philosopher, very much following in the footsteps of Plato, you know, it's

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.920
[Guest]: repeated by him.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.960
[Guest]: And in our own day, Sam Harris, you know, repeats this argument and people don't always

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.360
[Guest]: attribute it to Plato, but he's the one who first formulated this extremely elegant argument.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Just for the listeners, I'll kind of quickly explain what it's essentially saying is that

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.040
[Amit Varma]: if there are normative moral codes that you follow because God tells you to follow it,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.280
[Amit Varma]: are you doing that because he, like, is he telling you to do good things because there

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.920
[Amit Varma]: is a reason for those to be good, in which case those reasons are enough in themselves.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920
[Guest]: You don't need the God.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.120
[Guest]: And if there are no reasons, then why do it?

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.120
[Guest]: And why do it?

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.520
[Guest]: I mean, if it's simply a caprice of God, you know, a whim, you know, do this, you know,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:45.880
[Guest]: give charity to the widow and to the orphan rather than, you know, persecute them.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:51.440
[Guest]: There's no additional reason that dictates this moral choice.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.280
[Guest]: Does that really answer the question we're asking when we want to know what makes good

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.360
[Guest]: actions good?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.200
[Guest]: What makes evil evil?

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.640
[Guest]: Just the whims and caprices of an immoral God.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.680
[Guest]: So no, we feel not, you know, we feel no.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.360
[Guest]: There's a reason God wants us to do this rather than that.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.520
[Guest]: Well, then if there's the reason, that's the reason, and God is redundant.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.640
[Guest]: It's a very elegant argument.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:25.800
[Guest]: And you know, I think sometimes it's against my will in certain debates with theists who

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.240
[Guest]: want to argue there can't be no morality without God.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.320
[Guest]: And you know, this is an argument that I have had to face so many times.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.680
[Guest]: And you know, you give them, for me, the best response is Plato's argument, you know, 2400

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:48.240
[Guest]: years ago, pre-Christian, pre-Jewish, you know, but that it's, yeah, it's a very, very

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.560
[Amit Varma]: elegant argument.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And this brings me to my next question, which is really puzzling, which is that you have

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:58.480
[Amit Varma]: this outbreak of what we would call rationality in this period where Socrates and Plato and

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Aristotle are doing well.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And then you have this long sort of interval until the Enlightenment in the 18th century

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.840
[Amit Varma]: before you have that.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And the rest of the time is all of those religions, those monotheistic cults, all of that thinking

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.760
[Amit Varma]: you should have, you would think would go away with Plato's question, at least the rationalism

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.280
[Amit Varma]: would survive.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.200
[Amit Varma]: But it disappears for several hundred years.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.200
[Guest]: Why is that?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:31.960
[Guest]: Well, you know, partly, you know, one of the problems with this religion of reason, you

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:40.680
[Guest]: could almost call it, right, or a normativity of reason, is that it requires a lot of hard

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest]: work.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.680
[Guest]: It requires education.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.880
[Guest]: You don't get the most comforting answers from it, right?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.880
[Guest]: You know, it depends on us.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.560
[Guest]: It's very human-centric.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:59.880
[Guest]: It makes the universe a kind of cold and uncaring place, an impersonal place.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.000
[Guest]: It's not surprising it broke out in ancient Greece, given what they thought of their gods,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.720
[Guest]: which were, they're downright, you know, hostile to us.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:18.640
[Guest]: But it doesn't, whereas the, you know, the Judeo-Christian Muslim view, which captured

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.800
[Guest]: the world, is that it's very powerful.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.800
[Guest]: It gives us a sense of cosmic significance.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.000
[Guest]: You know, I, myself, had started out that way.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.680
[Guest]: I was born into an extremely religious family.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.800
[Guest]: I know what it feels like to make the transition of feeling, you know, that God is watching

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:43.240
[Guest]: everything I do, which is terrifying because, I mean, it's really, there's no privacy whatsoever.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.360
[Guest]: And also, you know, he's a very stern God.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.880
[Guest]: He's judging if you do and, you know, in Judaism, which was my birth religion, it's, you know,

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.960
[Guest]: there are laws for absolutely everything, laws specifically for women to keep them in

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.400
[Guest]: their place.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.720
[Guest]: And these rankled me very much.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.800
[Guest]: These did not go down well with me.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.960
[Guest]: But one thing you never doubt, and that is that you matter.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.880
[Guest]: I mean, because you matter to the Lord of the universe.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.360
[Guest]: He created you intentionally.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.400
[Guest]: He has designed, you know, he created you rather than somebody else.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.520
[Guest]: So you have your place in the universe.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: You know, what I was saying about that village that, you know, that predates the axial age,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.360
[Guest]: in some sense, it makes the universe a village, you know, that we all have, I've never thought

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.560
[Guest]: of that before, actually, but that we all have our place, you know, with the head chief,

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.440
[Guest]: you know, is there.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.440
[Guest]: And he had a really great...

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.880
[Amit Varma]: Always a man.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.880
[Guest]: Always a man.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.640
[Guest]: And he had, you know, he has designs on us.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:52.720
[Guest]: And it's a comforting and it sort of replicates, you know, where we came from, that tribal

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.360
[Guest]: village life.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.520
[Guest]: So it is our default, I think.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.920
[Guest]: And reason is pushing against that.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:09.920
[Guest]: And so I think it was such a powerful replication of the village intimacy, only on the cosmic

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.040
[Guest]: scale that was presented to the world.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.040
[Guest]: It's not surprising.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.360
[Guest]: Also, it promises us an afterlife.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:22.800
[Guest]: I mean, it makes us extremely, you know, it assuages some of our deepest fears, which

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.880
[Guest]: is that, you know, in the great scheme of things, we're really not so very much.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.640
[Guest]: No, we don't want to feel that.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640
[Guest]: We fear death.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640
[Guest]: All of these things.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.200
[Guest]: And it really palliates and speaks to our deepest fears.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:42.040
[Amit Varma]: One of the interesting points that you, the arguments that you address in the introduction

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.640
[Amit Varma]: to your book, in fact, is about how people often say that philosophy, even today, is

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.760
[Amit Varma]: just a set of footnotes to Plato, for example.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.120
[Amit Varma]: And people therefore make the argument, including I'm sure some of your scientist friends, that

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.280
[Amit Varma]: science has progressed so much, you know, no one would say that science is like footnotes

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.400
[Amit Varma]: to Pythagoras or whoever.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.560
[Amit Varma]: But with philosophy, we keep going back to Plato and finding it very relevant.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And you can actually begin an argument there.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.200
[Guest]: What do you have to say to that?

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.200
[Guest]: Several things.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.320
[Guest]: I think that, you know, it was Alfred North Whitehead, a 20th century philosopher and

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.040
[Guest]: logician who had said that the truest thing you can say about Western philosophy is that

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.680
[Guest]: it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:28.760
[Guest]: And this is a very good soundbite, but like most soundbites, it's a gross oversimplification.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.200
[Guest]: What you can say about Plato and the reason that he's so very important is that he had

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.920
[Guest]: a real sense for what the philosophical questions were and what answers a philosophical question

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.400
[Guest]: and what doesn't answer a philosophical question.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.120
[Guest]: And he found philosophical questions lurking in every area.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.720
[Guest]: So he lays out the landscape of philosophy, that we can say, the different areas, you

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.560
[Guest]: know, philosophy of religion that we spoke about a little bit and, you know, and theory

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.360
[Guest]: of knowledge, epistemology, moral philosophy, political philosophy, you know, all these

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.680
[Guest]: different, but that there are always these philosophical questions that arise that are

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.480
[Guest]: not one with the fields themselves.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.800
[Guest]: They're meta questions.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.960
[Guest]: They're about the philosophy of science, you know.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:18.440
[Guest]: So it's not that he laid out all of the answers, as I say, we can look back and see how many

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.440
[Guest]: mistakes he made.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.640
[Guest]: I mean, his theory of forms.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.080
[Guest]: I don't know anybody who holds by this philosophy of language.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.800
[Guest]: He asked the important questions and he proposed his theory of form.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.800
[Guest]: What is a meaning?

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.640
[Guest]: How does a word acquire meaning?

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.680
[Guest]: And he had this theory of forms.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.000
[Guest]: We have philosophy of language now, very complicated, very sophisticated.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.280
[Guest]: It's not Platonic, right?

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.400
[Guest]: It's not Plato's answers are not the answers, but Plato's questions, time and again, are

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400
[Guest]: the questions.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.800
[Guest]: But we've made, we've made progress with them.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.360
[Guest]: The other thing is the more scientific progress we make, the more philosophical questions

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.480
[Guest]: are churned up by the scientific progress.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, in fact, as you say, philosophy raises the proto-scientific questions that

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.680
[Guest]: is, yes.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:15.960
[Guest]: So often philosophers will first ask the scientific question that kind of motivates the science

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:21.120
[Guest]: and finally the methodology emerges that could, that could answer these questions.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.600
[Guest]: But that's not its only role.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:30.440
[Guest]: It also looks at what science, you know, the current science of the day is telling us and

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.360
[Guest]: helps to determine what it's answering and what it's not answering.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.480
[Guest]: So for something like, for example, neuroscience.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:44.280
[Guest]: So we've learned so much more about consciousness, you know, through cognitive science and through

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.000
[Guest]: neuroscience, we can map the brain and see where different aspects of consciousness,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
[Guest]: where they're located.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:00.920
[Guest]: And, you know, I think neuroscience has made it extremely probable that consciousness is

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.560
[Guest]: a brain process, right?

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.880
[Guest]: That it's, it is, it is a material physical process.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:17.600
[Guest]: Has it thereby eliminated the notion of agency, that we're actually in control of our actions?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.280
[Guest]: Has it shown that we can possibly be free, that the sense that we have of actually making

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:30.120
[Guest]: choices of, of just deliberating and deciding is an illusion.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.800
[Guest]: So this is a philosophical question.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:40.280
[Guest]: So look at what science has so far established and then see what it implies, what it doesn't

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.280
[Guest]: imply.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.560
[Guest]: What's, what's still open.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:52.440
[Guest]: Scientists are often very eager to, to interpret their findings in the broadest way possible.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.440
[Guest]: So you'll find many neuroscientists, you know, I mean, we've answered all of these philosophical

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.200
[Guest]: questions and that's where people trained in philosophy, you know, they have to look,

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.640
[Guest]: know the science, be trained in the science.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:11.280
[Guest]: But as the philosophical question, does it really entail what the scientists are saying

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280
[Guest]: that it entails?

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:19.600
[Guest]: I mean, in physics, which was the, the, the science, the scientific field that I'm most

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:26.240
[Guest]: interested in, that I had most studied in university, there is, you know, we have this

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:32.920
[Guest]: very strange theory, quantum mechanics, and we don't quite know how to interpret it.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:40.840
[Guest]: And you know, when I was taking my physics courses, there was one view, you know, about

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:48.040
[Guest]: quantum mechanics, which is, was associated with Niels Bohr, was called Copenhagen interpretation,

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.480
[Guest]: which is that, you know, things don't exist until you measure them.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.240
[Guest]: So to ask where is the particle before it's measured, where, you know, where had it been

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.120
[Guest]: before, is a meaningless question.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.480
[Guest]: You know, this is a philosophical view.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.240
[Guest]: And what happened was philosophers began to examine this view and say, look, here's quantum

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240
[Guest]: mechanics.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.480
[Guest]: Here's what you found.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.400
[Guest]: The interpretation of quantum mechanics, this is philosophical, is it good philosophy?

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:21.520
[Guest]: And they're the ones who really prodded physicists so that they came up with other interpretations

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520
[Guest]: as well.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.680
[Guest]: There's the Bohmian interpretation.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.200
[Guest]: There's the multiverse interpretation.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.480
[Guest]: These things were first proposed by, by philosophical thinking.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:35.960
[Guest]: So this is another way in which the more progress we make with our science and getting into

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:42.440
[Guest]: stranger and stranger things, to see what it implies and what it doesn't imply.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.160
[Guest]: And that, that is, that's the work I think very much of philosophy.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:56.240
[Guest]: What philosophy is after is to maximize our overall coherence, to see what we know and

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:04.640
[Guest]: what other possibilities that leaves open, closes off, to try to make us as consistent

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.640
[Guest]: and coherent.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.840
[Guest]: That has always been the role of philosophy ever since Socrates was wandering around asking

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.440
[Guest]: his annoying questions of his fellow citizens.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And just speaking of those annoying questions and what the task of philosophy is, there's

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.360
[Amit Varma]: another great passage from your book I'd like to quote, which is, quote, truth cannot be

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.880
[Amit Varma]: transmitted from one mind to another, the pouring out of the full flask of a master

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.640
[Amit Varma]: into the passive receptacle of a student.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Truth seeking comes from the violent activity of philosophy, a drama enacted deep in the

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:39.000
[Amit Varma]: interior of each of us and which manages in its violence to deprive us of positions that

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.960
[Amit Varma]: may be so deeply and constitutively personal that we can't defend them to others.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.560
[Amit Varma]: This violent activity is personal, even as it leads one in an impersonal direction where

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.080
[Amit Varma]: interpersonal agreement is possible.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.080
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of also sort of describes the Socratic method of how he did his dialogues

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.040
[Amit Varma]: and ask questions and got down to the essence of everything.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:05.640
[Amit Varma]: So my question to you is, would Socratic dialogue therefore be effective today in this polarized

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640
[Guest]: age?

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I certainly, I certainly think so.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.440
[Amit Varma]: He would get torn apart on Twitter, for example.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.440
[Guest]: Yes.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.440
[Guest]: He'd seem like a troll.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:22.760
[Guest]: So, you know, yeah, one of the things that I think is very true of the philosophical

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.880
[Guest]: enterprise is the dialogue is extremely important.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.880
[Guest]: You know, it began with the dialogue.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.160
[Guest]: Socrates never even wrote anything down because he believed in the lived conversation.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.520
[Guest]: It has to be minds clashing with other minds, and that's the way these deep intuitions that

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:44.280
[Guest]: we don't even realize we have, because they're so deep down within us, that they can be brought

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.520
[Guest]: to the floor and other people who don't share your intuitions will say, defend them, account

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.320
[Guest]: for them, tell us why I ought to believe in them.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.040
[Guest]: And then, you know, sometimes you realize you really have no reason whatsoever.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.880
[Guest]: And that's how progress is made.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.280
[Guest]: One of the wonderful things that's happened in our own day is that, you know, more and

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.640
[Guest]: more people are brought into this conversation.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:08.920
[Guest]: A person like me, a woman, would not have been part of this conversation for very long.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.360
[Guest]: And I have seen over the course of my lifetime how this has changed.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.680
[Guest]: When I entered into philosophy, I was the only woman in the room, especially because

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.280
[Guest]: I did philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.920
[Guest]: These were really considered unfeminine, right, areas of philosophy.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.560
[Guest]: I was the only woman in the room.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.000
[Guest]: I'm not anymore, right?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.080
[Guest]: There are many women.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:32.960
[Guest]: But this itself has brought philosophical questions into the conversation that were

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:40.280
[Guest]: invisible to men, such as raising children, you know, questions about what is the right

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:46.720
[Guest]: way, you know, children have been, care for the planet.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:54.320
[Guest]: I mean, the ecological concerns have become, you know, in general, for all of us, a very,

00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:00.960
[Guest]: very important part of philosophy, but more what we call applied ethics, rather than just

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.600
[Guest]: grand theories of ethics, applied ethics, you know, really specific questions that are

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.600
[Guest]: facing us have become much more prominent.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.280
[Amit Varma]: Like the trolley problem applied to autonomous cars, for example.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:21.960
[Guest]: Yes, yes, things of this sort that have, for some reason, you know, that women have found

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:29.680
[Guest]: this, less grand theories and more applied ethics, you know, that are, you know, so ecology,

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:36.600
[Guest]: family ethics, medical ethics, you find many, many women in medical ethics.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:43.680
[Guest]: So this is interesting to watch, and even the analogies that are, you know, we are always,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.880
[Guest]: one of the things that we do to test our intuitions is to do thought experiments, you know, and

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:55.600
[Guest]: they're pretty wacky, often, the trolley problem seems to be an example of a thought experiment.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.360
[Guest]: The kinds of thought experiments that I hear now being proposed are often, you know, sort

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:07.280
[Guest]: of coming from a woman's life, from a woman's perspective, a woman's sense of priorities,

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:16.920
[Guest]: and so the wider the group that we bring in, people from different cultures, the better,

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.240
[Guest]: because we come, the different cultures, the different life experiences give us such different

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.320
[Guest]: intuitions that are invisible to the person.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.400
[Amit Varma]: But why I brought up the Socratic notion of dialogue in the modern age was, does it worry

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you, for example, that in the last 10 years, what we've seen with social media and people

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.520
[Amit Varma]: living so much of their lives online, is that people shut themselves off in echo chambers,

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.480
[Amit Varma]: where they spend a lot of time posturing to raise their status within their in-group,

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.240
[Amit Varma]: but don't really talk to each other, they just talk past each other.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:52.200
[Guest]: You know, when the World Wide Web, as we used to call it, was first proposed, this seemed

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:58.280
[Guest]: the most liberating idea to a person like me, oh, now I can talk to people in India,

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:04.440
[Guest]: I can talk to people in Afghanistan, and in Saudi Arabia, and I do, actually, talk to,

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it can be used this way.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And the huge net benefit remains.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.640
[Guest]: Yes, but what we hadn't foreseen is what happened.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:20.600
[Guest]: Human nature, the worst of us, asserting itself in this new social media range.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:30.880
[Guest]: And so these echo chambers, and you only search out your own opinions that are so validated

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.400
[Guest]: and strengthened, because everybody you're talking agrees with this.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:41.640
[Guest]: So, and this is, of course, the exact opposite of what the Socratic dialogue is supposed

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.480
[Guest]: to be about, which is, again, I, myself, it's interesting, because psychologists have shown

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.280
[Guest]: us that we, there's an endorphin lift, there's a kind of surge.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:58.360
[Guest]: When you hear your own opinions replicated in others, you feel good.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360
[Guest]: And so...

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.200
[Amit Varma]: So it's healthy to be in an echo chamber?

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.720
[Guest]: Yes, it feels good.

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:11.800
[Guest]: But you know, as soon as I read this, I started to read publications, you know, newspapers

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.120
[Guest]: and periodicals that are, that I very much disagree with, right?

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:22.240
[Guest]: And yes, I feel angry, you know, I don't feel, I don't feel comfortable reading these things.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:28.200
[Guest]: But I, you know, I force myself to, and I force myself to think out, well, what are

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.600
[Guest]: they assuming that I'm not assuming?

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.720
[Guest]: How do I defend my assumptions against their assumptions?

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.360
[Guest]: It's a lot of work, right?

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:42.080
[Guest]: This is a lot of work, but, and it's uncomfortable, and it doesn't feel so very good.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:47.720
[Guest]: But I think, I think that this is part of what it is to be an enlightened person.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.520
[Guest]: To be an enlightened person is to be aware of the things that you're assuming, and that

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.680
[Guest]: they're not necessarily true to other people, and do you really have good reasons?

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.000
[Guest]: Could you convince them?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.040
[Guest]: What's the best that you could give them to try to change their minds?

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040
[Guest]: If we did that...

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Are you generally hopeful that we're moving in the right direction?

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.040
[Guest]: No.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040
[Guest]: Oh, I don't know.

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.040
[Guest]: Yes, maybe.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.680
[Guest]: Okay, well, one, I've taken enough of your time.

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.680
[Guest]: I know you've got to go.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.240
[Amit Varma]: So one, one kind of final question I've been waiting to ask, and you kind of alluded to

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.920
[Amit Varma]: it a while back.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.780
[Amit Varma]: Do you believe in free will?

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Because when you talk about virtue coming from knowledge, if you have complete knowledge,

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.160
[Amit Varma]: doesn't that then make philosophy meaningless and virtue moot?

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.960
[Guest]: Oh, that's a deep, it's a deep question.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:42.600
[Guest]: You know, I believe in, you know, to believe that we have this ability to look at our own

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:52.600
[Guest]: thought processes and be self-critical about them and change our mind about them, without

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:59.400
[Guest]: believing in that degree of freedom, you know, we can't make any sense out of what it is

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.760
[Guest]: to be rational.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:06.920
[Guest]: So if we're committed to reason, we have to be committed to some degree of freedom.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.720
[Amit Varma]: To at least the illusion of free will.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.360
[Guest]: No, I think we have to be even more.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:19.720
[Guest]: It's like, to say that there really is, you know, rational behavior, rational beliefs

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:25.080
[Guest]: justify belief, and those which are irrational and unjustified, and that therefore ought

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.560
[Guest]: not to be believed, right?

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:35.720
[Guest]: There is a normative presupposition that is enfolded in epistemology itself.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.800
[Guest]: To be committed to that, we have to be committed to some degree of freedom.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.960
[Guest]: When I see, when I examine my own thought processes, because you come at me with these

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.000
[Guest]: trenchant questions, and I say, well, I really don't know how to answer them.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.040
[Guest]: I better go back to the drawing board and rethink it, and maybe I will, I will change

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.040
[Guest]: my mind.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.080
[Guest]: That is, that's a presumption of being a reasonable person at all.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:07.180
[Guest]: So if, you know, what we have learned undermines reason itself, then we have no reason to even

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:10.120
[Guest]: trust what we have learned, right?

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.960
[Guest]: It's a, it's a kind of Pyrrhic victory.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:19.680
[Guest]: It will, it will destroy any claims we have to, to truth, to knowledge, to reason.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:25.640
[Guest]: So to that degree, I think we have to, we have to countenance free will.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.880
[Guest]: Rebekah, thank you so much for coming on the show.

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.880
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.880
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.520
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed our conversation.
