00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.060
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.880
[Amit Varma]: dead economists were gathered to watch, I wondered. Just then, the title flashed on the screen.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen. Today's episode is about zombie firms and creative

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.120
[Amit Varma]: destruction. What are zombie firms, you ask? They are the living dead of the business world,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.400
[Amit Varma]: firms that should have shut down but are kept alive, sometimes by zombie banks. Air India is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.040
[Amit Varma]: one example and Jet Airways, which shut down recently, could have been another one. My guest

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.800
[Amit Varma]: today is the economist Ajay Shah, who is a zombie hunter of sorts, passionate in his belief that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.840
[Amit Varma]: zombie firms are bad for the economy and for common citizens like you and me, and that the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.040
[Amit Varma]: state should not allow this horror movie to continue. Before he explains why, though, let's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.800
[Amit Varma]: take a quick commercial break. This episode of the scene in the unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.480
[Amit Varma]: show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love. The book I want to recommend today is

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.000
[Amit Varma]: called Hayek by Iman Butler. Frederick Hayek is one of the most important thinkers of the 20th

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.680
[Amit Varma]: century, and someone who's had a great influence on me. But this is not a book by him, but a brief

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.800
[Amit Varma]: introduction to his life and his thinking by an outstanding author called Iman Butler. So check

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.160
[Amit Varma]: it out on Storytel. And remember, you get a 30 day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IBM.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Ajay, welcome to the scene in the unseen. My pleasure to be here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.280
[Amit Varma]: Ajay, I've been reading you and I've admired your work for many, many years,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.360
[Amit Varma]: almost since the start of the millennium. Tell my listeners a little bit more about you. Like,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, how did you become an economist? What was what's your journey been like?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.960
[Guest]: Um, I had the good fortune that I was brought up in a house with 6000 books,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.320
[Guest]: and my father was an economist. So in a way, I've been exposed to these things all along.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.000
[Guest]: I studied aeronautical engineering at IIT Bombay. And then I jumped into a PhD in economics.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.200
[Guest]: After moving back to India, I worked at the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.920
[Guest]: the CMIE. I worked at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.240
[Guest]: This is a university near Bombay. And I was then in the Ministry of Finance in Delhi.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.120
[Guest]: After that, I have been at the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.280
[Guest]: NIPFP in Delhi. So that's my life trajectory. All through my work, I've basically been curious

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.480
[Guest]: about the world, both in terms of understanding how things are, and in terms of what public

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.720
[Guest]: policy can do to make it different. And when you start thinking about public policy, it inevitably

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.120
[Guest]: takes one away from simple economics, because a lot of public policy is really public management,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.240
[Guest]: it's public administration, it is law, and of course, it is politics. So I've been exposed

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.160
[Guest]: into that world. I've had the good fortune of being involved in many of the big and exciting

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.120
[Guest]: policy projects of the last 25 years. These included the early development of the equity

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.560
[Guest]: market, the reforms of building SEBI and NSE, the new pension system. Then I was part of the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.720
[Guest]: early thinking on the goods and services tax. I was part of the Financial Sector Legislative

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.320
[Guest]: Reforms Commission, which did a full clean write of Indian financial law. I was part of the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.160
[Guest]: bankruptcy process. I was a member of the committee that drafted the Indian Bankruptcy Code. And I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.000
[Guest]: was part of the movement of the Reserve Bank of India, towards inflation targeting, and so on.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.080
[Guest]: So I've had the good fortune of being at the early ideas stages of some of these important projects.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I noticed that you were very fortunate in the same way that I was that I

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320
[Amit Varma]: also grew up in a house full of books. And that's where I kind of got hooked on to reading and then

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.960
[Amit Varma]: you just get curious about the world. And that's an incredible habit. So tell me a little bit about

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.360
[Amit Varma]: what were your early influences in terms of like, you said you were in a house with about

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.280
[Amit Varma]: 6000 books. So, and your dad was an economist, but I'm presuming they weren't all books of

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.520
[Guest]: economics. There would have been all kinds of books. My father was a 19th century intellectual,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.760
[Guest]: okay, where it was not a narrow economics view. It was everything. It was history,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.760
[Guest]: it was politics, it was philosophy, it was culture, it was religion, it was everything. So

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.880
[Guest]: I always think of myself as a visitor to this century, from the 20th century, for me,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.440
[Guest]: the great experience of my mind is the thought process of the 20th century. So if you look at

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.080
[Guest]: the 20th century, starting from the collapse of the first globalization in 1914, then you play

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.440
[Guest]: the arc through the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War, the collapse of

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.440
[Guest]: colonial empires, the Cold War, the collapse of communism, the rise of liberal economics and

00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:00.360
[Guest]: globalization, and then its recent minor hiccups. In my mind, this is the story that this is my

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.040
[Guest]: natural locale. I understand this world. I have spent my whole life studying this world. I think

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.200
[Guest]: I have some intuition into how things have happened. And I think that's a useful thing to

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.120
[Guest]: have in this century, where many people don't quite remember those interconnections and have

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.040
[Guest]: not lived those experiences. So as a reader of books, I always say that a person lives only one

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.400
[Guest]: life. But when you read books, you can experience 1000s of lives. So I feel I have pulled together

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.880
[Guest]: some knowledge and experience from 1000s of people of the 20th century.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And who were the early thinkers or what were the books that had a big influence on you earlier?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Like if I had to ask you to name a couple of books, which changed the way you think about

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.280
[Amit Varma]: the world? It's a question I often ask people.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.880
[Guest]: This is going to be an embarrassment. But today, the book that looms large in my mind is a book

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.800
[Guest]: that I only read about six or seven years ago. And this is the book Seeing Like a State by James C.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.560
[Guest]: Scott. I just think of that book as one of the most important influences in how I think about

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.600
[Guest]: the world today. And sadly, I got to it only seven years ago.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.840
[Guest]: How did it change the way you looked at the world?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.880
[Guest]: It made me much more cautious. So I think I have suffered from an engineering disease.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:21.480
[Guest]: And a willingness to design the world too much. And I think the book slapped me around

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.560
[Guest]: and made me much more careful and much more cautious. It also helped that along the way,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.800
[Guest]: I was gaining more experience and I was learning how things go horribly wrong

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: through more practical experiences. But I think that James Scott has helped me

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.200
[Guest]: be far more careful and far more grounded in respecting the complexities of the world,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.760
[Guest]: in underlining how little we know. We the thinkers about public policy

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.360
[Guest]: are actually far less knowledgeable and far less confident in what we do. So this is the sort of

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.880
[Guest]: caution and change in worldview that James C. Scott has helped me see.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.440
[Guest]: Maybe it was brewing all along, but the book just was like a vision for me when I read it.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And is that sort of epistemic humility, something that is very uncommon in the

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.040
[Amit Varma]: fields that you worked in? Because I imagine that people in government always do imagine that they

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.800
[Guest]: can, you know, see themselves as designers of sorts. So I think of it as two parts.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.880
[Guest]: First, right after independence, there was unabashedly a period of modernism.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.960
[Guest]: There was this idea of a developmental state, the government was going to build steel mills,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.800
[Guest]: you know, there was central planning raged on a large scale that the governments were quite

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.400
[Guest]: comfortable and quite arrogant in reshaping the world. By the late 70s and early 80s, when

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.920
[Guest]: the economic policy philosophy started shifting into a more market-led vision of the world,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.960
[Guest]: I think that has subsided. But even then, I think that we in India would do better

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.760
[Guest]: by crossing the river, by feeling the stones, making small moves, learning from experience,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.360
[Guest]: always being humble, listening to the world, listening to the data, and changing our mind as

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.800
[Amit Varma]: we go along. Getting to sort of the topic at hand, I mean, the larger topic, of course,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.520
[Amit Varma]: is the existence and the danger of zombie firms and the value of creative destruction.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.520
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, at the time that we are recording this, we are recording this on

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.800
[Amit Varma]: April 22. And what is looming in front of me, as I think of these things is obviously the

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.640
[Amit Varma]: downfall of jet, where in a sense, obviously, I'm glad it's gone, because a lot of the voices

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.240
[Amit Varma]: for keeping it alive, I mean, for the government to keep it alive would really have been, you know,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.360
[Amit Varma]: privatizing profits, socializing losses. And that's absolutely the worst for, you know,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.560
[Amit Varma]: any supporter of free markets can hope for. Tell me a bit about jet, like what exactly happened

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:49.480
[Guest]: there? Why did it fail? What was the journey? So, I've thought a lot about the Indian airline

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:55.560
[Guest]: industry. And in my mind, one important root cause of the trouble, which I think has not been

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.400
[Guest]: adequately appreciated, is the presence of Air India that was making losses. So, here is the

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.360
[Guest]: key intuition. So, just to make up an example, suppose there is an Air India that has 20%

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.880
[Guest]: market share. So, not a dominant player, but big enough to matter to the price. And suppose

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.840
[Guest]: Air India systematically loses money, which means that the taxpayer is topping up Air India every

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.440
[Guest]: year. But Air India is systematically charging an affair that is not enough for Air India to make

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:32.280
[Guest]: money. And there is an artificial injection of resources from the taxpayer. What that does is,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.840
[Guest]: it really puts a crimp on the profits of every other firm. So, if I'm a rival airline, I'm unable

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.800
[Guest]: to charge slightly higher prices, because Air India is here charging relatively lower prices.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.440
[Guest]: So, these kinds of firms, firms like Air India have a technical name. They're called zombie

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.320
[Guest]: firms. So, the phrase zombie is supposed to bring to your mind the living dead. I have a funny story

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.880
[Guest]: about this. Once I was part of a government committee where the phrase zombie banks was used.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.840
[Guest]: So, now the word zombie firms, zombie banks is a technical phrase. It's a term of art

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.120
[Guest]: in economics literature. But there was a chairman of a public sector bank who was hugely offended

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:19.000
[Guest]: because he took this phrase to be a slur and there was an energetic fight where he asked for the

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.600
[Guest]: deletion of the word zombie banks from all over the report. So, zombie firms, zombie banks, these

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.080
[Guest]: are technical terms in economics. So, this is a firm that, you know, by right would not exist in

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.200
[Guest]: any reasonable world, but is being artificially kept alive on life support either by taxpayers

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.960
[Guest]: or by banks, or by somebody, but really, it's not a viable firm. So, in our…

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And it need not always be a public sector firm.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.600
[Guest]: And it doesn't have to be a public sector firm. So, for example, in Japan, the zombie

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.560
[Guest]: banks were keeping zombie firms alive. And both the banks and the firms were purely private.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.120
[Guest]: So, there was an entire ecosystem of zombies of the living dead walking around the landscape.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.840
[Guest]: These are firms that are not profitable, they're not viable. But the interesting insight is that

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.680
[Guest]: if you have one guy with a 20% market share, who's being artificially kept alive, either by banks

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.840
[Guest]: or by taxpayers, then that actually contaminates the health of the entire industry. The remaining

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.280
[Guest]: 80% of the industry will not be healthy because they will not be able to charge suitable prices.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.760
[Guest]: So, then the disease tends to spread. So, once you get one zombie firm, you will get others,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.880
[Guest]: then there'll be a second firm, there'll be a third firm. So, when you look back at the

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.040
[Guest]: failures of some of the other airlines in India, the counterfactual I would like to

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.080
[Guest]: play in my head is, what if Air India had actually been profitable? What if Air India

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.720
[Guest]: had been charging a little more for its tickets? What if Air India had been privatized? Okay, so,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.120
[Guest]: people often think that if Air India was privatized, that would mean more competition

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.840
[Guest]: for private firms. But I would also say, it would probably mean somewhat higher ticket prices. And

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.440
[Guest]: that would prop up the profitability of all the other Indian airlines. So, this is a part of what

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.840
[Guest]: led to the failure of Jet. It was just too many years of having to compete with Air India.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Let me cite an illustration from one of your pieces and all the pieces I refer to in this will

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.080
[Amit Varma]: be linked in the episode page in the show notes, where you illustrated this by saying that imagine

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.120
[Amit Varma]: that the ticket price which the market is willing to pay is 100 rupees, but Air India is so inefficient

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.480
[Amit Varma]: that it cannot price it at less than 110 bucks. So, then the taxpayer or the banks or whoever

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:27.240
[Amit Varma]: basically gives Air India 11 bucks, so they can charge 99 rupees. And what that does is because

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Air India is functioning at 99 rupees subsidized by us or other zombie banks or whatever, is that

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.280
[Amit Varma]: the likes of Jet and Indigo cannot then charge 102, 101 or even 100, they have to compete at that

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.600
[Amit Varma]: level. And the investments that they would have made with their profits and you know, getting

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.640
[Amit Varma]: more fleet, you know, just expanding overall is something that they can't do, they're barely

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.280
[Guest]: struggling to get even. And now let me add to that. So, let's imagine a counterfactual, where

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:58.040
[Guest]: Air India had exited the market. Okay, so just suppose we managed to shut down Air India. Many

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.560
[Guest]: things would happen. So far, we've talked about the pricing side. But also many pilots would then

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.560
[Guest]: lose their jobs in Air India. The supply of pilots would go up, the prices of pilots would go down,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.280
[Guest]: all remaining airlines, all surviving airlines would benefit because pilots would be cheaper.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.440
[Guest]: Landing slots would become available. Real estate at airports and near airports would become

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:27.480
[Guest]: available. Capital would become available because for many investors and banks, there are limits on

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.080
[Guest]: the amount of investment you can do in one industry. And by the time you've given loans to

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.480
[Guest]: Air India, you've choked up your industry concentration limits. And there would probably

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:41.080
[Guest]: be space on the balance sheets of banks that is freed up once Air India exits. So, we should see

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.880
[Guest]: the exit of a firm as playing on these two sides. One is, it improves the pricing power of the

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.960
[Guest]: survivors. The second, it improves the cost function of the survivors. The survivors are able

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.000
[Guest]: to buy their inputs at a slightly lower price. And put these two things together, you get a little

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.720
[Guest]: bit of a bump in the profitability. And that actually could have made quite a difference for

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.600
[Amit Varma]: some of the airlines that blew up along the way. Right. And you know, from another of your posts,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.040
[Amit Varma]: there's a very interesting quote where you kind of illustrate this. So I'll just quote that,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.840
[Amit Varma]: it's useful to focus on the plane. Ultimately, what is required in the economy is that a plane

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.480
[Amit Varma]: has to fly from Bombay to Nagpur. Earlier, that plane was leased or owned by Jet Airways. An

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.040
[Amit Varma]: efficient financial system is one where leasing companies shift leased planes from Jet Airways

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.400
[Amit Varma]: to other airlines, and the bankruptcy process sells of the own planes or own planes. As long

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.520
[Amit Varma]: as the plane flies, it does not matter what logo is painted on a stale stop code. And you have

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.800
[Amit Varma]: another post like this was in a piece and you have another post on your early blog, where you sort

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:46.360
[Amit Varma]: of illustrate this by talking about the cost of an idle plane for a single day. And you point out,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.560
[Amit Varma]: you know how, for example, an efficient hypothetical dictator would make sure that every plane ran

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.520
[Amit Varma]: every day because he has to. But the way and the market would do the same thing if it was allowed

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.240
[Amit Varma]: to function properly, but because of the way our system is messed up, that doesn't happen. And

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Kingfisher actually had planes lying idle for an entire year at a phenomenal opportunity cost.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.680
[Guest]: So actually, I started thinking about this field when I saw the Kingfisher planes. It just breaks

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:18.120
[Guest]: my heart to see those assets sitting on an airfield. What a waste. Okay. It is just a tragedy

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.760
[Guest]: for society when that asset is sitting there and it's not being used. And that's our failure as

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.800
[Guest]: society. So as you said a moment ago, it doesn't matter what colors are painted on the plane. You

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.920
[Guest]: want the damn plane to fly. So in economics, we always use this hypothetical concept of an

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.040
[Guest]: omniscient dictator who knows how to allocate resources. Okay. Please note, no economist

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.480
[Guest]: advocates dictatorship. This is just, and no dictator is omniscient. This is just an intellectual

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.760
[Guest]: device that if you could think efficiently and use all assets and all labor of the country,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.640
[Guest]: well, then that's like a hypothetical benchmark. And we always would like to build a society that

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.760
[Guest]: is able to use resources properly. So it struck me as a glaring failure when there were planes

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.800
[Guest]: belonging to Kingfisher airlines, which were just sitting idle. That is failure. And we should ask

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.760
[Guest]: ourselves, how can we organize society so that this doesn't happen? It should just take a few

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:15.640
[Guest]: days for a leasing company to switch a plane from one airline to another airline for a painting job

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.120
[Guest]: to be done for new colors to be painted on the plane. And then you're back to business. Finally,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.320
[Guest]: what is going on? As you mentioned a moment ago, there's a plane, there's a pilot, there is Bombay,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.880
[Guest]: there is Nagpur, there's a passenger. It doesn't matter. What is the firm? What is the airline?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.920
[Guest]: What are the colors? Okay. The same pilot will get a job in that new airline and you're done.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:41.400
[Guest]: You just want to get rid of that one ephemeral construct called an airline and hand over that

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.760
[Guest]: asset, that pilot to a different ephemeral construct called another airline. And that's

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.600
[Guest]: our job as society. Can we create the institutional arrangements through which

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.080
[Guest]: these things can be done swiftly? And then we are done. Then we don't need to get so stuck

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.680
[Guest]: up about the bankruptcy of jet airways. It is always sad when an organization dies.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.160
[Guest]: Okay. So for all of us, we've been part of teams. We've been part of organizations.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.280
[Guest]: We love organizational capital. We love to build organizations. And I'll come back to that in a

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.200
[Guest]: moment surrounding the discussion on bankruptcy. But as society firms are ephemeral, we should use

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.200
[Amit Varma]: assets well. So, you know, when you say that, that those assets should immediately have been

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.040
[Amit Varma]: put to better use and would have been within a few days, you know, some listeners might

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.480
[Amit Varma]: immediately imagine as Indians tend to look at the government for solutions,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.920
[Amit Varma]: let's say how the government should do that the government should, blah, blah, blah. But

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.640
[Amit Varma]: what really happens is that when you say society wants to society wants that society acts through

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.280
[Amit Varma]: markets, markets are the mechanism through which we fulfill each other's needs in society.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And typically, the market process would lead to that happening, you know, where the planes

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.920
[Amit Varma]: idle for maybe a week and they repainted and then they're flying and everything's back to normal.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Explain to me how that process would work out. And explain to me what are the impediments in

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.440
[Amit Varma]: its way that you know, what's wrong with the system? Why isn't that happening?

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.320
[Guest]: So I share what you said a moment ago 100% that when we say society, we're looking for

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.480
[Guest]: the working of markets. Okay, we are a self organizing system. People deal with each other

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:15.560
[Guest]: with self interest and profit motives. And what we're looking for is the rules of the game through

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.320
[Guest]: which all these nice things will happen. And that takes us to institutions and law.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:28.200
[Guest]: So let's think of the pieces of this puzzle. The first piece of the puzzle is that I'm very happy

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.160
[Guest]: that a lot of planes are leased and not bought. Okay, because it's much easier to move a leased

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.720
[Guest]: plane from one airline to another. Okay, so the airline is supposed to regularly make payments

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.200
[Guest]: to the leasing company. And when that doesn't happen, the leasing company yanks the plane,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.640
[Guest]: and that plane is then available for rent to give it to somebody else. And so that same plane

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:55.080
[Guest]: sitting in Nagpur will be captured from the control of one airline. And the leasing company will

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.240
[Guest]: probably make phone calls to all the airlines and saying, do you want this asset? It's lying

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.600
[Guest]: right there. Okay, so that's one part of it that leasing is a very good thing. The second important

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.280
[Guest]: thing is to think of bankruptcy. Okay, so the way to think of the bankruptcy process is like this.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:17.480
[Guest]: Imagine there is a company with, say, 100 rupees of assets, out of which there is 30 rupees of

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.080
[Guest]: equity and 70 rupees of debt. And this company gets into trouble and it is not able to pay either

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.080
[Guest]: its creditors or its employees or something. So for whatever reason, the company gets into

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.920
[Guest]: trouble. Now what should happen is the bankruptcy process. Conceptually, what happens in the

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:38.360
[Guest]: bankruptcy process is we say to a new buyer that I'm willing to write off all the debt of the

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:45.080
[Guest]: company. So it's 30-70, 30 rupees of equity, 70 rupees of debt. Imagine what the bankruptcy

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.120
[Guest]: process does is it says, look, the 70 is gone. Okay, so you as a buyer, I'm giving you a clean

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.480
[Guest]: slate. I'm giving you an all equity company of just the assets of the company and no debt. So

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.400
[Guest]: you're not carrying any baggage. That's the glory of the bankruptcy process. That's the beauty of

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.080
[Guest]: the bankruptcy process that you get a clean slate. It's not like the bad old days where the buyer of

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.920
[Guest]: a company had to take over all the debt that came with the company. Here, the buyer gets a clean

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.360
[Guest]: slate. He gets a start. Now, suppose the price, the highest bidder says the price I'm willing to

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:23.240
[Guest]: pay is 29. Okay. Then the lenders who have control of the bankruptcy process will think, you know,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.400
[Guest]: what's the point? I might as well just liquidate the assets of the company and I'm not really

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.400
[Guest]: getting much. But if the bidder sees some value in the organization, in the people,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.520
[Guest]: in the processes, in the capabilities of the organization, then he probably bid 40,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:42.280
[Guest]: probably bid 50. And the debtors will take whatever little money they can get that comes in

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.720
[Guest]: and walk away. So that's the bankruptcy process. Can we run this quickly? Can we do this literally

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.960
[Guest]: within weeks? It should not be complicated. It should not take forever. Okay. So in India,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.400
[Guest]: these things go on for years and years. Our puzzle in public policy is how do we make this happen

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:03.160
[Guest]: quickly? So we created a new bankruptcy law in May, 2016, and we're still in the early stages

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.640
[Guest]: of figuring this out. But really in an ideal world, that's what you want to happen. That

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.960
[Guest]: we like Jet Airways as an organization. It had some genuine capabilities. So somebody should

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.200
[Guest]: be willing to pay for it. It had some landing slots. It had some very attractive real estate.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.440
[Guest]: It had some people. It had some systems. It had some capabilities. So imagine you put it up for

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.800
[Guest]: auction in the bankruptcy process. Then somebody would pay for it and would pay a good price.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.200
[Guest]: And all the debt would get written off and you start over. And that's the glory of bankruptcy.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.600
[Guest]: Look around the world. Airlines go bankrupt all the time. It's not new. It's not unusual.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.720
[Guest]: Telecom companies go bankrupt all the time. It's not new. So the point is, we should not allow

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.960
[Guest]: these things to become long, slow, painful affairs. We should have the institutional

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.720
[Guest]: arrangements to do these things quickly. So the assets will be used. So the people will be used.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.520
[Guest]: So the organizational capital will be used. But you know what, if nobody feels there is

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.320
[Guest]: organizational capability of value inside this company, then there won't really be interesting

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:07.240
[Guest]: bids. And then, yes, the company deserves to just be cut up into some pieces and sold off that.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.720
[Guest]: You sell some land, you sell some planes, and for the rest, the company ceases to exist.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.680
[Guest]: And then we should be unsentimental about it. Okay, we tried. It didn't work. Move on. Let's

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.160
[Guest]: give the parts back to society and let's move on to something new.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.240
[Amit Varma]: So where did the IBC, like we do have, you know, an IBC, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.720
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out, where did it fail in this instance?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:35.400
[Guest]: The IBC is still a work in progress. So many of the steps that I've described are an idealized

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.760
[Guest]: depiction of what a bankruptcy process should be. Many pieces of the IBC are not yet in place. We

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.920
[Guest]: don't quite have the ability to rapidly set up the committee of creditors, rapidly assemble the

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.320
[Guest]: information, rapidly do an auction, have a tribunal that will look effectively at these

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.440
[Guest]: issues without introducing delays, without making mistakes, and so on. So this is still work in

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.920
[Guest]: progress, and we're not there. But I'm just on an idealized world that that's how we should be

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.680
[Guest]: thinking about this. By the way, as you would have read one of my articles, I think the right

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.760
[Guest]: answer for Air India, for the government, is to use the bankruptcy code. Yeah, that's what I was

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.400
[Guest]: coming to. Because that's where you wipe the debts clean. The only way in India, where you can wipe

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.600
[Amit Varma]: the debts clean and start over is IBC. So I wanted to break that down for me. Now, in your specific

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.840
[Amit Varma]: piece, for example, you gave the instance of say that there is a zombie firm, and it has say 200

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:33.560
[Amit Varma]: rupees in debt. And the most anybody is willing to pay for it is 50 rupees. But nobody will do

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.200
[Amit Varma]: that because they pay 50 rupees and they're stuck with 200 rupees of debt. So one option is where

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.280
[Amit Varma]: the government covers the debt. So you have an auction where the winning prize is a negative bid

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:49.480
[Amit Varma]: in this case 150. So the government covers 200, the other 50 goes into covering that and then

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.400
[Amit Varma]: you do whoever bids for it has a firm with no debts, but that of course, and the taxpayer is

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.000
[Amit Varma]: taking that burden, but it's a one time fiscal burden and doesn't keep repeating. Is that the

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of scenario that would work for Air India? Well, it would involve the use of taxpayer money,

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.400
[Guest]: and I don't see why. So what's the other option? The other option is to put Air India into the

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:17.080
[Guest]: bankruptcy process. So imagine that one of the banks, one of the public sector banks will have

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.000
[Guest]: a payment that does not come on time from Air India. So imagine the taxpayer stops putting

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.400
[Guest]: money into Air India. Air India fails to pay either an employee or a creditor, or a bank,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.280
[Guest]: and then any of these characters can go to the NCLT and initiate the bankruptcy process.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.520
[Amit Varma]: As it turns out, as it turns out, right.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:43.000
[Guest]: And what the bankruptcy process does is precisely this. It takes Air India, it puts it up for sale,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.680
[Guest]: and it offers the buyer a clean slate. It says all your debts are wiped off. And whatever that

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.600
[Guest]: buyer puts up the highest bidder puts up, that's the money that goes to the creditors,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.760
[Guest]: it may be less than the full debt that was owed to them, but that's okay.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.440
[Amit Varma]: So that's given in a pro rata kind?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.400
[Guest]: Yeah, there is a procedure for allocating. And in the end, you get a clean, unencumbered firm

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.840
[Guest]: with some assets, with some capabilities, with some software, with some people,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:12.440
[Guest]: with some management systems, or maybe these organizational capabilities actually don't exist.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.240
[Guest]: And nobody really comes up with a half plausible bid for Air India. In this case, it goes to

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.640
[Guest]: liquidation, please sell Air India building, please sell the planes, please sell the real

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.680
[Guest]: estate at all the airport counters, and so on.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Right. You've spoken and you had an article on the IBC as a means of privatization,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.440
[Amit Varma]: which would basically be this, you get rid of a zombie firm in this manner.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.880
[Amit Varma]: So the question here is that, you know, number one, there are obviously interest groups,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.480
[Amit Varma]: which would be against this in the political economy, which stop these kinds of reforms

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.160
[Amit Varma]: from happening. And number two, there might be a mindset problem where, you know, people think of

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.400
[Amit Varma]: the economy in a particular sort of central planning way that we have to keep these firms

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.000
[Amit Varma]: alive. And you have zombie banks keeping zombie firms alive, as you described, you know, which

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.080
[Amit Varma]: of these is more of an issue here?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.360
[Guest]: So I think the second one, because we in India have not had experience with the bankruptcy code,

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.840
[Guest]: we're used to firms that just live and live and live. And we've developed this worldview that

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.880
[Guest]: a firm essentially lives forever. And I would just like to plead with all of us that yes,

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.840
[Guest]: there is something great in the organizational capabilities of many firms, but that doesn't

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.120
[Guest]: mean all firms have great organizational capabilities. And just like the creation of

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.040
[Guest]: the creation of new firms is very important, the destruction of old firms is also very important.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.920
[Guest]: And as a society, we have to move on. A firm is nothing but a collection of people

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.480
[Guest]: and capital that comes together. And if it doesn't work, then we should just move on

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.400
[Guest]: because that same capital, those same people will do other things. Okay. Finally, a pilot

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.760
[Guest]: is going to fly planes. Finally, the Indian passenger will fly from Bombay to Nagpur.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.400
[Guest]: So, you know, in the end, it all evens itself out. We don't have to be so stuck on the idea

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.920
[Guest]: that there will always be an Air India and there will always be a Jet Airways. Maybe these are not

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.480
[Guest]: the right organizations to have done these things, or maybe they are. I'm not here to prejudge

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.360
[Guest]: whether there is organizational capability or not, but that's for the bankruptcy process to decide.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.920
[Guest]: If there are buyers who feel that there is organizational capability in Jet Airways,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.840
[Guest]: they'll put up a price for it. And if there isn't, then we should feel a little bit of sadness,

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.040
[Guest]: but we should move on. And the great economist Joseph Schumpeter taught us

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.080
[Guest]: this whole message about creative destruction, that the glory of the market economy lies in

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:39.160
[Guest]: that ceaseless churning where new firms are born all the time and old firms die all the time.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.720
[Guest]: And that's what keeps a market economy energetic. That's what keeps a market economy honest.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.720
[Guest]: And I feel we in India have somehow got into this notion that every firm is somewhat like a

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.720
[Guest]: government job, that I'll have the job forever, the firm will be there forever. And I think that

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.880
[Guest]: we would all be better off being more equanimous about it, that look, these things happen,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.240
[Guest]: they come and go. I would like to narrate two stories in this regard. The first of them is

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.240
[Guest]: the malls of India. So as an economist, I suffer from two problems. The first is that I rarely get

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.800
[Guest]: to visit malls. And the second is that when I visit malls each time, my heart overflows with joy

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.240
[Guest]: because I see how much change there is between one month and the next month. You walk in any

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.840
[Guest]: mall in India, there is this constant churn. There will be a new outlet where there was something

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.560
[Guest]: completely different. People move on. People try something if it works great. If it doesn't,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.880
[Guest]: they move on. There's that dynamism. Among small firms in India, we know that dynamism.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.800
[Guest]: So similarly, you would have heard of the restaurant business in India. People put in a

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.600
[Guest]: lot of capital thinking it's going to work for a year. So you do your entire business plan,

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.520
[Guest]: thinking at the end of the year, people will be tired of this restaurant and odds are,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.760
[Guest]: I'll have to shut it down and move on and do something new. That's the dynamism.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.920
[Guest]: Here is a story originally written by my colleague, Ela Patnaik. She did this in the

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.400
[Guest]: Indian Express some years ago. You will remember a time when there were these STD, ISD, PCOs all

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:12.360
[Guest]: over the country. So all over the country, we would travel and then we would find our way

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.440
[Guest]: to some STD booth and we would make a call home. When mobile phones first came, we still used those

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:27.160
[Guest]: STD, PCOs because roaming was extremely expensive with your mobile phone. I believe that at the

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.480
[Guest]: peak, there were more than a million of these PCOs and each of them probably had one, two,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.520
[Guest]: three people participating in the production. So probably a labor force of multi-million people

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:43.080
[Guest]: was producing these STD, ISD, PCOs. And then one fine day, the roaming cost of cell phones went to

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:49.960
[Guest]: zero. And this entire industry vanished in the blink of an eye. This is an industry vastly bigger

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.440
[Guest]: than the employees of Jet Airways. In the blink of an eye, all these people lost their jobs and

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.560
[Guest]: they moved on. They went and did other things. And cyber cafes for that matter. Similarly,

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.680
[Guest]: cyber cafes sprang up and cyber cafes vanished. And this is the glory of a market economy.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.760
[Guest]: That at each point in time, entrepreneurs look at the world, firms look at the world,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.680
[Guest]: they try to figure out how can I serve the customer? And there is a way of serving the

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:17.240
[Guest]: customer and then the world changes. Preference has changed, technology changes. And we should

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.160
[Guest]: be unsentimental about firm creation and firm destruction.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Another example that comes to mind is there used to be an old saying right up to the end of the

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.200
[Amit Varma]: 90s, a Japanese saying, I think, that if you want to make a man bankrupt, give him a camera.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Because film was so expensive. And now you don't find, you know, Kodak film developing

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.120
[Guest]: thingies anymore.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.840
[Guest]: On every street in India, we would have had one little shop, which is a studio and they would

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.160
[Amit Varma]: develop your film and today they're all gone.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.520
[Amit Varma]: Except maybe for passport photos, small whatever. And you know, part of this is again that Indian

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.160
[Amit Varma]: mentality like earlier in this conversation when you were talking about how if Air India was to

00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:01.880
[Amit Varma]: shut down, other airlines would be able to buy pilots cheaper. And I thought a lot of my listeners

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.880
[Amit Varma]: would react to that by saying, oh, what about the poor pilots? They're going to get paid less.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, those same voices spring up now and say, what about the poor jet employees?

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.400
[Amit Varma]: There are, you know, whatever thousands of employees, what are they going to do?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's the scene effect. And, you know, like the show is, of course, called the scene

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.560
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen. And the unseen effect is that, look, there is value created in the economy and

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.880
[Guest]: all of these people eventually get absorbed.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:27.480
[Guest]: And see, you can't have it only one way. When markets work and there was a shortage of pilots,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.920
[Guest]: the price of pilots went up. And at that point, pilots didn't complain.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.480
[Guest]: Okay. But it's the same process that over the years, there'll be more and more young people

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:42.120
[Guest]: who will earn their wings and there will be supply of pilots and that will impact on the price. So

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.240
[Guest]: once we get used to the idea that supply and demand determines the price, then we just respect

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:53.560
[Guest]: that vast impersonal machine of the market and it will have its own ups and downs for each of us.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I also want to talk a bit about the price system and how that affects zombie firms and

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.120
[Amit Varma]: how that's, you know, how a system where you don't let zombie firms die prolongs downturns.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:18.200
[Unknown]: But we'll take a quick commercial break.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.200
[Unknown]: So,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.120
[Unknown]: they talk about the challenges faced by the 470 million plus children in India.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.600
[Unknown]: On What A Player, Akash Mehta and Siddharth Dedeja are joined by sportswriter Vivek Krishnan.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.040
[Unknown]: They talk about why Bangalore should be in the top four spots and a lot more.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.120
[Unknown]: On Dating is Garbage, three IBM dudes discuss their dating lives with Janam and share their

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.040
[Unknown]: stories around love, friendship and sex. On Simplified, we have the founder of Kranti

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.360
[Unknown]: Art Theory, Romario Rodriguez. He joins Chuck in Narendra as they talk about talent management

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.920
[Unknown]: and integrating various art genres. On Football Twirl, the boys are back to discuss last game

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.480
[Unknown]: week's EPL results and the heated battle for top four placement. On Gol Gappa, model turned

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.120
[Unknown]: actress Aditi Govindrikar joins Tripti where she talks about motherhood, practicing psychology

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.000
[Unknown]: and her career as a model. And with that, let's move on with your shows.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with the economist Ajay Shah about

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.120
[Amit Varma]: zombie firms. You should really make a horror film on this. If Bollywood kind of took this up,

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:04.680
[Amit Varma]: that would be great. You know, part of your analysis of zombie firms and all the pieces

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.920
[Amit Varma]: that you've written on it involves the state, the government not understanding how prices work

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.560
[Amit Varma]: fundamentally. Tell me a little bit about that. I mean, I've had episodes in the past on how

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.120
[Amit Varma]: damaging price controls and all of that. Just take me through.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:26.440
[Guest]: So I feel that a child can understand the price system. And yet, so many people seem to not

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.080
[Guest]: particularly think about the price system. It's it's just it's a great recipe for understanding

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:37.320
[Guest]: the world. It's like an invisible formula that is running the world. And it's a secret that only a

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:44.520
[Guest]: few people have. So let me let me talk a bit about how some of these things work. And at once,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.920
[Guest]: these are trivial observations. And yet they're interesting and powerful observations. So let's

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:56.680
[Guest]: start at planes once again. So we had some of these Boeing 737 MAX planes being grounded because

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.960
[Guest]: of safety concerns. And at about the same time, we had a disruption in jet airways. So the supply

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.440
[Guest]: of planes, the supply of seats on planes was adversely affected.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.280
[Amit Varma]: This is what economists would call a supply shock.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:17.640
[Guest]: It was a supply shock. Now, the fundamental nature of the price system is that the price

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.960
[Guest]: moves to equate supply and demand. OK, so there is a market and that market is not clearing that

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.600
[Guest]: there are 100 people trying to buy seats, but there are only 80 seats. There's a mismatch that

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:35.880
[Guest]: doesn't work. How the price system deals with it is that prices go up until 20 guys walk away.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:42.440
[Guest]: OK, so the price system rations out the limited seats that are available. So let's visualize that

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.960
[Guest]: there's a Bombay Delhi ticket, which was ordinarily some 7000 rupees. And now there's a shortage of

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.720
[Guest]: supply. So the price system. So let's just fix numbers. There are 100 people trying to buy seats

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.640
[Guest]: and there are only 80 available. So think of the price system as running an auction.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:03.160
[Guest]: It says, no, instead of 7000, I'm going to go to 7500. Some people in the room drop out and they

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:09.400
[Guest]: say, OK, at 7500, I'm not going to fly. Does that get you to 20 people dropping out? If not, let's

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.960
[Guest]: go to 8000 rupees for the ticket and you keep raising the price until there are only 80 guys

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:20.600
[Guest]: left. OK, that's the imaginary anthropomorphized price system. That's what the price system does.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.440
[Guest]: Now you go one deeper into that and you say, how much do you think I'd have to raise plane

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:33.880
[Guest]: tickets to get maybe 5% or 10% of the flyers to drop out? And you know what? Not a lot.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:40.680
[Guest]: Because for many people in India, flying is a choice. You may choose to not fly. You may choose

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.760
[Guest]: to use a train. You may choose to use a Volvo bus. So many people are on that borderline. Flying is

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.680
[Guest]: not some critical, essential thing. It's still something that we have a discretionary expenditure

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.720
[Guest]: on flying. So my prediction would be that a relatively modest movement in the price

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.320
[Guest]: would work to clear supply and demand. And so it's not a big disruption. There's no great

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:09.400
[Guest]: change in prices that occurs. It's nice. There's a 5-10% move in the prices. That's great for the

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.440
[Guest]: profitability of Indigo and Go Air and SpiceJet and all that. This is the time they deserve to

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.920
[Guest]: make money. Once again, there are people who will call this profiteering. And I say, look,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:25.720
[Guest]: this is the joy that these firms get in return for the long slog of fighting it out while Air

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.440
[Guest]: India was underpricing tickets and Jet Airways was there. And in those years, the other airlines

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:36.760
[Guest]: did badly. And this is the moment when you make money, because when the other guys exit is your

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.720
[Guest]: great opportunity to make money. We should not grudge them. This time, we should not be getting

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:47.560
[Guest]: angry at the fact that they are gouging customers or they are profiteering. This is markets. This is

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:53.800
[Guest]: the normal movement of the price system. If I may take an example from an unrelated industry,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:01.800
[Guest]: let's consider wheat. Now, wheat is a very cheap grain and wheat is a staple. And most of us don't

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:07.640
[Guest]: even know the price of wheat that goes into the chapati that we eat, which means that if there

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.440
[Guest]: was a supply shock, so imagine there was a drought, there was a failure of the Rabi crop in Punjab and

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.800
[Guest]: Haryana. Now, there is a problem. There is not enough wheat. So if the price of wheat goes up

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:23.720
[Guest]: by 5% or 10%, it would not work to clear supply and demand. You would need a large movement in

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:28.600
[Guest]: the price of wheat to make people change their behavior, to shift away from wheat to eating rice,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.240
[Guest]: to eating bajra, whatever. There would be adjustments. But for many people, you would

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.280
[Guest]: need a large movement in the price of wheat to elicit a change in behavior. And the term economists

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.680
[Amit Varma]: use for this is demand elasticity. So the demand elasticity of the wheat consumer is different to

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.520
[Guest]: the airline flyer. Exactly. So I was particularly comfortable at the prospect of a supply shock in

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:54.760
[Guest]: airlines, because our elementary intuition into the kind of behavior of flyers is that people are

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.920
[Guest]: highly sensitive to price. People are always conscious of what they're spending when they

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.440
[Guest]: buy a plane ticket. So you would expect a given supply disruption to get tidied over with a

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.360
[Guest]: relatively modest movement in the price. Whereas in something like wheat, you would get large

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.080
[Guest]: movements in the price. Once again, we shouldn't get angry about these movements. This is the

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.560
[Amit Varma]: price system. This is what prices do. And what a lot of people demand is that, you know, if the

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.400
[Amit Varma]: price of something, especially something essential goes too high, they say no, no, the government

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.000
[Amit Varma]: should control it. But, you know, I've had in I've had different episodes in price controls,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.560
[Amit Varma]: including an Uber. So I'll just kind of illustrate that with an example of two things that, you know,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:37.480
[Amit Varma]: letting the price adjust does one is let's say that there are 100 potential Uber customers at

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.120
[Amit Varma]: a given point in time who want a taxi, but there are only 50 taxis available. Now, if you fix the

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:47.800
[Amit Varma]: price, what happens is that is first come first serve, the first 50 people get it, the other 50

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.280
[Amit Varma]: are simply stranded. Now, you could be someone who has an urgent need, maybe you need to take your

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.360
[Amit Varma]: aging father to the hospital, maybe you need to catch a flight, you would be willing to pay much

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.240
[Amit Varma]: more, but you're stranded. And some of the people who happen to get the taxis, the lucky 50 could

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.320
[Amit Varma]: just be going out for an errand or you know, they could easily walk or take a bus or do something

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:10.360
[Amit Varma]: else is trivial, or they could just sit at home and watch Netflix. And they get it instead.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Whereas if you allowed the price to adjust, two important things would happen. One is that it

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.440
[Amit Varma]: would be allocated depending on how desperately someone wanted it because a guy who has to go to

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.280
[Amit Varma]: the airport, the guy who has to take his dad to the hospital, they'd be willing to pay more.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And someone whose need might be trivial, who can just you know, it's a five minute drive,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.520
[Amit Varma]: he can take an auto or walk would do that. So the price system effectively sort of sorts those guys

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.120
[Amit Varma]: out. The second and the more important thing that it does, which even applies to airlines or

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.960
[Amit Varma]: anything is that it sends information, it sends information to idle Uber drivers that listen,

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.000
[Amit Varma]: there is a profit to be made. And for their self interest to get into the market to fulfill the

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.160
[Amit Varma]: needs of the guys who would otherwise be stranded. And this information on both ends to both the

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.680
[Amit Varma]: buyer and the seller so that they can adjust is something that I think is unintuitive and unseen.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.840
[Amit Varma]: And people don't often get it that if you fix the price, you will have scarcity,

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.240
[Amit Varma]: it will be first come first serve. And a price system is beautiful, not just in the short term

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:15.880
[Amit Varma]: way of letting people get what they need based on their how urgent the requirement is, but also in a

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:21.240
[Amit Varma]: long term way of fixing that supply demand shortfall. So I want to talk about two things.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.840
[Guest]: If I may do this in reverse order, I'll come to what you just said in a moment. So I'm very happy

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:33.480
[Guest]: you brought up Uber, because there is something fundamental and profound about the gig economy.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:41.880
[Guest]: And it fits beautifully in our intuition about how markets work. There was a paper done by people at

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.760
[Guest]: the Center for Civil Society, which did some things that were quite interesting and an eye

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:55.160
[Guest]: opener to me personally. This was about Airbnb. And they found that one of the features of Airbnb

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:02.280
[Guest]: accommodations that users valued the most was a kitchenette. And it turns out that this is

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.600
[Guest]: something quite difficult to do within the normal government regulatory system. So the gig economy

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.920
[Guest]: is particularly good at discovering products and features in its own way that traditional

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:18.280
[Guest]: regulatory structures might fumble at. And I think that's an important lesson to all of us that

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:24.440
[Guest]: let that self-organizing system work and discover solutions as opposed to using regulation.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:30.200
[Guest]: That said, there is a role for regulation. And let me talk about your example. So first,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.720
[Guest]: I agree with everything you said, but now let me bring the cautionary note about the problem and

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:42.360
[Guest]: how we worry about it. The technical phrase we use in the field of the economics of public policy

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:49.400
[Guest]: is market failure. A market failure is a situation in which the self-organizing system,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:55.160
[Guest]: the individual decentralized decisions by all of us does not work so well, where something goes

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.720
[Guest]: wrong. And there are four categories of market failures. And the first of them and the most

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.080
[Guest]: important of them in one way is a monopoly. So when there's market power, when somebody's a

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:09.720
[Guest]: monopolist, things don't work so well. The monopolist will gouge the consumer. The monopolist

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:16.040
[Guest]: will artificially depress production and will extract consumer surplus. So nobody likes a

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.320
[Guest]: monopoly. And in a way, a lot of what we do in public policy is designed to combat these

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:28.520
[Guest]: monopolies. Now, when you go back to the beginning of the taxi industry, which is now like 70, 80

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:34.440
[Guest]: years old all over the world, the situation that was on the mind of everybody was like this, that

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.960
[Guest]: there is one taxi cab on a street and you are one consumer on the street and you go up to the taxi

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:46.200
[Guest]: cab and say, will you go there? And the guy realizes that you're desperate and he's a monopoly

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:53.080
[Guest]: in that brief moment and he can basically charge anything. So the regulation of taxi fares came

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:59.640
[Guest]: out of that problem. That in that situation, the bargaining power is entirely asymmetric. And when

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.680
[Guest]: there is only one taxi cab on the pavement, that person gets the ability to charge almost anything.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.920
[Amit Varma]: And also if I may interrupt, the problem in India is that the supply of those taxi cabs is also

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.520
[Amit Varma]: controlled by the government because there are only limited licenses they give out. So that,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, furthers the scarcity.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.560
[Guest]: Yeah. Same as the New York taxi cabs, which are artificially restricted.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.080
[Guest]: Yeah. But I just want to focus on that point that there is market failure in this problem.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:30.360
[Guest]: And that is why there is regulation of taxi cabs. Now, in the limit, the Uber surge pricing

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:37.880
[Guest]: can potentially collapse into that same problem. That in the central systems, Uber sees that many

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:43.960
[Guest]: customers are walking on a street with its app open. So Uber has a unique ability to see where

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.840
[Guest]: its users are. And it knows that on that street, there are only three taxi cabs. So you've got a

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:55.240
[Guest]: little monopoly. And now why not charge the moon for that? So everything you said is correct, that

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:02.200
[Guest]: the price will ration out the users and will allocate the scarce goods to the people who

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.720
[Guest]: want it the most. The high price will attract more consumers. But we do have a regulatory

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:13.720
[Guest]: problem, which is that it is perfectly feasible for Uber to turn into just a classic 19th century

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.600
[Guest]: fear of a monopolist. And I don't have an answer for how you would solve this problem. But I just

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:24.520
[Guest]: want to say that good economists do worry about Uber surge pricing as well. So I have like three

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.880
[Amit Varma]: responses to this. One is, of course, like, you know, when we see a market failure, we often think

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.200
[Amit Varma]: of the government has to step in. But I think as you know, public choice theory would tell you that

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.760
[Amit Varma]: government failure is far more endemic and in a sense, I would argue even inevitable because of

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.240
[Amit Varma]: the way the incentives are aligned. But leaving that broader point aside, you know, when you point

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.960
[Amit Varma]: out about, you know, your traditional Kali Pili taxi, how it's a monopoly for a moment when you

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.800
[Amit Varma]: want to go somewhere and he can charge whatever he wants. I don't know if I'd call it a market

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.360
[Amit Varma]: failure, because the reason that scarcity exists and that monopoly exists for the moment is because

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.200
[Amit Varma]: the state is interfering in the, you know, market entry.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.600
[Guest]: Even if entry were open, there will always be these dumb luck situations,

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:11.800
[Guest]: where, so to use a London analogy, it starts raining. Then suddenly, there is a surge of users

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.720
[Guest]: of taxis, and there will be a street where there will be two, three taxis. And so there's always a

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.240
[Amit Varma]: little lag, the market takes time to adjust, would you call that a market failure per se,

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:28.520
[Guest]: it would be a market failure if it persists. So if there is a monopoly, where within hundreds of

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.000
[Guest]: meters of walking distance, I really am down to only one or two producers, and they can essentially

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.840
[Amit Varma]: charge me very high prices, I would call that market power. And my third point is that, you

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:43.160
[Amit Varma]: know, the big issue with a monopoly, of course, is that they can charge high prices and expect

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.040
[Amit Varma]: consumers and so on. And competition keeps prices low and all of that. But a lot of the modern

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.880
[Amit Varma]: monopolies, monopolies, quote, unquote, that people tend to worry about, like an Amazon,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:00.120
[Amit Varma]: like a Facebook, like even an Uber, are actually not doing that. You know, even if they control

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.720
[Amit Varma]: the market, you see that the prices are very low, and the consumers are benefiting massively,

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.400
[Guest]: like from Amazon, for example. Well, you have to be cautious about that.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.320
[Guest]: There is a very plausible scenario that a firm like Amazon or a firm like Uber

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:19.160
[Guest]: becomes a monopoly at first with very low prices, drives off the competitors. Then after that,

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.120
[Guest]: you've got a network effect that the only game in town is Amazon or the only game in town is Uber,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.760
[Guest]: and then they would raise prices. So we should look this gift cards in the mouth.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.880
[Amit Varma]: But if that happens, surely then other entrants will come in.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.640
[Guest]: By that time, some of these games will be locked up because their network effects. So

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:41.960
[Guest]: the key network effect in these platform economies, like Uber, is that if I'm a driver,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.680
[Guest]: and I switch on the Uber app, I've got an order flow coming into that. And if I'm a customer,

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.080
[Guest]: and I open the Uber app, I will find more taxis. Once you've created this network effect,

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.120
[Guest]: then both sides tend to come to that platform because they don't have a choice.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:58.520
[Guest]: And that platform can charge supernormal pricing. So there are genuine concerns about these

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:03.640
[Guest]: markets. I am not quick to say we know solutions. But I think we know enough to be concerned.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.560
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough. I mean, as of now, I see Uber and Ola and even your, you know,

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.640
[Amit Varma]: Kalipili is playing outside and there's always video conferencing. So why do you even need to go

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:18.520
[Amit Varma]: anywhere? But I'm kidding. Right. So, so to kind of get back to one of the sort of interesting

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:23.000
[Amit Varma]: points you made is that if not for state interference, the different ways in which

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.280
[Amit Varma]: the state keeps zombie firms alive or zombie banks keep zombie firms alive, not just in the

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.200
[Amit Varma]: public sector, but the private sector. And in fact, I should ask you to elaborate on that,

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.000
[Amit Varma]: which I will. But one of the effects of that is that downturns are longer that if creative

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.640
[Amit Varma]: destruction is allowed, downturns would be much shorter and you give specific examples of that.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:47.640
[Guest]: Can you take me through that? So that the great economist Karl Marx taught us that it is in the

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.520
[Guest]: nature of the market economy that there are booms and busts. Okay, so there are periods of exuberance

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:59.560
[Guest]: and a great deal of investment. And then the competition hots up and margins go down and

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:05.880
[Guest]: some firms get into trouble. We in India have lived this twice in the period after the early

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:13.080
[Guest]: nineties. So let me tell the grand Indian story. The grand Indian story is that in from 93, 94,

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:19.000
[Guest]: 95, 96, we had investment boom and a great deal of entry took place. So new firms were born,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.480
[Guest]: new capacities were built. By 97, 98, 99, the world started becoming difficult and a lot of

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:31.080
[Guest]: firms got into trouble. Okay. And then we played that same story again, one more time. So in 2003,

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:36.920
[Guest]: four, five, six, seven, we had the most gigantic investment boom in India's history. And then from

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:43.880
[Guest]: 2011 onwards, we've been doing quite badly. Okay. And what's going on there is that there is a

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:50.520
[Guest]: surge of entry and then competition hots up. And then what? If you do not think about exit of

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.480
[Guest]: firms, if you do not think of firms closing down, firms getting sold, firms getting bought,

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.360
[Guest]: then that misery just drags on for more years. Okay. So what we see in our business cycle

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:08.920
[Guest]: research in India, so Radhika Pandey and Ela Patnaik and I have papers on measuring the

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:14.040
[Guest]: Indian business cycle. And we are struck by how these things take more time in India. And we've

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.800
[Guest]: often wondered what is going wrong. And when we compare with countries like the United States,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.560
[Guest]: it seems to us that one difference is that when things go wrong in the United States,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.280
[Guest]: they get rapidly cleaned up by the bankruptcy court. So people move fast. This isn't working,

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.640
[Guest]: you get into trouble, you're down on your payments. I would also underline one more

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.600
[Guest]: interesting feature here. All these things go faster when there is debt. Okay. So imagine I'm

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:46.520
[Guest]: an all equity firm. I'm 100% equity. Now I can sustain my own bad behavior for some time. But

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:52.040
[Guest]: when I have debt, I've got a Damocles sword on my head, I have to repay the debt. And when times

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:58.200
[Guest]: become tough, when I'm unable to produce the cash, then I will fail on one of my debt repayments.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.280
[Guest]: And then you just want to go quickly, move it through the bankruptcy court, just go as quickly

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.600
[Guest]: as you can to the bankruptcy court. Either the firm will be closed down, or it'll be sold to

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.400
[Guest]: somebody else, very often an existing firm. So market power will develop that some of the

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.200
[Guest]: survivors will achieve a little more clout in the market, be able to get the price up a little.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.280
[Guest]: And then profit rates will come back, investment will come back. So this whole cycle of life

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:26.680
[Guest]: is playing out slowly in India, because we are prolonging the business of firm exit.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And how does the state contribute to that, for example, is, you know, the NPS problem

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.120
[Amit Varma]: linked to that in the sense that bank or banks often keep these zombie firms alive by making

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.440
[Amit Varma]: loans and then servicing those loans and keeping them alive and throwing good money after bad,

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.640
[Guest]: and that prolongs the process. So this is very much a problem with our banking regulation.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:53.560
[Guest]: What should happen in banking regulation is, you see a borrower having distress,

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:59.000
[Guest]: you must rapidly mark down the value of that asset. Okay, so imagine you gave me a loan of 100,

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.680
[Guest]: you're supposed to be vigilant, you're the bank, you're supposed to be vigilant,

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.520
[Guest]: you're supposed to watch me and understand my early signs of distress. Very often,

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.600
[Guest]: you are my payments bank as well. So you're seeing my cash, you're seeing my revenues,

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.680
[Guest]: you very much know when my life is not going so well. And of course, there is beautiful

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:19.320
[Guest]: information in the accounting data, we can construct models of firm failure using the

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.160
[Guest]: accounting data. So put it together, it's not difficult for a bank to know when the

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.520
[Guest]: borrower is in trouble. Now the bank is supposed to make an estimate of what is the prospective

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:34.440
[Guest]: market value of that loan, that if you try to take your loan to me and sell it to somebody else,

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.160
[Guest]: what would that somebody else be willing to pay? What banking regulation has to do is to force

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.840
[Guest]: banks to recognize these losses. So if the fair value of the loan on the market is going to go

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:50.200
[Guest]: down from 100 to 60, then honestly, if I tried to sell this loan, the market would pay me 60,

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.760
[Guest]: then the bank should show that loss of 40 right now, because you've really lost that money.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:00.200
[Guest]: And you should show it right now. Now, as you will expect, no bank employee wants to do that.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.320
[Guest]: So that's what banking regulation is all about. Banking regulation is about forcing bank employees

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.600
[Guest]: to face up to the difficulties in their book and recognize these losses and take the losses

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:17.240
[Guest]: on the chin. Now, we haven't particularly done that. So RBI has long had a history of being kind

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:22.360
[Guest]: to banks, of being kind to the borrowers of banks. And so these things just slither on for years and

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:31.560
[Guest]: years. So in our calculations, we believe that if the Indian debt crisis and the banking crisis

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:41.880
[Guest]: had been dealt with in 2011, 2012, 2013, the cost of equity capital that was required inside Indian

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:49.720
[Guest]: banking would have been about 2-3 trillion rupees. Every year of delay has driven up that cost.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.480
[Guest]: Today, it would cost 8 or 10 trillion rupees to fix all the banks. Because when you don't solve

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.160
[Guest]: these things, they just become more and more expensive because you have to put more money

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:05.080
[Guest]: after the old money. So these are the sorts of things where a society has to be organized

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:11.560
[Guest]: around a philosophy of the market economy. We need all of us to come to grips with these concepts

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:18.520
[Guest]: that when there is a loan, there will be a fairly tough bankruptcy code in it. And the bank will

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.000
[Guest]: recognize these losses fairly quickly and so on. When a bank doesn't work, we will close down a

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.720
[Guest]: bank. These are all the concepts of a market economy, the discipline, the rigor of a market economy.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.120
[Guest]: And I think we're just at the early stages of learning how these institutional things work.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.960
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, the incentive of a politician who's always fixed on the short term and always

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.960
[Amit Varma]: fixed on the next election will always be to kick the can down the road. You know, bureaucrats will

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:47.960
[Amit Varma]: have the same inclination. And even bankers, for example, will not want to take the, you know,

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.720
[Amit Varma]: there is policy paralysis when they're worried that okay, if I give a haircut on this loan,

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:56.360
[Amit Varma]: if I take a haircut on this loan, I could be accused of corruption. And all of those factors

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.040
[Guest]: and those different incentives. We need to solve some of these things. So for example,

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:05.720
[Guest]: a banker being held responsible when there is a markdown on the loan, we have to build

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:14.440
[Guest]: the institutions, the machinery to protect people to find ways of determining what is the size of

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:22.280
[Guest]: the damage and so on. But this is the puzzle that we face that how do we create a society where

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:27.720
[Guest]: there is creative destruction. All the things we talked about fit under that puzzle that we need to

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:33.160
[Guest]: get entrepreneurs and employees used to the idea that firms come and firms go. We need to get

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:41.240
[Guest]: banks used to the idea that they will mark down the losses that have occurred and that sometimes

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:47.080
[Guest]: banks will go bust. We need a banking regulation capacity that will hawkishly monitor banks and

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.240
[Guest]: make sure that they do these things correctly. And in return is this very big prize. And that

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.440
[Guest]: very big prize is that we will finish off with downturns quickly. And it seems to me like a very

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.840
[Guest]: big prize that it would be a truly great thing for a country that you go through a great investment

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:06.200
[Guest]: boom, then there is really tough competition within a short time, maybe one year, two years,

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.840
[Guest]: you work it out, and then you restart the next big boom. Whereas in India, these things slide

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.240
[Amit Varma]: down for many, many years. So, you know, before we end the episode, I'd also then like you to,

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:20.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, elaborate on GST. You were obviously, as you mentioned, in the early days involved with

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:26.200
[Amit Varma]: designing the GST and what eventually got implemented by the Modi government is much more

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:33.160
[Amit Varma]: convoluted than people like you would have liked. And your case was that a good GST, a simple GST

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:38.760
[Amit Varma]: with one low tax with a good administrative structure would have helped kill off zombie

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:44.520
[Guest]: firms faster. Explain that process to me. What is happening in India is that we have too many

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:51.240
[Guest]: different rates. And it's become complicated, you could be an inefficient firm and take cover in

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:58.200
[Guest]: various clauses of the tax code, or you could take cover in tax evasion. So the sophisticated idea is

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:06.360
[Guest]: that the low productivity firms of India are hiding in violating regulations, in emitting

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:14.120
[Guest]: pollution when that should not be done, and in cheating on taxes. So the deep insight is that

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:23.000
[Guest]: if we are able to build a simple clean GST, again, my idea is very clear about 8-10% single rate on

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.840
[Guest]: single rate on everything, just a universal base, 8%, 10% on everything, a simple tax administration,

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.600
[Guest]: then a lot of the hassle is taken out. And the room for fudging around is taken out,

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:42.520
[Guest]: the room for discretion by the tax authorities taken out. And what that will do is it will

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:48.440
[Guest]: uncover the inefficient firms, the zombie firms, the low productivity firms that have been hiding

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:56.120
[Guest]: in the woodwork based on their ability to cheat on taxes. So big phenomenon we see in India is that

00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:04.280
[Guest]: we see large, sophisticated, high technology firms often tend to have a high compliance culture.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:12.200
[Guest]: They meet every pollution regulation, they meet every labour law, they meet every tax requirement.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.040
[Guest]: And that's great. We want those kinds of firms to thrive. But those firms don't really make

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.520
[Guest]: the kind of profit margins they ought to, because they're competing with a low productivity firm

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:26.200
[Guest]: that manages to cheat on regulation, to cheat on pollution, to cheat on labour law, to cheat

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.640
[Guest]: on taxation. So that's the big idea about the connection between GST and zombie firms.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.720
[Amit Varma]: And what you also pointed out was that before the GST came into play, and to some extent,

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.520
[Amit Varma]: maybe still now, is that you had taxation of transactions, which in public finance called

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.440
[Amit Varma]: bad taxes. And then what that forces companies to do is it creates an incentive towards vertical

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:53.400
[Amit Varma]: integration. The example you gave was that let's say if you are, you know, taxing, you know, when

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.640
[Amit Varma]: the engine of a car is made, and then when the car is put together, and if you're taxing them

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.880
[Amit Varma]: separately, then it's in a company's interest to bring it all in house in this vertical integration.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Whereas economies advance, the more there is specialization. And, you know, not having not

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:14.200
[Amit Varma]: taxing each transaction separately, and a GST basically treats them all as one reduces the

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.520
[Amit Varma]: incentive for vertical integration, you have more specialization, and everybody benefits.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:25.000
[Guest]: So this is the old Adam Smith idea, that we each of us specialize, and we get to doing something

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.080
[Guest]: very well. And that leads to a very nice intuition in a market economy, that a sophisticated economy

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:38.040
[Guest]: is one in which we transact more. Okay, so more turnover is the hallmark of a more sophisticated

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.840
[Guest]: economy. So we are arm's length firms, you are an engine producer, I am a car producer.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.800
[Guest]: But we still do a lot of business with each other separately, because I'm buying

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.840
[Guest]: your engine. Whereas in a less sophisticated economy, we vertically integrate these things

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.960
[Guest]: into vertically integrated monoliths. And this is a less efficient way of organizing society.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.880
[Guest]: So it's a very simple public finance idea that never tax transactions. A transaction tax is

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.920
[Guest]: always a bad tax. Because that way you are interfering with the very lifeblood of an

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.120
[Guest]: efficient society, which is many, many people doing many, many trades.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, to end the episode, a final question, you know, you've worked for a couple

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.680
[Amit Varma]: of decades now, you know, in public policy, you worked within government, you worked with the

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Ministry of Finance, do you see the thinking on this changing? Like, obviously, it's a good thing

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.360
[Amit Varma]: that JET was allowed to close down. But do you broadly see the thinking on this changing that

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.480
[Amit Varma]: we have a GST, even if it's not a perfect one? We have the IBC, even if it's not being implemented

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:45.240
[Guest]: perfectly? Do you see the mindset changing? I'm actually a little disappointed. So I started

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:53.000
[Guest]: out in India in 1993. And there was a lot of excitement about the market economy. And I felt

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.640
[Guest]: many people were very self consciously trying to understand what it means to live in a market

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:04.760
[Guest]: economy, and to adapt oneself and one's organisation into the concepts and frameworks of a

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.960
[Guest]: market economy. I think some of that intellectual construct has gone astray. And we are losing

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.480
[Guest]: sight of the foundations, we are losing a sense of the fundamentals. So I feel, in some ways,

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:25.160
[Guest]: we are less equipped in terms of the worldview and the framework today than we were in 1993.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.320
[Guest]: And it's a bit of a disappointment that this hasn't quite gone as I had hoped it would go.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.160
[Amit Varma]: This is a policy universe you're talking about?

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.880
[Guest]: This is the mind of all of us about how we think about markets, how we think about government,

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.240
[Guest]: how we think about the role of state.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting because 60% of India is born after liberalisation, right? So you would

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.960
[Amit Varma]: not expect these kind of reflexive worship of the state to sort of be there.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.280
[Guest]: I think a reflexive socialism is alive and well.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.000
[Amit Varma]: On that extremely hopeful note, Ajay, thank you so much for coming on the show.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:22.520
[Amit Varma]: My pleasure.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Advertising is dead. Yep, you heard me right. Advertising is dead.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.640
[Unknown]: We're all in the content business now. Let's not call it news, TV, radio, etc, etc. It's all content

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.720
[Unknown]: and we're in the middle of this weirdly exciting phase where all the borders and lines that have

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.880
[Unknown]: been drawn over decades has been swept away by this lovely thing called the internet.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.320
[Unknown]: We're a show where we don't dwell on just the stuff that is now, but rather the wider stuff

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.920
[Unknown]: about advertising, media, content and the whole goddamn circus surrounding it.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.040
[Unknown]: Tune in every Tuesday for a weekly unboxing of the mystery box we used to call advertising.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.520
[Unknown]: I'm Varun Duggirala, co-founder and content chief at The Gritch, and this is my new podcast.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:48.040
[Unknown]: Advertising is dead.
