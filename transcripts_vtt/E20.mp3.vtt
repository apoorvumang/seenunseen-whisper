00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200
[Amit Varma]: Let me begin the show with a confession.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.500
[Amit Varma]: I am God.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.100
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you heard me right.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600
[Amit Varma]: I am the Almighty God.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.900
[Amit Varma]: Now, it might seem kind of contradictory that I'm also an atheist,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.300
[Amit Varma]: but that's what happens when you lack self-belief.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.700
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, let me tell you about what happened yesterday morning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.900
[Amit Varma]: It was monthly admission day.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.400
[Amit Varma]: That day in the month when I admit dead souls into heaven.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.800
[Amit Varma]: So, I was sitting at the gates of St. Peter's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200
[Amit Varma]: and as the applicants trooped past me,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.400
[Amit Varma]: I gazed into their souls to determine if they were worthy of admission.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Had they been defenders of freedom all their lives?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.800
[Amit Varma]: Had they respected the personal autonomy of others?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
[Amit Varma]: Had they been kind and empathetic to their fellow humans?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Did they like golden fried prawns?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.900
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, so I chose a few thousand souls and they all gathered before me.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
[Amit Varma]: I said to them,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.300
[Amit Varma]: you will now get the rewards for your earthly good deeds.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.700
[Amit Varma]: You can have whatever your heart desires.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.500
[Amit Varma]: Who here wants an eternity of sensual pleasures?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
[Amit Varma]: The crowd was quiet.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.700
[Amit Varma]: No one stepped forward.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
[Amit Varma]: I tried again.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Who here wants to lie on a comfy divan

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
[Amit Varma]: with slaves in silk harem pants holding grapes above their face?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200
[Amit Varma]: No one volunteered.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Who wants to listen to some divine music?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Who wants to watch movies and eat seafood platters all day?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Who wants to do adventure sports without risk of death

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.500
[Amit Varma]: for you're already dead, ha ha ha!

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Who wants to watch CCTV footage from any place on earth?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.800
[Amit Varma]: Silence.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.900
[Amit Varma]: No one seemed to want any of these things.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300
[Amit Varma]: I was bemused.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600
[Amit Varma]: I asked them,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.600
[Amit Varma]: so what the hell do you want?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
[Amit Varma]: One of them shouted,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
[Amit Varma]: we want jobs.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Then all of them shouted in chorus,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.700
[Amit Varma]: we want jobs, we want jobs, we want jobs.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.400
[Amit Varma]: My mouth was open in divine astonishment.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.900
[Amit Varma]: Finally, the first guy said to me,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.600
[Amit Varma]: we want jobs.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Jobs is our idea of heaven.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.800
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.300
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.400
[Amit Varma]: This episode follows on from last week's episode

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.100
[Amit Varma]: in which I discussed the Right to Education Act

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.200
[Amit Varma]: with my guest, Vivek Kaul.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.700
[Amit Varma]: We ended the episode when Vivek pointed out

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.400
[Amit Varma]: that one of the unseen effects of our dismal education system

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.400
[Amit Varma]: was that so many people were simply unqualified for the job market.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Because there was a demand-supply mismatch at the level of education,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: there was also a demand-supply mismatch at the level of jobs.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.700
[Amit Varma]: Both Vivek and I feel that India is headed for a jobs crisis.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.500
[Amit Varma]: This jobs crisis is the unseen effect of decades of bad policy.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.700
[Amit Varma]: Our education system is messed up,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.500
[Amit Varma]: our labor laws are horrible,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: the license in Inspector Raj has crippled India,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.700
[Amit Varma]: and our agricultural policies have trapped our farmers

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.300
[Amit Varma]: in a vicious cycle of continuing poverty.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.500
[Amit Varma]: To talk more about this jobs crisis,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700
[Amit Varma]: I've got Vivek back with me in the studio.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back, Vivek.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
[Guest]: Thanks for having me over again.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.700
[Guest]: One of my friends, Varun Mitra, who was on the show,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.900
[Amit Varma]: a few weeks ago, often quotes Naipaul

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.900
[Amit Varma]: and talks about the million mutinies that are brewing in India.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.500
[Amit Varma]: And some of these recent mutinies that we've seen

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500
[Amit Varma]: are like the Jat agitation in Haryana,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.500
[Amit Varma]: the Patidar agitation in Gujarat,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700
[Amit Varma]: and all of them revolve around the question of jobs,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
[Amit Varma]: a subject which you've studied very deeply and are very worried about.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.700
[Amit Varma]: Can you expound on that a bit?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.900
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500
[Guest]: So, you know, the funny thing is that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.500
[Guest]: most of these job agitations

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.300
[Guest]: are centred around people who come from landowning castes.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.300
[Guest]: So, if you look at Jats in Haryana,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.300
[Guest]: or you look at the Patidar Patels in Gujarat,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.300
[Guest]: or the Marathas who have been having these silent rallies

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.300
[Guest]: all across Maharashtra, or the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.300
[Guest]: they are landowning castes.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.300
[Guest]: So, the point is that they never really needed jobs up until now.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.300
[Guest]: Now, what has happened is that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.100
[Guest]: over a period of time, the average landholding of a farmer

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.100
[Guest]: in India has come down dramatically.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.100
[Guest]: And as per the agriculture census of 2010-11,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.100
[Guest]: which is the latest data that we have,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.100
[Guest]: it's come down to around 1.1 hectare.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.100
[Guest]: And they've come down essentially because families are growing.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.100
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, every generation the land gets divided.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.100
[Guest]: You know, there is only so much of land going around.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.900
[Guest]: And so, the land keeps getting smaller and smaller.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.900
[Guest]: And, you know, as the land keeps getting smaller and smaller,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.900
[Guest]: the economies of scale keep going out of the window.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
[Guest]: So, farming is not as lucrative for them as it used to be.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.900
[Guest]: So, they need jobs.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.900
[Guest]: The problem, as we discussed in the last episode,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.900
[Guest]: is that the educational outcomes of people

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.900
[Guest]: who have been through the Indian schooling system,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.700
[Guest]: are really not up to the mark.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.700
[Guest]: And they want government jobs.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.700
[Guest]: So, the irony again is that, you know,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.700
[Guest]: the government jobs are going up at a very, very small pace.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.700
[Guest]: I mean, in case of many, many, in many states,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.700
[Guest]: the government jobs may have actually come down.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.700
[Guest]: In one particular state that I studied in the book was Haryana.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.700
[Guest]: And in case of Haryana, the rate of, you know, job acceleration

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.500
[Guest]: at the Haryana government level has been very, very slow.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.500
[Guest]: So, the funny thing is that, you know,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.500
[Guest]: I really don't know as to why are they asking for a government reservation

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.500
[Guest]: because the government doesn't really create jobs anymore.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.500
[Amit Varma]: So, give me a sense of the scale of the problem.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.500
[Amit Varma]: Like, this demographic dividend that we speak of, is it really a dividend?

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.500
[Guest]: What kind of...

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.500
[Guest]: Yes. So, you know, there is a lot of research around this.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.500
[Guest]: And essentially, the researchers try and estimate as to

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.300
[Guest]: you know, the number of new individuals entering the workforce every month.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.300
[Guest]: And the estimates vary.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.300
[Guest]: But on an average, they all come to, you know,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.300
[Guest]: something around 1 million individuals entering the workforce every month,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.300
[Guest]: which is around 1.2 crore every year,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.300
[Guest]: which is around half the population of Australia.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.300
[Guest]: Now, in the traditional sense of the term, you know,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.100
[Guest]: what does demographic dividend mean?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.100
[Guest]: It essentially means that when your working population,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.100
[Guest]: working age population is growing at a faster rate than your overall population,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.100
[Guest]: then the country tends to benefit.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.100
[Guest]: Because as these guys get jobs and, you know,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.100
[Guest]: they spend, you know, they earn money and they spend that money,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.100
[Guest]: the economy tends to grow at a much faster rate than it did in the past.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.100
[Guest]: So, there are examples of this demographic dividend happening

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.100
[Guest]: all over the world, including China.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.900
[Guest]: But then there are other examples in the Middle East

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.900
[Guest]: where the demographic dividend did not turn out to be a demographic dividend.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.900
[Guest]: You know, in India, the way we are currently going,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.900
[Guest]: there are not enough jobs being created

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.900
[Guest]: for the 1.2 crore individuals who are entering the workforce every year.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.900
[Guest]: So, there is a supply problem.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.900
[Guest]: There is also a problem at the level of people who are entering the workforce

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.700
[Guest]: in the sense that their learning outcomes, their educational outcomes are really not in place.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.700
[Guest]: I mean, as we discussed in the last episode,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.700
[Guest]: you know, people can't do basic reading, basic writing.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.700
[Guest]: And an average Indian is educated only until the primary school level.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.700
[Guest]: Now, which is not in this day and age,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.700
[Guest]: which is, you know, it's very difficult to be a primary school,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.700
[Guest]: pass out and find something of a proper job.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.500
[Amit Varma]: So, the tragedy of so many people coming into the workforce

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.500
[Amit Varma]: and those jobs simply not being there

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.500
[Amit Varma]: is really the unseen effect of a number of different policies

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.500
[Amit Varma]: which have, you know, perpetuated themselves over the decades.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.500
[Amit Varma]: One of them, of course, is education.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.500
[Amit Varma]: There is a mismatch at a fundamental level

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.500
[Amit Varma]: between the kind of education that people want or need

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500
[Amit Varma]: and the kind of education which the state

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.500
[Amit Varma]: in a supply-led, top-down kind of wisdom actually ends up providing.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.500
[Amit Varma]: And that creates a sort of a massive mismatch.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.300
[Amit Varma]: What would you say are the other huge causes

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.300
[Amit Varma]: for those jobs simply not being there?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.300
[Guest]: Okay. See, over the last few years,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.300
[Guest]: what has happened is that, you know,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.300
[Guest]: the Indian corporates have been heavily leveraged

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.300
[Guest]: and they've taken on a lot of loans from banks

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.300
[Guest]: and are no longer in a position to repay.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.300
[Guest]: And given that, they're not in a position to expand.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.300
[Guest]: So, when you're not in a position to expand,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.100
[Guest]: you know, you're not really creating jobs.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.100
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the rate of investment

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.100
[Guest]: in the Indian economy, it has fallen dramatically

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.100
[Guest]: over the last five years.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.100
[Amit Varma]: And what would you say are the fundamental causes for this?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.100
[Guest]: So, one is, as I said, that, you know,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.100
[Guest]: there is already, as far as industries are concerned,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.100
[Guest]: they already have enough capacity.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.100
[Guest]: That capacity in itself is not being utilized.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.900
[Guest]: The second thing is that, you know, labor laws in India

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.900
[Guest]: are extremely screwed up.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.900
[Guest]: So, anyone, you know, who wants to expand thinks twice.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.900
[Guest]: So, if you compare, you know, India with China,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.900
[Guest]: I mean, I don't have specific numbers,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.900
[Guest]: I don't remember specific numbers right now,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900
[Guest]: but India has many more small industries

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.900
[Guest]: whereas China has mid-level and larger industries.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.900
[Guest]: And the small industries in India continue to remain small

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.700
[Guest]: because it is unviable for them to grow bigger.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.700
[Guest]: You know, the moment they grow any bigger,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.700
[Guest]: the law of the land catches up with them

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.700
[Guest]: and they have to follow, you know, all these labor laws

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.700
[Guest]: and a lot of other laws, which makes it very, very difficult

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.700
[Guest]: for them to continue to be viable.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.700
[Guest]: And this is not something that, you know, I'm making up.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.700
[Guest]: Even the National Manufacturing Policy of 2011,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.700
[Guest]: which ultimately was copied and became the Make in India thing,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.500
[Guest]: elaborates on it in great detail.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.500
[Guest]: So, this is, you know, labor laws

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.500
[Guest]: and the fact that corporates are heavily leveraged

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.500
[Guest]: is, you know, one thing which is essentially

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.500
[Guest]: holding back capacity expansion.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.500
[Guest]: Two things actually, yeah.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.500
[Amit Varma]: So, at a policy level, let's say you're sitting right now in the PMO

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.500
[Amit Varma]: and Modiji calls you into the office for a meeting

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.500
[Amit Varma]: and he says, Vivek, I've heard your podcast,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.500
[Amit Varma]: I've read your book, amazingly insightful.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.500
[Amit Varma]: What should I do?

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.300
[Amit Varma]: These are the jobs that the nation needs.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.300
[Amit Varma]: If we are to make something of a demographic dividend,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.300
[Amit Varma]: otherwise it will be…

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.300
[Guest]: So, that's a, you know, that's a very long answer.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.300
[Guest]: I mean, I can give you a long answer, I can't give you a short answer.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.300
[Amit Varma]: Give me a long answer, let's go.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.300
[Guest]: So, you know, as we were talking before the podcast,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.300
[Guest]: you know, I mean, and as I have repeated through the last two podcasts,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.300
[Guest]: you know, most of the Indians coming out through the education system

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.300
[Guest]: are not really properly educated.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.100
[Guest]: So, their educational outcomes are not in place

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.100
[Guest]: and given that, the jobs that they can do are essentially,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.100
[Guest]: you know, low-skilled, what we call low-skilled jobs.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.100
[Guest]: Typically, you know, when people move away from agriculture into other jobs,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.100
[Guest]: they move into construction jobs.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.100
[Guest]: Now, if you look at construction,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.100
[Guest]: construction jobs essentially get created at, you know, three levels.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.100
[Guest]: One is when corporates expand, which isn't happening right now.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.900
[Guest]: Two is when the government tries and builds physical infrastructure,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.900
[Guest]: which is happening right now.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.900
[Guest]: But then, you know, the government has a limitation

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.900
[Guest]: on the amount of money that it can spend in any given year.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.900
[Guest]: The third thing is real estate.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.900
[Guest]: Now, this is where, you know, things can change

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.900
[Guest]: and India's so-called demographic dividend can find jobs

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.900
[Guest]: despite the fact that they are not very well-educated

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.700
[Guest]: because real estate does create a lot of low-end jobs.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.700
[Guest]: The problem is that in the top, you know, in the biggest eight cities in India,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.700
[Guest]: which is where the real estate market really is,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.700
[Guest]: the demand for homes is simply not there.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.700
[Guest]: And the reason for that lies in the fact that prices have reached a level

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.700
[Guest]: where people simply can't buy.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.700
[Guest]: So, for real estate demand to pick up, prices need to fall.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.500
[Guest]: And when prices will fall, then, you know, demand will pick up

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.500
[Guest]: and then construction activity will pick up

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.500
[Guest]: and then all these people, you know, not all, but, you know,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.500
[Guest]: a significant portion of the people entering the workforce will find lower-level jobs.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.500
[Guest]: Now, the question is why are real estate prices not falling?

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.500
[Guest]: You know, this is something that everybody keeps talking about.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.500
[Guest]: And, you know, a simple as well as a complicated answer for it

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.300
[Guest]: is the fact that a lot of real estate is essentially run in the black economy.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.300
[Guest]: Now, you know, why does a builder want you to pay a certain portion

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.300
[Guest]: of the money that you pay him in black?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.300
[Guest]: You know, I mean, let's say you're an honest taxpayer

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.300
[Guest]: and when you're buying a home to live in,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.300
[Guest]: when you pay a builder in cash, you're converting your white money into black.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.300
[Guest]: But why is the builder asking for that money in cash?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.300
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, you know, a simple answer is that

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.100
[Guest]: he does not want to pay tax on it. Fair enough.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.100
[Guest]: But there are other answers as well.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.100
[Guest]: Now, he needs that cash because he needs to, one, pay his suppliers in cash.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.100
[Guest]: Two, he needs to pay the politician who is backing him in cash.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.100
[Guest]: Why does he need a politician?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.100
[Guest]: He needs a politician because our real estate regulations,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.100
[Guest]: you know, across states are so complicated

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.100
[Guest]: that anyone who does not have the blessings of the local politician

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.900
[Guest]: and the local bureaucrats would not be in real estate business in the first place.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.900
[Guest]: Now, this also explains to a large extent as to why we do not have,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.900
[Guest]: you know, a pan-India real estate company, if you were to look at it.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.900
[Guest]: In fact, we don't even have a pan-Mumbai real estate company.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.900
[Guest]: There are, you know, players who concentrate in different pockets of the city,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.900
[Guest]: which explains to you, you know, many things.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.900
[Guest]: So, again, so the question is, why does the politician need money in cash?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.700
[Guest]: The politician, obviously, you know, one is because he is corrupt.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.700
[Guest]: He also needs money in cash because he has to fight an election every five years.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.700
[Guest]: And elections in India now have become very, very expensive.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.700
[Guest]: In fact, some time back, I was talking to, you know, a pollster

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.700
[Guest]: and he was telling me that even municipal level elections,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.700
[Guest]: if you are serious about contesting a municipal level election in a big city in India,

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.700
[Guest]: it can cost you a few crores.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.700
[Guest]: And you may not win the election, you know, at the end of the day.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.500
[Guest]: There you go, my dreams of being a corporator. Vivek, what have you done?

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.500
[Guest]: So, you know, so the point I'm trying to make is,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.500
[Guest]: so the politician needs cash to fight elections.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.500
[Guest]: So, unless electoral funding is cleaned up, you know,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.500
[Guest]: if we can clean up this entire process of electoral funding,

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.500
[Guest]: I mean, like in the US, the electoral funding is very, very open.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.500
[Guest]: If in India we can have some sort of a system, you know, like the American system,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.500
[Guest]: I mean, not that the American system is perfect.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.300
[Guest]: They have, you know, there are problems there as well.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.300
[Guest]: But at least it's clean and it's, you know, it's transparent.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.300
[Guest]: So, if we can have some sort of a similar system,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.300
[Guest]: then, you know, the electoral financing part gets cleaned up.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.300
[Guest]: Now, once the electoral financing part starts to get cleaned up,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.300
[Guest]: then, you know, your real estate guy suddenly does not need all the black money that he needs as of now.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.300
[Guest]: Then the prices start to come down, then we create jobs.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.100
[Guest]: But the point is that, you know, this is not like, you know,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.100
[Guest]: a government taking a single decision and a solution emerging.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.100
[Guest]: There are multiple decisions at multiple levels which need to be taken.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.100
[Guest]: I mean, take the fact that, you know, take agriculture for that matter.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.100
[Guest]: Now, as of now, if you have agriculture land,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.100
[Guest]: I mean, you would have discussed it in your past podcast.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.100
[Guest]: If you have agriculture land, you can only sell it as an agriculture land.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.900
[Guest]: Now, the change in land usage depends on the local government.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.900
[Guest]: And which is where they make all the money that they do, all the corrupt money that they do.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.900
[Guest]: Where there is discretion, there is rent-seeking.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.900
[Guest]: Where there is rent-seeking. So, these are the things, you know,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.900
[Guest]: these are fundamental reforms that are needed.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.900
[Guest]: And it's all, believe me, it's all connected.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.900
[Guest]: I mean, you know, if these things are cleaned up, you know,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.900
[Guest]: some amount of jobs will start to get created at least in construction.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.700
[Guest]: If labor laws are cleaned up, you know, manufacturing can,

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.700
[Guest]: you know, small manufacturers can hope of, you know, becoming a little bigger.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.700
[Guest]: And there is enough research, you know, globally which shows that jobs are created.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.700
[Guest]: Big companies don't create jobs. Jobs are created when small companies become bigger.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.700
[Amit Varma]: And simultaneously, as I spoke about in previous episodes with other guests,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.700
[Amit Varma]: you know, in our service industry, jobs are actually going because of artificial intelligence.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.500
[Amit Varma]: Even in manufacturing, there is a limit to how many new jobs can now spring up because of automation.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.500
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all of these decades, we had these terrible labor laws and terrible regulations

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.500
[Amit Varma]: which kind of crippled the manufacturing industry.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.500
[Amit Varma]: But even if they were all to be removed overnight, we might just have missed the bus.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.500
[Guest]: We might have missed the bus. But the point is, you know, what else can you really do?

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.500
[Amit Varma]: What else can you really do?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.500
[Amit Varma]: It's pretty depressing when you look at the causes of, you know, our shortfall in jobs

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:36.300
[Amit Varma]: because it starts right from education because you have, you know, a top-down command and control kind of system

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.300
[Amit Varma]: where market inputs don't really dictate what kind of schools we have and what kind of education people get,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.300
[Amit Varma]: which leads to a lot of underqualified or non-qualified people emerging into the workforce.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.300
[Amit Varma]: And they don't have jobs because the manufacturing industry has been stymied

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.300
[Amit Varma]: with these terrible labor laws and regulations and so on.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.100
[Amit Varma]: Plus, there is a whole mess of what you described as happening in real estate.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.100
[Amit Varma]: Plus, you have tens of millions of people in this country literally trapped in agriculture

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.100
[Amit Varma]: because they're not allowed to get out. It's just very messy.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.100
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me, in the years to come, like one of my friends has expressed this fear to me in the past

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:21.100
[Amit Varma]: that we only have 20 years to sort things out because after that, instead of getting younger as we are now,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.100
[Amit Varma]: we start getting older and people start moving out of the workforce.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.900
[Amit Varma]: And if we don't fix it by then, we are in for, A, a disaster and B, a lot of social unrest.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.900
[Guest]: Which is, you know, social unrest has already started. I mean, it's happening.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.900
[Guest]: I mean, it's not very in the face right now, but it's there.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.900
[Guest]: Now, whether that will turn into something like an Arab Spring is something that one cannot speculate about.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.900
[Guest]: But the funny thing is, you know, I mean, as we were discussing before the podcast,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.700
[Guest]: the official rate of unemployment in India is just 5%.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.700
[Guest]: Yeah, why is that? I don't get it.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.700
[Guest]: So, it's the way you calculate unemployment, basically.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.700
[Guest]: So, there are two methods and in the first method, you know,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.700
[Guest]: if you are employed for 183 or more days during the course of the year,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.700
[Guest]: you are considered to be employed.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.700
[Guest]: So, you can be unemployed for 182 days in a year and you would still be considered to be employed.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.700
[Guest]: So, as per this method, the rate of unemployment is 5%.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.500
[Guest]: Then we have another method which is even more interesting,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.500
[Guest]: which basically sees that have you been employed for the last 30 days.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.500
[Guest]: You know, whenever the survey happens, they check this.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.500
[Guest]: So, if you have been employed for the last 30 days, you are considered to be employed.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.500
[Guest]: As per this method, the rate of unemployment is 3.7%.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.500
[Guest]: But then, you know, even though these data points mislead,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.500
[Guest]: there is another data point that the government puts out,

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.500
[Guest]: which tells you the real state of unemployment in India,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:54.300
[Guest]: is that only 60% of, a little more than 60% of people who look for jobs

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.300
[Guest]: during the course of the year, I mean 12 months of the year are able to find jobs.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.300
[Guest]: In case of rural India, this number is even lower at 52%.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.300
[Guest]: So, only 52% of rural India has a job all through the year.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.300
[Guest]: So, this tells you the real problem of unemployment in India.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.100
[Guest]: So, what we have is not unemployment, but underemployment.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.100
[Guest]: You know, everybody is doing something,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.100
[Guest]: but then that something is really not productive enough.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.100
[Amit Varma]: This is a very scary story you have laid out Vivek

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.100
[Amit Varma]: and it just reminds me of how privileged both of us are.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.100
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for coming on the show.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:46.900
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit for having me.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.900
[Amit Varma]: And then I said, you want jobs?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.900
[Amit Varma]: I can give you jobs.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.900
[Amit Varma]: I can give you anything.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.900
[Amit Varma]: I am God.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.900
[Amit Varma]: Jobs, come out and say hello to these wonderful people.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:29.700
[Unknown]: And as I said this, Steve Jobs stepped out from behind me.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.700
[Amit Varma]: He profiles LGBT people from all across the country

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.700
[Amit Varma]: and some of the stories are really poignant.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:22:12.500
