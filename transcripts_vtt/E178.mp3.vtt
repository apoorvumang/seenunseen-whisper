00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
[Amit Varma]: I remember a time when journalism was different.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.040
[Amit Varma]: It was a battle to find the truth, not a fight over what is the truth.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.540
[Amit Varma]: It was the first draft of history, not a first draft of competing fictions.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.760
[Amit Varma]: It was cold, rational reporting, not heated partisan polemic.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.120
[Amit Varma]: Indian journalism has always been mediocre.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.160
[Amit Varma]: But there was a time when the intent, at least, was to get at the facts, not to push specific

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.380
[Amit Varma]: narratives.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.180
[Amit Varma]: From facts to narratives, from asking measured questions, to shouting, shouting, shouting.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.520
[Amit Varma]: From being a corrective to politics, to becoming a tool of politics.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.480
[Amit Varma]: How did we get here?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480
[Amit Varma]: What happened?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.920
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm a 70s kid, like my guest on today's show, Nidhi Rajdhan.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.440
[Amit Varma]: When we grew up in the 80s and 90s, there was a broad consensus on what the facts were.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.960
[Amit Varma]: And while everyone distrusted politics, we more or less trusted the media.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.440
[Amit Varma]: It might often have been inept, mostly mediocre, but it was well intentioned.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.960
[Amit Varma]: All that has now changed.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.360
[Amit Varma]: Our media is a mess, especially news television, but not only news television.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.480
[Amit Varma]: I have watched this as an alarmed observer on the sidelines, writing columns and pontificating

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.560
[Amit Varma]: from a distance, but never really in the thick of the battlefield.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.740
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi has been in the middle of the action though, helping us to figure out a changing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.360
[Amit Varma]: India since she first joined NDTV in 1999.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.720
[Amit Varma]: NDTV, the training ground for so many prominent journalists, once looked like it would set

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.800
[Amit Varma]: the benchmark for good reporting.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.400
[Amit Varma]: Now it looks like an outlier in these shrill, polarized times.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.880
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi, for these 21 years, has embodied that cliche about how journalists must comfort

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.440
[Amit Varma]: the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, but the comfortable are not comfortable with

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.800
[Amit Varma]: being afflicted and independent journalism in India is being attacked in so many different

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi is now headed to Harvard to teach journalism there, and I managed to catch her in the transition

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: to share her insights on the seen and the unseen.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.240
[Amit Varma]: In the last few months, I have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours watching TikTok.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.600
[Amit Varma]: You might consider it an addiction and indeed TikTok always gets my dopamine going.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I don't call this addiction though, I call it sociological research or even taking one

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840
[Amit Varma]: for the team.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.800
[Amit Varma]: I have designed a new course called TikTok and Indian society, and I invite you to be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
[Amit Varma]: part of it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.840
[Amit Varma]: I believe that TikTok reflects real India better than any other outlet for news and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
[Amit Varma]: entertainment.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.400
[Amit Varma]: Our mainstream sources of news and entertainment are controlled by elites who just don't get

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.760
[Amit Varma]: small town India or village India or poor India or even young aspirational India.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.900
[Amit Varma]: This TikTok has blown away these barriers and given the means of production to everyone.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.680
[Amit Varma]: It has empowered people who otherwise did not have a voice or a platform.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'm blown away by the talent I see every day on this app.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.160
[Amit Varma]: And my eyes are also opened to so many shades and nuances of India that I had not noticed

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160
[Amit Varma]: before.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.200
[Amit Varma]: We see the worst of India in our prejudices and attitudes, but also the best in our creativity

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
[Amit Varma]: and our descent.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.400
[Amit Varma]: My course is unique as it will be conducted surprise, surprise on WhatsApp and will involve

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.400
[Amit Varma]: both my thoughts on the many teams I discuss as well as hundreds of amazing videos that

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.120
[Amit Varma]: illustrate my points.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.040
[Amit Varma]: I am charging rupees 5,000 for this course to head on over to cnunseen.in slash TikTok

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.080
[Amit Varma]: to enroll for TikTok and Indian society.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: My new course over at cnunseen.in slash TikTok.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.320
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Thanks so much for having me, Amit.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.880
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi, before we get to sort of talking about journalism and your career in journalism,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.200
[Amit Varma]: tell me a bit about sort of your life before that, like your dad, of course, was Maharaj

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Krishan Rajzan, who used to be editor-in-chief of PTI, noted journalist.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, you grew up across the world in London and in New York, and I read somewhere

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.400
[Amit Varma]: that you wanted to be a doctor when you were a kid, not a journalist.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, tell me a bit about that.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.200
[Amit Varma]: What were your sort of formative influences like and why did you decide to turn to journalism?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.440
[Guest]: So yeah, that doctor thing is funny because, well, first, like all children, I wanted to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.760
[Guest]: be an astronaut.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: And that pretty much died by the time I turned 12, because I realized I didn't like flying

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
[Guest]: very much.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.160
[Guest]: So outer space was really out of my league.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.720
[Guest]: And then, yeah, I kind of got interested in medicine, and I took up science.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.200
[Guest]: We'd moved back to India, and I took up science as my stream of study in classes 11 and 12.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.160
[Guest]: And I remember my dad coming to me and saying, why do you want to spend so many years of

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.080
[Guest]: your life studying, do something creative?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.400
[Guest]: And you know, my mother was shocked.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.080
[Guest]: She's like, how can you tell your daughter, who wants to take up this noble profession,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.480
[Guest]: like a good Kashmiri girl, you know, she wants to be a doctor.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.080
[Guest]: And you know, he said it because, you know, when he was in school and college, he never

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.480
[Guest]: wanted to be a doctor or an engineer, which was the only thing that Kashmiri parents wanted

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.860
[Guest]: their kids to do.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.280
[Guest]: And I think he was very keen that I do something creative.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.160
[Guest]: And then around that time, when I actually joined college, which was LSR, television

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.800
[Guest]: started to become big, you know, NDTV was, I mean, there was The World This Week and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.520
[Guest]: NDTV had come on to Star News.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.960
[Guest]: And so TV was becoming more and more interesting.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.760
[Guest]: And my mother said that, would you ever be interested in this?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.680
[Guest]: And I realized that actually I would, because I guess without realizing it, we grew up in

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.560
[Guest]: a household where news was just part of life, like brushing your teeth.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.560
[Guest]: You know, you get up in the morning, read the newspaper, you have to watch the evening

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.800
[Guest]: news at night.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.240
[Guest]: And so I always enjoyed keeping up with current affairs.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.120
[Guest]: But I didn't want to follow my dad's footsteps and become a print journalist, because I thought

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.160
[Guest]: there would be too many comparisons.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.640
[Guest]: So I was reluctant at first, but when I realized that there was another medium by which to

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.840
[Guest]: do journalism, which would be something I could claim as my own.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.720
[Guest]: That is why, you know, broadcasting happened.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And that's how it happened.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And what was sort of your formative influences there?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, I mean, this in two senses, one, of course, is in the narrow sense of, after you

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.040
[Amit Varma]: want to be a journalist, who are you looking at as role models?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.840
[Amit Varma]: And where are you sort of imbibing those values from?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.160
[Amit Varma]: But also in a broader sense, you know, intellectually, what were your influences?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, what were the books you remember from that time, which maybe shaped the way

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.240
[Amit Varma]: you thought about the world and so on?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.080
[Guest]: Well, I think, obviously, my dad was a big influence in terms of just journalistic ideals

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.160
[Guest]: and values.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.760
[Guest]: And he's always been someone who's really been an ideal journalist in that way.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.200
[Guest]: And someone I've really looked up to.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.880
[Guest]: But I remember as a kid growing up in the US, reading about Watergate, and, you know,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.680
[Guest]: looking at journalists, broadcasters like Sam Donaldson, you know, there was that famous

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.000
[Guest]: you know, hold on, Mr. President, he even wrote a book by that title.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.640
[Guest]: And, you know, that that really stuck with me as a kid that, you know, a reporter can,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.920
[Guest]: you know, stop the leader of the free world and say, you know, hold on, you have to answer

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.520
[Guest]: my question, you know, and and that's how powerful journalism is, and how it should

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520
[Guest]: be.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.160
[Guest]: Unfortunately, nobody does that here.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.520
[Guest]: And nobody would.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.900
[Guest]: But these were some of the things that really influenced me growing up watching broadcasters

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.680
[Guest]: like Sam Donaldson, like Tom Brokaw, and seeing the kind of journalism that they did.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.200
[Guest]: And it's so different to what we see on TV on Indian TV today, certainly.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.560
[Guest]: And of course, seeing it in my own home.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.120
[Amit Varma]: And how much of a difference did it make, you know, relative to your colleagues, for

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.360
[Amit Varma]: example, the fact that, you know, you spend time in London and New York growing up, that,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, your father, of course, was a journalist, and you were exposed to perhaps much more

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.320
[Amit Varma]: than many of your colleagues might have been like, you know, I remember when I was like,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm also a 70s kid like you, and when I was growing up in the 80s, in the 90s, print journalism

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.040
[Amit Varma]: was considered sort of a last resort, you fail to do your medical and your engineering

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.040
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.320
[Amit Varma]: And print journalism was in the last resort.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, at all my time in journalism, I've sort of bemoaned the poor editorial standards

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.760
[Amit Varma]: and writing standards and all of that TV was different, because TV was new, it appeared

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.480
[Amit Varma]: like there was a brash new generation coming up.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.360
[Amit Varma]: And within that, you were someone who had, you know, perhaps a little more, a slightly

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.200
[Amit Varma]: different experience, while growing up in terms of exposure to media and culture and

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200
[Amit Varma]: so on.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Did that make much of a difference per se?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And within television?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.480
[Amit Varma]: Did you feel that, you know, you were a lot apart from the older school, the print journalists?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.800
[Guest]: You know, the thing is that I think the kind of childhood I had was very privileged, and

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.360
[Guest]: I was really lucky that I had it.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.800
[Guest]: For both me and my brother, it was, as you rightly said, it just exposes you to a completely

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800
[Guest]: different world.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.440
[Guest]: I was four plus when we moved to England.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.160
[Guest]: And so I did my initial sort of nursery schooling here.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.800
[Guest]: And, you know, my whole worldview of things, I think for all of us, our early childhood

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.520
[Guest]: and those formative years are really important in terms of how we, our values are shaped,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.240
[Guest]: how we look at the world, and perhaps the most important.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.600
[Guest]: So especially in the US, because by the time I was in New York, you know, I was in a class

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.160
[Guest]: of people where everybody was, everyone was basically an immigrant.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.880
[Guest]: You know, I grew up in a vibrant city where, you know, my best friend was an African American,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.000
[Guest]: another close friend of mine, who's still my closest friend today, half Bangladeshi,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.960
[Guest]: half German, very sort of eclectic, you know, childhood in that sense, in terms of the people

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.440
[Guest]: you interacted with, grew up with.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.160
[Guest]: So I've had a very liberal outlook towards life, towards everything as a result of that.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.840
[Guest]: So that really shaped me.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.880
[Guest]: And schooling there was very, very different.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.640
[Guest]: And coming back to India was actually very hard, Amit, because, you know, the school

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.080
[Guest]: system here was different, the emphasis on rote learning, etc, that wasn't something

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.640
[Guest]: that I was used to, though I did pretty well as a student here also.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.480
[Guest]: Also the language because, you know, I'm a Kashmiri.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.240
[Guest]: So in my house, we grew up speaking Kashmiri always, and we grew up speaking English, obviously.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.200
[Guest]: But Hindi is not our mother tongue in that sense.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.160
[Guest]: So Hindi for me was, you know, Amitabh Bachchan films and, you know, stuff like his dialogues

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.200
[Guest]: in Hindi movies, which I really enjoyed, but I wasn't fluent at all in Hindi.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.120
[Guest]: And so when I came back, I was 13.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:52.120
[Guest]: And it was really hard, but, you know, getting rid of my American accent so that I could

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.920
[Guest]: fit in with people to fit in with my classmates, because you really feel like an outsider.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.840
[Guest]: I didn't know what Antakshari was, because that was like, those were the nice days, you

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.880
[Guest]: know, when kids actually played Antakshari and stuff like that, when they were like 14.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.160
[Guest]: So you know, like, I didn't know all those Hindi songs, I watched Hindi movies, but because

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.280
[Guest]: I wasn't comfortable with the language, but I'm proud of the fact that when I did decide

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.800
[Guest]: to take that plunge into TV and all of that, you know, when I was in college, and I would

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.280
[Guest]: read the Navbharat Times every Sunday, out loud, with a Hindi English dictionary next

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.400
[Guest]: to me, because I knew that if I have to be a broadcaster, if I have to be a journalist

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.920
[Guest]: period in this country, I have to know Hindi.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.280
[Guest]: And I have to know it well enough to be able to communicate on air.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280
[Guest]: And I did it.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.840
[Guest]: And I anchored, I have been a bilingual anchoring reporter all these years, I anchored on our

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.200
[Guest]: Hindi channel for many years, I've anchored the US elections with Pankaj Pachauri in Hindi,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.520
[Guest]: with Vikram Chandra in Hindi, I've anchored the budget in Hindi.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.040
[Guest]: And I'm really, really proud that I was able to do that.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.280
[Guest]: Because this it wasn't easy.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.960
[Guest]: It wasn't the language that sort of came naturally.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, they often say of cricketers when they play a beautiful shot that oh, he

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.320
[Amit Varma]: makes it look so easy.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think one can have the sort of the same impression about news anchors not realizing

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.560
[Amit Varma]: that sort of hard work that goes in behind the scenes.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm just thinking aloud, I was you know, when you mentioned how your cosmopolitan background

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.640
[Amit Varma]: and you know, being in a school in New York that had, I mean, which is basically a city

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.160
[Amit Varma]: of immigrants shaped your outlook to the world.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.680
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud, I'm therefore wondering that, how true would you say from all your

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.560
[Amit Varma]: experiences of meeting people throughout the last 20 something years, which is such a core

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560
[Amit Varma]: part of your job?

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.880
[Amit Varma]: How true is it?

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Would you say that people are often shaped by their circumstances that their ideology

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.880
[Amit Varma]: can come out of what they have been exposed to and are there for example, the other thought

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.120
[Amit Varma]: that sort of strikes me is that despite the Kashmiri Pandit background, you don't sort

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.000
[Amit Varma]: of have the resentments that many Kashmiri Pandits do for, you know, understandable reasons

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: in their case.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on this?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.440
[Guest]: Well, I agree with that.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.040
[Guest]: I do think the circumstances we are exposed to shape who we are.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.360
[Guest]: And for instance, on the Kashmiri Pandit question, I'll tell you something.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.440
[Guest]: I mean, I think it's because you know, it's not that my family wasn't affected by it.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.360
[Guest]: It was my grandparents had to leave with their bags packed overnight and flee.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.680
[Guest]: And my father and my mother would always tell my brother and me that look, we shouldn't

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.360
[Guest]: blame entire communities for what happened.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.880
[Guest]: My father still has a very romantic notion of how he grew up in Kashmir.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.360
[Guest]: And he truly believes, I know a lot of Kashmiri Pandits don't and they get angry when some

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.080
[Guest]: of us say this, but he truly believes in that idea of Kashmiriyat, that his best friends

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.720
[Guest]: growing up were Muslims.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.640
[Guest]: And whenever we would visit Kashmir every year, we would always go to Khil Bhawani,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.300
[Guest]: which is our most revered temple there.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.920
[Guest]: But on the way back, we would also go to Hazrat Bal Mosque, to the shrine, and offer prayers

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920
[Guest]: there as well.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.680
[Guest]: And my parents would always say, my dad in particular, that, you know, this is who we

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.680
[Guest]: are.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.360
[Guest]: This is how we must respect all religions.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.920
[Guest]: And that yes, a lot of things happened during the Pandit exodus, which have made people

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.920
[Guest]: angry and bitter for understandable reasons.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.200
[Guest]: But that the Muslim community has also suffered, that we cannot tarnish entire community, etc.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.840
[Guest]: So I've grown up with those values.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: And I guess I don't blame those from my community who have actually borne the brunt of that

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.440
[Guest]: exodus and the kind of atrocities that happened with them and their families.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.960
[Guest]: Obviously, you know, they are shaped by that anger.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.480
[Guest]: They are shaped by that very deep and real pain that they went through.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.360
[Guest]: So I don't think that I can sit in judgment on, you know, how they feel.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, I'm proud of the fact that I do meet many of those, they may not

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.320
[Guest]: be vocal on Twitter, like some others, but I do meet many Kashmiri Pandits also, who

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.280
[Guest]: despite having gone through what they have, are, you know, sort of willing to, to heal

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.880
[Guest]: and heal together.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.440
[Guest]: And I would hope that that sentiment would eventually prevail.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.840
[Amit Varma]: I was going to ask a question about this towards the end of the show.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.720
[Amit Varma]: But as we brought up Kashmir, I'll ask it now, I just want to quote from the introduction

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.680
[Amit Varma]: you wrote for your book, Left, Right or Center, where you spoke about how when you went to

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Srinagar to shoot your documentary there, and you've written quote, when I reached Srinagar,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.080
[Amit Varma]: many people already recognized me from television, they knew I was a Kashmiri Pandit.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.160
[Amit Varma]: At first I was wary, my mother's fears ringing in my head, but very soon that fear dissipated.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.040
[Amit Varma]: I was welcomed warmly like a long lost daughter who had finally come home.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And with that, my faith in the idea of Kashmiriyat and the idea of India was restored just a

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600
[Amit Varma]: little.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.400
[Amit Varma]: And I quote, and elsewhere in the introduction, you talk about how Gurmehar Kaur, who lost

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.960
[Amit Varma]: her father in combat at Kargil in 99, once when she was chatting with her mom about it,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.160
[Amit Varma]: her mom said that, listen, Pakistan didn't kill him, war did.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there's also the story about Yogendra Yadav, who after what his family

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.920
[Amit Varma]: had suffered during partition was named Salim, you know, that was his middle name, which

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.280
[Amit Varma]: is again, such a beautiful sentiment.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me and you know, I've also traveled through Pakistan covering cricket

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.920
[Amit Varma]: and all that.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.120
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that, you know, despite all the harsh, shrill, angry rhetoric that

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.920
[Amit Varma]: is there in the airwaves and so on, when you actually go down to the level of the common

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.120
[Amit Varma]: person, these tribal distinctions don't seem to matter so much.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.280
[Amit Varma]: There's another strand that kind of plays out.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think it is then that when it comes to the media, or it's the ugliness that gets

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.240
[Amit Varma]: accentuated and exacerbated?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.360
[Guest]: I think that's just the nature of the medium, Amit.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:27.800
[Guest]: And the fact is that social media in particular is a medium in which ugliness gets amplified

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.240
[Guest]: to infinity, you know, and it brings out I think the worst in people.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.920
[Guest]: It also brings out a lot of good in people.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.080
[Guest]: I'm not saying that, but, you know, honestly, I remember, I mean, I'm in that generation

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.400
[Guest]: like you, you know, we had life without social media, and it was so much simpler when you

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:50.880
[Guest]: look back, so much nicer, and now look how complicated and, you know, mentally exhausting

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880
[Guest]: it is.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.060
[Guest]: And I just think that that's, that just brings out the worst in all of us.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.060
[Guest]: And I agree with you.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.920
[Guest]: I mean, like, when you actually talk to people on the ground, the sentiments will be very

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.640
[Guest]: different from what the establishment, you know, will actually do.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.280
[Guest]: Pakistan is a prime example of that.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.640
[Guest]: I have friends who are Pakistanis, very good people, and who are brave enough to take on

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.960
[Guest]: the ISI and their own army very publicly journalists in particular, in fact, I think their media

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.720
[Guest]: is far more free, frankly, and brave than ours.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.920
[Guest]: And that's another story.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.080
[Guest]: But, you know, even in Kashmir, my own experiences have been like that.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:31.000
[Guest]: But, you know, I mean, social media tends to reduce everything to these dangerous binaries,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.320
[Guest]: which in itself is another conversation.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come to that a little later.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's go to your early days in television in the 90s, which is, of course, before social

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.600
[Amit Varma]: media and you know, sort of as a viewer watching the evolution of television, I remember it

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.720
[Amit Varma]: from the early days when Pranav Roy did The World This Week, which was, you know, this

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.640
[Amit Varma]: one hour weekly thing we all used to look forward to on the only channel we had.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, I remember the video news magazine, News Track used to come out and

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.640
[Amit Varma]: there was such a leisurely pace to everything.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've also spoken about how when you first joined news television, people had so

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.320
[Amit Varma]: much more time to do their stories, you had a couple of days, or, you know, longer to

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.680
[Amit Varma]: put a single story together.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me a bit about what those early days were like, like, you know, you obviously

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.960
[Amit Varma]: joined NDTV as a bright eyed 21 year old, what did you expect?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.400
[Amit Varma]: What did you find was different?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.160
[Amit Varma]: What did you learn in those early years before things started changing in the 2000s?

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.440
[Guest]: You know, it was so different.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.400
[Guest]: I joined in 1999.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.160
[Guest]: And those were like the golden days of television.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.360
[Guest]: And I've seen, I've seen the whole transition from that into what has happened now, which

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.480
[Guest]: is both sad and, you know, strange.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.320
[Guest]: But the early days were incredible, because there was a lot of idealism, there was not

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: that kind of cutthroat competition from other news channels.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.560
[Guest]: And honestly, NDTV was and in my view, continues to be the best television news organization.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.160
[Guest]: I mean, there is no I mean, it's not a coincidence that all the major sort of players on the

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.440
[Guest]: television news broadcasting stage in India today have their origins in NDTV, some good

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.840
[Guest]: and some not so good, and you know who I mean.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.480
[Guest]: But you know, the basic training, they all came from the NDTV stable by and large, you

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480
[Guest]: know.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.200
[Guest]: So it was incredible, because this was an organization at that time that was, you know,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.840
[Guest]: we had money, we had resources, we had the platform, you know, you could spend days traveling

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.200
[Guest]: for a story.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.040
[Guest]: Like I said earlier, as you pointed out, you would spend time on that story.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.840
[Guest]: There was a whole series we used to do for many years actually called India matters,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.160
[Guest]: where all of us would take turns every month for one week in a month, we'd be assigned

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.480
[Guest]: to India matters where we traveled into rural India and sort of uncovering India invisible,

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.160
[Guest]: going beyond the regular politics, the day to day stuff that happened in Delhi.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.120
[Guest]: And you know, you had the budgets for that, you know, I remember when I joined, I spent

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.480
[Guest]: just two, three weeks in orientation, which was great.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.400
[Guest]: I mean, you know, you you're actually being taught now there is no time for this orientation

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.840
[Guest]: are new reporters who come, come, they train for a few days and bam, you know, you're out

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.760
[Guest]: in the field because there's no time.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.920
[Guest]: But those were different days, you know, you you were leisurely taught about how editing

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.720
[Guest]: is done, camera work is done, etc.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.920
[Guest]: And you know, I walked into Pranoy's room one day, and I said, Can I go to Tibet?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.840
[Guest]: I want to do a documentary there and Pranoy was like, Yeah, of course, you should apply

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840
[Guest]: for a visa.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840
[Guest]: I did.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.440
[Guest]: And I got a visa like a year later and I went.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.640
[Guest]: So you know, I can't do that now, nobody can because there ain't no money for that kind

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640
[Guest]: of stuff now.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.400
[Guest]: But you know, I one day I went in, you know, I said, I'd like to go to Iran.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.800
[Guest]: And if I get an interview with the foreign minister, can I stay back for a week and do

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.080
[Guest]: a documentary?

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080
[Guest]: Of course you can.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.240
[Guest]: I went, I did that.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.720
[Guest]: And, you know, shot there for like seven, eight days.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.100
[Guest]: That was an adventure, you know, came back, put it on air.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.240
[Guest]: So I think, I mean, those were really the golden days, like I said, and that's, of course,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.400
[Guest]: linked to the financial health of an organization, among other things.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.760
[Guest]: And over time, you know, things for the media as a whole have become much more difficult.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And we know, we know that.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.280
[Amit Varma]: And we'll discuss sort of the transitional points.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.920
[Amit Varma]: But I have a newbie question, which is that even then, you know, NDTV was, of course,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.520
[Amit Varma]: a 24 hour channel.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.080
[Amit Varma]: So what gave you guys, you know, the luxury to sort of take so much time and do so much

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.040
[Amit Varma]: thoughtful work and do the sort of stuff that you did with, you know, Uncovering India and

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
[Amit Varma]: so on?

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.140
[Amit Varma]: Did you have more people?

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.480
[Amit Varma]: Was it just more budgets?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Was the news structured differently?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600
[Guest]: What was so different?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.760
[Guest]: It was structured differently also, Amit, because you didn't have bulletins, like every

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.520
[Guest]: hour, you know, you had them, I remember, alternate hours, and then the flagship bulletin

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.200
[Guest]: was your nine o'clock, you had more people, you had more budgets, so you could actually

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.200
[Guest]: spare a bunch of reporters to be doing something completely different, somebody on an investigation

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:59.520
[Guest]: for Star News Sunday, which was like, you know, your long format magazine show on Sundays,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.300
[Guest]: you had people you could spare for India Matters, which was a completely different team altogether.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.120
[Guest]: So it's all those things together, which which made it possible to and because you didn't

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.240
[Guest]: have that sort of some other channel breathing down your neck.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.200
[Guest]: And those kind of rivalries you could actually I mean, I spent three days doing a rainwater

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.160
[Guest]: harvesting story, for God's sake, I was damn proud of, you know, but that was a new thing

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.120
[Guest]: then, you know, and I was like, you know, I showcased what rainwater harvesting was about.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.280
[Guest]: I think one of my I think the first story I did a P2C for, if I'm not mistaken, was

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.040
[Guest]: about condom vending machines in government offices, which is super awkward to shoot.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.120
[Guest]: But I had to interview, but I spent two days on that I didn't have to like, I didn't have

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.440
[Guest]: to rush into it and do it in two hours, you know.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.520
[Guest]: So I mean, like nowadays, there's no question, even I would tell a reporter, what do you

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.280
[Guest]: need some bites and, you know, some shots and none of that then, you know, there was

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.920
[Amit Varma]: a very nice feature on Jon Stewart in the New York Times.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from something he said with Struck A Chord, where he said, quote, 24 hour

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.600
[Amit Varma]: news networks are built for one thing.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's 9-11.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.440
[Amit Varma]: There are very few events that would justify being covered 24 hours a day, seven days a

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440
[Amit Varma]: week.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.520
[Amit Varma]: So in the absence of urgency, they have to create it, you create urgency through conflict,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, as this sort of process started playing out, how did it affect you?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Was it sort of frustrating, because then the pressure on the channel becomes to amplify

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.400
[Amit Varma]: every damn little thing that you cover, which means that, you know, one, everything is shallow,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.280
[Amit Varma]: because you're spending less time on it.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:42.440
[Amit Varma]: And two, you can't go deep into, you know, areas which may not be of interest to mass

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:47.000
[Amit Varma]: viewers like rainwater harvesting, I presume, how was that process like in coming to terms

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Guest]: with it?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.840
[Guest]: I completely agree with what Jon Stewart has said there.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.200
[Guest]: And that is part of the problem that, well, the two things in India, frankly, unfortunately,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest]: for whatever reason, you don't even have to manufacture urgent news, because there's always

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.320
[Guest]: something happening.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:08.880
[Guest]: But the fact is, on a serious note, that even the most sort of anodyne news items, which

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.720
[Guest]: can just pass off as a graphic or be put on the ticker, increasingly, I found in the last

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.360
[Guest]: few years, in particular, there is a thing about mini, but we need an OB on this right

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360
[Guest]: now.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.680
[Guest]: It's not that big a story, but because the other channel is doing it, we need to like

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.520
[Guest]: stay with this for like 10 minutes and play it up and, you know, get reactions from x,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.520
[Guest]: y, z.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.960
[Guest]: And sometimes you don't even get a chance to process, you know, what it is that you

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.640
[Guest]: are doing an OB on, you know, like, one day, I was suddenly asked to

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.040
[Guest]: anchor on an RBI press conference.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.880
[Guest]: And I actually I said, No, because I said, I am not an expert on the RBI.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.420
[Guest]: And let's not pretend that anchors know everything.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.320
[Guest]: My expertise is in politics and foreign policy, you want me to, you know, come on and do something

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.520
[Guest]: on that, I'd be happy to, because that's what I've done my entire life, but I'm not suddenly

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:04.040
[Guest]: going to be an expert on the repo rate, which, frankly, I need to read about and understand,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.360
[Guest]: I'm not going to pretend I know anything about it.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:13.560
[Guest]: So we're in that age, Amit, right now, where everything is like, is big, you know, and

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.080
[Guest]: for me, personally, that is part of the reason why I became extremely tired of it.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.440
[Guest]: You know, in the last few years, while I love television, and I've actually walked away

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.720
[Guest]: from television, from the best primetime slot that one could have, I mean, you know, some

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.920
[Guest]: people say that, I mean, what else do you want?

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.760
[Guest]: Great executive editor, nine o'clock slot, it's not that it's just that the nature of

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.080
[Guest]: the medium now just doesn't let you breathe anymore.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.520
[Guest]: You know, and you're just, it's just constant, there is, I mean, your brain just doesn't

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.960
[Guest]: stop working.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960
[Guest]: It's exhausting.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.280
[Guest]: It really is.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.060
[Guest]: And television has just become like, this competitive thing to put your senior anchors

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.280
[Guest]: on air for everything.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.520
[Guest]: Every small thing is now a big thing.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.400
[Guest]: So I think that's, you know, something we all need to reflect on.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.560
[Guest]: But that's the way it is now, with so many news channels out there.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And I once did an episode with Ashok Malik, where he gave me an interesting insight onto

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.440
[Amit Varma]: this race to the bottom, where he said that, you know, when you have channels paying such

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.640
[Amit Varma]: enormous license fees to just get into the business, you know, the pressure to recoup

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640
[Amit Varma]: is immense.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.240
[Amit Varma]: So they have no choice but to sort of chase TRPs in this sort of frenetic race, and then

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.120
[Amit Varma]: everybody gets caught up in that and there's no getting out.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, do you think structural reasons are like that are part of the problem that

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.840
[Amit Varma]: because entry barriers are so high, once you get in, you cannot really chase a niche and,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, do whatever you, you know, do rainwater harvesting showreels, for example?

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.160
[Guest]: Well, why not?

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.080
[Guest]: I mean, it did work for us.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.840
[Guest]: It's not that I mean, NDTV is India's most trusted news brand repeatedly for a reason.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.920
[Guest]: So I think it's not that it didn't work.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.600
[Guest]: And look, these bark TRPs, frankly, are TRPs that NDTV has challenged all the time, they

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600
[Guest]: don't make any sense.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.280
[Guest]: If you if you look at how our shows do on YouTube, for instance, or even Tata Sky, the

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.720
[Guest]: numbers are completely different from what bark puts out.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.760
[Guest]: So there's so much I mean, NDTV has gone public with this about the kind of manipulation that

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.800
[Guest]: happens, you know, with ratings.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.080
[Guest]: So I do think that at least there used to be a space for this.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.960
[Guest]: And I'd like to believe that there is, you know, still space for it, although sometimes

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.560
[Guest]: one gets so disheartened that even during something like this coronavirus pandemic,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.440
[Guest]: when TV viewership has jumped immensely across the board, because people were in lockdown,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.320
[Guest]: they were at home, people wanted information.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.280
[Guest]: If your bark ratings are still reflecting that Republican times now are your leading

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.680
[Guest]: news channels, then I begin to wonder the choices that people are making, you know,

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.240
[Guest]: and is this what they wanted to see?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.320
[Guest]: Because those channels were not giving you information, they were still doing Tablighi

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.580
[Guest]: Jamaat 24 hours a day.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.040
[Guest]: And is that what people want to see?

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.800
[Guest]: So I said, you know, a lot of these numbers don't make sense to me just because of how

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.600
[Guest]: they just don't add up.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.280
[Guest]: You know, they actually don't add up if you just look at online and how we're doing online

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.400
[Guest]: and how we're doing on bar.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.760
[Guest]: So I don't know, I still think there is space for this kind of good journalism.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.840
[Guest]: And that's why NDTV will not become tabloid, it is not going to be tabloid.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.800
[Guest]: It's not been easy for us.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:14.320
[Guest]: But NDTV would never take the sort of times now route, we're just genetically completely

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320
[Amit Varma]: different.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.920
[Amit Varma]: One of the shifts I've noticed over the past two decades, exacerbated by social media,

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.920
[Amit Varma]: but you know, it began even before that was that, you know, when we were growing up in

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.960
[Amit Varma]: the 80s and 90s, there was a broad consensus on the truth.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.000
[Amit Varma]: There wasn't a dispute about what is actually happening.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, your different media outlets may chase different angles or have different opinions

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.080
[Amit Varma]: and something.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.920
[Amit Varma]: But you know, everyone kind of agreed on what the facts were.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:45.080
[Amit Varma]: What has now happened is one that people get their information from many more sources,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.400
[Amit Varma]: media itself is so fragmented.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there is no longer that consensus on the truth, people have their ideologies

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.480
[Amit Varma]: or their visions of the world and whatever.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And they just want information that sort of confirms that and we all get sucked into these

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:05.080
[Amit Varma]: echo chambers, which gets shriller and shriller as you know, you compete to sort of express

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.800
[Amit Varma]: your own virtue within your selected echo chamber.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.140
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that, you know, then you begin to wonder what is this news thing?

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:18.880
[Amit Varma]: Is it just a battle of competing narratives that do facts even matter anymore?

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, barring, you know, small islands of excellence like NDTV and a handful of online

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.220
[Amit Varma]: independent sites, not the mainstream media.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.720
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me that everything else is about, you know, this big battle of narratives.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.720
[Amit Varma]: How does that sort of make you feel?

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I understand that NDTV has had its core values and stuck to them throughout.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.640
[Amit Varma]: But more and more in these times, it seems like an outlier.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640
[Guest]: It is an outlier.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.580
[Guest]: And I completely agree with you because now it's become like the media has become ideologically

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.800
[Guest]: divided in this country, the way pretty much everything else has.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:59.000
[Guest]: And that's to me has taken, I mean, what I see, frankly, is a decay of an important institution

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.560
[Guest]: in a democracy, which is a free press.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:08.520
[Guest]: And I see that not just in isolation, Amit, I see it as a larger decay of democratic institutions

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.160
[Guest]: in the country as a whole, whether it is parliament.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.640
[Guest]: I mean, how much work our parliament committee is doing, for example, how much look at the

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.320
[Guest]: way bills are rammed through parliament without any proper debate and discussion, you know,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.720
[Guest]: even the finance bill.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.080
[Guest]: So you may have a big majority in parliament and you may have an overwhelming majority,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.540
[Guest]: but democracy is not about just the majority.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.600
[Guest]: It's about taking everyone along.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.280
[Guest]: So look at the way parliament has been diminished.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.280
[Guest]: Look at the way the judiciary has abdicated its responsibility with the honorable exceptions,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.800
[Guest]: I may say, of some high courts, which, to my surprise, in the last few months have woken

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.920
[Guest]: up, for instance, to the migrant crisis in a way that, you know, should really sort of

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.800
[Guest]: wake up the Supreme Court of India, which waded into it much later.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:02.440
[Guest]: But if you look at the Supreme Court of India, which has sort of turned the other way on

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:08.280
[Guest]: human rights issues, constitutional issues, on habeas corpus, it's changed the meaning

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.560
[Guest]: of that, particularly when it comes to Kashmir.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.520
[Guest]: So when you see what is happening to us as a democracy right now, I feel that the decay

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.720
[Guest]: of the media and the decline of the media as an institution in India has to be seen

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.240
[Guest]: in that context.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.480
[Guest]: I think in India, a big crisis also stares at us because of the way, I mean, you raised

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.080
[Guest]: this question earlier about, you know, the structures and being dependent on, you know,

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.200
[Guest]: certain parameters to, for instance, make money and TRPs.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.480
[Guest]: That's part of the problem, that your media is actually dependent on the government for

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.760
[Guest]: advertisements to survive.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.240
[Guest]: And that whole model and that whole system is utterly flawed.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.320
[Guest]: We have a media that does not, you know, stand together and is not institutionally strong

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.960
[Guest]: enough to fight back from government pressure or government intimidation.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.960
[Guest]: I mean, you'll have the odd statement from an editor's guild, but please tell me, what

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.360
[Guest]: is the Press Council of India?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.520
[Guest]: What is its role?

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.900
[Guest]: When has it ever done anything meaningful?

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.280
[Guest]: Does anybody listen to the Press Council of India?

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.600
[Guest]: You know, so that to me is the saddest thing, actually, just seeing the sort of decay.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.360
[Guest]: I mean, you look at America, you see that in America also mainstream media is constantly

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360
[Guest]: under attack.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360
[Guest]: The president hates them.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.900
[Guest]: He abuses them, but he cannot ignore them.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.320
[Guest]: He still gives interviews.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.080
[Guest]: He still does press conferences.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.120
[Guest]: He still went to the New York Times editorial board and did an interview with them, despite,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.960
[Guest]: you know, all the names he calls the New York Times, right?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.600
[Guest]: So institutionally, the media there is much stronger.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.320
[Guest]: And you know, so they can call their president a liar and not worry about repercussions.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest]: And here, we are the complete opposite.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.640
[Guest]: You know, we have become ideologically divided.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.920
[Guest]: The truth is a casualty.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.160
[Guest]: I'm sorry.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.720
[Guest]: But some of these news channels, to me, are not news channels.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.920
[Guest]: I don't know what to categorize them as.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.320
[Guest]: They are, I mean, I used to laugh at them, Amit, at one point of time.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.280
[Guest]: I used to think it was funny that you had these 10 windows and you had the anchor screaming

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.640
[Guest]: like a banshee about something.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.960
[Guest]: But I don't think it's funny anymore.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.320
[Guest]: And I realized in the last couple of years in particular, that what they're doing is

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.960
[Guest]: they're putting targets on people's backs.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.360
[Guest]: You know, they're demonizing entire communities.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.160
[Guest]: They demonize Kashmiris all the time.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.440
[Guest]: They like, they want to paint all Kashmiri Muslims as pro-Pakistani terrorists, which

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.160
[Guest]: Kashmiris are not.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.640
[Guest]: They will question the credentials.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.160
[Guest]: They have equated anyone who criticizes the government as that, as being anti-national

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160
[Guest]: or unpatriotic.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.560
[Guest]: You know, the government is not the nation, right?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.640
[Guest]: So they whip up that hysteria, they whip up and they're doing it now.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.200
[Guest]: I mean, even with China, it's embarrassing when you look at the screen grabs of, you

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.600
[Guest]: know, last 10 days ago that they said stuff like Nepal kneels and China bows.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.880
[Guest]: And do you know how badly those kind of headlines and captions play out in those countries?

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.200
[Guest]: People are very, very sensitive to that.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: You know, Nepalese friends have called and said how angry and sort of hurt they are seeing

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: those kind of captions.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.040
[Guest]: Look what Nepal did to you.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.400
[Guest]: You know, and China bows and you know, stuff like that.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:16.960
[Guest]: I mean, I think they're doing far, far more harm than we realize to our social fabric,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: not just to journalism, but to society.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
[Guest]: And I think it's really, it's just dangerous now.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: It's not funny anymore.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, since you mentioned Nepal, this anecdote came to mind about this pitched battle

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.240
[Amit Varma]: that took place, I think, in the late 30s or 1940s, when people were discussing what

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.400
[Amit Varma]: shape an independent India could take, which was then in the future, of course, and Mahatma

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi said something to the effect of the Nizam of Hyderabad could be the new ruler,

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.360
[Amit Varma]: at which Veer Savarkar took offense and said, no, we must be a Hindu kingdom.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.520
[Amit Varma]: The king of Nepal should be the king of India.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And contrast that with where we are, you know, I'm just thinking of the sort of contrast

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.640
[Amit Varma]: that you've seen, like in one of your interviews, you quoted your dad as telling you, quote,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.520
[Amit Varma]: don't editorialize and get all your facts right, check with more than one source, get

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.480
[Amit Varma]: it right, do not get it first, stop quote.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And in contrast, when I was reading your introduction to left, right and center, I'll quote what

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.320
[Amit Varma]: you said, quote, it is now anti-national to even question the government.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.960
[Amit Varma]: So most TV channels today simply don't do it.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.360
[Amit Varma]: In an interview to NDTV, Arun Shourie called them North Korean TV channels that essentially

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.840
[Amit Varma]: parrot the government line.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.240
[Amit Varma]: The raids on NDTV in June marked a turning point for free press in India.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.320
[Amit Varma]: As Shourie said, it was meant to kill the chicken to frighten the monkeys, quoting a

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Chinese proverb, stop quote.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And but just looking at how the media is structured in India, this seems so inevitable to me.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.480
[Amit Varma]: For example, as you point out, the government has so many levers with which it can pressurize

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.480
[Amit Varma]: media.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.160
[Amit Varma]: In the sense, just looking at the print media, you look at HD or TOI, they have so many other

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.080
[Amit Varma]: business interests, somebody will have a chemical factory somewhere, there can be an IT raid

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.080
[Amit Varma]: there.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.320
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, so much of media runs basically on money coerced from us, you know, it runs

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.720
[Amit Varma]: on government advertisements, and the government uses that to basically buy the media and use

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.400
[Amit Varma]: it as a lever to pressurize the media.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.400
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you also, besides the carrot, you also see the stick, where you know, cases

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.960
[Amit Varma]: of sedition are filed on journalists, and there is a sort of a chilling effect in play

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, NDTV itself, of course, has taken a lot of pressure, there was a campaign to

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.320
[Amit Varma]: get advertisers to quit NDTV.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there have been income tax raids and all of that, you know, so just looking

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.800
[Amit Varma]: at this, I mean, do you think there's and the only sites that really survive are small

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.120
[Amit Varma]: online sites, which are not dependent on all of this, like, you know, the very brave people

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.240
[Amit Varma]: at alt news and the wire and scroll and so on.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.600
[Amit Varma]: But beyond that, you know, do you think and but they are just below the radar mostly,

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.840
[Amit Varma]: that's kind of why, but, you know, it's that sort of one of the reasons that you're kind

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.280
[Amit Varma]: of glad to be getting I mean, are you glad to be just getting out of this?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.180
[Amit Varma]: Are you thinking to yourself right now, not my circus, not my monkey, I've had enough

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.180
[Guest]: of this shit?

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.180
[Guest]: You know, partly?

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.180
[Guest]: Yes.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.180
[Guest]: To be honest, I'm it.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.240
[Guest]: But the thing is that I live and breathe news.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.240
[Guest]: Okay, I love it.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.080
[Guest]: I mean, it's, it's the only thing I know how to do well, I've been a reporter, editor everything.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.200
[Guest]: And so like, for me, this is a passion, which is why it makes me so angry to see what has

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.720
[Guest]: happened to the media in the last few years.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.520
[Guest]: And, and, you know, it also just happened to be the right opportunity.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.600
[Guest]: I mean, it's that, you know, this Harvard thing, you know, it came along.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.400
[Guest]: And I thought to myself, I mean, I told them, I said that, Are you sure you're interested?

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.600
[Guest]: I mean, because I've never taught before.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.800
[Guest]: And I'm not, I mean, it's very different to sort of talk to a roomful of people as a one

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.840
[Guest]: off and take questions.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.680
[Guest]: But they were like, No, we're looking for people who don't come, you know, with that

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: baggage of teaching and would rather be able to teach through their own experiences and

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: so on.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.020
[Guest]: So I thought to myself that, you know, this is a great opportunity for me to actually

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.200
[Guest]: take a step back from the madness of this place, and to learn.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.120
[Guest]: For me, this is an opportunity to be a student all over again, because I think I will be

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.980
[Guest]: the student, it's not that I will be, you know, the teacher, this gives me an opportunity

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:10.660
[Guest]: also to just learn to be in a very different atmosphere, where I learn from the students

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.660
[Guest]: I interact with.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.360
[Guest]: And from the faculty there, I can go and sit in lectures.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.320
[Guest]: And I'm not relocating Amit, by the way, it's a visiting role, I'll be back and forth between

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.800
[Guest]: Delhi and Boston.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.240
[Guest]: So for me, it's the best of both worlds.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.760
[Guest]: And maybe I'll, you know, start working on a book on the media or something, you know,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.680
[Guest]: while, you know, while I spend time here in India.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.280
[Guest]: But it's nice to be, you know, for 21 years, this is all I've done all the time, like,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:42.920
[Guest]: it's 24 seven, it's been TV, earthquake ho gaya tum jao, plane crash ho gaya tum jao,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.480
[Guest]: bombing ho gayi jao, you know, go to the spot.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.480
[Guest]: And of course, in the last few years, it was every time something happened, go and anchor

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480
[Guest]: it.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.920
[Guest]: But you know, now it's nice to take a step back.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.840
[Guest]: And it still connects me to journalism.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.640
[Guest]: So it doesn't take me away from what I love.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.680
[Guest]: But it hopefully will give me a different perspective.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.960
[Guest]: And let me give something back to it, because I'm still very idealistic about it, for some

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960
[Guest]: reason.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I don't get to speak to too many idealistic people.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.100
[Amit Varma]: And I'm really glad you're getting a break after all these years, taking a grind and

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:26.440
[Amit Varma]: our listeners will also now get a break, but we'll be back because we have a lot to discuss.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.000
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.280
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.320
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.480
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.400
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.200
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.920
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.160
[Amit Varma]: I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics of

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:04.040
[Amit Varma]: producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.160
[Amit Varma]: So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.660
[Amit Varma]: And that involves you.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.200
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.560

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Nidhi Rahsaan and Nidhi, so far, we've sort of been talking about how

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.480
[Amit Varma]: television has changed, but over the, you know, the 21 years that you've been in it,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.080
[Amit Varma]: but what has also changed is not just television itself, but the whole media landscape surrounding

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.560
[Amit Varma]: it and social media is a significant part of that.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you and I were just being nostalgic a little while back about how peaceful and

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.440
[Amit Varma]: nice the days were before social media.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about the kind of difference that, you know, social media has made to the

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.880
[Amit Varma]: way people cover news and to people like you personally, who cover the news.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.120
[Guest]: Well, it's made a huge difference.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:31.840
[Guest]: Look, the fact is that I think social media is great in that it's a great source of immediate

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840
[Guest]: news.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.000
[Guest]: As a journalist, when you follow, let's say, the AP Twitter handle, Reuters, or any news

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.200
[Guest]: organization's Twitter handle, you know, that you're getting immediate updates, you know,

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.480
[Guest]: and in the old days, you wouldn't get it so quickly, you would have to wait for the flash

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.960
[Guest]: to come up on the news wires on PTI or AP or Reuters, etc. on, you know, what, which

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.160
[Guest]: was connected to your office systems.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.000
[Guest]: So social media has a certain immediacy to it, reporters directly tweet from a briefing

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.980
[Guest]: about what is happening, you know, word by word, what is being said, statements that

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.980
[Guest]: are coming in.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980
[Guest]: So it's very quick.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.720
[Guest]: And that way, it's a great source of information.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:11.640
[Guest]: But I mean, what it's also done is, I think, it's made news much more interactive, which

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.760
[Guest]: is both great and also a pain.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.160
[Guest]: But on a serious note, I think it's good, it's good that a lot of your viewers can tell

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.960
[Guest]: you what they really think, let's say, of your show or of a particular story, they give

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.960
[Guest]: you feedback.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.400
[Guest]: Very often, people flag important stories, like for instance, in this pandemic, people

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.280
[Guest]: have taken to Twitter to tell us about the way that, you know, hospitals had no beds,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.600
[Guest]: you know, and if they hadn't done that, you know, it would have taken much longer to get

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.920
[Guest]: to know about how serious the crisis is, for example, in Delhi, you know, about the shortage

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.280
[Guest]: of beds.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.800
[Guest]: So I think in that way, social media has played a great role.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.040
[Guest]: And I mean, the abuse aside, I'm saying that when when there is a healthy conversation

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:56.360
[Guest]: between you and someone who reads your work, or watches your work, then that's great.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.480
[Guest]: But yes, it's made reporting much more complicated, I'll tell you, for example, when I went to

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.440
[Guest]: cover Mr. Modi's visit to Israel a few years ago, I think it was three years ago, firstly,

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.600
[Guest]: you know, cost cutting.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:14.320
[Guest]: So I was covering it with the mobile journalism kit, you know, the mojo, just the cell phone

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.560
[Guest]: and me went to Israel.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.040
[Guest]: And everyone else was there, you know, with their big cameras and their tripods and all

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.480
[Guest]: but I had, I was really proud of the fact that we were doing it like this.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.560
[Guest]: And kind of, you know, I stood there doing my piece to camera.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:33.600
[Guest]: So first, you have to worry about the technical part of it, where, you know, frankly, I was,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.560
[Guest]: I was so distracted about the reporting part of it that I was so worried that the mic shouldn't

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.680
[Guest]: be off, the tripod shouldn't fall apart, you know, you know, stuff like that, because you

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.440
[Guest]: worry so much about the technical part of it, because you're doing everything yourself.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.520
[Guest]: And then I almost the ambassador almost got run over by a truck, because we were standing

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.280
[Guest]: in the middle of the road doing an interview, you know, that's I'm like, you know, I'm pulling

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.960
[Guest]: him into the frame. And then Sasne Haider was on that trip with me.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.760
[Guest]: So she helped, you know, then, because the entire TV media went after baby Moshe who's

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.120
[Guest]: not baby anymore.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: So you know, I need to hold the phone for me while I chased his family down and said,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.400
[Guest]: would you would you speak to us and you know, at least she was there to help.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.720
[Guest]: So it wasn't easy.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.200
[Guest]: But then, on that trip, I realized we we just started doing, you know, Facebook Live also,

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.520
[Guest]: which I didn't know what the hell that was, until it happened.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.960
[Guest]: Because now I'm going and doing these stories about the Indian community in Israel and whatever.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.720
[Guest]: And so in addition to doing my television story, I had to first put out a web copy.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.280
[Guest]: Now everything is on the web first.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.280
[Guest]: And then I have to do a Facebook Live.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.760
[Guest]: Okay, so I was like, yeh kya hai?

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.240
[Guest]: And then I had to do that also.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.700
[Guest]: And then you have to do your television OBS also, you know, and then deal with the technology

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.480
[Guest]: and the technical issues and failures and all of that.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.360
[Guest]: So it's not easy.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.960
[Guest]: And that's what reporting is like on a day to day basis for a lot of young people today.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:00.720
[Guest]: You know, you are doing digital, you are handling your social media accounts, a lot of them

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.360
[Guest]: are having to do YouTube stuff separately.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.320
[Guest]: And then you have the pressures from television.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.640
[Guest]: So and plus, you have to make sure you're actually getting your story right.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.920
[Guest]: So there's a lot of pressure on reporters today.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.680
[Guest]: And I have to say very honestly, Amit, it was much more fun way back then.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.800
[Guest]: You know, I personally think so.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:22.240
[Guest]: That it was much more fun when one had the time and the space to be able to think about

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.800
[Guest]: what one had to write and do.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.160
[Guest]: I still love the rush of hard news.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.920
[Guest]: But just sometimes it's just overwhelming.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:33.680
[Guest]: And hats off to these kids, you know, who sort of manage everything so seemingly effortlessly,

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.200
[Guest]: but it really, really is not easy.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.200
[Guest]: Because you know, even the physical demands of the job, as you know, are very real.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.600
[Guest]: I mean, look at these reporters who've been out or reporting on the migrant crisis or

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.320
[Guest]: just the state of or of the pandemic in general.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.980
[Guest]: And then you juggle all these things together, social media included.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.980
[Guest]: It's not easy.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.920
[Guest]: And you know, now, you know, when you do it, you don't just anchor a show, then you identify

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.580
[Guest]: clips to put out on social media by what will catch the audience's eye.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.880
[Guest]: You know, what are the things that you can sort of extract and make a headline so that

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.320
[Guest]: it gets viral on Twitter becomes vital on Twitter, because now that is also important.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.280
[Guest]: So, one good thing I'm really about NDTV in particular is that we don't do the whole hashtag

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.760
[Guest]: thing except on election day, which is elections with NDTV.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.360
[Guest]: So there's no like, you know, hashtag like, Rahul Gandhi get a haircut, you know, something

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.360
[Guest]: like that.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360
[Guest]: You know what I mean?

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.640
[Guest]: Like, you know, or what is that Times Now favorite hashtag lobby, something about the

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640
[Guest]: lobby.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.840
[Guest]: I don't know which lobby it is, but they have something about the lobby every day.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.920
[Guest]: Lobby lies or lobby uses Chinese phones.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, normally, when I do an episode on something, I research the subject very thoroughly.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.320
[Amit Varma]: But I have to confess that I've watched practically no news television for the last 10 years,

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.240
[Amit Varma]: because I can't stand it.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, a couple of thoughts come to my mind from what you just said, the second perhaps

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.680
[Amit Varma]: leading to a question.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.560
[Amit Varma]: One is that, you know, it seems to me that as new technology comes up, there is an element

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.040
[Amit Varma]: of faddishness that comes into reporting in the sense of these all become boxes to tick

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.040
[Amit Varma]: that Facebook Life ka box tick karo, Instagram ka box tick karo, iska box tick karo, without

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:14.360
[Amit Varma]: enough thought going into what is happening to the trade off, in terms of the effort that

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.520
[Amit Varma]: goes into ticking these boxes and the depth of the news.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.280
[Amit Varma]: And the second which I'm going to turn into a question is, of course, we've all heard,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, Marshall McLuhan's famous saying about the medium being the message and it

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:29.320
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that if you know, so much of your time goes into putting stuff on Facebook Life

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.560
[Amit Varma]: and looking for clips to maybe put on Twitter or whatever all these little disparate things

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:39.520
[Amit Varma]: that one now has to do, doesn't that affect the depth which you can pursue a story and

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.280
[Amit Varma]: doesn't that then change the nature of the coverage in a negative way?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.480
[Guest]: It does, to be honest, I mean, to me, like I said, I preferred the old days where you

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:54.120
[Guest]: could really spend time on a story and everything wasn't like some massive life and death event.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.800
[Guest]: And you know, social media has brought with it certain pressures, but you know, you have

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.880
[Guest]: to learn to adapt.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.040
[Guest]: That's the way life is, you know, things will evolve.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.920
[Guest]: I don't think as some people have debated in the recent past, the television news is

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920
[Guest]: dead.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.360
[Guest]: It's certainly very, very problematic.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.560
[Guest]: There are huge issues with it in India in particular right now.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.280
[Guest]: But television viewership has exponentially shot up in the last few months.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.520
[Guest]: So there is a huge audience for it.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.120
[Guest]: We have to use that space responsibly.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.760
[Guest]: And you know, we have to evolve with technology.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.920
[Guest]: And ideally, you know, you have to have different resources for different things.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.280
[Guest]: So we also have an NDTV, a separate social media team, etc.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.120
[Guest]: But very often the reporters and anchors themselves have to get involved in that process.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.280
[Guest]: And it's exhausting.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:44.080
[Guest]: You know, I do think in the old days, one had more time to ponder over a headline.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.220
[Guest]: And also, I think, at this time, you know, like, on social media every day, we all turn

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:53.920
[Guest]: into experts, you know, foreign affairs, today everyone is an expert on China, but yesterday

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.880
[Guest]: we were experts on depression, and what was there the day before?

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.720
[Guest]: But you know, there was something else also.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.120
[Guest]: So anyway, everyone has an opinion on everything.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.880
[Guest]: And you know, very often, I mean, I'll tell you simple things like a press release will

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.800
[Guest]: come, I cover, I used to cover the MEA, I have to quickly look for that, like, I don't

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.880
[Guest]: have time to like sit and read it properly, you know, it's like, quickly, quickly look

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.920
[Guest]: for the two or three important news points and just get it out on Twitter, get it out

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.800
[Guest]: on the NDTV social media handle, get it on air.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.840
[Guest]: And you know, there's such a thing about pehle kaun karega, you know, that, to me, it stresses

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.840
[Guest]: me out a lot.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.640
[Guest]: That's what I would say.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.520
[Guest]: One would like to like, look at things carefully, sift through them carefully.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.720
[Guest]: And that's just taken, for me, at least it just took a bit of the sort of fun out of

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.720
[Amit Varma]: doing this on a regular basis.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.800
[Amit Varma]: As you're saying this, a thought that strikes me, a question that strikes me, rather, which

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.600
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, you've done a lot of, you know, as opposed to a lot of the shallow news

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.400
[Amit Varma]: coverage of the modern age, you've done a lot of deep work in the past, where you've,

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, done work in POK, you've done work in Tibet, like you pointed out after waiting

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.680
[Amit Varma]: a year for a visa, what is the work that you're most proud of in your career?

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'll make it a two part question by saying that, is there something that you're not proud

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.760
[Amit Varma]: of that you look back and said, Hey, I wish I hadn't done that?

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760
[Guest]: That's a good question.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.280
[Guest]: Well, I'm proud of quite a few things.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.400
[Guest]: I mean, I'm proud of all the documentaries I've done.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.920
[Guest]: I did quite a few, and I was really glad because NUTV gave me the space to do them, whether

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.640
[Guest]: it was the one in Tibet, or the one in Iran, I went back to, I went to cover the London

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.960
[Guest]: bombings of July 2007, as an on the spot reporting job.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.240
[Guest]: But then I went back a month later to do a bigger in depth thing on how Muslims in Britain

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:41.520
[Guest]: were coping with the sort of the changes and then the way people were looking at them after

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.520
[Guest]: that.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.680
[Guest]: The POK documentary certainly was something that I was very, very proud of, also, because

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.440
[Guest]: it was a runner up at the Asian TV Awards.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.080
[Guest]: And that was the year of the tsunami.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.880
[Guest]: And so the tsunami one and, and this came second and I was a bit worried that they would

00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.760
[Guest]: see think of it as being too political because it said Pakistan occupied Kashmir, not administered

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.840
[Guest]: Kashmir and stuff like that.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.320
[Guest]: And but but you know, they saw merit in it.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:10.020
[Guest]: And it was it was a runner up a story that is actually very boring to a lot of people.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:16.480
[Guest]: But I am most proud of is my work on the India US nuclear deal, which was a story I obsessively

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.200
[Guest]: tracked from beginning to end.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.920
[Guest]: And that's how I got interested in foreign policy.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.120
[Guest]: And that was a very, very difficult story to do, because it's very technical.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.760
[Guest]: It can be very, you know, technical and sort of very dense.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.640
[Guest]: And you know, to break that down for TV viewers every single day, and to make it interesting.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.480
[Guest]: And then it became one of the biggest political stories of our time.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.280
[Guest]: You know, Manmohan Singh's government also nearly fell because of it.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.400
[Guest]: It didn't, but it could have, you know, there was a confidence vote in Parliament on it.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:51.000
[Guest]: So it just became like this, this amazing story to track from beginning to end.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.800
[Guest]: Is there something I wish I shouldn't have done or that I'm not proud of?

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.800
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.240
[Guest]: There's nothing I can think of offhand Amit.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.280
[Guest]: But I'll tell you something which I've never said before.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.040
[Guest]: Sometimes I do have doubts about whether I should have thrown Sambit Patra out of that

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040
[Guest]: show that day.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.400
[Amit Varma]: For those of us who don't know what you're talking about, what are you referring to?

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.080
[Guest]: There was then Oh, you don't know this?

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Are you serious?

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.600
[Amit Varma]: I don't watch much news television.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm really sorry about this.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.040
[Guest]: I think, I don't know, was it maybe three years ago or two years ago, Sambit Patra was

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:29.280
[Guest]: on my show and started shouting at us on air and saying that NDTV has an agenda and you

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.120
[Guest]: know, ascribing motives to us.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.360
[Guest]: And I told him to leave.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.120
[Guest]: I said that if I'm sorry that I will not accept this accusation.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.080
[Guest]: And if you don't want to be on this channel, then go.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.040
[Guest]: And you know, if you're not, if you're not going to apologize, then leave.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.360
[Guest]: And I shot his mic down.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.840
[Guest]: I mean, it's, it's really an infamous incident, to be honest.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.280
[Guest]: And a lot of people were I mean, the Royals were very happy.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:56.120
[Guest]: I mean, everybody was the whole organization stood by me for doing that.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:01.960
[Guest]: Because every day, you know, you had BJP spokies sort of making digs at us all the time questioning

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.800
[Guest]: our sort of credibility, etc.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.080
[Guest]: And we got raided by the CBI, I think Pranoy got raided by the CBI like two, three days

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.600
[Guest]: later, which was a coincidence, but many people sought to draw links to it.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.560
[Guest]: But that's, you know, and then the BJP stopped coming on NDTV completely.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.800
[Guest]: And that stands to this day, officially, they do not come on NDTV.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:31.000
[Guest]: Now, at that time, until today, a lot of people, most people tell me that, you know, you did

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.200
[Guest]: the right thing, somebody has to stand up and call these guys out, etc, etc.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.440
[Guest]: But to be honest, Amit, when I look back, sometimes I look back, and I think that maybe

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.320
[Guest]: I shouldn't have and that maybe I should have said my piece and then let it go.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:53.440
[Guest]: And that it would have been more democratic of me to do it that way, rather than just

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.720
[Guest]: tell him to leave.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.920
[Guest]: I don't know, I'm very conflicted about that.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:01.120
[Guest]: But that is something I if I if I had, if I had to relive that moment, again, maybe

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120
[Guest]: I wouldn't do it.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me something for someone who feels as strongly about values and issues and indeed

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.200
[Amit Varma]: the health of our democracy as you clearly do.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Is that sort of like, I can imagine myself losing my temper in a similar way.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And I remember reading about the incident now that you described it.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.480
[Amit Varma]: But is that sort of emotional control hard, for example, when you're, let's say you're

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.600
[Amit Varma]: covering Kathua, and there are people who are sort of defending the rapist, or there

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.540
[Amit Varma]: are people who are defending garlanding the lynchers, for example, both issues on which,

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:36.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, you've sort of spoken out, then at that moment does, you know, on the one

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.480
[Amit Varma]: hand, you're supposed to be this objective anchor and you're sort of you have to be calm

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.720
[Amit Varma]: and ask sharp, probing questions, but on the other hand, how can the blood not rush to

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.720
[Amit Varma]: your head?

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.720
[Amit Varma]: How do you deal with that?

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.080
[Amit Varma]: How have you faced that conflict?

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.960
[Guest]: See, in my opinion, there is absolutely no obligation to be a quote unquote objective,

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.240
[Guest]: when you're anchoring what is meant to be an opinion based show, it's fine, because

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.200
[Guest]: like newspapers have editorial pages, right?

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.960
[Guest]: So these nine o'clock bulletins can be the editorial pages of your channel, in that sense,

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.640
[Guest]: it's perfectly okay to take a position on something, I don't have a problem with that.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:18.480
[Guest]: But I do have a problem with when, you know, you know, to me, there are certain things

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.680
[Guest]: which are inalienable truths, right?

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.240
[Guest]: And there are certain stories that do not have another side.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:31.760
[Guest]: So for example, politicians coming out in doing rallies in defense of rape accused and

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.200
[Guest]: murder accused, like in the Katwa case, to me, that was indefensible, there was no other

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.880
[Guest]: side to the story.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:43.960
[Guest]: To me, when somebody is lynched, and killed, there is no other side to the story.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.960
[Guest]: It's wrong.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.960
[Guest]: Okay.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.600
[Guest]: So I think, yes, I mean, I think we're all human.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.760
[Guest]: We will get emotional.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.600
[Guest]: I think it's a question of, I think it's perfectly okay to be emotional also.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.920
[Guest]: But you have to also know when to pull back.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.920
[Guest]: And that's a line that only an individual can draw.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.680
[Guest]: I have to admit that some of the stories that have disturbed me the most in the last few

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.520
[Guest]: years have been these stories, it has been depressing, actually.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:16.840
[Guest]: And I've found myself often coming close to tears, when one has had to have a discussion

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:22.080
[Guest]: on Akhlaq or one of these horrific incidents that happened all these years, and you actually

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.240
[Guest]: have someone sitting in front of you trying to defend the garlanding of lynching accused

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.640
[Guest]: or why the tricolour was draped on the men who were accused of killing Akhlaq.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.480
[Guest]: You know, and you just I mean, you know, a lot of people would sometimes criticize us

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:42.440
[Guest]: and say that, why do you call for instance, why do you call RSS spokespersons on the channel?

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:48.040
[Guest]: And I would say, and I still say this, that I'm sorry, but whether you like it or not,

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.680
[Guest]: they are ruling the country right now.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.360
[Guest]: You know, they have been elected by the people.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.240
[Guest]: And they represent what the government of India thinks at the moment.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.840
[Guest]: So we are not legitimizing them.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.080
[Guest]: The legitimacy has come from the last two general elections.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.760
[Guest]: So you can't, to me, this sort of the other liberal argument, you know, that you cannot

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.440
[Guest]: listen to the other point of view at all, no matter how horrendous it is.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.880
[Guest]: It's interesting, because, you know, that whole debate right now that happened in the

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.680
[Guest]: New York Times over that edit page by Cotton, Tom Cotton's piece here.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.600
[Guest]: And it was interesting that there were, I think, journalists more from our era who were

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.040
[Guest]: like, well, you know, he is an elected representative.

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.520
[Guest]: We may not agree with his views, but he has a right to put them across.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:36.240
[Guest]: And, you know, the Times has a right to put it in a context to say we don't agree with

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.140
[Guest]: it, etc, whatever.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.360
[Guest]: But should it be blanked out completely?

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:45.320
[Guest]: You know, so I am conflicted on that question also right now.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.720
[Guest]: But the fact is that I also feel it's important to confront people who have those views and

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.160
[Guest]: pin them down on that.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.880
[Guest]: And sort of, shall we say, shame them for some of the kind of open bigotry and hatred

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.880
[Guest]: that they profess.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.840
[Guest]: And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, like the hate speeches that some of

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.560
[Guest]: these guys made during the Delhi elections.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.160
[Guest]: I had a confrontation with some of the MPs, you can't just ignore them, they're members

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.360
[Guest]: of Parliament, for God's sake.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.760
[Guest]: It's not about giving someone a platform, but they are MPs, they've been elected, they're

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.200
[Guest]: going to stand up in Parliament and say stuff.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.240
[Guest]: They need to be held accountable for the kind of hate speech that they're spewing.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.040
[Guest]: And I think we need to do that.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.040
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't agree with you more.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.800
[Amit Varma]: It is, after all, our job to afflict the comfortable sort of, you know, when you're speaking of

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.360
[Amit Varma]: politician guests on your show, a couple of thoughts come to mind.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.440
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, you know, you've been doing the show Left, Right and Centre, which is

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.760
[Amit Varma]: sort of a debate show between different points of view.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.960
[Amit Varma]: So it's a two part question.

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:52.240
[Amit Varma]: Part one is that, given that people are inevitably going to take their party line, and even if

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:57.480
[Amit Varma]: they are not from a particular party, they are inevitably going to sort of take the line

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:03.920
[Amit Varma]: of whatever ideology or identity they've chosen for themselves, don't all these debates become

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.600
[Amit Varma]: so predictable that you broadly know in advance what everyone is going to say?

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.160
[Amit Varma]: That's part one of the question.

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And part two is that then behind the scenes, all of these people do what they do.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.200
[Amit Varma]: I think the incentives of politics makes politicians behave in venal and reprehensible ways.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.560
[Amit Varma]: But outside of that political framework, have you found not just politicians, but generally

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.040
[Amit Varma]: people in public life to be different from what their public personas are?

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, would you say that a politician you cannot agree with on issues can also turn

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.640
[Amit Varma]: out to be a nice guy and a good person, and there are these, you know, other sides to

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.640
[Guest]: them that you get to know?

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.640
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.040
[Guest]: I mean, you see that all the time.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.840
[Guest]: And yes, you're partly right about, you know, these political debates, in a sense becoming

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.560
[Guest]: very sort of predictable.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.360
[Guest]: But I want to say something here.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.520
[Guest]: I want to say that why is it that we in this country, which is the world's largest democracy,

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.280
[Guest]: which has this thriving political scene, why are we so averse?

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.120
[Guest]: Why is the word politicization a bad word?

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.320
[Guest]: It shouldn't be.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.440
[Guest]: In my view, every major issue should be politicized.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.640
[Guest]: And people as citizens, as voters should be listening to what representatives are saying

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.320
[Guest]: on those issues so that they can make up their mind on what side they are on particular issues.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:27.500
[Guest]: So for instance, when people would say during the Nirbhaya gang rape time, don't politicize,

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.520
[Guest]: you know, the sexual violence against women.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.520
[Guest]: Why not?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.640
[Guest]: I mean, I have been saying this for the longest time that the problem is we haven't politicized

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.200
[Guest]: these issues.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.280
[Guest]: We need to hold our publicly elected representatives accountable for the fact that women don't

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.760
[Guest]: feel safe while walking on the street or that, you know, convictions are abysmally low, etc.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.400
[Guest]: We need to politicize these issues and I at least would want to hear what each political

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.680
[Guest]: party has to say about it.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.480
[Guest]: So similarly, even on foreign policy and security issues, just because it's the Congress or

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.480
[Guest]: an opposition party raising it, it doesn't mean that it's wrong.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.720
[Guest]: I think there are legitimate questions that need to be, for instance, you know, now it's

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.880
[Guest]: become sort of, again, anti-national to question anything about the armed forces or to question

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.800
[Guest]: any intelligence gaps or intelligence failures.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.200
[Guest]: I mean, to me, it is actually patriotic to raise those questions, not just now, but I'm

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:25.760
[Guest]: talking about even earlier during the UPA time, that, you know, you need to ask, you

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.880
[Guest]: know, why lapses happen.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.080
[Guest]: For instance, look at what's happening in China and Ladakh at the moment.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.760
[Guest]: You had a clear situation where you had a section of the media that was just trying

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.440
[Guest]: to project a narrative of all is well, kuch nahi hua, it is a very small incident.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.680
[Guest]: Look at the way it has blown up, the lack of transparency, the lack of information that's

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680
[Guest]: coming out.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.760
[Guest]: And I think the opposition, while standing by the country and standing by the government,

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.080
[Guest]: is well within its rights to say, boss, you know, we need answers also on why this happened

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080
[Guest]: and how this happened.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.080
[Guest]: And please give us those answers.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.560
[Guest]: So I don't think that there's anything wrong with that.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.800
[Guest]: I think it's the way that those debates are structured.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.880
[Guest]: The problem, Amit, is that, you know, that they are, of course, completely in these shrill

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880
[Guest]: shouting matches.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.920
[Guest]: You can have perfectly good conversations, even debates, if you want to call them that,

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.960
[Guest]: with people from different ideologies sitting together, different political parties that

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.880
[Guest]: can be perfectly civil and yet disagree with one another, where you don't have to be screaming

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.440
[Guest]: at each other all the time, you know.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.160
[Guest]: But much of what's happening on Indian television today is contrived.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.520
[Guest]: It is, you call the fringe, you know, you decide that some guy in a long beard represents

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.960
[Guest]: all Muslims in India.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
[Guest]: He does not.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.520
[Guest]: Or you decide that some guy wearing a saffron robe represents all Hindus in India.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520
[Guest]: He does not.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520
[Guest]: Right?

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.840
[Guest]: So you just, you know, kind of pit two religions against each other.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.880
[Guest]: You start screaming in between.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.120
[Guest]: And that's why it's been reduced to a farce.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.480
[Guest]: And in my experience, I've given this example often, I actually found that if you do debates

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.160
[Guest]: well and you have a good conversation on important issues, it does make people sit up and think.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.120
[Guest]: For example, when the gang rape happened in Delhi, it was the first time I saw mainstream

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:16.520
[Guest]: news television night after night on primetime talking about sexual violence against women.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.120
[Guest]: And it forced the print media to make it a page one story as well.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.240
[Guest]: And I'm not joking.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.280
[Guest]: I think I did a primetime show on that story, like every day for the next, like, maybe two

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.480
[Guest]: months, you know, and it made a huge difference because at least people were talking about

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480
[Guest]: it.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.240
[Guest]: People were, I mean, people came out and they were agitated.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:40.160
[Guest]: And that was to me that that's good that in a democracy that the people were demanding

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.160
[Guest]: accountability.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.240
[Guest]: I mean, not in the way that it turned out, ultimately just became about a hanging and

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.040
[Guest]: not a bigger debate as it should have been about safety, about the judiciary speeding

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.480
[Guest]: up cases and convictions and all, but that apart, I'm just saying that just even having

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:58.120
[Guest]: that awareness to have that conversation, it became really important.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:03.920
[Guest]: So I think on China, for example, it is important to hear the opposition's voice.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.160
[Guest]: So I don't understand this thing of through doing, you know, what political parties think.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.160
[Guest]: We elect them.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160
[Guest]: Let's hold them accountable.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.480
[Guest]: Let's listen to what they have to say.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480
[Amit Varma]: Couldn't agree with you more.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.720
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's kind of get back to social media, because for a moment there, we just discussed

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.840
[Amit Varma]: the positive side.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And one can't really end with that because one of the, you know, the dark side of social

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:29.040
[Amit Varma]: media is, of course, the enormous amount of vitriol that is spread, the rumors that is

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.800
[Amit Varma]: spread, the abuse that, you know, people are constantly confronted with, and all of it,

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.720
[Amit Varma]: especially harder for a woman.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.040
[Amit Varma]: So now you are on the one hand, you're looking at social media closely for tips and new angles

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.720
[Amit Varma]: like this hospital has run out of bed, or there are interesting points of view, which

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.340
[Amit Varma]: you can take into account.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.560
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, there is also so much ugliness, and it cannot but help affect you

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560
[Amit Varma]: when this happens.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, the journalist Kanika Kohli had a thread I found quite moving on Twitter recently

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:04.360
[Amit Varma]: about how she was personally so affected when the IT troll farms came after her that she,

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, almost had an anxiety attack and had to kind of go to the loo very moving thread.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and all prominent women kind of go through that.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.040
[Guest]: How did you deal with that?

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.160
[Guest]: It's not nice, Amit.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.400
[Guest]: It's not nice at all.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:23.240
[Guest]: And I mean, I really feel for Kanika because I understand how she would have felt it's,

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.440
[Guest]: you know, the thing is that on social media on Twitter in particular, I don't know, I

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.400
[Guest]: mean, it's sort of a free for all against women, they'll say that we respect women,

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.720
[Guest]: and then you know, they'll, they'll, they'll abuse you in the next sentence.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:42.040
[Guest]: And they somehow think that talking about a woman's personal life, or, you know, her

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.680
[Guest]: sex life or something is, is somehow demeaning.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.240
[Guest]: I mean, it is it is extremely difficult as a woman to be on social media.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.440
[Guest]: I would agree with that.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.700
[Guest]: It's toxic.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:57.400
[Guest]: And frankly, I would not even be on Twitter, if it wasn't for the fact that people would,

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.520
[Guest]: you know, sort of creating these fake accounts in my name, and tweeting, and then people

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.800
[Guest]: would message me on every day and say, Oh, have you said this on Twitter?

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.760
[Guest]: And I would say, No, that's not me.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.320
[Guest]: So finally, I had, how many accounts can I complain against, right, Twitter would keep

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.300
[Guest]: taking them down, but I can't, like, you know, do it every week.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.440
[Guest]: So I decided I had to come on at least have a verified account so that whatever is going

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.040
[Guest]: out there is going out there in my name, and that so those those fake accounts actually

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.640
[Guest]: stopped after that.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:31.600
[Guest]: But otherwise, I honestly don't find it fulfilling at all it is it is extremely, extremely toxic,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.480
[Guest]: particularly so for women.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.400
[Guest]: And I understand where Karnika comes from, in that because everyone deals with these

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400
[Guest]: issues differently.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.920
[Guest]: I've developed a much thicker skin now than I had maybe like, say, five or six years ago,

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.280
[Guest]: when it really would affect me now it doesn't in that way.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.080
[Guest]: But everyone has different ways to deal with things.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.240
[Guest]: Not everyone will react the same way.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.920
[Guest]: And that's why it's it's not a safe space for women.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
[Amit Varma]: That's for sure.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.680
[Amit Varma]: And do you have a hack to deal with it?

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.080
[Amit Varma]: Like, did you ignore notifications or you know, do you just mute everyone who abuses

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.880
[Guest]: you once so over time you see less of it?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.700
[Guest]: I used to mute I was very polite, but then a friend of mine, why are you polite and he's

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.480
[Guest]: on Twitter as well.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.200
[Guest]: And he's like, I just I just block abusers.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:20.140
[Guest]: So anyone who abuses I block, and I block out misogynists, you know, and those that

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.600
[Guest]: just are annoying because you can be annoyed.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
[Guest]: I mute them.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.160
[Guest]: And I'm sorry, that's there's no free speech argument here.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.680
[Guest]: You're free to speak now.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.440
[Guest]: You go and speak and abuse and do whatever you want on your timeline.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.720
[Guest]: I have I also have the right to not have to listen to your crap.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So I block you.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.800
[Amit Varma]: No one's entitled to our attention.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And the other sort of aspect of social media is that what social media does is that it

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.640
[Amit Varma]: polarizes the discourse in very drastic ways in the sense that the discourse becomes very

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.920
[Amit Varma]: tribal, we form our own echo chambers, and then we need to, you know, keep posturing

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.960
[Amit Varma]: to raise our status within our own echo chamber, which can often mean sort of abusing the other

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.560
[Amit Varma]: side or whatever, and it gets more and more polarized.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And what this means for liberals often is that you have all these online purity tests,

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.520
[Amit Varma]: where you will have people who are, you know, perfectly good liberals in every way, getting

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.400
[Amit Varma]: attacked by other liberals for not being liberal enough.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And I have seen this happen to you as well.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, like even in the Tom Cotton case, that's basically what it is David Bennett, opinion

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.400
[Amit Varma]: editor who was made to resign is, you know, an impeccable liberal in every way who was

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:34.040
[Amit Varma]: just following this basic journalistic convention of giving the other side a chance to say their

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.480
[Amit Varma]: piece so that readers can judge for themselves.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.640
[Amit Varma]: And how do you feel about these sort of online purity tests and these mobs that descend upon

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.760
[Guest]: you if you deviate from the party line?

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.280
[Guest]: Well, see, that's the thing, right, that I'm glad that I don't fit into a particular box.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.360
[Guest]: I am neither black nor white.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.880
[Guest]: And like most people, I'm somewhere in between, you know, and that's perfectly okay with me.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:01.680
[Guest]: I mean, I have a certain view, for example, on the way India and Delhi handles the situation

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.040
[Guest]: within Kashmir.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.200
[Guest]: But I have a very different view on the way on Pakistan's role in Kashmir.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.120
[Guest]: So I can be both.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.600
[Guest]: And I'm not going to apologize for that, you know.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.440
[Guest]: So in any case, the conservative right wing thinks I'm too liberal and I'm not the conservative

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.000
[Guest]: right wing at all.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.280
[Guest]: But I just find that the so-called liberals are actually often, Amit, the most illiberal

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.080
[Guest]: people you can come across in the way that they go after people for having a different

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.720
[Guest]: point of view.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.120
[Guest]: And I expect it of the extreme right wing because I ain't no friend of theirs and they

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.360
[Guest]: ain't no friends of mine, let's face it.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.400
[Guest]: We are completely ideologically at odds, right?

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:45.080
[Guest]: That even, I mean, among liberals, why can't someone have a nuanced point of view on something?

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.520
[Guest]: You can, right?

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.080
[Guest]: And there's nothing wrong with that.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.880
[Guest]: And therefore, that's why we get stuck in echo chambers.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.960
[Guest]: I mean, frankly, to me, that explains why Donald Trump might get elected president again

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.760
[Guest]: and why he got elected the first time.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.960
[Guest]: Because in America also, you had these echo chambers where, you know, people were just

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.400
[Guest]: not willing to listen to what was actually happening on the ground.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.360
[Guest]: And incidentally, Shekhar Gupta shared a very good piece.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.400
[Guest]: I don't remember who wrote it on this whole thing about what's happening in American newsrooms.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.320
[Guest]: And it had the sort of the New York Times resignation as an example of it, about just

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.160
[Guest]: how illiberal liberals have become.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.960
[Guest]: So you know, frankly, I now just wear it as a badge of honor.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960
[Guest]: I am who I am.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960
[Guest]: I am an individual.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.200
[Guest]: I am entitled to my opinions.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.320
[Guest]: If I'm not liberal enough for you, screw you, doesn't matter.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.840
[Amit Varma]: No, and it also strikes me that, you know, the thing about the extreme right is they

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.200
[Amit Varma]: wear their bigotry on their sleeve, but the extreme left can dress it up in sanctimony,

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.480
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, irritates me a little bit more sometimes.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.960
[Guest]: I agree with you.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:48.400
[Guest]: I mean, you know, as someone who's covered the conflict in J&K has, you know, seen personally

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.040
[Guest]: what it has, what Pakistan sponsored terrorism has done in the Kashmir Valley.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.760
[Guest]: I have no qualms in calling out Pakistan's role in sponsoring terrorism and kind of bloodshed

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.000
[Guest]: it has unleashed in our country.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.760
[Guest]: But at the same time, I am critical of the way the government has handled things in Kashmir

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.520
[Guest]: with an iron fist, particularly after the 5th of August last year.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
[Guest]: You have detained people.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.520
[Guest]: You've detained people for months on end.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.640
[Guest]: A former chief minister is still under detention.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.000
[Guest]: Is this a democracy?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.220
[Guest]: This is the world's largest, longest internet blackout.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.640
[Guest]: You still don't have 4G internet up.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.920
[Guest]: And what, the same rules of law do not apply to the people of Kashmir, are Kashmiris not

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.920
[Guest]: our people?

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.320
[Guest]: Are they not Indians?

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.840
[Guest]: So I, you know, you can be both, you know, you can be both.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.840
[Guest]: That's what I'm saying.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840
[Guest]: So I don't know.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.160
[Guest]: I mean, like this liberal thing of, you know, then they're like, oh, I mean, you know, oh,

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.280
[Guest]: she's talking about Pakistan this way because, you know, she must be feeling the pressure

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.280
[Guest]: to say that.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.200
[Guest]: No, that's always been my point of view.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.600
[Guest]: My documentary from POK, which got that award did because, you know, it took that line that

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
[Guest]: it did.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.800
[Guest]: And yet I'm somebody who is for dialogue between India and Pakistan because I don't think war

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.340
[Guest]: is a solution.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.920
[Guest]: So I can be that also, no?

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.000
[Guest]: I'm just saying that people are not black and white, views are not black and white.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.320
[Guest]: And that's the problem on social media and even on television, frankly.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.040
[Guest]: The moment you put people in a debate as foreign against, it becomes really banal and you oversimplify

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.040
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of the ways I found of judging tribal thinking is that if you are against Modi,

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.400
[Amit Varma]: can you say even one good thing about him?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.800
[Amit Varma]: Or if you're for him, can you say even one bad thing about him?

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And the answer is often no.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.560
[Amit Varma]: And then you know that in that case, that's just tribal thinking, because everyone contains

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.720
[Amit Varma]: multitudes and even the person you're against has done some good things.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.600
[Amit Varma]: And even the person you're for has flaws that you should be awake to.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, my next question is sort of it kind of strikes me and I'm again sort of thinking

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:46.240
[Amit Varma]: aloud here that when I look back in the last 25 years or so, the one profession where I

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:52.280
[Amit Varma]: can see that women have visibly excelled and, you know, made an impression and become incredible

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.920
[Amit Varma]: role models is in TV journalism.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.460
[Amit Varma]: And I'm, of course, thinking of people like, you know, you and Barkha, where, you know,

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.760
[Amit Varma]: some of our finest TV journalists are women, that's indisputable.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, like, does it sort of irritate you when you're covered, not just

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.760
[Amit Varma]: as a great TV journalist, but as a TV journalist as a woman, for example, I was searching online

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.440
[Amit Varma]: for articles in a few interviews of you and I came across this piece which was headlined,

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.880
[Amit Varma]: no skirting of issues, which within the piece headlines like, you know, quote, the importance

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.600
[Amit Varma]: of dressing cannot be dismissed, stop quote, and then quote, again, planning her outfit

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.760
[Amit Varma]: on a daily basis is one of the first things she probably does in the day.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't even remember what it is.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.040
[Amit Varma]: This came in Verve, you know, so I don't know what the journalists must have asked to get

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.200
[Amit Varma]: you to talk about your daily outfit planning.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And I think you correctly put her in a place by saying that when I wake up, I'm thinking

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.200
[Amit Varma]: of stories and I just pick up the first clothes that come to mind.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.440
[Guest]: So I think I remember this now I think she's quite gutted because I actually honestly don't

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.120
[Guest]: remember the last time I thought about what to wear.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.240
[Guest]: But yeah, that's, that's a funny thing that you reminded me about.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240
[Guest]: Yeah, God.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.000
[Amit Varma]: And does it become irritating when you know, people will try to put you into a box and

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.800
[Amit Varma]: think of you as a woman journalist or a Kashmiri Pandit journalist and just look at you in

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800
[Amit Varma]: that box?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.200
[Amit Varma]: Does that can which you wouldn't do yourself as a journalist?

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.280
[Guest]: I don't like the woman box, to be honest, because it's true.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:23.040
[Guest]: I mean, the fact is that for women, things are are generally much tougher in any profession.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.520
[Guest]: And you know, I think it's great when women sort of become role models for other young

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.560
[Guest]: women and their peers, and you know, are able to break certain glass ceilings.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.960
[Guest]: And I think that's what's great about NDTV in particular, because I was telling someone

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.480
[Guest]: yesterday who was talking to me about, you know, my journey as a woman journalist.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.320
[Guest]: And she was like, I'm sure you faced biases.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.320
[Guest]: And I said, actually, I haven't, I mean, because I've lived in this bubble in NDTV, where most

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.280
[Guest]: of our editors have been women, our primetime anchors have been women, gender was never

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:59.100
[Guest]: a factor when an assignment was given to you, whether it was an earthquake or a riot somewhere.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:03.640
[Guest]: Of course, you took care of basic safety, but you know, gender wasn't a factor.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.400
[Guest]: So apart from, you know, some sort of leery remarks by some people here and there, when

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.120
[Guest]: one step outside that, I'm glad that I was, you know, in this environment where it was

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.120
[Guest]: really different.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.800
[Guest]: But so I don't mind the woman part of it, you know, I, I'm okay with that.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.240
[Guest]: And to be honest, no, I mean, no, no one's asked me since that interview about what lipstick

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.040
[Guest]: shade is my favorite or something.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040
[Guest]: And there's nothing wrong with that.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.880
[Guest]: By the way, I really like lipstick.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.280
[Guest]: And that's still, you know, I mean, that's who I am.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280
[Guest]: Okay.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280
[Guest]: Just just keep that in mind.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.280
[Guest]: I love I love lipstick.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.120
[Amit Varma]: I love kajal, at which point I have to ask you, what is your favorite shade?

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.160
[Guest]: There's always timeless red Amit.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, okay.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we have 10 minutes to go before you have to head out.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.800
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not going to ask you about a subject which you know, we could discuss in a full

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.960
[Amit Varma]: episode, which is of course, Kashmir, which you know, you've seen up close as a journalist,

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.800
[Amit Varma]: you have that personal element with it, I don't think we can do it justice in the few

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.400
[Amit Varma]: minutes that we have left.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:09.600
[Amit Varma]: So I'll sort of ask my standard question with which I end a lot of my episodes where I ask

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.040
[Amit Varma]: guests on the subject of their choice, what gives you hope and what gives you despair.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.520
[Amit Varma]: So looking at the Indian media, where we are today, where you know, on the on the one hand,

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.280
[Amit Varma]: you have this polarization and this race to the bottom in TV news.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:28.120
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you also have the growth of technology and you know, the unknown unknowns

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.680
[Amit Varma]: which might change everything for the better.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Looking say 10 years into the future, what gives you hope and what gives you despair?

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.840
[Guest]: I want to first say that I don't think that the race to the bottom is just on television.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.840
[Guest]: And I want to say very clearly that I think it's in the media as a whole, including the

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.160
[Guest]: print media.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.320
[Guest]: Because when you look at the reporting that is done, I know that a lot of it, even in

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.160
[Guest]: our newspapers is just government spin.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.480
[Guest]: It has become dependent on government handouts and press releases.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.760
[Guest]: I'll give you an example.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest]: And I think all of us in the media need to reflect on this.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.640
[Guest]: If certain sources, quote unquote, are telling you that X number of Chinese soldiers have

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.880
[Guest]: been killed, you know, in this battle that happened the other day, why aren't they seeing

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880
[Guest]: it on record?

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.400
[Guest]: You know, this happened during Balakot as well, where suddenly sources started appearing.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.960
[Guest]: And I knew who the source initially was, which is why people went with it.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.520
[Guest]: But to me, it's deeply problematic when the media is putting out unverified stuff and

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.760
[Guest]: not demanding that the government go on record with certain things.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.200
[Guest]: So it has become, unfortunately, even in the print media, a lot of it is spin and press

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200
[Guest]: release journalism.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.800
[Guest]: I'm tired of reading pieces about why X politician is sleeping only four hours a day.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.120
[Guest]: I'm tired of reading op-eds, by the way, also by ministers and, you know, only opposition

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.560
[Guest]: leaders and, you know, with no nuance at all.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.480
[Guest]: So, you know, print, I think, has also gone down that road to the bottom.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.800
[Guest]: What gives me hope is those that do stand out, despite the pressures that are there,

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.280
[Guest]: which is, as you mentioned, there are some web portals that are doing a great job of

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280
[Guest]: that.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.520
[Guest]: I think there are still a couple of newspapers that are doing a good job, like the Indian

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.160
[Guest]: Express and The Hindu with their flaws, NDTV.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:15.920
[Guest]: I'm not saying we're not, and NDTV is not flawed, there are flaws with us also, but,

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.880
[Guest]: you know, we're all holding our heads above the water and doing the best that we can.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.200
[Guest]: And, you know, the rest of them, frankly, they don't inspire much hope.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.920
[Guest]: But I do get hope from the rest of from the examples that stand out.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.160
[Guest]: I mean, that the fact that there are people who are willing to push back, that gives me

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160
[Guest]: a lot of hope.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.280
[Guest]: And in any case, I don't like to despair.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.520
[Guest]: So I think I'd rather be hopeful.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Thanks so much for coming on the show, Nidhi.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.360
[Amit Varma]: I hope you have a good time at Harvard.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And if you can, please put your course out as a MOOC so other people like me can also

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.760
[Amit Varma]: sort of take it and learn from a distance.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.320
[Amit Varma]: But in any case, all the best.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.400
[Amit Varma]: And I'm very sure that we haven't heard the last of you.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.400
[Guest]: Thank you so much, Amit.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.960
[Guest]: No, I don't know how to keep quiet.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.000
[Guest]: So I think I'll be around.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
[Guest]: Thanks so much.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
