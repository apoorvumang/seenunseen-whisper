00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I decided to go watch a movie.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.520
[Amit Varma]: There was a lot of traffic outside, and I didn't feel like driving.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.200
[Amit Varma]: So I booked an Uber.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.640
[Amit Varma]: It's normally quite cheap, but this was rush hour, and the price that was quoted was three

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.400
[Amit Varma]: times the normal price.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Three times.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.680
[Amit Varma]: I was outraged.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920
[Amit Varma]: I thought, this is robbery.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.200
[Amit Varma]: These greedy capitalists are exploiting me.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.240
[Amit Varma]: The government should step in and ban search pricing.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.880
[Amit Varma]: I cancelled my trip, and decided to watch something on Netflix instead.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.360
[Amit Varma]: Just as I switched the app on, a brilliant idea came to my mind.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.740
[Amit Varma]: Why should the government ban only search pricing by Uber?

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.040
[Amit Varma]: It should ban all high prices.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.280
[Amit Varma]: There are so many things I don't have the money to buy.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Luxuries I can't afford.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.920
[Amit Varma]: The government should fix the price of everything.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.240
[Amit Varma]: Mercedes cars should be available for one lakh.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.840
[Amit Varma]: Four bedroom flats in Bandra should be available for two lakhs.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
[Amit Varma]: Food in five-star hotels should be free.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Wow, what an idea.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.560
[Amit Varma]: We could all live the good life.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.560
[Amit Varma]: What do you think?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560
[Amit Varma]: Would this work?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Today's show is about banning search pricing in Uber.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.120
[Amit Varma]: The seen effect, no high prices.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.280
[Amit Varma]: The unseen effect, no cabs.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Price controls always lead to shortages.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.480
[Amit Varma]: My guest on the show today is Kartik Shashidhar, an economist and writer now based in London,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.600
[Amit Varma]: who enlightened me in the last episode of The Seen and The Unseen on how football transfers

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
[Amit Varma]: work.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: His first book, Between the Buyer and the Seller, will be released later this week and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.360
[Amit Varma]: I recommend you pre-order it on Amazon right away.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.180
[Amit Varma]: Between the Buyer and the Seller is a book about markets.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.280
[Amit Varma]: It evaluates markets from the point of view of how liquid they are and it looks at different

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.440
[Amit Varma]: kinds of markets.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.120
[Amit Varma]: One of his chapters is about how Uber disrupted the taxi market, making it far more liquid

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.960
[Amit Varma]: and thereby helping both consumers and drivers.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880
[Amit Varma]: I'd like to talk about that a bit before I get to the subject of search pricing.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Kartik, welcome to the show.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Hi Amit.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Good to be back here.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.040
[Amit Varma]: So Kartik, last week we spoke about liquid and illiquid markets in the context of football

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.800
[Amit Varma]: transfers and first you define liquid markets as markets where buyers and sellers find each

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800
[Amit Varma]: other very easily.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.320
[Amit Varma]: There's no transaction cost and there are so many of them that you can arrive at a good

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
[Amit Varma]: price.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.220
[Amit Varma]: You can gauge the supply and demand and arrive at a reasonable price very easily.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.480
[Amit Varma]: The example of that being computerized stock exchange and equally an illiquid market is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.120
[Amit Varma]: where this is much harder to do.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, the football market where there are few buyers and sellers and all kinds of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.440
[Amit Varma]: circumstantial factors pop up and every player is unique and not a commodity that you can

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.680
[Amit Varma]: easily find a price for him.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.340
[Amit Varma]: And the assumption often when we talk about these things is that this is just the nature

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.340
[Amit Varma]: of the market.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.480
[Amit Varma]: That a liquid market is going to be liquid and an illiquid market is going to be liquid

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.600
[Amit Varma]: and there's not much that can be done about it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.840
[Amit Varma]: But in your book you have an entire chapter about a market which was fairly illiquid and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.560
[Amit Varma]: which has become far more liquid in recent years.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm talking about Uber obviously and its dynamic pricing.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.200
[Amit Varma]: Can you shed more light on that?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.160
[Amit Varma]: How did that illiquid market become much more liquid?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160
[Guest]: Okay.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.120
[Guest]: So I think it was about three years back I think I gave a talk at the Goa project where

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.800
[Guest]: I spoke about how auto rickshaw and taxi markets can never be liquid, about how they can never

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
[Guest]: be efficient.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.800
[Guest]: The premise of my talk was that I examined regulation of auto rickshaw and taxi markets

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.440
[Guest]: in different countries and cities and said that each of them has a particular problem

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:10.140
[Guest]: because the way the costs are defined is so complex that no regulation can possibly capture

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.880
[Guest]: all of them and so it's almost impossible to regulate and become efficient and all that.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.120
[Guest]: And at the same time that is when Uber was really taking off and it had taken its first

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.520
[Guest]: steps in India and then Ola was also coming up and so in about a year's time that talk

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.720
[Guest]: that I gave in Goa became invalid because here you had a market which had once been

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.880
[Guest]: extremely illiquid but had suddenly become far more liquid just because of exchanging

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.520
[Guest]: superior information.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.680
[Guest]: And a lot of this superior information exchange happened because they introduced the price

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.920
[Guest]: and dynamic pricing into the mix.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And just to give a sense of what the market has traditionally been like, especially in

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.880
[Amit Varma]: cities like Mumbai and Delhi where I've lived, is that black and yellow taxis and auto rickshaws

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.720
[Amit Varma]: are licensed by the government, limited licenses are given out which sell at a premium and

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.920
[Amit Varma]: therefore what happens is that the supply is artificially constrained.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.320
[Amit Varma]: Now when you artificially constrain the supply, demand will inevitably overtake it and there

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320
[Amit Varma]: will be shortages.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.920
[Amit Varma]: So typically no one is really willing to, for example in Delhi, no auto rickshaw guy

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.920
[Amit Varma]: will go by the meter.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.080
[Amit Varma]: You have to negotiate which is fair enough.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.600
[Amit Varma]: But even that negotiation or any interaction between the buyer and the seller happens in

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.440
[Amit Varma]: a state of deeply imperfect information because neither has an idea of what the supply and

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.920
[Amit Varma]: demand situation is.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.480
[Amit Varma]: The guy trying to hail an auto rickshaw won't know if there's another auto rickshaw around

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.000
[Amit Varma]: the corner or if there are five more a street away.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And ditto for the auto rickshaw guy who doesn't know how many consumers would potentially

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.840
[Amit Varma]: want his services.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And Uber's technology and dynamic pricing takes care of the information problem, takes

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.640
[Amit Varma]: care of the matching supply and demand problem and completely changes everything.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.040
[Guest]: So I think the way the markets are regulated in Mumbai and Delhi are not very different

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.240
[Guest]: from the way they are regulated in, let's say, New York and London.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.680
[Guest]: The traditional view of regulators has been like, let us give out a limited number of

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.040
[Guest]: licenses and then impose certain rules on how these licenses are to be used, which basically

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.240
[Guest]: implies this is the price you can charge, this is how the price is going to be calculated,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.240
[Guest]: and you can work for so many hours a day.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.480
[Guest]: Depending on the jurisdiction to jurisdiction, these things change, but that's how these

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.040
[Guest]: markets have been regulated.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.000
[Guest]: But obviously, the regulators can't have a constant.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.440
[Guest]: So the first problem that comes with this is the demand supply thing because the number

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.280
[Guest]: of licenses is capped and doesn't necessarily increase with time.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.160
[Guest]: Very soon, you have a demand supply imbalance where regulation is well-enforced, such as

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160
[Guest]: New York.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.080
[Guest]: It just becomes a case of fastest fingers first.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.800
[Guest]: Whoever manages to get to the taxi first gets the taxi.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.320
[Guest]: Where regulation is poorly enforced, like in Chennai, it becomes a case of negotiations.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.880
[Guest]: Whoever can pay the most for the ride will get the ride.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.360
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's a good market in Chennai where because of the regulations, you have

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.960
[Guest]: a negotiation and the price mechanism for allocating the auto rickshaws.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.800
[Guest]: But the problem is that there's no information and there's no information exchange.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.480
[Guest]: So if I were to, and in the last episode, I spoke about how in the football market,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.280
[Guest]: because there's no good valuation mechanism, the bid and ask can be very far.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.120
[Guest]: And from my personal experience in places like Chennai, they are fairly far.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.280
[Guest]: You typically start bargaining at half the rate that the driver quotes you and so on,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.480
[Guest]: which is absolutely ridiculous because typically, taxi markets, you know there's a particular

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.400
[Guest]: reasonable distance estimate, time estimate, and so on.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.640
[Guest]: So you should have a good idea of what it should cost, but because you don't know what

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.600
[Guest]: the competitive landscape is like, you end up trying to bargain fairly aggressively and

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600
[Guest]: so on.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.760
[Guest]: So once you have a central aggregator who comes in, so this is the other thing that

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.200
[Guest]: I talk about in the book, is that a lot of people demonize middlemen, they say that middlemen

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.760
[Guest]: add no value and so on, and Uber, Ola, et cetera, are nothing but middlemen who try

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.120
[Guest]: to connect drivers and passengers.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.640
[Guest]: What the middleman does in this case is to enable transformation of information.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.760
[Guest]: He gets data on who's trying to travel from where to where at what point in time, and

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.840
[Guest]: then kind of transmits this data to all other users in the form of a price mechanism.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.480
[Guest]: So that's how they manage to kind of, while it might still be demand and supply, it's

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.760
[Guest]: still kind of a much more informed, search price is a much more informed multiple than

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.880
[Guest]: the bargains you have with your auto rickshaws.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And that informational aspect is a key part of dynamic pricing.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.600
[Amit Varma]: For example, when prices go up, they typically, they'll do two things.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.400
[Amit Varma]: One is they'll incentivize idle drivers to come out in the market, because, you know,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.880
[Amit Varma]: they know that there's more money to be made.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.660
[Amit Varma]: And equally, if someone wants to use the Uber for a very trivial purpose, he might choose

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.880
[Amit Varma]: to just stay home, or he might choose to take public transport.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.280
[Amit Varma]: But if someone needs it for an urgent purpose, like going to the catching a flight or going

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.480
[Amit Varma]: to the hospital, you know, they'd gladly pay the higher price, which is a true reflection

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
[Amit Varma]: of supply and demand.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So that kind of gets me to the crux of this episode.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:31.480
[Amit Varma]: I want to really ask you about is, in India, we've often had outrage at prices rising at

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.400
[Amit Varma]: times of high demand, which of course, they're bound to do in this dynamic system.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And in some places, you know, like Karnataka banned Uber search pricing at one point and

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Delhi experimented with banning it.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, the scene effects of this obviously is that the customer doesn't pay more than whatever

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.560
[Amit Varma]: the capped price is.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.960
[Amit Varma]: What are the unseen effects?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:58.680
[Guest]: Okay, so, first of all, I mean, let's distinguish between a capped price and banning dynamic

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680
[Guest]: pricing.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.680
[Guest]: I think the two are completely different things.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.120
[Guest]: So we'll come to that in a little bit.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.120
[Guest]: So I think what the regulators try to do is to completely ban dynamic pricing at all.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.920
[Guest]: They say that you need to have a particular fixed formula for pricing and charge customers

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920
[Guest]: based on that.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.080
[Guest]: The scene effect is that, okay, maybe this is going to keep the prices low.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.840
[Guest]: That order one unseen effect is that because it is going to jack up the average price.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.680
[Guest]: So if the earlier price was, let's say, 10 rupees, I'm just throwing a random number.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.240
[Guest]: Now the average price will be 15 rupees because you can't jack up from 10 to 20 when you want

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240
[Guest]: now and so on.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.320
[Guest]: So instead of charging 10 rupees all the time, you end up charging 15 rupees all the time.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.100
[Guest]: So the average price ends up going up.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.400
[Guest]: So that's the first order unseen effect.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.320
[Guest]: Second order unseen effect is that it leads to poor allocation in terms of you end up

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.800
[Guest]: allocating the right to the people who ask for it first or who are lucky enough to be

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.640
[Guest]: where they were when they asked for it and so on, rather than to the people who need

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.640
[Amit Varma]: it more.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.640
[Unknown]: It's a first come first serve.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640
[Guest]: It's a first come first serve.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.120
[Guest]: And then the other thing is that, I mean, yeah, there's no, because these guys are function

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.120
[Guest]: as marketplaces where the suppliers are also kind of independent people and not employees.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.400
[Guest]: What happens is that when you kind of ban dynamic pricing, there's no information to

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.600
[Guest]: the suppliers as well in terms of when their services are needed the most.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.040
[Guest]: So it might happen that, for example, there might be a particular Sunday when all Uber

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.000
[Guest]: drivers decide to take off for whatever reason.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.400
[Guest]: And that will lead to insane shortages because you can't use price to ration out whatever

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400
[Guest]: cabs you have.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.120
[Guest]: And there's no way for you to get any of these guys who are enjoying their Sundays to come

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.620
[Guest]: out and drive for you.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.520
[Guest]: But if you have dynamic pricing, then on the one hand, like on a particularly busy Sunday,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.560
[Guest]: whatever cabs are available, get allocated to the people who need it the most.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560
[Guest]: One.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.880
[Guest]: And second one is that, like, I mean, because the prices are higher, the drivers who value

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: their Sundays less than the others are actually going to come out and drive because they know

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.120
[Guest]: there's some good money to be made.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.280
[Guest]: And there's been some research, by the way, Uber is already 80 years old and there's been

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.680
[Guest]: enough research on whether dynamic pricing actually leads to a change in supply or if

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.520
[Guest]: it's just a change in demand and so on.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.600
[Guest]: So one very interesting piece of research has been done by a bunch of guys from Northeastern

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.720
[Guest]: University.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:24.520
[Guest]: And what they found is that high surge prices may not necessarily bring new drivers into

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.520
[Guest]: the market.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.680
[Guest]: As in people who are sitting at home don't automatically see, oh, it's 2x, let me go

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.280
[Guest]: take my car out and drive.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.760
[Guest]: But what it does is to, whatever cars are there in the city, they get allocated in a

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.160
[Guest]: better manner.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.280
[Guest]: So let's say I'm in Bandra, I'm an Uber driver, I'm in Bandra, and I see that I'm not getting

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.760
[Guest]: a ride for five minutes, I've waited without getting a ride.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.680
[Guest]: Now I see that in Malad, the surge multiple right now is 1.5x.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.920
[Guest]: I immediately know where to go to find my next ride because I know that, and this is

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.400
[Guest]: by the way, Uber shares this as a heat map with all its drivers.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.720
[Guest]: So I know that there is a demand supply imbalance in Malad, and if I go there, I will not only

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.360
[Guest]: get a passenger, but I'll also get a passenger who will be willing to pay more.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.640
[Guest]: And so it allocates the existing supply in a much, much superior manner.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And also, is it fair to say that beyond the immediate short term impact of, let's say,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.600
[Amit Varma]: at five o'clock on a Friday evening in rush hour, existing drivers are incentivized to

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.000
[Amit Varma]: go out for a ride because the price is higher.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.920
[Amit Varma]: And also in a broader sort of framework, if Uber drivers, because of this, because the

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.000
[Amit Varma]: services are valued, you know, get what they are valued more efficiently, if they actually

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.280
[Amit Varma]: start making more money on a monthly basis or whatever, you might have people in other

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.120
[Amit Varma]: professions saying, hey, maybe I should go for that.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:53.200
[Amit Varma]: And that can also help fill the sort of supply gap a little bit because, say, a night watchman

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.360
[Amit Varma]: who's earning 10,000 a month might see his friend who's an Uber driver earning 20,000,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.200
[Amit Varma]: and he makes a shift, which kind of also helps imbalance.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.840
[Guest]: And I think this has definitely been happening in India over the last couple of years, especially,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.680
[Guest]: I think, in order to build out their market, what Uber did was to, they gave out pretty

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.040
[Guest]: good incentives to get drivers on board for a while.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.640
[Guest]: And so and that's got a lot of people to move from other professions to get driving for

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640
[Guest]: these guys.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.880
[Guest]: And so and also, like, a lot of these guys are part time, they don't, like, I have met

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.400
[Guest]: quite a few drivers who they have contracts with these big taxi companies who lend out

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.960
[Guest]: cars to corporates, but that they only spend about two days a week doing that because that's

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
[Guest]: the amount of work they get.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.200
[Guest]: The other time they ride Uber, they let out their cars for Uber and so on.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.560
[Guest]: So it's sort of so because of this whole contracting model, because they don't have employees and

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.120
[Guest]: so on, it makes it extremely flexible, and it makes it extremely makes the market far

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.120
[Guest]: more efficient.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Far more efficient people are much more productive with the time the buyers benefit the sellers

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360
[Amit Varma]: benefit from.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:01.240
[Amit Varma]: So let me try and sum up what you mentioned as the unseen effects of banning search pricing,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.280
[Amit Varma]: or dynamic pricing.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Number one, the average price tends to go up.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.560
[Amit Varma]: So where your basic beginners price might be 50, you know, the system allows for the

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.160
[Amit Varma]: fact that the pricing will be fixed, and it's instead 75 and people who would otherwise

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.000
[Amit Varma]: have got a ride at 50 at non peak hours will have to pay 75 anyway.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Number two is in the short term, they lead to shortages because whenever demand outstrips

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.200
[Amit Varma]: supply, for example, if there are 200 customers who are waiting for 50 taxis, it will inevitably

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.720
[Amit Varma]: be first come first serve, or as you said, fastest finger first and the first 50 guys

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.600
[Amit Varma]: get it and the rest are left stranded, no matter how important their need is whether

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.880
[Amit Varma]: they need to go to the airport to catch a flight or take a relative to the hospital.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.080
[Amit Varma]: The third effect is that banning search pricing prevents information about the demand supply

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.960
[Amit Varma]: shortfall from getting out in the market in an efficient way.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.720
[Amit Varma]: So drivers, when there's a shortfall of drivers 200 people 150 cars, a dynamics price system

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.680
[Amit Varma]: would have kept a higher price and incentivize more drivers to go out there equally it would

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.920
[Amit Varma]: have incentivized some people who wanted taxis to instead take public transport or just stay

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.740
[Amit Varma]: at home if their need wasn't urgent, and that information doesn't get out anymore.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.240
[Amit Varma]: And number four, it perpetuates the system of shortages because this information isn't

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240
[Amit Varma]: getting out.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.440
[Amit Varma]: So those typical demand supply shortfalls will always remain.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.680
[Guest]: And this is one other thing that because that dynamic pricing kind of helps, right, it's

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.440
[Guest]: basically in terms of like, keeping drivers in the market.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:36.560
[Guest]: So what happens is that like now, with when you have fixed prices, the demand supply equation

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.600
[Guest]: turns around rapidly through the day.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.520
[Guest]: So during the morning peak hours, when people are need the rights to go to work to school

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.120
[Guest]: and all that, like you have massive demand, shortage of supply.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.960
[Guest]: And then through the day, let's say beyond the morning office hours until the evening

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.640
[Guest]: office, school hours or office hours, there's very little demand.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.680
[Guest]: So what happens in that case is that like, kind of you have people switching off, you

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.240
[Guest]: have people kind of going off the roads, people, you figure out that you're anyway not going

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.040
[Guest]: to get too many rights in this period.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.200
[Guest]: So you might as well not drive the taxis and so on.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.400
[Guest]: And because of that, what happens is like, the liquidity goes down in these periods.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.680
[Guest]: Because the demand is low, the supply also contracts and like, it becomes illiquid.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.400
[Guest]: What dynamic pricing allows is that like, it says, it's okay.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.440
[Guest]: I know that there aren't too many people asking for a ride right now, why don't you drive

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440
[Guest]: at a lower price?

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.380
[Guest]: Anyway, you're out on the road, anyway, your opportunity cost of doing the next ride now

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.860
[Guest]: is going to be lower than it was in the morning.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.040
[Guest]: So why don't you just accept a lower price right now?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.400
[Guest]: And the lower price also means that like more people are willing to kind of travel then

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
[Guest]: and so on.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.000
[Guest]: So I think it massively improves the utilization of the taxis and of the driver's dynamic pricing.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.280
[Guest]: And that's one effect, which is a, it's a kind of an N-th order effect, which is a little

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280
[Guest]: hard to see.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.200
[Guest]: But I think that's, that's where I think these days are really kind of improving the market.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.760
[Amit Varma]: So now I want to move on to, you know, from the economics of it to a sort of a political

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.760
[Amit Varma]: economy question.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Like typically, we find that interest groups which ask for surge pricing to be banned or

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.400
[Amit Varma]: which you know, want legislation against Uber and Ola are typically the entrenched people

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.880
[Amit Varma]: in the business like the black and yellow guys or the unions of the auto rickshaw guys

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.240
[Amit Varma]: who realized that they are getting hurt by all this because if an Uber is cheaper than

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.280
[Amit Varma]: an auto rickshaw and much more convenient than a black and yellow, why should you take

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280
[Amit Varma]: those?

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's easy to paint them as villains.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.360
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, they also have a legitimate point when they say that they are victims

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.480
[Amit Varma]: of bad regulation, because in the first place, the government put them in that mess by constraining

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.640
[Amit Varma]: the supply.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.120
[Amit Varma]: And they often had to pay a lot just to get that license.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.160
[Amit Varma]: For example, a New York medallion at one point was prohibitively expensive.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And the idea was a guy would earn it back over the period of years.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And then suddenly up comes Uber and you know, the demand for the regular taxis has gone

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.240
[Amit Varma]: down greatly.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.760
[Amit Varma]: So how do we sort of reconcile all these issues?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.400
[Guest]: Yeah, so it's a very legitimate kind of a claim that these guys are victims of bad regulation

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.560
[Guest]: because I mean, they got into those professions because they were told it's the number of

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.120
[Guest]: licenses is capped, then you can earn so much and so on.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.120
[Guest]: So I think in terms of this rate, what I would prefer is more of a kind of what I call is

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.080
[Guest]: a continuous solution rather than a discrete solution.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:31.520
[Guest]: I think the best example of that I have seen a penalty against Uber and Ola, which kind

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: of possibly favors these incumbent guys, but doesn't like really eliminate the new guys

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.400
[Guest]: is in the Mumbai Airport domestic terminal.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.160
[Guest]: The last time I traveled to Mumbai was about a year back.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.760
[Guest]: So things might have changed since then.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.200
[Guest]: But what I saw was this like, if you are an Uber or an Ola who's looking to pick up a

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.840
[Guest]: passenger from the Mumbai domestic terminal, you need to pay a surcharge.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.340
[Guest]: You need to pay a kind of a short term parking fee of 100 rupees or something like that.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.920
[Guest]: So that pushes up the cost of taking one of these things.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.160
[Guest]: So it's like, okay, I know you're disrupting the market.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.880
[Guest]: So you pay us a part of that as our rent, which we will distribute to the incumbent

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.000
[Guest]: so that the disruption is kind of eased and so on.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.080
[Guest]: So I think that is a significantly superior solution compared to earlier efforts where

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.600
[Guest]: they decided to either ban these guys from the airport or say that we want to put a price

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.360
[Guest]: floor, you can't charge less than this and so on.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.360
[Guest]: So I think this is something like this, where like you have a kind of a, you tax these guys,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.120
[Guest]: you tax these guys, use a part of their tax proceeds to kind of ease the transition from

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.000
[Guest]: the old regime to the new regime.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.920
[Guest]: But I mean, it takes a tremendous political will to do this.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And also the example you gave, I mean, that that airport thing is still on, by the way,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.280
[Amit Varma]: I think they have to pay 110 bucks to enter.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.380
[Amit Varma]: But then that is a case of a limited space, which is the airport, which is charging an

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.600
[Amit Varma]: access fee, which it is within its rights to do and whatever.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.820
[Amit Varma]: But those kinds of things, it strikes me, just thinking aloud, that if you expanded

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.640
[Amit Varma]: over a city and you tax Uber and you sort of subsidize the other guys and you ease the

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:10.480
[Amit Varma]: transition, a, those taxes slash subsidies tend to become permanent over time, because,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, regulation always moves in the direction of more regulation, not less regulation.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And that might, one could argue, defeat the purpose a little bit, because if you had an

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.960
[Amit Varma]: illiquid market, which has suddenly been made liquid by this new technology, why restrict

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.480
[Amit Varma]: the liquidity in the market through this kind of a measure?

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.200
[Guest]: No, I completely agree that this kind of stuff, this doesn't restrict the liquidity, it slightly

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200
[Guest]: reduces the liquidity.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.800
[Guest]: I think what happens is like, I mean, if you have this, so I'm not offering it as a solution,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.880
[Guest]: I'm not offering, I'm not saying this is what needs to be done.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.480
[Guest]: But what I'm saying is, if you're thinking of the solution as a ban, this is a much superior

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:50.080
[Guest]: way to do it than a ban, as in it's a, it's better than what the solutions that are being

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.360
[Guest]: proposed now are things like ban, things like, you can't have surge pricing, and it's quite

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.680
[Guest]: crazy if you're an Uber driver right now, I mean, like, because regulation is so easy,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.760
[Guest]: you don't know when you might be stopped, and a cop might decide to take away your car

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760
[Guest]: and so on.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.360
[Guest]: It's, it's like completely unfair to these guys how things are being regulated right

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360
[Guest]: now.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.160
[Guest]: So I mean, like, yeah, so having some kind of a basic regulation is great.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.800
[Guest]: But yeah, it's basically in terms of like, not as in having the regulation is great,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.040
[Guest]: because like, you will at least know when a cop can stop you and when he can't stop

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.600
[Guest]: you and so on at the very least, but like, it's kind of you don't want to, I completely

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.360
[Guest]: agree with you that like, regulation always moves, increasing over time and so on.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.320
[Guest]: So but yeah, so in that sense, like a ban is like, the outright, the worst option, the

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320
[Amit Varma]: worst idea.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.000
[Amit Varma]: At a practical level, I completely agree with you and it's kind of tragic that companies

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.280
[Amit Varma]: like Uber are not just in the business of business, but they also have to be in the

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.920
[Amit Varma]: business of politics because in every local jurisdiction, they have to face different

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.840
[Amit Varma]: kinds of restrictions aimed at them.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And I think one thing that one measure we should certainly take immediately to make

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.880
[Amit Varma]: life easier for the auto guys and the taxi guys who have been hit is remove the regulations

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:11.120
[Amit Varma]: on them, remove the sort of licensing constraints, remove the pricing constraints, and let them

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.680
[Amit Varma]: figure out mechanisms to, you know, join the liquid market or be part of their own kind

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.720
[Amit Varma]: of liquid market with their own apps or whatever.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.280
[Amit Varma]: But remove those restrictions, because right now, it's really not a level playing field.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And the solution for that is not to make it less level for the Ubers and Olas of the world

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.240
[Amit Varma]: and put the same restrictions on them.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.800
[Amit Varma]: But the solution for that is to make it equally free for everybody, because that is how both

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.280
[Amit Varma]: buyers and sellers benefit.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.280
[Guest]: No, I completely agree with I think there have been some markets every time what every

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.520
[Guest]: time you have some controversy with Uber or something, you have talks of a taxi union

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.440
[Guest]: which says that, okay, we are going to get our own app developed so that we can do something

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440
[Guest]: similar.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.920
[Guest]: But unfortunately, the problem with them is that they have like price caps, price, price

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.720
[Guest]: flows, everything, there's like way too much control on their life that they can't do any

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720
[Guest]: of this thing.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720
[Guest]: I mean, it would be great.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720
[Guest]: I mean, think of it, right?

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.880
[Guest]: I mean, there's no reason why the government should be setting price flows, like on something

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880
[Guest]: like this.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.760
[Guest]: So if you can have, I mean, again, this is a second best solution, this is not the ideal

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
[Guest]: solution.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.080
[Guest]: The ideal solution would be to not have any regulation.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.720
[Guest]: But I'm talking about like, basically, if you really want to regulate this thing, what

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.760
[Guest]: you do is have a price cap on these guys and then say like, okay, you're free to charge

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.320
[Guest]: anywhere up to this.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.240
[Guest]: They can form their own, each union can have their own app for all you care and they can

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.600
[Guest]: have, so rather than just having Uber and Ola, I'm a little uncomfortable with the Duopoly

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.600
[Guest]: right now.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.680
[Guest]: But you will have like more players because like, and so on, so it's like, there are definitely

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.320
[Guest]: significantly better ways to make this market more efficient.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320
[Guest]: Awesome.
