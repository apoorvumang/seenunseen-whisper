00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
[Amit Varma]: Assuming that being alive is a good thing, we are all lucky to have been born in these

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840
[Amit Varma]: times.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: As recently as 200 years ago, I'd have expected to be dead before 40, leave alone reach this

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.800
[Amit Varma]: ripe old age of 47.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
[Amit Varma]: If I got a common cold or an allergy, I could just die of that.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Forget about diseases like cancer because most people didn't live long enough to get

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.080
[Amit Varma]: In the 19th century, alternative medicine, which I'd call quackery, thrived because

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.280
[Amit Varma]: mainstream medicine was a mess.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.320
[Amit Varma]: The germ theory wasn't yet accepted by the profession and just going to a hospital could

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.720
[Amit Varma]: kill you, even if disease didn't.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Even basic hygiene was absent.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.620
[Amit Varma]: One of my heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, died after giving birth to her daughter, who we

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.920
[Amit Varma]: now remember as Mary Shelley, because a doctor hadn't washed his hands.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920
[Amit Varma]: She got a fatal infection.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, times have changed.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.440
[Amit Varma]: The medicine of today would seem like unbelievable magic to the primitives of just a hundred

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.480
[Amit Varma]: years ago.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.160
[Amit Varma]: But it's not magic, it's science.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
[Amit Varma]: Now here's the thing, we should still not be complacent.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Our scientists might have understood our bodies and created magnificent medicines, but those

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.800
[Amit Varma]: medicines still have to reach us.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.220
[Amit Varma]: Someone has to make them.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.960
[Amit Varma]: You can create the finest of medicines in your labs, but how are they actually being

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.040
[Amit Varma]: manufactured in our factories?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040
[Amit Varma]: Is there Jugaar involved?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.200
[Amit Varma]: Are people dying as a result?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.920
[Amit Varma]: The answer, especially if you are in India, is yes.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.480
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.520
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.320
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Dinesh Thakur, once a respected scientist in the healthcare industry and now

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280
[Amit Varma]: a crusader on behalf of all of us.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.480
[Amit Varma]: I first read about Dinesh in a brilliant book by Catherine Eban called Bottle of Lies, Ranbaxy

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and the Dark Side of Indian Pharma.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.760
[Amit Varma]: Dinesh is one of the heroes of the book, which is about the great fraud committed by the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.480
[Amit Varma]: company Ranbaxy, which no doubt took countless lives across the world.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.240
[Amit Varma]: Now some quick context.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: In the pharma world, big companies spend huge amounts of money creating new drugs.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: When a new drug created by a company gets approved by regulators, they have the exclusive

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.600
[Amit Varma]: right to make it and sell it for a number of years.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.120
[Amit Varma]: This allows them to recoup the expenses of research and development.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.400
[Amit Varma]: Now after this period expires, other companies can also make these medicines and these are

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: now called generics.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.400
[Amit Varma]: These generics are sold at a much lower cost than the original drug.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.840
[Amit Varma]: And if you want to make something for a low cost, well, India is a good place to start.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.720
[Amit Varma]: The Indian pharma industry's reputation got a big boost about a couple of decades ago

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.040
[Amit Varma]: when Cipla, driven by the visionary Yusuf Hameed, made cocktails of AIDS medicine for

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.440
[Amit Varma]: a dollar a day, which was a fraction of what it had cost until then.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.400
[Amit Varma]: This was a big deal for the developing world, especially Africa, and probably saved millions

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400
[Amit Varma]: of lives.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.960
[Amit Varma]: The remarkable thing about this was that the reduction in cost did not mean a reduction

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
[Amit Varma]: in quality.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Cipla's processes were outstanding and they helped get India the reputation of being the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.960
[Amit Varma]: pharmacy of the world.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.820
[Amit Varma]: Now Indian companies rushed in to make generics and one of the early giants was Ranbaxy.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: This is the part of the story where Dinesh comes in.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.720
[Amit Varma]: He left a plush job in the USA to come work at Ranbaxy, excited by this new age of Indian

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720
[Amit Varma]: pharma.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.560
[Amit Varma]: But he soon realised that Ranbaxy was a company driven by Jugaad.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.380
[Amit Varma]: While on the job, he found out that they routinely forge data to give to regulators.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.320
[Amit Varma]: Most of their so-called medicines were never even tested.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.640
[Amit Varma]: Dinesh and his team found that over 50% of the data given by Ranbaxy to the FDA, the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.240
[Amit Varma]: main regulator in the USA, was fake.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.880
[Amit Varma]: 100% of the data for India was fake.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880
[Amit Varma]: All of it.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And ditto for the developing world.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, in an internal meeting, the subject came up that the medicine Ranbaxy sent to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.860
[Amit Varma]: Africa probably did not work.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.760
[Amit Varma]: One Ranbaxy executive replied, quote, who cares, it's just blacks dying, stop quote.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.800
[Amit Varma]: When Dinesh realised what was happening, he resigned.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.300
[Amit Varma]: And then he realised that he could not stay silent while millions of people were putting

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.960
[Amit Varma]: their faith in medicines that could kill them.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So he complained to the FDA, who began an inquiry into Ranbaxy.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.100
[Amit Varma]: They filed a suit against Ranbaxy and Ranbaxy lost.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.160
[Amit Varma]: They paid out a huge sum as a settlement and admitted that they were guilty of all that

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.820
[Amit Varma]: they had been accused of.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.800
[Amit Varma]: But this did not solve anything in India.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.120
[Amit Varma]: The culture of Jugaad continues in the Indian pharma industry to this day.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.320
[Amit Varma]: In his conversation with me, Dinesh describes in chilling detail not only his own experiences

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.680
[Amit Varma]: at Ranbaxy, but also the state of Indian pharma since and why he continues to wage a crusade

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.840
[Amit Varma]: to reform the system.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, I know I've spent a lot of time on this introduction giving this context, but I did

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.560
[Amit Varma]: it because this issue more than any other issue I have discussed in the last five years

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.320
[Amit Varma]: affects people's lives directly.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.240
[Amit Varma]: It's not hyperbole to say that this is actually a matter of life and death.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.600
[Amit Varma]: So please listen.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.760
[Amit Varma]: But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.940
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.400
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.040
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.600
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.080
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.200
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.200
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.960
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.360
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.080
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.300
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.900
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.400
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.240

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Dinesh, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280
[Guest]: This has been a long-term coming.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.600
[Guest]: I mean, we've been corresponding almost for a little over a year now, almost a year and

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
[Guest]: a half.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.700
[Guest]: And I'm finally glad to be in the same place as you, you know, to record this and talk

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.700
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, I was very fascinated by the book, The Bottle of Lies by Katharine Iban, in which

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.640
[Amit Varma]: you play kind of leading role and also by the larger questions that it raises.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.800
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, one of the interesting things about our existence is that there are so many

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800
[Amit Varma]: things we normalize.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
[Amit Varma]: We take it for granted.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
[Amit Varma]: We don't think about it.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.980
[Amit Varma]: So we assume, for example, that there is a rule of law, or we assume that the medicine

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.280
[Amit Varma]: that we take works, or that the rupee that I earn today will have the same value tomorrow

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.400
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.440
[Amit Varma]: We kind of survive on these foundations of trust, which at some points you can discover

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.800
[Amit Varma]: are a little shakier than one thought.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.000
[Amit Varma]: But before we kind of get to the subject at hand, I want to speak a little bit about you.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.200
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about your early life, because someone who just heard of you in a cursory

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.120
[Amit Varma]: way may think of you as a crusader for a particular kind of cause, or a civil activist of sorts.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's not just in healthcare, but civil rights also that you've been active, but you're

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.440
[Amit Varma]: also someone who is deeply into music, you're a Hindustani classical musician who's been

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.020
[Amit Varma]: part of bands.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.600
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of the young Dinesh Thakur, where did you grow up, where did you go to

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.800
[Guest]: school?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:06.800
[Guest]: So my family originally is from UP, from Muzaffarnagar, Western UP, you know, they praise us in the

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.440
[Guest]: news for all the wrong reasons, but you know, that's where we're from.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.960
[Guest]: But for the last three generations, we've been, you know, sort of living in, you know,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.660
[Guest]: the Hirshwaila, Andhra Pradesh and now Telangana.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.600
[Guest]: My great grandfather was an armyman, you know, in the old Nizam's army.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.920
[Guest]: That's how we migrated there.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.520
[Guest]: And then ever since we've been living, you know, in that area.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.680
[Guest]: I grew up in a little town called Nizamabad, which is about, I think about 170 kilometers

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.240
[Guest]: north of Hyderabad, because my grandparents had a place there.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.240
[Guest]: My dad essentially grew up there.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.660
[Guest]: He got a degree in law from the Nizam's college in Hyderabad, then he started practicing law.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: So that's where, you know, I grew up, I was born in Hyderabad.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.560
[Guest]: Typical middle class family, you know, went to, I started actually, my education started

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:58.800
[Guest]: with a Hindi medium school, because that was the closest school that was to where we lived.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: It was a Marwadi school.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.120
[Guest]: I remember my grandfather sort of walking me to school and bringing me back.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.920
[Guest]: But soon enough, you know, there was a convent school that was a little further down, you

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.120
[Guest]: know, the road.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.240
[Guest]: And I think I was in second or third grade that, you know, I'd gotten into the Catholic

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.240
[Guest]: school and that's where I graduated from.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.120
[Guest]: And then, you know, 11th and 12th was a local government college, which is a godforsaken

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.120
[Guest]: college.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760
[Guest]: But anyway, went through that.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.240
[Guest]: In those days, the Ismaili state of Hyderabad used to administer what was called the Common

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800
[Guest]: Entrance Examination.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.400
[Guest]: I think it was called EAMCT or something like that, Engineering and Medical Common Entrance

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400
[Guest]: Examination.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.680
[Guest]: So, you know, went through that.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.960
[Guest]: I think I was ranked like 3000 some odd and, you know, by the time my turn came around,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.040
[Guest]: the only thing that was available at that time was chemical engineering.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.840
[Guest]: So I talked to my dad and basically said, look, you know, why can't I do law?

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.000
[Guest]: Because he was a lawyer.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.400
[Guest]: And he said, no, no, you're good at math.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.400
[Guest]: You should actually become an engineer.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.040
[Guest]: And that was the only engineering available at that point in time, you know, given where

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
[Guest]: I was.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.760
[Guest]: So I ended up sort of enrolling into an engineering college at Dosmani University.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.960
[Guest]: It's a really old university in Hyderabad, you know, very reputable.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.680
[Guest]: Now I think it's very different.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.920
[Guest]: But in those days, it still stood for something, trained really good people.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.040
[Guest]: So those were four interesting years, you know, in Dosmani.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.560
[Guest]: Then, you know, graduated and then, you know, it was interesting in those days, you know,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.440
[Guest]: one of the things that we all used to do was everybody who graduated sort of applied to

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440
[Guest]: go to the United States.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.080
[Guest]: That was kind of a given at that point in time.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.800
[Guest]: So, you know, I ended up sort of applying to a bunch of schools there, got accepted

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.960
[Guest]: to the University of New Hampshire, they gave me a scholarship and ended up going to Durham

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
[Guest]: at that point in time.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.200
[Guest]: There's no way that I would have been able to afford it on my own without a scholarship.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.840
[Guest]: But that was just luck, just worked out that way.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.360
[Guest]: And wound up in New Hampshire and then got my master's degree there.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.920
[Guest]: And then that's how my career essentially began.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.600
[Amit Varma]: I'll stay a little bit with the earlier years before you kind of end up there, because what

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.320
[Amit Varma]: sort of interests me is, one, you're just three or four years older than me.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.360
[Amit Varma]: So we are almost the same sort of generation in a sense.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm curious about growing up at that time, like you mentioned that chemical engineering

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.640
[Amit Varma]: was like the one thing left.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.480
[Amit Varma]: So that's where you opt for that.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.160
[Amit Varma]: So number one, what was your conception of yourself like, like, did you think in terms

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160
[Amit Varma]: of I want to do this?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160
[Amit Varma]: I want to do that?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160
[Amit Varma]: What were your models?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.300
[Amit Varma]: What were your heroes?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Because I know so many of the influences back in those days used to come from like, cinema,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.040
[Amit Varma]: for example, Bollywood in our case, and, you know, maybe Telugu cinema in your case, I

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040
[Amit Varma]: don't know.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.400
[Amit Varma]: But so many of them came from cinema and also about the values that one takes, like you

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.080
[Amit Varma]: have spoken elsewhere about how your grandmother reading the Ramayana and Mahabharata to you

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.200
[Amit Varma]: had a deep influence.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'm very interested in that, because it seems that in that kind of environment where

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.560
[Amit Varma]: you're growing up in the 70s and 80s, there can be two kinds of influences on you when

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.640
[Amit Varma]: it comes to values.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.560
[Amit Varma]: And one is what you see happening around you.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.280
[Amit Varma]: And the other is from these kind of things that percolate down, whether it's your grandmother

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.640
[Amit Varma]: teaching you Ramayana and Mahabharata or the Amar Chitra Katha and so on.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.380
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that, because these seem very contrary to me.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.480
[Amit Varma]: One of the themes of your experiences in later times also is this sort of culture of, you

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.120
[Amit Varma]: know, just doing whatever it takes to make money, just doing whatever it takes to get

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.920
[Amit Varma]: ahead and not having a sort of a deeper core there.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.160
[Amit Varma]: So how did these two sort of play out when you were a kid?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.200
[Guest]: So you know, I think, I mean, look, I think that my childhood was no different than, for

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.600
[Guest]: example, I'm sure all of our childhood, right?

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:46.080
[Guest]: You know, we all grew up with, you know, a larger family, joint family, where you live

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.480
[Guest]: with your parents and grandparents.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.400
[Guest]: And you know, in my case, both my grandparents had a, you know, disproportionately large

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400
[Unknown]: impact on me.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.000
[Guest]: I think my grandfather passed away, you know, 1970s, I was very, very young at that time.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.840
[Guest]: I mean, I have very few memories, but my grandma was still around.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.060
[Guest]: She passed away in the early 90s.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:11.280
[Guest]: But I have very fond memories of, but and think about like, you know, in large Indian

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.920
[Guest]: families, the matriarch, right?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.880
[Guest]: Grandma essentially is the one who essentially runs the house.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.960
[Guest]: I mean, she was a little petite lady, you know, she was like five odd, five feet odd.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.920
[Guest]: But you know, the will of an iron sort of strength, and she was the one who essentially

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.960
[Guest]: ran the house.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.880
[Guest]: This is a part of the story, I mean, that I don't think I've ever told anyone before.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.200
[Guest]: So I'm going to have to try and take you back, you know, a couple of hundred years before,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.600
[Guest]: because life kind of, you know, entangles you in very different ways, right?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.400
[Guest]: If you know about the history of the Singh brothers, right?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.000
[Guest]: The family that essentially they come from, their maternal side of their family is very

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
[Guest]: illustrious.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.080
[Guest]: You know, Baba Charan Singh, who was the head of the Rajaswami Satsang, you know, in base

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.400
[Guest]: in Punjab, he essentially comes from a lineage of, you know, I mean, today's, when you think

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.840
[Guest]: about gurus, right?

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.100
[Guest]: You think about the, you know, the Jaggi Vasudev, Asaram Bapu, to me, those are not the kind

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.100
[Guest]: of people that there are.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.800
[Guest]: I mean, there are people who essentially were mystics.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.200
[Guest]: And this gentleman, Charan Singh was one of those people who essentially came from that

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200
[Guest]: line.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.480
[Guest]: Now, for whatever reason, I think that art, that skill is disappearing.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.800
[Guest]: We don't think about those things anymore.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.040
[Guest]: But there was a time when those people were alive, you know, they used to essentially

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.200
[Guest]: practice sadhana and they knew what they were doing, right?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.360
[Guest]: So if you trace the lineage of that Sufi tradition all the way to Khusro and to Nizamuddin Auliya

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.840
[Guest]: and, you know, the way that that evolved at that point in time, there were two branches

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840
[Guest]: of that.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.480
[Guest]: One was the BS side, which is the Charan Singh side of it.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.520
[Guest]: The other branch was Agra side, which is where, you know, sort of the other branch of the

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.800
[Guest]: teaching of Swamiji Maharaj essentially came from that.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.720
[Guest]: The reason I'm saying this is because that lineage percolated down into my family and,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.960
[Guest]: you know, I can't tell you whether it's serendipity or what, that I had to get entangled with

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.160
[Guest]: the people who essentially came down from the Charan Singh side.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.440
[Guest]: Because you know, I've, as a child, I've seen, you know, what mystics can do.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.640
[Guest]: They were, I mean, my grandma was one of those.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:36.240
[Guest]: So it's the tradition of, you know, hearing Ramayana read to you, the tradition of hearing

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.560
[Guest]: Mahabharata read to you.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.960
[Guest]: We had copies of Kabir, B.J., like four or five of them in the house, you know, that

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.240
[Guest]: we ended up reading.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.240
[Guest]: That's why, you know, the episode that you did of Gita Press with Akshaya Mukul was so

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.200
[Guest]: resonating in the way that, you know, that entire sort of tradition about the printed

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.520
[Guest]: word evolved over a period of time, you know, so that was environment I grew up in where,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.400
[Guest]: you know, we had this notion of, you know, where you had in a gathering, you know, certain

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.560
[Guest]: date or time of the year or whatever, the year where you sat and listen essentially

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.400
[Guest]: to Kabir, B.J. being read back to you or Tulsi Ramcharitmanas being read back to you.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.600
[Guest]: And realize that these are written in Dohas, right?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.360
[Guest]: You don't know what that means as a child of five, six, seven years of age.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.600
[Guest]: But then your grandma is explaining to you what that really means, right?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.000
[Guest]: Providing you the context of, you know, what a specific Doha actually really means.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.680
[Guest]: If you read Tulsi Das's Ramcharitmanas, you know, it is such a beautiful poetry.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.840
[Guest]: But then, you know, as a child, you don't know how to comprehend that.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.040
[Guest]: You listen to Kabir, you know, writing about, I mean, this is Nirguni, right?

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.220
[Guest]: I mean, completely different kind of thinking in terms of how Kabir imagines the Almighty

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.880
[Guest]: to be, right?

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.760
[Guest]: And the way he describes the world around him.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.920
[Guest]: It's very hard for a person to reconcile those two things, right, where in one poem, you're

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.300
[Guest]: trying to imagine God in the form of a person incarnate.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.720
[Guest]: In the other side, you're essentially saying there's a Nirguni, there's no gun, right?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.960
[Guest]: Kabir talked completely about a Nirguni Bhagwan, right?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.400
[Guest]: I mean, he says, okay, this is where you need to go, this is where you came from, this is

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400
[Guest]: where…

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.320
[Guest]: So, those are kind of early influences trying to reconcile those dichotomies in life and

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.280
[Guest]: figuring out those have stayed with me for a long period of time.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.880
[Guest]: I don't know if that's good or bad, but, you know, it is what it is.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And in general, when you sort of look at current times and from what you're saying, it then

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.840
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that we can, that there's a different kind of corruption at play here, a different

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of evolution where you have these religious and spiritual traditions, which come down

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.280
[Amit Varma]: over a period of time, which have popular resonance, as in Kabir's Ohas and all of that.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:00.480
[Amit Varma]: And yet, over the last few decades, perhaps, this political impetus to take it in a particular

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.440
[Amit Varma]: direction, almost as if aping the West in terms of there, the religions are religions

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440
[Amit Varma]: of the book.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440
[Amit Varma]: There is that one book.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.320
[Amit Varma]: So, a similar thing where you try to homogenize an understanding of what Hinduism is and what

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320
[Amit Varma]: religion is.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.640
[Amit Varma]: And just as I keep saying, we contain multitudes, I mean, the religion contains more multitudes

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.080
[Amit Varma]: than anything else, not even a religion, a way of being, as it were, and that's also

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080
[Amit Varma]: gotten corrupted.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting that you speak of that particular tradition, the Swami Satsang

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Bohas, which is again, another strand of that is there in the Ranbaxy folks, Malvinder and

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Shivinder and the kind of nonsense that is happening there, where it essentially comes

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.720
[Amit Varma]: down to being a modern day cult and nothing else, everything else is lost.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.240
[Amit Varma]: So, just looking around at India, is that something that you feel that has also happened,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.880
[Amit Varma]: that in some ways we've let this great religion down by going on and on about how great it

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.880
[Guest]: is?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.560
[Guest]: You know, that's a very deep question you're asking and I don't know if I'm qualified enough

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.560
[Guest]: to answer that.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.960
[Guest]: But, you know, as somebody who, I don't practice religion, that I don't go to temples anymore

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.800
[Guest]: because to me, you know, the experience doesn't mean anything.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.240
[Guest]: I mean, you see pictures of people going to a temple to be showered around because, you

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.760
[Guest]: know, you want to spend a few minutes in front of the deity.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.280
[Guest]: I can do that at home.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.040
[Guest]: I don't have to go to a temple to do that.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.760
[Guest]: But I think that, you know, I certainly have an opinion about the politicization of religion,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.720
[Guest]: which I think is just terrible.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.680
[Guest]: I think that, you know, whether it's the new age, you know, aspect of how religion is perceived

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.880
[Guest]: or the old age, which is the fundamentalist aspect of how the religion is practiced.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.680
[Guest]: It just turns me away, personally.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.200
[Guest]: I don't know whether, you know, that's something that I can authoritatively speak about it.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.480
[Guest]: But purely from a personal point of view, I think that, you know, the entire purpose

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.880
[Guest]: of, you know, religion and tradition was to develop a sense of understanding of your place

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.540
[Guest]: in the universe, right?

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.440
[Guest]: That seems to have completely gotten lost.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.640
[Guest]: We don't talk about, you know, why we are, you know, and where we are.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.240
[Guest]: We just focus on what is it that we want to do to try and advance a cause.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.360
[Guest]: I don't know what that cause is.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.020
[Guest]: For some people, that cause is to build a temple.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.840
[Guest]: Some people, the cause is essentially to build clean rivers, or I'm not saying that one is

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.760
[Guest]: better than the other, but, you know, this existential question of why we are where we

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.680
[Guest]: are, I don't know whether we actually even ask that question anymore, right?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.520
[Guest]: So I don't know what to say to the question that you're asking.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, none of us, I mean, I don't know who's qualified to even speak about it these days,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640
[Amit Varma]: you know.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.160
[Amit Varma]: So it's like, I think everyone's sort of feeling of it is as valid as anything else.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.920
[Amit Varma]: I just remembered that growing up, I would never be at odds with, say, being born a Hindu

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.680
[Amit Varma]: in this particular place, but not actually being a practicing Hindu.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, being an atheist to school, having the kind of beliefs I do, which some would

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.200
[Amit Varma]: say are enlightenment values, but having all of that was fine.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.240
[Amit Varma]: I still fit in here.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240
[Amit Varma]: This was still my home.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm still part of the civilization, and I could be whatever else.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And today, one just feels that the space for that in one sense is not diminishing per se,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.400
[Amit Varma]: perhaps that's a big statement, but that there are people who would like it to diminish,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.160
[Amit Varma]: who would like it to define the civilization in a particular way, and just make everything

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.960
[Amit Varma]: so combative, instead of just letting us quietly contain multitudes.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell me more about then, you know, what going to New Hampshire was like, like, was a sort

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.240
[Amit Varma]: of a culture shock?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240
[Amit Varma]: What was the study like?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Did you enjoy chemical engineering?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.880
[Guest]: It was, you know, it was certainly a completely new experience for me.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.360
[Guest]: I mean, I'd never been actually, that was my, I think the first flight that I ever actually

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.680
[Guest]: took from Bombay, Pan Am used to operate in those days, hadn't gone bankrupt in those

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.560
[Guest]: days.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.680
[Guest]: But you know, the way that I learned was very different.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.520
[Guest]: I'll just tell you an interesting anecdote.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:12.240
[Guest]: So I was thinking about this on my ride coming here, one of the courses that I took in college

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.680
[Guest]: while I was enrolled in Osmania, it was a mandatory course for chemical engineers, it

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.840
[Guest]: was called the material energy balance, which teaches you the fact, you know, how energy

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.600
[Guest]: gets converted from mass to energy, right?

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.640
[Guest]: So in that course, and I don't know if this ever happened to you, but in those days, I'm

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.040
[Guest]: talking about the 80s and 90s, right, there were no computers, you know, so the question

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.280
[Guest]: papers used to be cyclostyle, so the professor used to actually write the question on a piece

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.600
[Guest]: of paper.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.680
[Guest]: And then they used to get cyclostyle because Xerox was really expensive, right?

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.320
[Guest]: And you used to, I mean, everybody got a piece of the cyclostyle paper, and then the question,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.560
[Guest]: you had to write down the answer to your solution to that question.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.320
[Guest]: Unfortunately, the one that I got was kind of blurry, it wasn't like visible, because

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.280
[Guest]: you know, you really have to push down very hard to make that mark on the cyclostyle paper,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280
[Guest]: right?

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.840
[Guest]: And then it goes to the machine, and then you run around and the Vax generates it.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.320
[Guest]: So when I did my math in that equation, I was off by two digits, because the decimal

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.480
[Guest]: wasn't visible to me, right?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.280
[Guest]: So when my paper was evaluated, because my answer didn't actually match what the professor

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: was expecting, I got a zero on it.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.560
[Guest]: The only reason was because I couldn't read the decimal point in the question that was

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560
[Guest]: defined.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.280
[Guest]: And the reason I say this to you was because when I juxtapose this experience to the way

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.200
[Guest]: I was taught, you know, when I went to UNH.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.840
[Guest]: So one of the courses that I had to take there was fluid mechanics, right?

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.080
[Guest]: So Professor Carr was my teacher there.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.920
[Guest]: And you know, my term paper was, and in those days, like this is 1991, right?

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.720
[Guest]: Stents essentially, you know, the stuff that we put it in arteries, and they were not like,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.280
[Guest]: you know, on board, they were just being developed.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.560
[Guest]: So one of the things that you get taught as a chemical engineer is how do fluids flow?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.440
[Guest]: Because you know, you have to mix things, you have to make sure that you blend slurries

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.160
[Guest]: and stuff like that.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.560
[Guest]: And people who are your listeners who have done any kind of chemical engineering will

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: know that you get taught about venturi flow, laminar flow, turbulent flow, eddies, and

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.240
[Guest]: things of that nature.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.800
[Guest]: On one hand, the experience of getting taught in India was that, you know, you used to mug

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.160
[Guest]: these things, go out, then vomit it out on a piece of paper, and God forbid, if you didn't

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.080
[Guest]: read the cyclostyle paper correctly, you got a zero on it.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.120
[Guest]: Other side of that was Professor Carr, his term paper was, he wanted us to sit down and

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:38.080
[Guest]: think about what angle of a stent would be appropriate.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.640
[Guest]: Because again, you know, there is fluid, there is essentially plasma running through your

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.440
[Guest]: arteries and veins, right?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.800
[Guest]: So if you have to put a stent in, you can design a stent to be a Y, right?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.760
[Guest]: So you know, you can have a stent going in with bifurcating, you can design a stent to

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.720
[Guest]: be a T, right?

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.760
[Guest]: And even if it's a Y, you can have an acute angle, you can have an obtuse angle in there,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.760
[Guest]: right?

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.200
[Guest]: The question he asked was, what angle is most appropriate, you know, in order for the stent

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.520
[Guest]: not to have accumulation of plaque?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.560
[Guest]: Remember, our blood actually has platelets in it, right?

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.480
[Guest]: Red blood cells and white blood cells, it's not pure liquid, it's a sludge, right?

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.280
[Guest]: So the question here is that if you're putting in a stent, you want to design the stent with

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.400
[Guest]: a certain angle so that you don't cause plaque formation at the junction.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.800
[Guest]: So the question was, go think about designing, what would the angle be?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.280
[Guest]: Now, asking the question that way, I did not know how to answer because I was never taught

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.120
[Guest]: to think in those terms, right?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:43.720
[Guest]: Here I had to read the McCabe-Smith book, figure out what the equations were, go out

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.920
[Guest]: to the term and essentially sort of, you know, solve problems.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.800
[Guest]: The reason I say this is because I think one of the things education does, and I'm hoping

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.880
[Guest]: that it is happening here more now, education is not about regurgitating stuff, right?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.440
[Guest]: It's making you think about what is it that you want to do differently.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.360
[Guest]: That question, although I got an A- on it, I don't think I did a great job.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.660
[Guest]: I think that I did the best I possibly could.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.720
[Guest]: But that makes you think, right?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.000
[Guest]: There is no one solution for it.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.280
[Guest]: You can design a T-stent, you can design a Y-stent, you can design, I mean, they were

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.960
[Guest]: drug-inducing stents, meaning you coat them with drug and over a period of time they put

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.040
[Guest]: drug in the bloodstream.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.600
[Guest]: Open-ended questions are really important, because I don't think there's a solution to

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.760
[Guest]: every problem.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.400
[Guest]: If you go in and thinking that I'm going to solve this problem and find a solution today,

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.640
[Guest]: you'll be disappointed.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.920
[Guest]: I think that a lot of problems that we find in life, I don't, you know, half the problems

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.680
[Guest]: that I deal with don't even have a definition of a problem, forget about a solution, right?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.240
[Guest]: So open-ended solutions, open-ended problems are really important.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.920
[Guest]: And I just hope that our education system is beginning to teach some of these things.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.800
[Guest]: How do you deal with an uncertain world where data isn't available, where, you know, it's

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.640
[Guest]: not properly defined?

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.400
[Guest]: How do you think about that when you try and solve things of this nature?

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.400
[Guest]: Education is really important.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.960
[Guest]: So that, I mean, that's a seminal experience that I think about in terms of when, you know,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.040
[Guest]: when I went to UNH and got my master's there.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: That's the kind of experience that I had, which I still remember getting a zero on this.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: I was so disappointed.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.800
[Guest]: I was like, I thought I did it right.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.200
[Guest]: And then I found out that my decimal was off by 2.2 digits.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:28.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I did an episode with Anirban Mahapatra, who pointed to an identical experience as

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.760
[Amit Varma]: something seminal for him as well, where he mugs up everything here.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.400
[Amit Varma]: And then when he goes out there, he just does really badly in the first exam because he

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.640
[Amit Varma]: is not used to thinking like that.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.680
[Amit Varma]: And I have the title of your master's thesis in front of me, soluble and immobilized catalars.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.280
[Amit Varma]: I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Effect of pressure and inhibition on kinetics and deactivation.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720
[Amit Varma]: Was it fun?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Was it enjoyable?

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720
[Guest]: It was really fun.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.240
[Guest]: So this is the thing that you were looking at at that time, right?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.560
[Guest]: So again, my advisor, he was from India.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560
[Guest]: He was from Chennai.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.240
[Guest]: He just retired as the senior provost.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240
[Guest]: Excellent.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.780
[Guest]: I mean, Dr. Vasu was very, very good.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.360
[Guest]: The only thing I didn't like about him was that he used to hold his classes at 8.30 in

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360
[Guest]: the morning.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.280
[Guest]: I mean, New Hampshire, if you know anything about the geography, snows like crazy in winter.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.600
[Guest]: And so, you know, he insisted on all the students being in the class at 8.30.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.680
[Guest]: We had to get up at 7 o'clock, go to the dorm, eat your breakfast, and then get to class

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680
[Guest]: at 8.30.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.160
[Guest]: It was like minus 40 degrees outside.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.760
[Guest]: But yeah, so what I was doing there, and that was kind of interesting, and this is again

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.480
[Guest]: you know, science evolves, right?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.520
[Guest]: In those days, we were doing something completely different in the sense that at that time,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:49.080
[Guest]: you know, we were thinking about how do you sort of use enzymes as active catalysts to

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.560
[Guest]: try and increase the reaction.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.920
[Guest]: And one of the things that you're taught in chemical engineering is that one of the factors

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:00.040
[Guest]: that gives you higher rates of catalysis is surface area.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.560
[Guest]: So the larger the surface area, the better, you know, yield that you get from the reaction.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.440
[Guest]: And so what I was trying to do there was to take, you know, porous beads, like beads with

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.680
[Guest]: small pores in it, because the more porous it is, the larger surface area it is.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.700
[Guest]: You take an enzyme, which is a labile thing, enzymes are not very stable, you immobilize

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.840
[Guest]: it on that, and then use that in a reaction and see, does the reaction proceed better?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.000
[Guest]: You get a better yield.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.320
[Guest]: The issue there was not whether, you know, what we were doing would actually work.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.800
[Guest]: The issue was, think about, you know, how do you design experiments, how do you design?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.800
[Guest]: So my experimental reaction chamber was a PVC plastic pipe of two inch by two inch long,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.160
[Guest]: with two plastic flanges on both sides.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.400
[Guest]: And I had to build this.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.800
[Guest]: In the lab, I had to build this, I had to cut PVC to take, you know, plexiglass on both

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: sides, fix it, put flanges in it, essentially to be able to have your input and output on

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Guest]: it.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
[Guest]: And then, you know, high pressure, right?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.960
[Guest]: So you had to put, you know, high pressure in and see what really happens in that part.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.160
[Guest]: The notion there was that two things.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.880
[Guest]: One is that it taught me how to think about experimental design.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.960
[Guest]: How do you think about, you know, doing an experiment with a hypothesis and testing that

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.120
[Guest]: hypothesis and experiment and figuring out whether it works or not?

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.080
[Guest]: I mean, nine or 10 times it fails, you still have to go back and try it in a different

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080
[Guest]: way, right?

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.240
[Guest]: So that's experimental design point of view.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:31.040
[Guest]: Second thing it taught me was importance of data, recording what you're measuring in the

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.760
[Guest]: lab, right?

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.760
[Guest]: Every data point.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.920
[Guest]: So, you know, you just start the reaction, take measurements of one minute, two minutes,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.040
[Guest]: three minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes, and then plot that and see whether the yield

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.880
[Guest]: at the end of the reaction time, do you get a better yield or not?

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.840
[Guest]: The fidelity of doing that, basic science, right?

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.320
[Guest]: I mean, you go to a lab, you have a lab notebook, you think about your experiment, you write

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.560
[Guest]: down your hypotheses, think about how you design that experiment.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.200
[Guest]: You say, okay, if my experiment succeeds, this is what I'm going to get.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.680
[Guest]: If my experiment fails, this is what is going to happen.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.080
[Guest]: Happens all the time, right?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.560
[Guest]: But the training that school gives you, any school should give you, is this.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.100
[Guest]: It's not whether, you know, you're producing a Nobel Prize winning invention.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:22.120
[Guest]: It's about making you think about how do you think about doing science, which today, you

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.680
[Guest]: know, I'm sorry to say that we don't think about that anymore, right?

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.480
[Guest]: We think about science, again, in black and white terms.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.640
[Guest]: Science is not black and white.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.440
[Guest]: Nine out of ten times things fail, right?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.760
[Guest]: And then you find out one fine morning, you know, after a lot of sweat and blood that,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.040
[Guest]: you know, something actually works.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the lessons in this go beyond science in terms of the importance of process, importance

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.320
[Amit Varma]: of data, the importance of intellectual honesty, even, in just making sure the process and

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.560
[Amit Varma]: the data are right.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.160
[Amit Varma]: And even that importance of getting a little meta, thinking about how to think about something

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.880
[Amit Varma]: rather than kind of useful skills, which they don't quite teach in India.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.120
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, while you're in this very cold place, which Indian students famously

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.240
[Amit Varma]: sometimes have trouble with, how's the music going?

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.280
[Amit Varma]: Because you've been trained in Hindustani classical music, tell me a little bit about

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.280
[Amit Varma]: that side.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.800
[Guest]: So again, a lot of this came essentially, remember, you know, the environment at home

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.960
[Guest]: was this, you know, traditionalistic.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.680
[Guest]: So if you know anything about the tradition of the mystics, right, there is something

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680
[Guest]: called Shabad, right?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.520
[Guest]: So you sing, you sing, you know, that you recite, you know, the poems of the saints

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.160
[Guest]: and basically it's supposed to mean something to you, right?

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:45.600
[Guest]: So I ended up sort of listening at home, you know, singing along with my parents and understanding,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.320
[Guest]: you know, what was really happening.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.640
[Guest]: So it's just that that training, essentially, with a little bit of formal training in Hindustani

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.640
[Guest]: classical over a period of time, I'm not any, you know, some great singer or anything like

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640
[Guest]: that.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.760
[Guest]: It's just that the environment at home was that we used to sing Shabads, we used to sing,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.720
[Guest]: you know, the traditional Satsang kind of stuff that actually happens at home.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.840
[Guest]: That's how I picked up a lot of this stuff, right?

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.680
[Guest]: And then some training, a little bit.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.760
[Guest]: But the good thing in those days, I'll tell you what was good, Spik Mckay was very active

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.760
[Guest]: in those days.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.600
[Guest]: There were chapters of Spik Mckay pretty much in every U.S. universities.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.400
[Guest]: I saw, you know, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, like this close, like I was like right here and,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.800
[Guest]: you know, when he had come to Syracuse at that point in time, I was enrolled in a computer

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800
[Guest]: measuring program.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.600
[Guest]: I mean, what personality, I mean, you are in heaven, you know, when you hear him sing.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.640
[Guest]: I mean, there was just, Spik Mckay was very, very active.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.200
[Guest]: There's chapters of Spik Mckay pretty much in every university.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.040
[Guest]: We used to do concerts, we used to invite, you know, personalities from India to come

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.800
[Guest]: in and sing, play, it was a really good time, college days.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And you used to sing in bands also, the rumor goes.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960
[Guest]: Long time ago.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960
[Amit Varma]: It's been long.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.120
[Amit Varma]: At some point, the Pharma lobby is going to get hold of these old recordings and circulate

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120
[Guest]: This is a person.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120
[Unknown]: Exactly.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.720
[Amit Varma]: So, after this, you joined Bristol Myers Squibb, where you rise through the ranks very fast.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And also where you, you know, eventually your last post there, I think, is a director of

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Discovery Informatics.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.280
[Amit Varma]: But there, what you're doing is beyond chemical engineering in the sense that there's informatics

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.000
[Amit Varma]: there, obviously, as your job title goes.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.120
[Amit Varma]: There's also a little bit of robotics, like the way Catherine Iban describes you.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.960
[Amit Varma]: She says, quote, Thakur played a small but cutting edge role in the company's endeavors.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.920
[Amit Varma]: He ran a department that built robots, automated laboratory helpmates intended to make the

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.680
[Amit Varma]: work of drug testing more efficient and reliable.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.840
[Amit Varma]: Thakur's lab buzzed with innovation, more than a dozen scientists reported to him.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.320
[Amit Varma]: Pulleys, motors, bells and levers were scattered about, and bright-eyed college students cycled

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.440
[Amit Varma]: through pitching in as needed, stop quote.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And from there, the natural segue would be that I can totally see you kind of continue

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.760
[Amit Varma]: down what already was a cutting edge role.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Till today, you are sort of running an AI startup or whatever and doing all of that.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your role at BMS, what you kind of learned there, and you know,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.480
[Amit Varma]: what made you decide to kind of give that up and move along?

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.320
[Guest]: So, you know, so the training that I got as a part of the master's program was two things.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.920
[Guest]: One is think about how to conduct experiments.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.040
[Guest]: The second thing that I got – so there's a subject that is taught in chemical engineering

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.560
[Guest]: is called programmable logic controllers and process-oriented design, right?

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.320
[Guest]: So you're building, you know – I don't know if you ever passed by one of these big

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.280
[Guest]: distilleries or ONGC plants, right, I mean, you can see them, they're big plants that

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.360
[Guest]: actually have, you know, pipes going here and there, and they're doing this kind of

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360
[Guest]: stuff.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.080
[Guest]: When you sort of drill it down to basics, it's basically programmable logic controllers,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080
[Guest]: right?

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.080
[Guest]: So all you're saying is there's some switches, right?

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.520
[Guest]: So the way that you kind of drive something is you turn the switch on or off so that,

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.800
[Guest]: you know, you have a positive or negative, and then you have a pulley that basically

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.000
[Guest]: moves things around, right?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.440
[Guest]: So the reason this was important was for twofold, so I have to take a step back and explain

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.600
[Guest]: to you what was really happening in those days.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.280
[Guest]: And the reason this is important, because when we talk about India and India being a

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.600
[Guest]: pharmacy to the world, right, this is a phrase that is most commonly used right now, or pharmacy

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.280
[Guest]: to the developing world, right?

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:27.280
[Guest]: Even as of today, as a country that, you know, sort of has this prowess of, you know, manufacturing

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:33.200
[Guest]: drugs, there's been just one or two instances where we've actually discovered and developed

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.520
[Guest]: a drug that has gone to the market.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.520
[Guest]: We've never done that.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520
[Guest]: The reason is very simple.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.840
[Guest]: We'll come to that later on, why we haven't done that.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: But the way that this thing was done back then was that the process of drug development

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.880
[Guest]: basically is that, you know, you identify a target in the body, right?

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.420
[Guest]: So for example, if you have a receptor of some kind, or if you have a protein that you're

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.960
[Guest]: trying to target, right?

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.480
[Guest]: You're trying to either make it do more than what it is doing, or you're trying to stop

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.600
[Guest]: that from doing something, right?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.160
[Guest]: Those are the kind of things that you're trying to do to try and develop a drug.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.000
[Guest]: Now, the way discovery worked in those days, and it's evolved now a little bit with computer

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.160
[Guest]: aided design and artificial intelligence, is that what you used to do was you used to

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.720
[Guest]: take scaffolds of chemical structures, right?

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.000
[Guest]: And you throw that particular sort of target and see what sticks.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.320
[Guest]: Now, remember, these targets are large protein molecules.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.720
[Guest]: So these are very large molecules, they fold, right?

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.880
[Guest]: So this is not like a strict chemical structure.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.360
[Guest]: For example, a simple chemical structure you think about is benzene, right?

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.760
[Guest]: Benzene looks like rings, hexagonal rings.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.140
[Guest]: That's how benzene looks like.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.880
[Guest]: If you've got, you know, among your audience, you have people who are chemists, they'll

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.160
[Guest]: realize that you can have structures that become really, really complex.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.840
[Guest]: You can have hydrogen molecules, oxygen molecules, right, branching off of that, right?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:07.640
[Guest]: So you're trying to take a chemical molecule and you're trying to throw that at this target

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.360
[Guest]: to either block something or make it do something differently, right?

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.520
[Guest]: And the way we used to do that was called high throughput screening, meaning that you

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:23.960
[Guest]: take a thousand of these chemical structures, right, and in an experiment, you see if these

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.880
[Guest]: chemical structures bind to the protein at all.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.600
[Guest]: Now, out of the thousand, you may see one or two showing some activity, activity meaning

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.580
[Guest]: there is some – it is actually making it do what you want it to do, right?

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.800
[Guest]: Then you take that basic structure and then you modify it, right?

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.520
[Guest]: You add additional things around it and see if it makes a difference.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.080
[Guest]: Because remember, proteins essentially are like ribbons.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:53.200
[Guest]: So you take a long ribbon, you fold it, right, and there is this one site in that ribbon

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.040
[Guest]: that is the active site.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.840
[Guest]: So you're taking a small chemical molecule and you're trying to attach to that site to

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.160
[Guest]: make it do something, right?

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.840
[Guest]: So you're essentially now dealing with thousands and thousands of these experiments that you're

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840
[Guest]: doing.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.760
[Guest]: And it's very hard to make, you know, people do that.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.160
[Guest]: Because remember, you know, I mean, if you ask me to do the same thing 10 times, I'll

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.080
[Guest]: make a mistake on the ninth time because it's repetitious and it becomes really rote, right?

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.240
[Guest]: So the way that we thought about this was, why don't we automate it?

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.480
[Guest]: Why don't we essentially build, you know, these systems that actually do these things

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.560
[Guest]: at night during the day, you know, and then we can keep an eye on what was really happening.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.960
[Guest]: So my job was essentially to build this.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960
[Guest]: It was really fancy.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.360
[Guest]: I have a video, but basically, you know, it looked like, you know, if you've seen Ford

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.040
[Guest]: Motor Company's manufacturing or even Maruti's company, you have these big robots that look

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.480
[Guest]: like robots right now that pick up a piece of the car and put it on a manufacturing line,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480
[Guest]: right?

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.520
[Guest]: You take a door and you just stick it on.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.800
[Guest]: That's exactly what it looked like.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.200
[Guest]: We had robots, but the smaller ones, you know.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.760
[Guest]: So again, you know, it had pulleys and motors in them, and they used to move things around

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.240
[Guest]: from place to place to place.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.400
[Guest]: Now you see a lot more automation.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.480
[Guest]: I mean, the Amazon facility has all robots in it right now.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.480
[Guest]: In those days, that was a novelty.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.040
[Guest]: So my job as an engineer was to build those things for two reasons.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.760
[Guest]: One was because we needed to run thousands of experiments.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.200
[Guest]: It was not like you're doing one or two chemicals, right?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.140
[Guest]: You do thousands and thousands of these, number one.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.360
[Guest]: Number two is that the way that you read out this stuff, like, how do you know that something

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.960
[Guest]: actually attaches to the protein and does something?

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.980
[Guest]: There are one of two ways that you could do that.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.600
[Guest]: You could take a effervescent, you know, molecule that would light up, right?

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.800
[Guest]: So if it attaches to the protein and you take the rest of it out, you would read that because

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.640
[Guest]: that would generate light, you know, and the UV light will actually show up.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.360
[Guest]: Or you take a radioisotope, right?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.120
[Guest]: You take, you know, carbon-14 or one of these things, and you take a radioisotope and attach

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.320
[Guest]: it to it, and you use a Geiger counter to read it.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.680
[Guest]: Now, you don't want people to be exposed to radiation, right?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.020
[Guest]: I mean, if you were using a radioisotope in your assay, you don't want people essentially

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.040
[Guest]: to expose themselves to unnecessary radiation, right?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.240
[Guest]: So that's where robots become really important.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.960
[Guest]: So the job that I was assigned, based on my training, was to build these things.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.520
[Guest]: And this is what we used to do, essentially build, you know, systems that ran day and

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.520
[Guest]: night.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.520
[Guest]: They would just pick up.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.160
[Guest]: So think about it like a manufacturing line.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.760
[Guest]: It would know where to go get the compound from.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.880
[Guest]: It would know how to dilute it because you're not going to do the same concentration, right?

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.520
[Guest]: So think about if you go to a pathology lab, they take your blood sample, but then they

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.520
[Guest]: run the assay.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.240
[Guest]: It's not run the same concentration of that you actually take the blood, they would dilute

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.680
[Guest]: it down, spin it, take the white blood cells out, and then they would actually use that

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.040
[Guest]: to do a biological assay.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.400
[Guest]: So that's what I was tasked to do.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.760
[Guest]: And we ended up sort of building, you know, those kind of systems, you know, for the company

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.900
[Amit Varma]: at that time.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:02.160
[Amit Varma]: What I also found fascinating reading about your years at BMS was that you've spoken about

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.360
[Amit Varma]: this orientation program they put you through.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And there was such a stress of this orientation program on a particular set of values and

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.200
[Amit Varma]: how you were supposed to kind of approach your role just in the industry.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.840
[Guest]: So I mean, this is one of the things that these companies, they used to do, I hope they

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.120
[Guest]: still do it, right?

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.000
[Guest]: One of the things that they did was when you joined in as a fresh engineer or a fresh scientist,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: right?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.280
[Guest]: You used to get a sabbatical, kind of a rotation, basically.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.320
[Guest]: You would used to go spend a month in every department to try and understand what they

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.680
[Guest]: did so that you would at least get a sense of, look, you're not buttonholed into this

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.960
[Guest]: one job that you have, but you get a bigger picture.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.640
[Guest]: But the biggest thing that was drilled into you, into all the people who they hired was,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.280
[Guest]: why are you doing this, right?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.600
[Guest]: It's not about trying to punch a machine or a tablet, get the tablet out.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.240
[Guest]: It's not about designing a robot.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.920
[Guest]: At the end of that line, there's a patient.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.280
[Guest]: And you're doing this essentially to try and make a difference in the patient's life.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.280
[Guest]: That was the biggest thing that I think was really important, because what happens is

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.600
[Guest]: that when you graduate from college, right, you don't have that perspective.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.520
[Guest]: You're going in as a computer engineer to design software.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.720
[Guest]: You're going in as a mechanical engineer to be able to design some machines and systems.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.600
[Guest]: You're going in as a chemical engineer to design chemical reactions and figuring out

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.040
[Guest]: how to make, you know.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.800
[Guest]: What you don't see is that how all of this comes together in the end, and it impacts

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.480
[Guest]: somebody's life, right?

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:38.760
[Guest]: So bringing in people to be able to correlate to that, right, where you get to interact

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.800
[Guest]: with the patient who says, look, I'm taking this drug, and I've been diagnosed with a

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.960
[Guest]: melanoma, and I'm on your drug, and it's making my life better, that's a really powerful message

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.200
[Guest]: that goes to somebody to say, you're making a difference in somebody's life.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.240
[Guest]: I just don't know whether we do it often enough these days, right?

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.720
[Guest]: We're so focused on the bottom line that I don't know whether we do it in a way to try

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.520
[Guest]: and put context into young people that, yes, you're doing a job.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520
[Guest]: I understand that.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520
[Guest]: You're earning a living.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.280
[Guest]: You're really trying to make a difference.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.980
[Guest]: But there's a bigger picture out there.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.840
[Guest]: You really are trying to make a difference in somebody's life.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.120
[Guest]: That I think is really important, and BMS did that very, very well, you know, for people

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.600
[Guest]: like me who joined the ground level, you know, and worked our way up, so.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:30.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that kind of training also plays one part in explaining sort of this deeper cultural

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.320
[Amit Varma]: difference that seems to be there between, say, US pharma and Indian pharma.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And just the syncing of the end user, you know, applies to a lot else.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Like I think, like even in writing, like, you know, the very first lesson of my course

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:46.200
[Amit Varma]: essentially is that when we write too often, we think of writing as an act between us and

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.080
[Amit Varma]: our laptop, my or Mary laptop, that I have thoughts in my head, I put them down on paper

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.520
[Amit Varma]: or on the laptop, and it's done and you're not thinking of the reader.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Because your writing only becomes meaningful when it has an intended effect on the intended

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760
[Amit Varma]: reader.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.240
[Amit Varma]: And we don't often enough think of that.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And I think that this can then be extrapolated as a danger to any calling or any profession

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.200
[Amit Varma]: or vocation that you forget that end purpose, that you kind of get lost in the mechanics

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.880
[Amit Varma]: of whatever it is that you're doing at any point in time, and you kind of let that go.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:21.960
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about then how, you know, you rise up rapidly, as millennium begins,

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.040
[Amit Varma]: you are the director of informatics at this very well regarded company in the US.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.120
[Amit Varma]: And then you decide to come back.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.360
[Amit Varma]: So take me take me through that process.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.000
[Guest]: Basically, you know, it was again, serendipity, right?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.600
[Guest]: So, you know, an opportunity presented itself.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.120
[Guest]: So I was a, you know, I was working in informatics, and there's this gentleman who was a fairly

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.000
[Guest]: senior person, his name was Rashmi Waria.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.320
[Guest]: He was responsible for pharmaceutics.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.800
[Guest]: Now, what that means is basically, how do you design a drug so that your body can absorb

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800
[Guest]: it, right?

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.400
[Guest]: So think about it, we talked about how, you know, to find this one drug that works against

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.800
[Guest]: a target, right?

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.680
[Guest]: Let's assume that you find that, right, you find something that is novel, that, you know,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.340
[Guest]: works against a particular disease.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.680
[Guest]: That's not the end of the story, because you know, how do you actually get it to a patient

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.640
[Guest]: that patient will take it, right?

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.600
[Guest]: You have to figure out, look, if I, you know, you know, if I formulate that as a capsule,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.180
[Guest]: you know, will the patient take it?

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.480
[Guest]: If I make it a suspension, like a liquid formulation, will the patient take it?

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.600
[Guest]: Does it have to be an injectable, meaning that, you know, it has to be available immediately.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.840
[Guest]: Remember, if you eat something, it takes time for the chemical or the biological thing to

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.400
[Guest]: go into your stomach, get absorbed, and then become bioavailable, right?

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.360
[Guest]: If you want something immediately, like, for example, if somebody is suffering with a stroke,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.100
[Guest]: you can't give them a tablet.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.600
[Guest]: You want to inject a clot-busting drug right away, so the clot essentially sort of, you

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.440
[Guest]: know, vanishes, you know, at that point in time.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.000
[Guest]: So these things, how do you make the drug available, is the remit of what is called

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
[Guest]: pharmaceutics.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.420
[Guest]: And he was the head of that group at that point.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:05.680
[Guest]: He had accepted a role to join Ranbaxy as the head of their research and development.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.600
[Guest]: I did not know this.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.800
[Guest]: So one day, you know, the campus where I used to work, you know, there was a time where,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.880
[Guest]: you know, we used to walk around in the afternoon, after lunch, just kind of clear our head,

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880
[Guest]: talk with people.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.520
[Guest]: It was just a cultural thing there.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.560
[Guest]: So one day he asked me whether, you know, we would do that.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.960
[Guest]: And while we were walking around, you know, he told me that, look, you know, I'm leaving

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.280
[Guest]: EMS, and he was there for a long time, much longer than I was there.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.640
[Guest]: And he said, I'm going to go to India, I'm going to be heading this company, and I didn't

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.520
[Guest]: know what the company was.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.640
[Guest]: And he told me, look, you know, you've risen really, really fast in this organization,

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.120
[Guest]: but you're going to hit a glass ceiling here.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.640
[Guest]: You know, there's only so many vice presidents and directors in the company, right?

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.400
[Guest]: This is an opportunity for you to go back and do something very different.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.360
[Guest]: You know, the skills you have, I really need that skills along with me in my new role there.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.520
[Guest]: It's a good way for you to give back to the country as well, because this is not something

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.200
[Guest]: that the country has.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.120
[Guest]: I'm going to try and do something very different, you know, in this case.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.360
[Guest]: And the company has told me that I had a free hand in doing what I need to do.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.400
[Guest]: And why don't you come with me, right?

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.480
[Guest]: So that came out of the blue for me, because I had no idea that I would even be considering

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.000
[Guest]: something like that.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.080
[Guest]: But having thought about it, and, you know, I did my own research, but there was one time

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.120
[Guest]: that I'd come to visit my parents.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.360
[Guest]: I went and met, you know, people in New Delhi.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.280
[Guest]: In fact, the interesting Brar, who was the CEO of Ranbaxy at that time, he had come to

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.720
[Guest]: New York once.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.400
[Guest]: He was at the Hilton, you know, in the Grand Central, and he'd asked me to come meet with

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400
[Guest]: him.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.480
[Guest]: So I'd went and met with him there.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:44.480
[Guest]: So over a period of time, this courtship happened, and, you know, comfort developed.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.360
[Guest]: And you know, given the fact that this was a very unique opportunity, I decided that

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.360
[Guest]: I would come here, and helping Rashmi build what he wanted to build.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:59.640
[Guest]: He really wanted to turn Ranbaxy from a manufacturer of drugs to a company that actually researched

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640
[Guest]: and developed drugs.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.560
[Guest]: That was his vision in terms of what he wanted to do.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.720
[Guest]: That's the reason why he accepted this position to come here.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.280
[Guest]: And you know, he said, look, you know, I need people like you, because, you know, it's going

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.640
[Guest]: to be a, it's a big job, and I need people like.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.080
[Guest]: So he had another gentleman, his name is Qasim Mukhtiar, who was also a fairly senior person.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.240
[Guest]: He came along with him.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.560
[Guest]: I came along with him, Nimish came along with him.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.800
[Guest]: So it was a bunch of people essentially sort of, you know, came along, because we really

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:30.720
[Guest]: saw an opportunity to try and make a difference and rebuild this kind of raw prowess that

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.000
[Guest]: we saw within the Indian pharma.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.600
[Guest]: Because you know, Indian pharma was doing really, really well in those days, you know.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.280
[Guest]: From a price competition point of view, in the US, obviously, healthcare costs are really,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.480
[Guest]: really expensive, right?

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.920
[Guest]: So the Indian companies were making, you know, huge sort of, you know, dent into that market.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:56.440
[Guest]: And it was a very unique opportunity to say, can you steer the ship from just making stuff

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.200
[Guest]: to doing something innovative?

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.880
[Guest]: Could we do all of something new that the country's never done before, right?

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.440
[Guest]: That was a great attraction for somebody like me to come here.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.040
[Amit Varma]: So to contextualize that, I want to sort of examine a couple of parallel tracks that are

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:15.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of also developing during this time, and one, of course, is the whole funda of,

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, innovator companies, which will develop a medicine, say they'll have a patent

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.240
[Amit Varma]: on it that will last for, I think, 17 years.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.040
[Amit Varma]: And during that time, they charge whatever, they make their money back, and they make

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.160
[Amit Varma]: their profits.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And after that, you have generics coming in, where pretty much anybody who demonstrates

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.480
[Amit Varma]: that they can make it with a different process, can just get in there.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's a middle thing.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.360
[Amit Varma]: And for a lot of Indian companies, then they became good at sort of reverse engineering,

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.160
[Amit Varma]: that how is this made, figuring out a slight difference in the process and getting into

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.760
[Amit Varma]: that generics market where you're making cheap medicines and making your money that way.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:57.280
[Amit Varma]: And part of what you guys went there to do, as you said, Rashmi and you and all the others,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.600
[Amit Varma]: was take it up the value chain, where you're kind of innovating and developing your own

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600
[Amit Varma]: medicines.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.480
[Amit Varma]: The other sort of interesting parallel track I find here is what Yusuf Ameed did with a

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:12.800
[Amit Varma]: Zipla when they made the AIDS cocktail for Africa at less than $1 a day.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that and also the significant, what was really happening

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.360
[Amit Varma]: in that generics market which perverted those incentives?

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.820
[Guest]: So I think that's a story that needs to be told and told again.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:28.760
[Guest]: Because I don't think that we, as Indians, really understand what Mr. Ameed actually

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760
[Guest]: did.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:37.920
[Guest]: I think that it's a really powerful story to think about, because the drugs that were

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:45.080
[Guest]: developed to combat the AIDS epidemic, characteristically, this is what pharma does, they essentially

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.120
[Guest]: try and extract blood from a stone if they have a product.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:55.560
[Guest]: Even today, look at hepatitis C, the drug that is available to treat hepatitis C that

00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:01.160
[Guest]: Gilead makes, it's sold at $1,000 per pill.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:07.720
[Guest]: Now the argument that they make is it's essentially a quality of life, it's the value of what

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:13.200
[Guest]: we are adding to somebody's life who's suffering with a really bad infection, whether it's

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.340
[Guest]: hepatitis C or HIV.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.000
[Guest]: But let me just digress a little bit here for a second.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.320
[Guest]: This is really interesting, because given your background and your interest in economics,

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.100
[Guest]: so there are two pricing models.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:31.800
[Guest]: One pricing model that basically says, what value do I add to my consumer?

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.000
[Guest]: I charge that based on the value that I add.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.240
[Guest]: This is what most pharma companies do.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:43.240
[Guest]: They say that if I can keep you out of the hospital for X number of days, and hospitalization

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.680
[Guest]: costs X number of dollars per day, that is the value that I'm adding to you.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.840
[Guest]: By taking this pill, you don't have to go to the hospital.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.840
[Guest]: That's how you extrapolate and say, okay, my drug has to cost $30,000 a year.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840
[Guest]: It's unreal.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840
[Guest]: It's stupid.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.520
[Guest]: The other way we think about when it comes to genetics is this cost-plus model.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.460
[Guest]: What does it take you to make something, and there's a decent margin on top of that.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.520
[Guest]: That's a cost-plus model.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.520
[Guest]: This is really interesting.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.520
[Guest]: Think about this.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:19.120
[Guest]: When Pfizer developed vaccines, the mRNA vaccines right now, and Pfizer said, okay, you know

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.280
[Guest]: what, they were the first ones who got regulatory approval, emergency approval for a vaccine.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.160
[Guest]: How do you determine the value, the price of that particular vaccine?

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.080
[Guest]: The entire world is shut down.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.680
[Guest]: This is essentially, you have a product that has the ability to return the economy back

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680
[Guest]: to normal.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:43.240
[Guest]: Now, they charge the US, the Center for Medicare Services, I think paid between $26 and $30

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.980
[Guest]: per shot for Pfizer.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.900
[Guest]: How they arrived at it, I don't know.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.040
[Guest]: But you can take that argument to a ridiculous nature saying, look, because I'm going to

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.560
[Guest]: now enable the world's economy to come back, I can charge $1,000 for it, right, if you

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.520
[Guest]: follow the value-based model.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.920
[Guest]: You can't do that anymore.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.900
[Guest]: Nobody will be able to afford something like that.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:11.520
[Guest]: This notion about companies charging a lot of money, we will come back and revisit that

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520
[Guest]: a little bit.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:21.960
[Guest]: But what happened with Mr. Hamid and Dr. Hamid and Zipla was basically they broke that model

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:28.440
[Guest]: because there were companies in the United States who were charging an anomaly leg for

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.640
[Guest]: this therapy for very, very poor people.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.680
[Guest]: They didn't care whether this disease was endemic in Africa.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.840
[Guest]: They were still asking Africans to pay the same price that the United States would pay.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.600
[Guest]: There's no way that model works, right?

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.240
[Guest]: And so there were a couple of different people in the US activists who worked with Dr. Hamid

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.400
[Guest]: and they basically broke that model and basically said, look, we are going to reverse engineer

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.760
[Guest]: this thing.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:00.600
[Guest]: We are going to essentially give you a dollar a day cocktail while they were charging $300.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.520
[Guest]: And that essentially revolutionized people's lives.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.700
[Guest]: What happened in Thailand?

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.020
[Guest]: What happened here in Bombay?

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.520
[Guest]: What happened in Africa?

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.880
[Guest]: People all gave their life to what Dr. Hamid did.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:18.920
[Guest]: He basically broke that model of, you know, the pharma companies holding poor patients

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:24.240
[Guest]: hostage for the kind of money that they were looking for.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.000
[Guest]: And the reason that happened was because two things, right?

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.920
[Guest]: One was in the 70s, our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was basically provided this pathway

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.960
[Guest]: where she said, look, if you can figure out a different way of making the same product,

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.960
[Guest]: you have protection.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.960
[Guest]: Right?

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.120
[Guest]: So this is how we developed reverse engineering skills in the country.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.640
[Guest]: We began to sort of figure out how to make the same product but a different way, right?

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.720
[Guest]: That's how our genetic industry evolved.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.520
[Guest]: So we had those skills.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.240
[Guest]: So when the activists in the US, Bill Haddad, they came and talked to Dr. Hamid, they figured

00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:00.240
[Guest]: out that this is what they would do and they broke that model.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.320
[Guest]: So that was what was happening at that particular time.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320
[Guest]: That was one.

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.240
[Guest]: The second thing that was really happening at that time was this concept called a patent

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.760
[Guest]: cliff.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:16.600
[Guest]: So as you said, once you register a patent over a period of time where you have exclusivity,

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:21.400
[Guest]: essentially after that, multiple companies come in and the price drops.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:27.680
[Guest]: What was unique in that time period, the late 90s and early 2000s, right?

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.160
[Guest]: The number of blockbuster drugs that went off patent, I've never seen that many drugs

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.720
[Guest]: actually go off patent any time after that.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:39.720
[Guest]: That was a period of seven to eight years where drugs like Lipitor, right?

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:44.520
[Guest]: Drugs like, you know, all the statin drugs, which is essentially billion dollar drugs

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.240
[Guest]: at that point in time, they were all going off patent.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:53.200
[Guest]: So it was a great opportunity for the Indian pharma industry, which had this promise to

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest]: be able to think about how to remake this particular sort of chemicals in a different

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.640
[Guest]: way.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:04.280
[Guest]: There was a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to be able to do that.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:10.720
[Guest]: So those two things came together, became sort of a harmonization of those two things,

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:16.240
[Guest]: which essentially provided a Philip to the industry to sort of dream big and say, look,

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:21.000
[Guest]: we can reverse engineer and manufacture, but even these guys realized, look, this is not

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.360
[Guest]: going to last forever, right?

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.680
[Guest]: Once the patent cliff vanishes, you're going to be back to essentially doing the same thing

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.680
[Guest]: over again.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.480
[Guest]: So we have to invest in doing something different.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.480
[Guest]: We have to innovate.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.360
[Guest]: We have to be able to, you know, get our own products, because you see, if you have an

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.200
[Guest]: innovative product, you command a premium.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.120
[Guest]: You can charge a lot more money doing that.

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.440
[Guest]: So that was the context at that point.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's also fascinating to me how, you know, it's easy to sort of paint everyone

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.160
[Amit Varma]: with the same brush and say, oh, this is a culture in India, you know, the kind of thing

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.560
[Amit Varma]: that Ranbaxy did.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:55.880
[Amit Varma]: But if you kind of look at Yusuf Amir and CIPLA and the kind of values that they believed

00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.760
[Amit Varma]: in, the importance in processes and quality and all of that, it's just off the charts.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you have some of the newer companies like Ranbaxy, where everything

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.920
[Amit Varma]: was bottom line, where you went in and there were, you know, you had posters in the walls

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:15.080
[Amit Varma]: pushing you towards getting a higher profit percentage of, you know, reaching, say, 1

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.560
[Amit Varma]: billion in the US when they were 100 million at the time, I think, or reaching a total

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.520
[Amit Varma]: of 5 billion, whatever, sort of 1 billion at the time.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And another sort of interesting nuance to the way that companies were allowed to make

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.360
[Amit Varma]: generics was that, you know, when you applied for the permission to make a generic medicine,

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:37.040
[Amit Varma]: there was an added incentive for whoever was the first to get approved, because that company

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.880
[Amit Varma]: would get six months of a clear run to be able to make the generic when they could make

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.640
[Amit Varma]: a lot of money.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And then after six months, everybody else kind of comes in.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And Iban's book describes, like, it's like, you know, wars in the streets where you have

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.560
[Amit Varma]: the parking lots of the FDA, and people from different generic companies are camping out

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.400
[Amit Varma]: there and different groups, because when the door opens in the morning, they want to be

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.620
[Amit Varma]: first with their application, and all of that.

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.280
[Amit Varma]: And this also meant cutting corners.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Because you have this era of the patent cliff, you have a limited number of drugs which are

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:14.200
[Amit Varma]: going off patent, and you got to be first and whether you're ready with the science

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.200
[Amit Varma]: or not.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:24.200
[Guest]: Yeah, so this was an unfortunate outcome of this US law, right, the Vatch Haxman Act,

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.600
[Guest]: that created this nonsense.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.760
[Guest]: This was a compromise that was reached with the big pharma, right?

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.320
[Guest]: Remember, initially, when the generics came around, big pharma basically tried to malign

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.880
[Guest]: them and saying, okay, these are not good quality drugs, they don't know what you're

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880
[Guest]: doing.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.280
[Guest]: And obviously, you know, activists pushed and pushed and pushed, right?

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.440
[Guest]: So the compromise was that, look, they'll try and get another little bit out of it.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.640
[Guest]: And the six months was essentially to say, we are going to license our technology to

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.360
[Guest]: some other company that will give us six more months to try and milk this market as much

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.760
[Guest]: as we possibly can.

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.320
[Guest]: That was the genesis of the six-month exclusivity.

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:04.880
[Guest]: But you never have a full appreciation of the incentives at the time that you give incentives,

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.880
[Guest]: right?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.680
[Guest]: How they play out in the market is something that you get a sense of it later on.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.040
[Guest]: And this was an incentive that was well-intentioned.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:20.360
[Guest]: Unfortunately, it was completely sort of, you know, taken upside down.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.400
[Guest]: And it became, you know, a reason for companies to cut corners and then try and figure out

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.280
[Guest]: what they need to do.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.200
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk about your time at Rinbux, you know, so you kind of get out there.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.680
[Guest]: And Rashmi doesn't last very long.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.200
[Guest]: No, so he doesn't.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.560
[Guest]: I think what happened was that he had developed a difference of opinion with the family.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.560
[Guest]: So there's a power struggle happening in those days, because, you know, see, DS Broward,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.120
[Guest]: who was the chairperson and the CEO of the company, right?

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.640
[Guest]: So there were the family waiting in the wings, right?

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.520
[Guest]: And it was as if he was warming the chair for the, you know, CEO of the family to take

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.960
[Guest]: over.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.360
[Guest]: And obviously, there was power politics going on in there.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.520
[Guest]: And then between all of that, you know, Rashmi's equation with the company kind of deteriorated

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.760
[Guest]: a little bit, and he decided to leave and start his own.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:12.280
[Guest]: So I think after me, within a year of me joining, a little over a year of me joining, he decided

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280
[Amit Varma]: to leave.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: At one point, you know, he apparently said to you, you'll never believe the kind of shenanigans

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.440
[Amit Varma]: that are going on.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440
[Amit Varma]: But he didn't elaborate.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, did you have a sense that something is dodgy here?

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600
[Guest]: Something is not right?

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.440
[Guest]: Yeah, so I never thought that there was an issue with the quality of stuff that was going

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440
[Guest]: on.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.600
[Guest]: I mean, you know, scuttlebutt was that Rashmi wasn't getting along, wasn't getting along

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.200
[Guest]: with the family, with Malvinder, and in the meetings, we could see, right, body language,

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.440
[Guest]: you could see in a meeting sitting across the table, because Malvinder was at that point

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.760
[Guest]: in time, head of India business.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.880
[Guest]: So he was running the India business at that point in time.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.160
[Guest]: So I would see him in meetings, and you could see the body language.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.000
[Guest]: They're not like, you know, not like colleagues and colloquial kind of stuff.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.120
[Guest]: So my suspicion was that there's something going on personally between them, not so much

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the product that they were making.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.160
[Amit Varma]: One interesting side note that I kind of realized from Iban's book was that when Rashmi left,

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.920
[Amit Varma]: he actually got, you know, a big settlement when he left, which can also be interpreted.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And I think, you know, Iban implies that it was sort of just a silent about whatever you

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240
[Amit Varma]: might have seen.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.720
[Guest]: I, you know, unfortunately, I've never gotten a straight answer what that was for.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.360
[Guest]: All I know is that, you know, yes, there was a big settlement.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.520
[Guest]: You can read it to say, well, you know, just go away and keep your mouth shut.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.720
[Guest]: Or, you know, this was something that was negotiated right off.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720
[Guest]: I just don't know.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.440
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't get anything, you know, I was just I walked away with whatever was due

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.440
[Guest]: to me.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.440
[Amit Varma]: That was it.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.440
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440
[Amit Varma]: And ditto Rajendra Kumar.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.320
[Guest]: When you talk about, you know, unsung heroes, right, Dr. Hameed, Dr. Kumar is another one

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320
[Guest]: of those.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's very few people that you run into who really have the courage of their

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.760
[Guest]: conviction to say, look, I am who I am.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.240
[Guest]: I'm not going to be a part of the shenanigans.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.840
[Guest]: I mean, the guy was a head of, you know, the CNS clinical research at GSK.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.680
[Guest]: Like, I mean, he was among the four top four or five people in GlaxoSmithKline R&D.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.800
[Guest]: Gives up that position, comes to India.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.120
[Guest]: On principle, he says, I'm a medical doctor.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.160
[Guest]: I know what is happening here.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.920
[Guest]: I'm not going to be a part of it.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920
[Guest]: You want me to fix it?

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.120
[Guest]: I know how to fix it.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.240
[Guest]: Give me the resources to try and put these things right.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.640
[Guest]: And if you don't, I'm going to walk away from it.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.240
[Amit Varma]: He walked away.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's zoom into the story and stretch it out a bit.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.880
[Amit Varma]: He's your new boss.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.560
[Amit Varma]: You instantly take a liking to him and, you know, medical doctor, great values, obviously

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.720
[Amit Varma]: incredibly competent at his work.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.200
[Amit Varma]: He goes to South Africa and he comes back and he's shaken, you know, take the story

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200
[Amit Varma]: forward from there.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.760
[Guest]: See, this is what had happened, right?

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.760
[Guest]: So there was a French inspector named Olivier Lableyre, right?

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760
[Guest]: He's still there.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.600
[Guest]: He's still working for the French regulatory agency.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.640
[Guest]: Good friend of mine, good friend.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.400
[Guest]: He was a part of a WHO group, right?

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.240
[Guest]: Now let me explain a little bit about how it works.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.560
[Guest]: So what happens is the WHO is a World Health Body, right?

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:15.140
[Guest]: Not every country has their own regulatory structure, right, to evaluate the quality

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.140
[Guest]: of medicines, right?

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:20.680
[Guest]: There's a lot of countries in Africa that they don't have that capability.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.360
[Guest]: Nigeria does today, right?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.560
[Guest]: They have done a really good job.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.640
[Guest]: Tanzania does, Congo does.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.080
[Guest]: But there are several different countries that don't have the capability, right?

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.440
[Guest]: What they do is they rely on the World Health Body to say, do you think that we can buy

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.280
[Guest]: these medicines, right?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.600
[Guest]: So the way the WHO thinks about this is they develop, you know, a framework to say these

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.400
[Guest]: are pre-qualified manufacturers.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.880
[Guest]: So we have done our due diligence on them.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.520
[Guest]: We believe that they know what they're doing.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.400
[Guest]: We can vouch for the quality of what they are producing, right?

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.280
[Guest]: And they put that list out.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.120
[Guest]: And these countries that don't have the regulatory capacity then look at that list and say, okay,

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.920
[Guest]: we know what WHO has said this.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.360
[Guest]: We can trust their assessment, so we'll go ahead and buy it from this particular manufacturer.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.280
[Guest]: That is how the process is supposed to work.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.560
[Guest]: Now as a part of that assessment, the WHO relies on doing inspections, right?

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.560
[Guest]: They go out there and obviously check before they can approve some manufacturer out there.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.760
[Guest]: WHO doesn't have regulatory capacity, right?

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.400
[Guest]: So it pulls in from countries' regulatory capacities, wherever countries have good regulatory

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400
[Guest]: capacity.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.840
[Guest]: They'll say, can you lend us your inspectors, right?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.160
[Guest]: We'll come in and do this.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.360
[Guest]: So the gentleman who was leading that effort at the World Health Organization was a gentleman

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
[Guest]: named Andre Wanziel.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.800
[Guest]: He was a medical doctor, and he pulled in regulators from different countries.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.760
[Guest]: And this was a German-French regulator, Olivier.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.680
[Guest]: He came in to basically inspect Ranbaxy's portfolio.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.960
[Guest]: Because remember, at that time, what was happening was Bush was elected.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.320
[Guest]: AIDS was rampaging through the world at that time.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:10.080
[Guest]: In public pressure, they established the president's emergency relief for Africa and Southeast

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.940
[Guest]: Asia.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:16.200
[Guest]: Part of that thing was that the Clinton Foundation, they basically said, look, we are going to

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:21.560
[Guest]: work with these companies in India who certainly know how to make these drugs.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.720
[Guest]: We will negotiate a really good price for you because we'll combine all the volumes

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.900
[Guest]: from across the African countries.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:33.380
[Guest]: We will combine the volumes, we will negotiate a really good deal, and we will help you get

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.200
[Guest]: you really good quality AIDS drugs that are manufactured in India.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:44.840
[Guest]: As a part of that process, the WHO was evaluating Ranbaxy's portfolio of lamivudine, stavidine,

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.840
[Guest]: ziduvidine.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.120
[Guest]: These are the antiretroviral drugs that are essentially used to treat HIV.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.640
[Guest]: So they stop replication of the virus.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.320
[Guest]: The way things work is that pharma companies, what they do is that they usually work with

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.640
[Guest]: outside contracting companies who run clinical units.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.000
[Guest]: So Ranbaxy had its own clinical unit as well.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.240
[Guest]: In Delhi, there's a hospital called the Majidia Hospital.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.760
[Guest]: This is where Ranbaxy did their internal work.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.160
[Guest]: But usually the number of molecules you're developing is much larger than the capacity

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.220
[Guest]: of your internal unit actually can do, so you outsource it.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:24.760
[Guest]: So they've given it to this company called Vimta Laboratories in Hyderabad.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.360
[Guest]: So Olivier goes there, he does the inspection, and he finds out that these guys are fudging

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360
[Guest]: data.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.360
[Guest]: So they're saying essentially that we've enrolled 20 patients, he can only find one ECG.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.560
[Guest]: And he says, this is nonsense.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.660
[Guest]: So he goes back, makes a report, and that report goes to the South African regulator.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.520
[Guest]: Because remember, South Africa is going to buy, they're going to look at these reports,

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520
[Guest]: right?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520
[Guest]: How are they going to buy?

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.080
[Guest]: Because WHO puts out this report, the buying agency is going to look at that report and

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.020
[Guest]: say, they call up Ranbaxy and say, what the heck is happening here?

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.600
[Guest]: You guys are outsourcing your work to third-party company and they're fudging data, right?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.800
[Guest]: So Brian, who was CEO at that point in time, and Raj was like, I think, maybe not even

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.560
[Guest]: a month, maybe three weeks into his job.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.480
[Guest]: He calls Raj and says, look, I need you to go to South Africa.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.980
[Guest]: I need you to go to Johannesburg and sit down and tell them that we'll fix it.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:22.960
[Guest]: Whatever the problem is, we'll make sure that all of these things will be straightened out.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.240
[Guest]: And the reason he did that, because he was counting on Raj's essentially standing as

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240
[Guest]: a doctor, right?

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.280
[Guest]: Brian would never be able to make that kind of a case.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.560
[Guest]: You're getting a qualified medical doctor with that kind of standing to vouch for the

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.560
[Guest]: company.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.720
[Guest]: So Raj goes there to Johannesburg, along with another gentleman who is responsible for outsourcing.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.000
[Guest]: So this guy's job was to get the work done from all of these other contract companies.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
[Guest]: He has his meeting, he tells them, look, don't worry about it.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.840
[Guest]: You know me, I can fix these things, don't worry about it.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.520
[Guest]: On the way back, he's told on the flight that, you know, you're new here.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.960
[Guest]: You don't know the whole story, but this is not a unique situation that you're dealing

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
[Guest]: with.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960
[Guest]: You'll have to deal with this.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960
[Guest]: You know, other instances.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.560
[Guest]: He's like, what the heck are you talking about, right?

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.280
[Guest]: I thought this was like a one-off thing that, you know, something happened with the bad

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280
[Guest]: contractor.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.280
[Guest]: We're trying to fix this thing.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.160
[Guest]: Now, you're telling me that there's more to it?

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.680
[Guest]: He says, what?

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680
[Guest]: Tell me more.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.120
[Guest]: And he said, I don't know.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120
[Guest]: You'd have to figure it out.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.280
[Guest]: He wasn't kind of in a non-committal at that point.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.480
[Guest]: I won't give him the real story.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.560
[Guest]: So when he got back, he called me, and my job was portfolio management at the point.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.800
[Guest]: So he called me back and basically said, look, I really need to know to get to the bottom

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.920
[Guest]: of this, because I'm being told, when Brian told me it was a one-off thing, he said, just

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.480
[Guest]: go and talk to them and make sure that things will be sorted out.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.680
[Guest]: Now I'm being told that this is not unique to just South Africa, there's a bigger issue

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680
[Guest]: here.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.640
[Guest]: I really need to know what that is, and that is how this entire thing got started.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:57.160
[Amit Varma]: Take me through the next step, because at this stage, the assumption is that, OK, something

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.360
[Amit Varma]: went wrong with the contractor and whatever, and there might be other issues, but they're

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.360
[Amit Varma]: minor issues.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.360
[Amit Varma]: They are kind of fixable.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.200
[Amit Varma]: There is no sense that there is a problem with the edifice itself, that everything is

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:15.320
[Amit Varma]: shaken, that most of the data might just not be falsified, that it's all just a kind of

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
[Amit Varma]: a pack of cards.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So what he asks you and your team to do is, therefore, to look at every different market,

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.120
[Amit Varma]: what medicines are going there, what is the data, and go back to the source of the data

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.880
[Amit Varma]: and see that it matches.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about how you now approach this problem, like you're sitting with your team,

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.040
[Amit Varma]: what's going on there?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040
[Amit Varma]: What are you telling them?

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.400
[Amit Varma]: How big is the problem for you, just in terms of getting to the next stage of this investigation?

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.480
[Guest]: So thankfully, at that point in time, I'd only hired a group of five people.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.640
[Guest]: And they were responsible for each of these portfolios, so the company's portfolio was

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.280
[Guest]: essentially divided into regions.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.040
[Guest]: They called it regions for whatever reason.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.480
[Guest]: India was region one.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480
[Guest]: Europe was region two.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.920
[Guest]: So all the countries in Europe are region two.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:03.480
[Guest]: Region three was Latin America, so Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and region four was United

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.800
[Guest]: States and Canada.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.800
[Guest]: So I had one person for each of those.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.160
[Guest]: So Vivek was for region three, which was Latin America.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.640
[Guest]: Prakash was looking at the US portfolio.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.520
[Guest]: Karna was looking at Europe.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.720
[Guest]: So four people.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.080
[Guest]: And then I had two other people.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.160
[Guest]: One was looking at the medicines for malaria ventures, because we were developing a novel

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.360
[Guest]: molecule there.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.720
[Guest]: So we were doing this at that point.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.880
[Guest]: And thankfully, I had a few hands to help me.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.760
[Guest]: Now, to answer the question that you're asking, how did I go about doing that?

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.960
[Guest]: In order to answer that question, I have to first explain to you how a generic drug is

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.960
[Guest]: developed.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.200
[Guest]: So there are essentially four pieces to this.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.320
[Guest]: So the first thing is that, remember, you're not innovating anything.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.160
[Guest]: You know there is a product out there that works.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.640
[Guest]: What we are trying to do is to figure out how to make it in a way that still produces

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.640
[Guest]: the same therapeutic benefit.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.920
[Guest]: That is the question that we are trying to solve.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.200
[Guest]: So the first thing that you need to do is to be able to figure out what is the formulation.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.920
[Guest]: What I mean by formulation is, how do you deliver it to the patient?

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.640
[Guest]: Do you make a tablet out of it?

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.280
[Guest]: Do you make a capsule out of it?

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.080
[Guest]: Do you make an injectable out of it?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.120
[Guest]: Do you make a liquid solution out of it?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.680
[Guest]: That's number one.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.480
[Guest]: Once you develop that in the lab, the next thing is, I can make it in a lab, like I can

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.680
[Guest]: make 5 milligrams of it or 10 milligrams of it.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.320
[Guest]: How do I get it to scale?

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.680
[Guest]: How do I make 100 kilograms of this thing?

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.880
[Guest]: There is some science behind that.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.520
[Guest]: So what works in lab will not work in a much higher scale facility.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.560
[Guest]: So just like you can cook rajma for two people.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.760
[Guest]: You can figure it out what the recipe is.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.640
[Guest]: You have a party of 15 people.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.680
[Guest]: You better be very careful with the recipe, otherwise, you really have to control all

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680
[Guest]: of those things.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.600
[Guest]: So scaling that process is also really, really important.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.760
[Guest]: Once you do that, then the third thing is, you then take it to the clinic.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:08.880
[Guest]: You're trying to test whether your formulation, the one that you made, does it mimic in the

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.520
[Guest]: body of a patient the way that the innovator's formulation does.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.400
[Guest]: So if I'm trying to make a copy of Lipitor, which is autoverstatin, which is the drug

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:24.000
[Guest]: that is used right now, it's a best-selling drug for hypertension, blood pressure.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
[Guest]: So if a patient takes Pfizer's autoverstatin, and this is how it behaves in the body, my

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.720
[Guest]: drug, my formulation has to behave kind of similar way, right?

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.800
[Guest]: Regulations say plus or minus 20%.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.880
[Guest]: You have to be within that range of – there are two things that we measure in there.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.600
[Guest]: One is how much drug is available and how fast does it excrete.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.960
[Guest]: Now remember what happens when you take medicine, right?

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.320
[Guest]: Think about, for example, if you drink, I don't know whether you do or not, but if

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.200
[Guest]: you drink, you take one drink, you may not get a buzz.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.040
[Guest]: You take a second drink, slowly you start getting, you know, to get a buzz.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.880
[Guest]: Or maybe this is a better example, Holi, right?

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.280
[Guest]: Everybody has bhaan.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:12.920
[Guest]: You can get a lassi or you can get, you know, matai and there is opium in it, right?

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.460
[Guest]: You take one bite, you don't feel anything.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.140
[Guest]: You take a second bite, you kind of start feeling a little buzzy.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.800
[Guest]: You take that one complete ladoo, then you start laughing, right?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.160
[Guest]: Because you know, the concentration of that particular rupioid within your body essentially

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.840
[Guest]: gets to a point where it is really high at that point.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.720
[Guest]: Now, the second thing that actually happens is that the body then excretes that out, right?

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:43.200
[Guest]: So either through urine you get it out, you know, through sweat you can get it out, right?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.920
[Guest]: So again, if you over drink, what happens?

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920
[Guest]: Start throwing up, right?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.520
[Guest]: The body says, I can't handle it and just kind of vomits it out, right?

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.400
[Guest]: So these are, you know, processes that essentially sort of get the drug from our body.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.560
[Guest]: So when you are testing this drug in the clinic, right, you're essentially trying to see what

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.840
[Guest]: is the highest concentration of that, you know, particular formulation, do you get to

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.600
[Guest]: that point, right?

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.440
[Guest]: And how fast does the body actually get it out of your system?

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.360
[Guest]: The reason why you need to do this is because doctors need to know when they write the prescription,

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.760
[Guest]: is it one pill a day, or do you have to take two times a day, or do you have to take once

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.080
[Guest]: after morning, after breakfast, after lunch, and after dinner?

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.080
[Guest]: How do you know that?

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.820
[Guest]: You know that because you've done these experiments to figure out your body takes eight hours

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.960
[Guest]: to get this drug out of your system, your body takes four hours to get it.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.880
[Guest]: That's how you figure out whether you take it once a day, twice a day, three times a

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880
[Guest]: day, right?

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.680
[Guest]: So you test it in the clinic.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.960
[Guest]: The final part of this is you put it all together.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:49.400
[Guest]: What you do is you put together a file and you say, this is how I made it in the lab,

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.480
[Guest]: this is how I scaled it up, this is how I tested it in the clinic.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.560
[Guest]: And then, you know, I put it all together and say, okay, now I'm going to send it to

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.600
[Guest]: a regulator to say, this is what I need to do.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.000
[Guest]: Now, in order for me to map out this entire process, I have to ask each of these guys

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.760
[Guest]: basically say, for each of these areas, look at the steps that are required, right?

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:17.920
[Guest]: So when you are scaling it up, how do you go from making, you know, five gram quantities

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.560
[Guest]: in the lab to 100 kilogram quantities, right?

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.120
[Guest]: How do you scale that up?

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.560
[Guest]: What are the processes involved in doing that?

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.600
[Guest]: Who did that?

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.400
[Guest]: Is there a lab notebook there?

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.960
[Guest]: Did somebody record that particular experiment that was done, right?

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.240
[Guest]: So we came up with a matrix of all of these activities for each drug.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.840
[Guest]: And they were asked essentially to go and figure out where that data existed or not.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.840
[Guest]: And this took forever because, you know, there were hurdles in every step of the way.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.960
[Guest]: People wouldn't let them come into the labs.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.800
[Guest]: People wouldn't give them information.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.680
[Guest]: But over a period of time, we managed to develop a reasonably good idea of where the holes

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.680
[Amit Varma]: were.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.800
[Amit Varma]: I just want to read out this little bit from the book which summarizes what you found where

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Catherine Iban writes, quote, at the behest of managers, the company's scientists substituted

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.120
[Amit Varma]: lower purity ingredients for higher ones to reduce costs.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.480
[Amit Varma]: They altered test parameters so that formulations with higher impurities could be approved.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.600
[Amit Varma]: They faked the solution studies to generate optimal results.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.240
[Amit Varma]: They crushed up brand name drugs into capsules so that they could be tested in lieu of the

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.640
[Amit Varma]: company's own drugs.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.600
[Amit Varma]: They superimposed brand name test results onto their own in applications.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.400
[Amit Varma]: For some markets, the company fraudulently mixed and matched data streams, taking its

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.600
[Amit Varma]: best data from manufacturing in one market and presenting it to regulators elsewhere

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.880
[Amit Varma]: as data unique to the drugs in their market.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.480
[Amit Varma]: For other markets, the company simply invented data.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Document forgery was pervasive.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:51.480
[Amit Varma]: The company even forged its own standard operating procedures, which FDA investigators rely on

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.480
[Amit Varma]: to assess whether a company is following its own policies.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.000
[Amit Varma]: In one instance, the employees backdated documents and then artificially aged them in a steamy

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.200
[Amit Varma]: room overnight in an attempt to fool regulators during inspections, stop quote.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And you've also spoken elsewhere about how the steam rooms were a part of the system

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.280
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, you know, the FDA and other regulators have their systems in place that

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.340
[Amit Varma]: these are the processes by which drugs should be made and these are the processes by which

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.780
[Amit Varma]: we evaluate them.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And Ranbaxy has a system within a system and the whole point of the system within a system

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.140
[Amit Varma]: is to subvert the other system.

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:32.880
[Amit Varma]: So you actually have a steam room where the only purpose is to forge documents and to

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.560
[Amit Varma]: make them look old.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And there's another, I think, the gentleman in regulatory affairs who told you that, you

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.180
[Amit Varma]: told him that, okay, the data doesn't match the dossiers, what's going on here, how much

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.560
[Amit Varma]: of the data is forged?

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
[Guest]: What did he tell you?

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560
[Guest]: Well, it varied.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.160
[Guest]: I mean, I think in the stringent regulatory markets, like Europe and US, almost half of

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160
[Guest]: it was.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.960
[Guest]: And then I asked him, what do we do in India?

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.880
[Guest]: And he laughed at me and basically said, who looks for data in India?

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.880
[Amit Varma]: 100%?

01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880
[Amit Varma]: 100%.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.480
[Amit Varma]: I just want to sit back and if you're listening to this, you should also sit back.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.160
[Amit Varma]: This impacts real people.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.960
[Amit Varma]: This means that if all the data that is coming to you, if you're in India or half the data

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.680
[Amit Varma]: in the US, if you're taking a generic made in India is forged at that point in time,

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.640
[Amit Varma]: the people making the medicine didn't give a shit about whether it works or not.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And lives are at stake here.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is just bizarre.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.240
[Amit Varma]: You can have any kind of medical condition and the medicine, the so called medicine can

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.640
[Amit Varma]: actually make it worse, because it's manufactured in this crazy manner where all the data is

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640
[Guest]: forged.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.000
[Guest]: Unfortunately, that's the truth.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.480
[Guest]: And you know, the sad part about this, Amit, is that after this book came out, right after

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:47.800
[Guest]: this entire episode where the company pled guilty, paid fines, the biggest beneficiaries

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.000
[Guest]: of this are the patients in the United States and Europe.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
[Guest]: Because the FDA got smart.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.800
[Guest]: It started enforcing the regulations much more stringently.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.120
[Guest]: It knows what to look.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.080
[Guest]: Nothing's changed for us.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080
[Guest]: Nothing.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.720
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's get back to that story.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things we uncovered was that data in entire markets was completely

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:17.160
[Amit Varma]: invented, like Brazil, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Egypt, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Peru, Dominican

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Republic.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.080
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you know, this lady called Kathy Spree joined the US office of Ranbaxy.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:27.720
[Amit Varma]: And at first, she was really impressed by the results of the generic versions of Rionet

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.040
[Amit Varma]: and Sorted because she said, wow, Ranbaxy's data is so good, you could actually superimpose

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.240
[Amit Varma]: it on the data of the originals.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And the truth was that the data had been taken from there.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.360
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, and this really just struck me so hard, at one point where she was on

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.920
[Amit Varma]: a conference call with company executives from India, she spoke about, you know, that

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.840
[Amit Varma]: the AIDS medicine that Ranbaxy is supplying to Africa, it probably doesn't work.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.040
[Amit Varma]: And one of the company's top executives said, quote, who cares, it's just blacks dying,

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.040
[Guest]: stop quote.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, unfortunately, that's true.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Just reading about this stuff just gives me goosebumps, right?

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's just completely shocking to me.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.680
[Amit Varma]: You're getting this shit in real time.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.560
[Guest]: Yes, unfortunately, it's true.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.640
[Guest]: You know, I mean, sometimes what happens is that in the middle of something, right?

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.440
[Guest]: And there's so much happening around you, you don't get a chance to sort of internalize

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.760
[Guest]: and think about this thing in the way that you ought to, right?

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:26.800
[Guest]: The benefit of hindsight, you know, that quote about, you know, just the blacks dying, it's

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.800
[Guest]: so offensive.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.040
[Guest]: It is so offensive.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.880
[Guest]: And the interesting thing is that Cathy says that not one person on the call objected to

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880
[Guest]: it.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.520
[Amit Varma]: It just blows my mind.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.600
[Amit Varma]: So what's happening there?

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.280
[Amit Varma]: You've gathered this data, this data is incredible.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.600
[Amit Varma]: It is incredible to the point of being unbelievable that here is a company with more than a billion

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.640
[Amit Varma]: dollars in sales, more than 100 million of that from the US.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.520
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if these are 2001 figures, or these were the figures at the time.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.640
[Amit Varma]: But obviously, with ambitions of getting much bigger, you know, Bill Clinton has come and

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.960
[Amit Varma]: he's partied with Malvinder and Shivender and all of that.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've got this data where everything is based on lies.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.820
[Amit Varma]: So one, what's going through?

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.880
[Amit Varma]: What are you and your team thinking?

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And two, what happens next?

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.600
[Guest]: So you know, we used to sort of as a team, we used to meet once a week, because these

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.920
[Guest]: guys used to travel, right?

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.120
[Guest]: So he used to travel to Devas, Devas was an MP, was a very big manufacturing facility.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.000
[Guest]: They used to go up to Ponta Saheb, that's again, a fairly large manufacturing facility.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.840
[Guest]: Goa, Goa was a very big manufacturing facility.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:39.360
[Guest]: So all my guys used to travel so that you could go look on the ground what was really

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360
[Guest]: happening.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.000
[Guest]: So the process was Monday morning, we met in office, and then everybody went their own

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.080
[Guest]: way, did whatever they needed to do, come back on Monday.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.600
[Guest]: And I used to meet with Raj on Tuesday, because I used to collect all that data, essentially

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.880
[Guest]: compile it and then go see him every week kind of, you know, so some weeks he was traveling.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.880
[Guest]: So he wasn't around.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.520
[Guest]: But someday, the week that he was there, I used to go see him and tell him, look, this

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.480
[Guest]: is how far we got.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.960
[Guest]: We had great difficulty getting data.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.640
[Guest]: But at some point when the picture began to emerge, and when I told him that this is what

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640
[Guest]: it is, he didn't believe me.

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.160
[Guest]: He said, there must be something really wrong.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.760
[Guest]: I mean, how is it possible that, you know, there is so much of this kind of, you know,

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.760
[Guest]: issues that you're dealing with?

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.880
[Guest]: You can't have a portfolio of a company where all the data is missing.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.000
[Guest]: Go back and redo this.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
[Guest]: So after a while, I just got like, you don't believe me.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.360
[Guest]: I mean, I'm telling you what I've heard, what I have.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360
[Guest]: You don't believe me.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.880
[Guest]: So why don't you come next Monday morning when I meet with my group, why don't you come

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880
[Guest]: and join our meeting?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.520
[Guest]: So he did.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.680
[Guest]: And he heard from people, all of them across the table.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:44.240
[Guest]: We sat down and basically people told him, look, this is what it is.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.400
[Guest]: After that meeting, I think the penny dropped for him too.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.400
[Guest]: And he was really upset.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.720
[Guest]: And he basically said, I just I can't believe this nonsense is going on.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:57.000
[Guest]: I need you to prepare, you know, a sort of a summary of how far you've come along here.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.120
[Guest]: I need you to give it to me in terms of what was really happening.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.040
[Guest]: So that was the first time I actually put together a spreadsheet, you know, because

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:10.000
[Guest]: there were multiple pieces of information to the spreadsheet that was there, you know,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.560
[Guest]: that was a consolidated was that was the first time that I did.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.800
[Guest]: There was a business development meeting in Bangkok.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:20.600
[Guest]: And part of on the sidelines of that meeting, he was supposed to be meeting with Brian and

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.840
[Guest]: and the business heads in Malvinder and everybody else.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.360
[Guest]: He said, give me that spreadsheet.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.360
[Guest]: Let me take it.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.680
[Guest]: I'm going to go talk to them.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.360
[Guest]: And, you know, so that was the first time that he told, you know, this is what was happening.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.920
[Guest]: After he came back, you know, we continue doing this and, you know, another month and

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.920
[Guest]: a half, month, month and a half after that, you know, he said, give me a PowerPoint presentation.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.260
[Guest]: So I made a PowerPoint presentation, gave it to him.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:51.080
[Guest]: This was discussed in the scientific subcommittee of the board of directors.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.680
[Guest]: He made the presentation.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.720
[Guest]: Not one person basically said anything.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.960
[Guest]: There was one scientist, Nityanand, who basically said, you know, we really need to do something

01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.960
[Guest]: to fix this.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.640
[Guest]: Everybody else said, just destroy it, get rid of the laptop, get rid of this, that and

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640
[Guest]: the other.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.640
[Guest]: And he was very honest.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.440
[Guest]: He told me when he came back from the meeting, he said, I know how to fix it.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.160
[Guest]: The right way to do this is to withdraw the entire portfolio, be honest with, you know,

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.560
[Guest]: the regulators, tell them that you have a problem.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.440
[Guest]: We will redo the thing, bottom up, clean this thing up.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.160
[Guest]: Yes, there's going to be a short term loss to the company.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.000
[Guest]: Next couple of quarters, we're not going to make our numbers.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.680
[Guest]: But it will emerge stronger if you do this thing right.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.120
[Guest]: Nothing, this pin drop silence in the room.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120
[Guest]: He came back that evening.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.480
[Guest]: He says, I'm leaving.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.480
[Guest]: Next day he resigned and walked away.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.520
[Amit Varma]: No, and just to be clear about, you know, what happened in that meeting, which is again

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.560
[Amit Varma]: so revelatory of people's approaches, is that the shock and horror that was in that meeting

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.200
[Amit Varma]: was not about the fact that these things are happening, that we basically lied about everything.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.820
[Amit Varma]: The shock and horror is that someone has collected this data, and they could get caught.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.360
[Amit Varma]: So they immediately say not only destroy all copies of this PowerPoint presentation, but

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.160
[Amit Varma]: destroy the laptop that it was made on.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.920
[Amit Varma]: So the entire laptop was taken from Mr. Kumar and destroyed basically, and the hammer was

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:11.320
[Amit Varma]: used and destroyed and luckily copies existed, including a copy with you, which, you know,

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.040
[Amit Varma]: is useful later in the story and keeps in fact cropping up at different parts of the

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.020
[Amit Varma]: story, which is really interesting.

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.120
[Amit Varma]: So he comes back and he quits.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, he basically, I think the next day he resigned, and then they actually had

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.400
[Guest]: a charade.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.920
[Guest]: They basically didn't tell the street.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.560
[Guest]: They said that his mom was there, they went back to the UK, some shenanigans.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.960
[Guest]: So they did they until January, they did not disclose to the street that the head of R&D

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960
[Guest]: had resigned.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.480
[Guest]: That was probably a big issue, losing two heads of R&D in quick succession, right?

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.780
[Amit Varma]: So they covered it up, didn't say anything.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:48.440
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of incident struck me and this happened, I think, much earlier, around the

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.920
[Amit Varma]: time Rashmi Barbahia was leaving, where you pointed out that you had no idea why he had

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.200
[Amit Varma]: left and exactly what the deal was.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.800
[Amit Varma]: But your son Ishaan, who was three years old, he had an ear infection.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.120
[Amit Varma]: And you first gave him Ranbaxy's version of Amoxiclav, which was generic, and it didn't

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.400
[Amit Varma]: seem to help at all.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And the moment you shifted him to the brand name version, it worked.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:16.840
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that has happened throughout the world, and is known to doctors everywhere.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Like Iban in her book, describes in great detail about how in America, at various points

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.440
[Amit Varma]: in time, doctors basically knew, they realized that if you're on the brand name version of

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.880
[Amit Varma]: a medicine, it's fine.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.120
[Amit Varma]: But the moment you shift to a generic, either you adjust the dosage and give the person

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.440
[Amit Varma]: much more of it to make sure that you have the equivalent amount of the drug, or if it

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.200
[Amit Varma]: doesn't work, and in some cases, it took lives.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.680
[Amit Varma]: And if it doesn't work, you shift back to the brand name version.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.400
[Amit Varma]: And the political incentives are, of course, to keep the generic versions as popular as

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.120
[Amit Varma]: possible because the government is spending 18% of GDP on healthcare.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.720
[Amit Varma]: And generics are a big part of that.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And in Africa, also, there are these, you know, vivid reports from Iban and others of

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.120
[Amit Varma]: how everyone in hospitals knew that you have a bunch of brand name medicines in a corner

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.680
[Amit Varma]: somewhere for an emergency, but you give generics to the other people, and they probably don't

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.680
[Amit Varma]: work.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.880
[Amit Varma]: And Ranbaxy in particular was one name to avoid, but not just Ranbaxy, like through

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.480
[Amit Varma]: this book, there are mentions of Walkhard and Dr. Reddy's and so on.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.280
[Amit Varma]: The list is kind of almost feels endless.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.880
[Amit Varma]: So at this stage, when Dr. Kumar has left, right, and you are left with your team, and

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.400
[Amit Varma]: you realize why he's left, you realize that what is happening is criminal, that is costing

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.080
[Amit Varma]: lives for sure.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And that's in fact, one of the great examples of the seen and the unseen, where what is

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:44.960
[Amit Varma]: unseen here is actually incalculable, like the lives lost or impacted through this, there's

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:50.360
[Amit Varma]: just no way to calculate it, because a medicine did not work, or because there was an impurity

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.440
[Amit Varma]: and it worked in the wrong way, there's no way.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So what now?

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Dr. Kumar is left, you are left with your team.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520
[Guest]: What are you thinking?

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.000
[Guest]: So obviously, I mean, I was a known target at that point in time, because they knew I

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.960
[Guest]: was the one who actually collected that data, right.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:10.680
[Guest]: So they sent the internal audit group after me, the guys just, you know, they essentially

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.880
[Guest]: sort of descended on my department, stayed there for almost like a month and a half,

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.640
[Guest]: dug through everything they possibly could, didn't find anything.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.440
[Guest]: And then finally, I think what they did was they planted some URLs in the IP table to

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.640
[Guest]: say that I was browsing porn on my computer.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.320
[Guest]: That was the thing that they wanted to make an issue out of, that somehow I was violating

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.320
[Guest]: company policy, I was browsing porn from work.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.120
[Guest]: And fortunately, I also had an IT department in mind, because, you know, we were doing

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.800
[Guest]: a lot of, you know, systems installation.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.760
[Guest]: So Sanjay Munshi was the guy who was a network administrator.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:51.040
[Guest]: He was the one who looked it up and found it, that it was being planted from the corporate

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.400
[Guest]: office.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:56.000
[Guest]: Once I found that, then I knew exactly what the gig was up.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
[Guest]: So I went to Brian and basically told him, look, can't work this way, right?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.320
[Guest]: I mean, how would you like to work?

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.280
[Guest]: Every second minute, you have to look over your shoulder, trying to figure out who's

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.680
[Guest]: going to come after you with a dagger, it just doesn't work like this.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.960
[Guest]: I can't, you know, this is not a way that I will survive here.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960
[Guest]: And he was fine with it.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.040
[Guest]: He was like, okay, that's fine.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.080
[Guest]: I said, you know, he asked me, what is, what are you going to do?

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.600
[Guest]: I said, I don't know, I'm going to try and figure out something else to do here.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.040
[Guest]: So it's like, that's fine, you know, Monday, go Monday, turn in your things and pick up

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.240
[Guest]: your personal effects and, you know, we'll settle your last and final whatever the thing

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.920
[Guest]: that you know, what was owed to you at that point and I'm a salary wise, I'll settle that.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.920
[Guest]: That was it.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.400
[Amit Varma]: That was the end of it.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And when you sort of landed up to take your things, you took the pictures of your kids

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.360
[Amit Varma]: from the desk, but you weren't even allowed to open it.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.840
[Guest]: No, because the problem was that the drawers actually contained a lot of handwritten notes

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:54.080
[Guest]: of people who were interviewed.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:59.120
[Guest]: You know, so my guys had done a lot of interviews, I had done a lot of interviews, and we had

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.720
[Guest]: handwritten notes of who we spoke to, when we spoke to what did we find, the drawers

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.440
[Guest]: actually contained a lot of those handwritten notes.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.360
[Guest]: And obviously, that was not something that I was able to do and let me, you know, lay

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.360
[Guest]: my hands on.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.200
[Guest]: So I got to, I got to collect Mishant's picture.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.320
[Guest]: I had some personal effects, you know, on the table that I did that.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.320
[Guest]: And that was it.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.600
[Guest]: That was the end of it.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.560
[Guest]: They physically stood there and stopped.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.960
[Guest]: So there was this HR manager, his name was Udbhav Ganju.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.840
[Guest]: He was the director of HR and a security person.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.640
[Guest]: Both of them essentially stood over my shoulder.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.120
[Guest]: It took all of like five minutes.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:38.440
[Guest]: On Monday morning, I went in there, I took the picture, I collected my pictures and had

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.040
[Guest]: some BMS personal effects on the table.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.160
[Guest]: So I took that, it took all of five minutes and they walked me off of there.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's insane.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.960
[Amit Varma]: No, I, you know, one of the things that struck me from Iban's book also, is that as I was

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.040
[Amit Varma]: reading through it, I was entering little rabbit holes in the site, googling all the

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:58.680
[Amit Varma]: names of the people and thinking to myself that surely this person's career was over

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.160
[Amit Varma]: at this point.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.840
[Amit Varma]: But they all continue to flourish in the pharma business.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:08.120
[Amit Varma]: All of these people who admitted to these wrongdoings, who forged documents, whose actions

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.840
[Amit Varma]: certainly led to so many deaths, they all continue to flourish in the business.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:17.520
[Guest]: Unfortunately, that's the sad truth of how this industry works.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.840
[Amit Varma]: So this has happened and meanwhile, there's a lot of other cloak and dagger stuff going

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:27.200
[Amit Varma]: on within the company, little politics like after DS Brar goes, Brian Tempest takes over

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.560
[Amit Varma]: as CEO and later on Malvinder basically takes over himself and in 2008, you know, the company

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:40.960
[Amit Varma]: is sold to this Japanese company, the FDA investigation is completely hidden from them.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.960
[Amit Varma]: What do you do?

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.320
[Amit Varma]: So you quit, you kind of go back home and you had, of course, shifted bag and baggage

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:53.520
[Amit Varma]: to Gurgaon, not something I would, you know, necessarily envy being there.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.500
[Amit Varma]: And there's an early part of the book, which mentions an interesting incident, which also

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I found kind of revelatory and it's, you know, credit to Iban, I think to put that incident

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.880
[Amit Varma]: in because it does reveal character, it tells you a little bit more about what's going to

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:11.400
[Amit Varma]: come where she talks about this traffic accident, which you witness, where your driver is driving

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.680
[Amit Varma]: you through a particular part of the road and you see that someone after an accident

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:20.080
[Amit Varma]: is lying there injured and your driver's instinct, as honestly, I think most people in India's

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.440
[Amit Varma]: would be, is just drive on, don't get involved with this shit.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.720
[Amit Varma]: But you stop, you take the person in the car and bleeding, injured, whatever you take that

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:34.360
[Amit Varma]: person to hospital, and because the doctor asked for some money up front, you pay seven

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.960
[Amit Varma]: eight thousand rupees, whatever it is, and you go away.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And the next day at Ranbaxy, the cops visit you and they are trying to frame you for running

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.600
[Amit Varma]: over a dead person.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:48.640
[Amit Varma]: So that they can extract something out of you and your HR settles it.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640
[Guest]: He makes him go away.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.800
[Guest]: I don't know what he did, but he made them go away.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.080
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, so clearly.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.400
[Guest]: So maybe the same Mr. Ganju, I don't know if he was Mr. Ganju.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.800
[Guest]: So Mr. Ganju was the head of HR and there's another gentleman who worked with him very

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.800
[Guest]: closely.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.800
[Guest]: His name is Mohan Ahuja.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.080
[Guest]: Both of them were very well connected and they made them go away.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.080
[Amit Varma]: So you've quit.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, obviously, you're despondent.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.380
[Amit Varma]: What are the different things going through your head?

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:20.020
[Amit Varma]: Because you've got a young family and your skills, in a sense, the industry is not ready

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.320
[Amit Varma]: for them.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.040
[Amit Varma]: So you're not really going to get a job right away in India.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.600
[Amit Varma]: And eventually you do with Infosys and all of that and you have to move back to the US.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:32.200
[Amit Varma]: But in the interim, you're sitting in your basement in Gurgaon, you're processing all

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.360
[Amit Varma]: of this.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.400
[Amit Varma]: What's your state of mind?

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.900
[Amit Varma]: What do you want to do?

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:39.080
[Amit Varma]: At what point do you decide that I can't walk away?

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.240
[Guest]: I can't let this rest?

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240
[Guest]: Two things, as you said, right?

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:49.000
[Guest]: I think that I did approach other companies, you know, offered my services, but they were

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.080
[Guest]: not ready because they didn't recognize the value of what I was doing.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.480
[Guest]: Why do you need somebody who can do all of this stuff?

01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:01.320
[Guest]: We know how to manage our own portfolios, so that was one.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.560
[Guest]: The second thing, I mean, then I started looking at IT services companies, actually worked

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.760
[Guest]: with Tata Consultancy as well.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:13.920
[Guest]: Again, it's the same situation, you don't need somebody to do the skill that I bring

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.920
[Guest]: to the table, right?

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.440
[Guest]: So it never worked out.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.120
[Guest]: And so I started thinking about, okay, what do I do now?

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:25.680
[Guest]: Because going back to the U.S. was an option, but then moving my entire family back again,

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.960
[Guest]: trying to start again from scratch, and even there, I didn't have a job at this point.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.360
[Guest]: I mean, I have to find some work and start again from scratch.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.000
[Guest]: It's not easy to do that.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
[Guest]: And remember, this is when, in 2007, 2008, this is when the entire market collapsed.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.880
[Guest]: People weren't hiring, nothing was really sort of happening in the market.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.120
[Guest]: People who I knew were employed were essentially being laid off at that point.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.640
[Guest]: Why would you want to hire somebody who left you for two years ago, wanted to go to India?

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.880
[Guest]: So what does he have to offer to you at that point in time?

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.520
[Guest]: And there's so much other mayhem happening in the economy at that point in time.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.880
[Guest]: So it took a while to sort of think through all of these things.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.520
[Guest]: The trouble is, when you're not sort of focused on doing something productive, then your mind

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.400
[Guest]: sort of reflects back on the things that you've experienced.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.840
[Guest]: And I had nothing better to do at that point in time.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:24.960
[Guest]: The two other guys who came with me, Dinesh Kasturi and Venkat, they also were in a difficult

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.960
[Guest]: position.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.400
[Guest]: So all three of us were in really, really bad shape.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:34.760
[Guest]: But unfortunately, the thing is, one was the fact that I didn't have anything to do, number

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760
[Guest]: one.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.680
[Guest]: Number two was the fact that I'm the kind of person who kind of doesn't react immediately.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:47.800
[Guest]: I reflect on these things and kind of store it, and after that, I do something.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.280
[Guest]: And so my initial reaction was very simple.

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.560
[Guest]: I said, like, fine, okay, I did what I needed to do.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.720
[Guest]: It ended.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720
[Guest]: I have to move on.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.400
[Guest]: There's not much more I can do about it.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.600
[Guest]: But then I started talking to Raj about this a little bit.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.200
[Guest]: He used to be in the UK, so we used to talk once in a while.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:10.760
[Guest]: And I used to tell him, look, is this it?

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.760
[Guest]: You walked away.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.520
[Guest]: You basically said, okay, this is mine.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.000
[Guest]: I'm not going to deal with this anymore, and we walked away.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
[Guest]: I lost my job.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
[Guest]: Are we done?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.960
[Guest]: Are we done with our responsibilities here?

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:27.480
[Guest]: A lot of these discussions over a period of time came to the point that I felt that I

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.240
[Guest]: needed to do something more than just sort of saying that I washed my hands off of the

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.840
[Guest]: situation.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.680
[Guest]: I'm done with my thing.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.280
[Guest]: And that's the reason why it took a while for me to kind of sort of think over this.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.480
[Guest]: What do I do?

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.160
[Guest]: How do I do it?

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.160
[Guest]: I also understand.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.080
[Guest]: I mean, there are a lot of people here basically said, look, if you go out and do something

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.080
[Guest]: and be public, realize that this is a big company.

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.640
[Guest]: They have lots of connections.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.360
[Guest]: By the time there was also anecdotes about boardroom brawls, the brothers beating each

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.560
[Guest]: other up, like dirty stuff, right?

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.560
[Guest]: I mean, you don't like, you know, why do you want to sort of put yourself out there?

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.280
[Guest]: You know, this was a counter narrative, you know, saying, you know, this is how things

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.280
[Guest]: get done in India.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:16.720
[Guest]: You know, you if you want to do something about it, just shut up and go about doing

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.720
[Guest]: your own thing.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:18.720
[Guest]: Reinvent yourself.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.000
[Guest]: There's nothing more you can do about it.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.640
[Guest]: So it took a while for all of this to kind of, you know, gestate and come to a point

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.560
[Guest]: where it was important for me to be able to do something about it.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, just talking about the environment, I mean, whistleblowers in India haven't, you

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480
[Amit Varma]: haven't really flourished.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you look at Manjunath and others who were basically murdered and in Iqbal's book,

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.920
[Amit Varma]: there's this other conversation she reports between Malvinder and Jay Deshmukh, the lawyer,

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.440
[Amit Varma]: where towards the end, at one point, they are fighting and they're fighting over exactly

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.440
[Amit Varma]: this.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And Malvinder tells Jay Deshmukh that, you know, I know where you live.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And Deshmukh says, of course, you know, where you where I live, you've come home, you fool.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:02.760
[Amit Varma]: And then he says that, you know, my brother founded the Shiv Sinha or whatever.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:09.160
[Amit Varma]: He had relatives who had, so there are these kind of threats going around and it's kind

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160
[Amit Varma]: of messy.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the next part of the story, where you send an email to the FDA or driven

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.080
[Amit Varma]: by conscience.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the next part of that, there's a little bit of musing I have here.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.400
[Amit Varma]: One is that when historians come on the show, I asked them about what they think of the

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.120
[Amit Varma]: great man theory of history.

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is, of course, something that people battle about, where there'll be one theory

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.840
[Amit Varma]: that history is basically made by great men and unfortunately, only great men is gendered

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.960
[Amit Varma]: because that's, you know, we've been, our species has been sexist and misogynist all

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960
[Amit Varma]: along.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.860
[Amit Varma]: And it's men who tend to make and write history.

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:48.960
[Amit Varma]: But one is that there are these men who do important things and the course of the world

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.520
[Amit Varma]: changes.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's one theory.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.840
[Amit Varma]: And the other theory is that no, there are currents of history and the people who appear

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.520
[Amit Varma]: to be great men are people who just came along and wrote those currents, but things would

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.520
[Amit Varma]: have happened anyway.

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:05.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, I don't want to ask you for your opinion on what historians themselves argue about

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:11.780
[Amit Varma]: all the time, but it strikes me that it's a bit of a happenstance that events unfolded

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:17.000
[Amit Varma]: the way they did, that Ranbaxy was exposed, that they apologized, that we know that they

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
[Amit Varma]: did all these things.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, it sounds like a wild conspiracy theory.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And all of it really comes down in a sense to one man.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's you.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.420
[Amit Varma]: For example, not just one man, but circumstances.

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Had you found a job immediately, maybe you would have been diverted.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.860
[Amit Varma]: Had you spoken with your wife and she would have discouraged you surely, correctly so,

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:40.000
[Amit Varma]: because you got to be practical and you did what you did.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.440
[Guest]: You're absolutely right.

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.240
[Guest]: I mean, I am a big believer in the second theory.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.000
[Guest]: I mean, I think that it's hubris to think about the fact that, you know, a man or a

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.560
[Guest]: group of men changed the course of history.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.560
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.560
[Guest]: But in this case, that's what, I mean, it's by happenstance, kind of.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.480
[Guest]: No, but the circumstances actually enable you to do that, right?

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:04.200
[Guest]: I think the most important thing, you know, whenever I get asked about this, right?

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.160
[Guest]: I was lucky.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:12.400
[Guest]: I was lucky because for whatever reason in my life, I had very strong role models, very,

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.280
[Guest]: very strong role models.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.400
[Guest]: My dad is one of them, Raj is one of them.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.920
[Guest]: I think that that is essentially, you know, made me react in the way that I reacted.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.560
[Guest]: But the circumstances are not mine.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.240
[Guest]: Circumstances was created by a number of different people around it.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240
[Amit Varma]: But they're kind of accidental.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.760
[Amit Varma]: Like, what if the Infosys job came about just when you left Ranbaxy and you?

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, counterfactuals are always there, right?

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:44.320
[Guest]: You can always think about counterfactuals, would have been as aggressive.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.320
[Guest]: But I have an answer to the Infosys job question.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:53.360
[Guest]: You see, what happened was, even while working for Infosys, I was working with the USFDA

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.520
[Guest]: until a point where they essentially told me, go get a lawyer, we cannot protect you

01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.760
[Guest]: anymore, right?

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.240
[Guest]: I had no idea that this statute existed in the law, right?

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.440
[Guest]: For almost two years, 18 months or so, I was meeting with, you know, the USFDA inspectors,

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.040
[Guest]: you know, answering questions, you know, what they were doing, helping them map out, you

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.360
[Guest]: know, what, you know, what they were doing.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.920
[Guest]: I mean, the raid, Valentine's Day raid in Princeton, a lot of this thing actually happened

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.720
[Guest]: while I was still employed at Infosys.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.560
[Guest]: I was doing my day job, at night I used to do this.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.120
[Guest]: So who's to say that even if I got the Infosys job right away, after I, you know, after I

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:33.320
[Guest]: quit Ranbaxy, I wouldn't still have done that?

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.440
[Guest]: Because you see, at the end of the day, I have to look at myself in the mirror and say,

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.480
[Guest]: did you do what you're supposed to do, right?

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480
[Guest]: Nobody can answer that.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.800
[Guest]: Raj can't answer it, my dad can't answer it.

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.800
[Guest]: Nobody can answer that.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.320
[Guest]: At the end of the day, I have to answer that to myself.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.320
[Amit Varma]: But the other moment of happenstance that strikes me is earlier on, if you look at a

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.880
[Amit Varma]: counterfactual when you're at BMS, and you decide that, hey, I'm in America.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.720
[Amit Varma]: This is a dream of any Indian born in the 60s or 70s.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, why should I leave?

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.720
[Amit Varma]: Why should I go back?

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.540
[Amit Varma]: Let me enjoy myself here and you stay back there.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you and your team is never at Ranbaxy.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.480
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps when Rajkumar wants his data, he doesn't even get it.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.640
[Amit Varma]: There's no one to get it for him.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640
[Guest]: And that could also happen.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640
[Guest]: That could very well have happened.

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.640
[Guest]: I mean, again, you know, when you look back and say, okay, why did it happen?

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:25.840
[Guest]: Why did it have to happen this way?

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.520
[Guest]: I don't have an answer for that.

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.520
[Guest]: Right?

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.720
[Guest]: I mean, if I had decided at that point in time, you know what, I'm on a fast track to

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.840
[Guest]: become a VP at BMS.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.240
[Guest]: I'm going to stick around for another five years, I'm going to become a VP very easily,

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.240
[Guest]: right?

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.200
[Guest]: A cushy life, well paying job, you know, perfectly, you know, sort of happy with my son.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.320
[Guest]: Nothing to complain about, right?

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.240
[Guest]: But at some point, you have to still ask yourself, and I still have to ask myself, okay, right?

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:57.880
[Guest]: At what point do you transition from being responsible to your family, immediate family,

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.560
[Guest]: to your responsibility toward a larger society?

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.080
[Amit Varma]: I don't have an answer.

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.960
[Amit Varma]: That's a legit question for after you uncovered what is at Ranbaxy.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And I completely buy that at that point, everything was inevitably going to where it led to.

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.920
[Amit Varma]: You would have to do this.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I buy that.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.160
[Amit Varma]: But you may not have been at Ranbaxy in the first place.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.160
[Guest]: But anyway, that's it.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.160
[Guest]: No, it's fascinating.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.520
[Guest]: Like, the reason I say this is as follows, right?

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.040
[Guest]: So in 2007, I started a company here in Bombay, right?

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:32.800
[Guest]: So it was based in Westboro in Massachusetts, but we had people here working.

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.920
[Guest]: And I grew it to, you know, a reasonable size as a CEO and a step down in 2012, a lot of

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:42.120
[Guest]: lessons there as well.

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.560
[Guest]: One of the reasons why that company did that well was because we were standing in the path

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.240
[Guest]: of social change.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:55.920
[Guest]: Industry was reinventing itself, they needed that skill, we just happened to be there.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:01.800
[Guest]: I can't, I mean, I can claim success because I had a fantastic team, we did an amazing

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800
[Guest]: job.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.760
[Guest]: But I can't take away from the fact that that exact model, if it was two years earlier or

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.640
[Guest]: two years late, we wouldn't have succeeded, right?

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.800
[Guest]: Sometimes you find yourself in this situation, right?

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.600
[Guest]: And you think that you're the greatest thing since sliced bread, you're not.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:23.260
[Guest]: You're just standing in the path of social change.

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.480
[Guest]: And if you're stupid enough to think that you're the one who's driving it, there's something

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.240
[Guest]: coming for you, right?

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.000
[Guest]: Have the humility to understand where you stand.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.760
[Guest]: And by God's grace, if you've been given the humility to understand how to leverage that,

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.640
[Amit Varma]: then you make something out of it.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:41.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you spoke about how, you know, if you were two years too early or two years too

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.440
[Amit Varma]: late, it wouldn't have worked.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:45.240
[Amit Varma]: And I just thought back to something like I've just moved house and we were unpacking

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.240
[Amit Varma]: a lot of old boxes.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And my wife came across this old article which came in business week in the year 2000, which

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.120
[Amit Varma]: was about me.

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.600
[Amit Varma]: I had done this startup then called Sonic Town with a friend of mine, which was basically

01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.480
[Amit Varma]: iTunes plus Myspace, what they went on to become.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, we had cut deals with record labels in the US that we would sell digital music.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.720
[Amit Varma]: And I was making the case that all your CDs will be defunct and everyone's going to listen

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.160
[Amit Varma]: to digital music.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.080
[Amit Varma]: And I remember going to New York in the middle of 2000 sometime, made a presentation to a

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.720
[Amit Varma]: bunch of venture capitalists, impressed some of them enough that they committed some money

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:19.720
[Amit Varma]: to us.

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.560
[Amit Varma]: And then the Nasdaq crash happens and everything goes to hell.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.320
[Amit Varma]: So we were way before our time, in a sense, and it all kind of went to hell.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And I said, Okay, never gonna be an entrepreneur again.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.880
[Amit Varma]: One could argue that in these modern times, every creator is one.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.120
[Amit Varma]: But let's let's now get back to your story.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:40.320
[Amit Varma]: You're in your basement, you boot up your laptop, and you send an email to the FDA,

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.040
[Amit Varma]: because you've decided that I can't keep this inside of me, there's too much at stake.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.040
[Amit Varma]: I have to let them know.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Now what is that process like?

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Because like, what did you expect?

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Like, did you think that, okay, it'll be a simple one step thing that I send them the

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.080
[Amit Varma]: details and they look into it and things get sorted out?

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.080
[Amit Varma]: What happened?

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Take me through the process of what then?

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:04.280
[Guest]: Because I mean, my experience there collecting this data told me that there was a stake in

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.640
[Guest]: it for the World Health Organization, right?

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.760
[Guest]: Because they were the ones who were essentially telling all of these countries in South Africa

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:15.560
[Guest]: that, yeah, you know, we can vouch for, you know, what you can buy from Grand Maxi.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.480
[Guest]: It was the UK's regulator, you know, Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency, because they

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:24.360
[Guest]: were also involved in buying a lot of stuff from the US FDA.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:30.120
[Guest]: My expectation was that they needed to know that this is what is the reality.

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.280
[Guest]: And they would do something about it in the sense that, you know, either they would be

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:40.280
[Guest]: more diligent in terms of evaluating the information that the company is providing in their applications

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.400
[Guest]: to ask for marketing authorization, or they would come and do better inspections, right?

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.520
[Guest]: Because I knew where the holes were at that point in time.

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.920
[Guest]: That was what my expectations were.

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:55.840
[Guest]: I got a very nice email from the World Health Organization saying, thank you very much.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.840
[Guest]: We'll look into it.

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.560
[Guest]: That was the end of it.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.240
[Guest]: UK never responded.

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.640
[Guest]: US, you know, over a period of time, I think what had happened was I managed to sort of

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:11.680
[Guest]: build some confidence over a period of time, because, you know what, I started sending

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.040
[Guest]: them information bit by bit, because I didn't want to overwhelm them saying, okay, I mean,

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.800
[Guest]: nobody would have believed, to be very honest with you.

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:21.240
[Guest]: And then this is exactly what happened.

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:27.360
[Guest]: So when I was told to go get a lawyer, just before the raid was executed, and I actually,

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.240
[Guest]: you know, spoke to Andrew, who's my good friend right now.

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:37.240
[Guest]: And when I told him what was happening, he thought I was crazy.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.680
[Guest]: It's like, you're telling me the largest genetic drug company in the United States

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:50.000
[Guest]: is selling all of these drugs with fudge data, and you're telling me that you know this for

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.360
[Guest]: sure?

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.240
[Guest]: He didn't believe me to begin with, right?

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.560
[Guest]: And over a period of time, he also kind of, you know, got convinced that that was true.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.480
[Guest]: That would have been the reaction if I told, you know, the USFDA, right, a friend that

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.920
[Guest]: look, guys, you know, you guys are not doing a right job, you know, there's wool being

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.960
[Guest]: pulled over your eyes, they would have laughed me out of the room.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.520
[Guest]: This was the largest genetic company in the United States.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:19.800
[Guest]: This was a company that actually had the first to file for the largest selling drug, Lipitor,

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.440
[Guest]: $12 billion drug.

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.920
[Guest]: Who's going to believe somebody who's saying something like this, right?

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.640
[Guest]: So I had to write to them over a period of time, and it kind of took a while for them

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.720
[Guest]: to appreciate what I was saying.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.560
[Guest]: Plus, again, you know, it always comes down to one or two conscientious people, right?

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.320
[Guest]: So there was this gentleman named Edwin Rivera Martinez, who passed away, you know, bless

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.320
[Guest]: his soul.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.640
[Guest]: He was the head of criminal investigations at that point.

01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:46.920
[Guest]: Edwin took interest in it.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.800
[Guest]: I didn't know, I met him a long, I mean, after the case ended many, many times, many years

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.720
[Guest]: later, I met with him.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.960
[Guest]: He was the one who took interest in this.

01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:01.120
[Guest]: And then there was another, later on, the true hero of the story is this lady who was

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.400
[Guest]: a criminal investigator in the US, Debbie Robinson.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.640
[Guest]: Without her, this case would have unraveled, you know, like nothing would have happened

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.640
[Guest]: in this particular case.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.080
[Guest]: This woman theory of history.

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:14.080
[Guest]: Seriously.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.320
[Guest]: She's the one who drove this thing to fruition.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.120
[Guest]: And if you meet with her, you will see, you know, I mean, she's no nonsense.

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.720
[Guest]: She comes from the IRS, the revenue side, walks with a, you know, holster, you know,

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.720
[Guest]: with a gun.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:33.200
[Guest]: You're in awe of the kind of person, I mean, she knocked heads, a bunch of people and made

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.200
[Guest]: it happen.

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:40.560
[Guest]: So again, it comes down to conscientious people trying to do the right thing.

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.720
[Guest]: Happened to be in the right place at the right time.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.760
[Guest]: If it was not for Edwin, if it was not for Debbie, this case would have never resolved

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760
[Guest]: itself.

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.160
[Guest]: It would have been in some dusty box someplace else.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:51:00.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of fascinating how it takes months and years to kind of unravel where

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:02.520
[Amit Varma]: it takes time for you to win their trust.

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And when they do their inspections, for example, the FDA has to carry out these inspections

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.680
[Amit Varma]: in India.

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And typically everywhere else, like in the US, for example, when the FDA does inspections,

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:17.160
[Amit Varma]: you've pointed out that they're all surprise inspections, so you can't prepare for them.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:21.160
[Amit Varma]: But in India, because of visas and all that, the companies know well in advance, they know

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.160
[Amit Varma]: what to do.

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.720
[Amit Varma]: So everything is sanitized.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.320
[Amit Varma]: These people are guided through.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.480
[Amit Varma]: But because of the kind of inputs that you were giving, they now knew what to look for

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.960
[Amit Varma]: in which factory, what kind of data to look at and all of that.

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.640
[Amit Varma]: So when did the penny start dropping that everything that you were saying was true?

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.420
[Guest]: After the first inspection, when they went to Ponta Saheb in 2008, and then they found

01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:46.240
[Guest]: out that they were fudging data, the first thing was very simple.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.760
[Guest]: So what happens is that when the US FDA comes to inspect, at the end of an inspection, they

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:56.880
[Guest]: give you a report, it's called the Form 483, and they write down what is it that they found

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.880
[Guest]: on that inspection.

01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.880
[Guest]: So it's very transparent.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:03.360
[Guest]: They come, they do the inspection, at the end of the inspection, they do a briefing,

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.120
[Guest]: they get the senior management in a room, they tell them, look, this is what we did,

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.160
[Guest]: this is what we found, it is a report that we're giving.

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.960
[Guest]: And so it's a draft report, it's not final, they give them an opportunity to actually

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.120
[Guest]: provide feedback, and then it gets finalized.

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:23.480
[Guest]: The first thing that is on that report is that when you walk into the manufacturing

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.800
[Guest]: facility at the gate, they have registers of who's coming and going.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:33.360
[Guest]: They were telling the US FDA, there were certain people who came in and did all this work.

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.520
[Guest]: There was no record of those people ever being in that.

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:41.880
[Guest]: So you start with there, right, and then you start digging and start unraveling, then you

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.680
[Guest]: find the steam room, then you find stuff that is happening behind the scenes.

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.520
[Guest]: So unfortunately, after the first inspection, they figured out that, look, this guy is not

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:53.300
[Guest]: smoking pot or whatever, what he's saying is actually true.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.440
[Guest]: So after that, I think there was some confidence that came in, look, he's saying what he's

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.700
[Guest]: saying.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.840
[Amit Varma]: And what's the process that now happens?

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.040
[Amit Varma]: In 2008, towards the end of that year, for example, Ranbaxy sold off to the Japanese

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.040
[Amit Varma]: company.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:11.640
[Amit Varma]: There also, there's this interesting storyline that, you know, Jay Deshmukh, who is, you

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:15.200
[Amit Varma]: know, legal representative, is called into this meeting, and he doesn't realize that

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.360
[Amit Varma]: it's over an acquisition.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.560
[Amit Varma]: He thinks it's some kind of business deal.

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:23.920
[Amit Varma]: And he says, hey, no, no, everything is kosher, and the FDA is just investigating some random

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.100
[Amit Varma]: minor thing.

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:29.760
[Amit Varma]: Even though they know what the FDA is investigating by now, that famous PowerPoint presentation

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:34.360
[Amit Varma]: is with the FDA, it's been spotted on their desk, and all of that, all of that has happened.

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:39.480
[Amit Varma]: And then after the sale happens, Jay Deshmukh realizes that he actually had he known it

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.040
[Amit Varma]: was an acquisition, he would not have been able to pull off such a big lie.

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's when he and Malvinder have this fight that I know where you live, and all

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.120
[Amit Varma]: this kind of crazy nonsense happens.

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And all these people are thriving, by the way, just Google all these names from this

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.160
[Amit Varma]: book.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.160
[Amit Varma]: They're all thriving.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:58.240
[Amit Varma]: It's just shocking that these are murderers in my eyes.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:01.560
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, so it takes many years, right?

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.560
[Amit Varma]: It takes many years.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:07.600
[Amit Varma]: In that time, you get the job in Infosys, you have to go to the US, you know, leaving

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.440
[Amit Varma]: your family behind.

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:12.280
[Amit Varma]: And there's a poignant scene as described in the book, I don't know if you're comfortable

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.520
[Amit Varma]: talking about it, but your wife goes to the basement and you're holding your son and crying.

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's this whole thing, where you transition from being a man with a career he loves to

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.400
[Amit Varma]: being a man on a crusade of sorts with this larger cause.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.000
[Amit Varma]: How does it affect your family?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.040
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a tough one.

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.040
[Guest]: That's a tough one.

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:40.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's look, you know, I mean, if you look at it today, right, you know, it's a

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.200
[Guest]: broken family.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.600
[Guest]: There's a man divorced right now.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:50.440
[Guest]: It did affect the family because, you know, you can't sort of continue doing this within

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440
[Guest]: and continue to live a normal life.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.320
[Guest]: It doesn't work that way.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.720
[Guest]: You know, I don't know, I mean, at that point in time, that felt the right thing for me

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:00.720
[Guest]: to do.

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.400
[Guest]: I, you know, it wasn't like, you know, I didn't have a choice that I needed to do or not do

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.520
[Guest]: at that point in time.

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.520
[Guest]: It was a tough call.

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:14.640
[Guest]: You know, when I left for the US to work for Infosys, I had a, I think, three month old

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:15.640
[Guest]: daughter at that time.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.040
[Guest]: So, yeah, it was a tough, tough time.

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And there must have been worries about safety as well.

01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Like there's an interview of your wife, Sonal, where she talks about how, when you told her,

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.440
[Amit Varma]: you took her to this Chinese restaurant, and you told her that this is what I've done.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And she had no idea at that point, that this is what has happened.

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.960
[Amit Varma]: I've become a whistleblower.

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And she talks about how, you know, she took a sip of the soup.

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.980
[Amit Varma]: And then you said, I have something to tell you.

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And when she next took a sip of the soup, it was cold, which kind of indicates what

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.800
[Amit Varma]: a shock it is to her also.

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And she speaks about how you gave her a phone number in the US embassy to call if there

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:56.120
[Amit Varma]: was ever any trouble, because you felt the Indian police wouldn't help you.

01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And elsewhere in Iban's book, it's mentioned about how I think Debbie Robertson gave you

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.800
[Amit Varma]: the number that, you know, call the US embassy, because you're a US citizen, call the US embassy

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.680
[Amit Varma]: if there's a problem.

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:13.200
[Amit Varma]: And these fears had to be part of it, because it was basically the people who, you know,

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.140
[Amit Varma]: once Ranbaxy realized that dossier, that PowerPoint presentation was with the FDA, and they physically

01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:23.040
[Amit Varma]: saw it in one of the meetings with the FDA, I would guess it's you and Dr. Kumar, who

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.480
[Amit Varma]: are the culprits and Dr. Kumar has sent a veiled warning that you will be implicated

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.640
[Amit Varma]: in this.

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.640
[Guest]: So you are a...

01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.640
[Guest]: Smart man.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.640
[Guest]: Both of us.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.640
[Guest]: Unfortunately, you know what, it was a tough time.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.040
[Guest]: I don't know what to tell you.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.840
[Guest]: I mean, we had security guards outside our home, but no amount of security buys you peace

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840
[Guest]: of mind, right?

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.700
[Guest]: You're always kind of worried about, you know, what's going to happen behind you.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.920
[Guest]: She also went through a lot.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:49.920
[Guest]: I mean, I'm...

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.920
[Guest]: What can I say?

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:55.320
[Amit Varma]: Are there times when you think, I wouldn't do this all over again?

01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.040
[Amit Varma]: Or had you known what was going to unfold that you would have taken another path?

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:05.560
[Guest]: You know what, I was asked this question many times, and I don't think, I can't think of,

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:12.960
[Guest]: you know, whether I would do something different when it comes to what I did with the Ranbaxy

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:13.960
[Guest]: thing.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:19.720
[Guest]: What I did in my personal life, yes, I mean, there's always regrets and there's a lot...

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:23.520
[Guest]: Because look, there's never an easy thing when you're dealing with people's lives, right?

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.860
[Guest]: You can always second guess yourself.

01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.080
[Guest]: Could you have done things better?

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.240
[Guest]: Could you have done things differently?

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.920
[Guest]: Would you still have, you know, a family together if you had done that?

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:33.920
[Guest]: Those are valid questions.

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.360
[Guest]: I don't have answers to that.

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.320
[Guest]: But when it comes to what happened with Ranbaxy, there's really no choice.

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:44.880
[Guest]: I mean, how could you sort of, you know, say no to what was happening, knowing full well

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:47.400
[Guest]: that forget about what is happening in Africa.

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.000
[Guest]: I'm worried about what is happening here.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.360
[Guest]: Go outside Mumbai, right?

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:57.000
[Guest]: Go outside, travel 40 kilometers outside of Mumbai where you don't have the Guardian Pharmacy,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.840
[Guest]: the 98.4, and then see what is sold actually at a chemist shop or a pharmacy shop.

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.360
[Guest]: We have no systems in place.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.680
[Guest]: You know, when I talk about recall and adverse events, people never paid attention.

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:13.400
[Guest]: You know what the pandemic did?

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:16.040
[Guest]: It made people realize that there is something called an adverse event.

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.880
[Guest]: You take a vaccine, you know, you will develop some issues around with it.

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.520
[Guest]: Some people will have rashes.

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.320
[Guest]: Some people will probably have a thrombolytic event, you know, that we have seen.

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:29.520
[Guest]: These people know that, you know what, there is something called an adverse event that

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:32.880
[Guest]: we have to record and report so that something can be done about it.

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.800
[Guest]: Until the pandemic came around, there was no awareness in the country around this issue.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:41.200
[Guest]: How do you build that capability in the country, right?

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:46.480
[Guest]: I mean, there are written documents, you know, Indian companies saying that if they are forced

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.480
[Guest]: to recall a drug lot from the United States because it's a fair lot, they tell in writing

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:55.440
[Guest]: that we are going to redirect it to the Indian market.

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:58.760
[Guest]: How do you reconcile yourself with that?

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:02.600
[Guest]: If it's a fair lot in the US, it's a fair lot.

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:07.320
[Guest]: You don't redirect that to the Indian market and sell it and make money out of it.

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:12.280
[Guest]: There are companies that have made this representation to the US FDA because the law that requires

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.800
[Guest]: you to destroy that lot.

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.800
[Guest]: They don't want to destroy it.

01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:18.440
[Guest]: They want to recall it and take it away from and distribute it in a market that doesn't

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.240
[Guest]: have the stringent regulations.

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:25.240
[Guest]: Knowing that, how can you not do what you're doing, right?

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:29.320
[Amit Varma]: There's a quote in the book, which is a variation on a famous quote about medicine that basically

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.760
[Amit Varma]: every medicine is a poison, but under certain very controlled circumstances, it can solve

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.720
[Amit Varma]: whatever medical problem you have.

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.760
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, that control is important.

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Controlling those conditions, what is the rate of release?

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:43.880
[Amit Varma]: What is the level of the dosage?

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Is it a pure formulation?

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Are there impurities, blah, blah, blah.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the processes in manufacturing matter, like for certain sterile medicines

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:55.960
[Amit Varma]: which are made, if you're in a particular part of the factory, you're actually supposed

01:59:55.960 --> 02:00:00.400
[Amit Varma]: to move very slowly so that the direction of the air doesn't change.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:02.560
[Amit Varma]: These are the kind of processes that matter.

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And here you have people like just flouting it in crazy ways.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Like there's another inspection that part of Iban's book focuses on this FDA investigator

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:16.720
[Amit Varma]: called Peter Baker, who, you know, for a series of years did a number of these inspections

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:21.320
[Amit Varma]: and became hated by the Indian pharma industry, because he always found what they didn't want

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.320
[Amit Varma]: him to find.

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And there's one factory he describes where the security guard was packing the medicines

02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:27.200
[Amit Varma]: with his bare hands.

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:30.480
[Amit Varma]: This is a kind of bullshit that kind of went on.

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:35.760
[Amit Varma]: So all this starts in like 2007, 2008, whatever, around that period.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.560
[Amit Varma]: And the case gets over in 2013.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:41.040
[Amit Varma]: So it's like gone on for five years and all of that.

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And at one level, it would seem that it's finally ended well, to the extent that these

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:52.120
[Amit Varma]: guys, Ranbaxy, agreed that they had committed all of that fraud, that they had fudged the

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.120
[Amit Varma]: data.

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.760
[Amit Varma]: They agreed to all of that.

02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:59.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, a settlement was given, of which you got a chunk, your lawyers got a chunk,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.680
[Amit Varma]: all of that happened.

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:04.560
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you know, one of the things that I found incredibly odd that this

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:11.600
[Amit Varma]: is around the time that, you know, Lipitor went generic, and Ranbaxy had applied to be

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:13.160
[Amit Varma]: first in line.

02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:17.680
[Amit Varma]: And during the FDA, it became a big debate that we know that this is a fraudulent company.

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Do we give them the right to be first in line?

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And there were various incentives, which were marked towards ignoring that and allowing

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Ranbaxy, as eventually happened, they were allowed to manufacture that generic.

02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.200
[Amit Varma]: And there were various incentives.

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Incentive number one is that, you know, US politics wanted it to happen because they

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:39.280
[Amit Varma]: needed generics to come in.

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:44.200
[Amit Varma]: Incentive number two is that the way the law was structured, if they don't give it to Ranbaxy,

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.920
[Amit Varma]: they can't give it to anyone else because Ranbaxy has that sole initial right of making

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:50.920
[Amit Varma]: the generic.

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.240
[Amit Varma]: So, it's all a big mess and eventually they gave it to Ranbaxy, but then the judgment

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:56.780
[Amit Varma]: comes.

02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:02.600
[Amit Varma]: But then what strikes me about the judgment is that fine, it has happened, but fundamentally

02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:04.480
[Amit Varma]: nothing has changed.

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:11.560
[Guest]: See, so, you know, as far as Ranbaxy is concerned, right, it was purely a monetary penalty.

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:16.640
[Guest]: They pled guilty to seven counts of criminal felony, paid a whole boatload of money.

02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.200
[Guest]: It's essentially money that they earned from selling Lipitor, the one that came in the

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.360
[Guest]: left pocket, turned around and gave it back to the government.

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.360
[Amit Varma]: That's exactly what happened.

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the reasons that it was cited internally within the FDA is if we don't give

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:31.720
[Amit Varma]: them the right to give the generic, they won't be able to pay the settlement.

02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:32.720
[Amit Varma]: That's just bizarre logic.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.720
[Guest]: Bizarre logic.

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:34.720
[Guest]: It's very good.

02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:39.000
[Guest]: You think about, you know, dysfunction in the systems, right?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.360
[Guest]: This is purely dysfunction in the system.

02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:47.240
[Guest]: And you're essentially incentivizing a criminal saying that, look, you know what, if you don't

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.240
[Guest]: do this deal, they're not going to be able to pay their penalty.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.200
[Guest]: How perverse is that, right?

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.600
[Guest]: But unfortunately, you know what, bureaucracies and systems all over the world work the same

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.500
[Guest]: way, right?

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:07.400
[Guest]: But the sad part about this whole thing is that there is no individual accountability.

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.520
[Guest]: Company pled guilty, right?

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:13.320
[Guest]: Company actually, you know, admitted that, yes, you know, this is a statement of facts.

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:14.320
[Guest]: This is what we have done.

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.320
[Guest]: We shouldn't have done this.

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.800
[Guest]: You know, we violated these particular statutes and this is because, you know, because of

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.040
[Guest]: this we're pleading guilty and then we're agreeing to pay the penalty.

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.680
[Guest]: No individual accountability.

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.400
[Guest]: Now, people will argue saying that, oh, it's a jurisdiction issue.

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.480
[Guest]: It's a, you know, people overseas, we don't have jurisdiction.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:34.400
[Guest]: I mean, if you have the will to overcome, you can certainly overcome.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.520
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you have the company selling stuff within your own country, right?

02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:42.040
[Guest]: Your, you know, your drug supply is contaminated with this stuff.

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.560
[Guest]: If you want to make an example of it, you could have done that, but it requires will

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.560
[Guest]: to be able to do that.

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.560
[Guest]: And that particular time, because they didn't have, unfortunately, there was no personal

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:52.400
[Guest]: accountability for that.

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:57.480
[Guest]: Having said that, the one good thing that I know has happened is that the Office of

02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:00.120
[Guest]: Inspector General did look at it carefully.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:04.320
[Guest]: They changed a number of regulations governing overseas inspections.

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.080
[Guest]: They brought in a lot more transparency.

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:11.680
[Guest]: They figured out that, you know, while the Ranbaxy case was going on, they set up offices

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:15.440
[Guest]: here in Mumbai and in Delhi as well, which obviously never functioned the way they ought

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.440
[Guest]: to function.

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:21.400
[Guest]: But what I'm saying is that they at least try to address systematic failures within

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.120
[Guest]: their system.

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.800
[Guest]: I just wish that we had done the same thing too.

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.080
[Guest]: I just wish that in Delhi, we would have done the same thing.

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:34.040
[Guest]: We would have accepted the fact that, look, you know what, whatever has happened has happened,

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.040
[Guest]: right?

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:40.120
[Guest]: If you don't want to go back and look backward, that's fine, but at least let's look forward.

02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.920
[Guest]: Let's try and make sure that this doesn't ever happen again.

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:47.680
[Guest]: Let's fix our systems and our processes and make sure that this kind of shenanigans never

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.680
[Guest]: happens.

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:50.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't think that has happened.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and then let's get back to talking about this because

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.360
[Amit Varma]: this might appear to be the end of a story.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:00.720
[Amit Varma]: The hero goes on a quest, the hero wins, the villain is punished, but it's not the end

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.720
[Amit Varma]: of the story.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:02.720
[Amit Varma]: It's not even close.

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:09.120
[Amit Varma]: So we'll come back after the break to discuss all of that.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.280
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it?

02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:13.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:17.920
[Amit Varma]: Over the last year, I've enjoyed teaching my online course, The Art of Clear Writing,

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.340
[Amit Varma]: and an online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:25.420
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:28.180
[Amit Varma]: interaction with much stimulation.

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:32.840
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:35.460
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:40.080
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, and a lovely and lively community at the end

02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:41.080
[Amit Varma]: of it.

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:44.880
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150.

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:48.440
[Amit Varma]: And the October classes begin on the 9th of October.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:53.800
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing.

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.400
[Amit Varma]: That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:01.240
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer does not require God-given talent, just the willingness to work hard

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.560
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:08.240
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the Unseen, I'm chatting with Dinesh Thakur on his long journey

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:18.560
[Amit Varma]: not just about exposing the fraud at Ranbaxy, but a lot more than that, because what that

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:24.040
[Amit Varma]: fraud really uncovered was what are in a sense worst practices within the Indian industry

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:27.360
[Amit Varma]: itself and how that problem remains to be solved.

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Because that case happens, none of the individuals get punished, the company pays the fine, and

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.720
[Amit Varma]: then is bought by Sun Pharma.

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And Iban's book shows how even in the years to come, as Peter Baker, the FDA investigator

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.600
[Amit Varma]: does his inspections and all of that, you know, those those malpractices continue.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you sent me a bunch of links, which are linked from the show notes about

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:54.080
[Amit Varma]: how even now, even up till the current day, companies are basically getting away with

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.600
[Amit Varma]: what they can get away with.

02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:58.360
[Amit Varma]: That's a default approach.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Even if the regulation gets a little better, so they get away with less, they're still

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:05.040
[Amit Varma]: getting away with most of what they're trying to get away with.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:08.080
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of makes it problematic for us.

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:13.120
[Amit Varma]: So like, was there a point where after all this is over, after you know, that decision

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.640
[Amit Varma]: was announced?

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:15.640
[Amit Varma]: What was it like for you?

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.720
[Amit Varma]: Was there a moment of great relief that this crusade is over?

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:24.920
[Amit Varma]: Or was there this sense of like, okay, what now, they solved nothing, there's still work

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:25.920
[Amit Varma]: to be done?

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:30.000
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I mean, I think that, obviously, there was a sense of relief, because, you

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.440
[Guest]: know, clearly, you know, something that you're dealing with for eight long years, at least

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:37.000
[Guest]: sees a milestone of some kind, right?

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.240
[Guest]: So it was a, you know, huge sense of relief.

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:46.120
[Guest]: And you know, it was a chapter closed, you know, if you can say that way.

02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:51.800
[Guest]: But I think what was also important was that, you know, what made me think back was this,

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:55.800
[Guest]: when the news broke, there was a lot of coverage here in India as well.

02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:00.280
[Guest]: Because you know, this was, you know, newsworthy event, there was a lot of coverage.

02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:06.440
[Guest]: And there was a lot of pushback from the sort of experts who kind of, you know, are aware

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:11.640
[Guest]: of what the industry is doing, saying that, you know, oh, this is a whole lot of, you

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:15.920
[Guest]: know, think about nothing, this is all about documentation problem.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:20.600
[Guest]: It's just that, you know, this company did not document the way that, you know, was required

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.600
[Guest]: of the USFDA.

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.020
[Guest]: And that's the reason why they were fined.

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:27.600
[Guest]: If you go back and look at some of the coverage and some of the discussions that actually

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:33.080
[Guest]: happened in around that time in 2013, that was what it was, you know, so just sort of

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:37.400
[Guest]: distract as much as possible and not let it linger, right?

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.920
[Guest]: So the question actually came, you know, to me was, okay, fine, you know, if that's the

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:47.520
[Guest]: approach that you're taking, then the only way to rebut that is to collect data and present

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:52.440
[Guest]: it in a way that kind of, you know, provides a different narrative, the real reality of

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.680
[Guest]: what is really happening.

02:08:54.680 --> 02:09:01.800
[Guest]: So with that in mind, you know, I was introduced to my current colleague on my board right

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:07.560
[Guest]: now, Prashant Reddy, who is intellectual property lawyer, but, you know, has deep knowledge

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.680
[Guest]: of the drug regulation, and the regulatory affairs.

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:16.520
[Guest]: So he and I have been working the last five, seven years right now, we essentially sort

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:22.360
[Guest]: of we set up a project to collect as much data as possible, to try and make our point,

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:27.840
[Guest]: because most of what was admitted by the company in the settlement agreement with the USFDA

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.240
[Guest]: was pertaining to the US market.

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:32.620
[Guest]: There was nothing in there about India, right?

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:39.320
[Guest]: So we spent almost two years, you know, filing RTIs, collecting data, building a case basically

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.920
[Guest]: saying that, look, the problem that we have is our drug regulation.

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:49.520
[Guest]: This regulation that was, you know, sort of established even before we became independent,

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.940
[Guest]: Drugs and Cosmetics Act, it really needs to be overhauled fundamentally, because there's

02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:59.320
[Guest]: some systematic problems with that, like everything else in history, right?

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:03.600
[Guest]: The act is a reflection of what was prevailing at that point in time.

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.680
[Guest]: We had princely states, which essentially were, you know, asserting their independence

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.740
[Guest]: about what they needed to do.

02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:13.800
[Guest]: Most of the issues we were dealing with at that point in time was with import of drugs,

02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.400
[Guest]: because we didn't really make anything, right?

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:20.280
[Guest]: So the act at the center was written primarily to regulate imports, and they gave a free

02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:23.560
[Guest]: hand to various states to do what they needed to do.

02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:28.800
[Guest]: So over a period of time, this, you know, sort of, you know, disjointed system became

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:36.320
[Guest]: so cumbersome that right now that the statutory bodies that exist within this regulation,

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.920
[Guest]: their purpose is not to speak for public health.

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:43.920
[Guest]: They actually exist to try and throw hurdles in progress.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.680
[Guest]: And the only way that you can, you know, address that is to make a fundamental change bottom

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.700
[Guest]: up to this regulation.

02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:55.480
[Guest]: So we collected a whole bunch of data, developed a public interest litigation, went back to

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:58.040
[Guest]: the Supreme Court in 2016.

02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.720
[Guest]: Sadly, the court didn't entertain our petition at that point in time.

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:05.960
[Guest]: So, you know, we continue to do what we need to do.

02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.600
[Guest]: So we have a bunch of cases in various high courts.

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.760
[Guest]: We have one couple of them in Delhi High Court, we have in Karnataka High Court.

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:19.080
[Guest]: Because you know, unless the regulation changes, right, and the regulatory structure changes,

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.520
[Guest]: it's going to be very hard for us to think about, you know, the quality of medicine in

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.520
[Guest]: the country.

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:25.520
[Guest]: Right?

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.800
[Guest]: I think that we are so used to this fact that, you know, we accept the quality that is given

02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:34.520
[Guest]: to us without questioning.

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.840
[Guest]: And we have no data to understand what the long term impact of this is.

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:39.840
[Guest]: Right?

02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:46.480
[Guest]: I mean, today, people are put on anti-hypertensives, and they take it for years on end.

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:51.600
[Guest]: We have no data to actually understand what is a long term consequence of taking poor

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:54.620
[Guest]: quality anti-hypertensives.

02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:55.920
[Guest]: What really happens to people?

02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:57.840
[Guest]: We just don't know.

02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:59.720
[Guest]: I can say that they're bad for you.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:02.040
[Guest]: Somebody else will come and say, no, how do you know it's bad for you?

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.040
[Guest]: We have no data.

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.040
[Guest]: Right?

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:10.080
[Guest]: So unless we have real good scientific data, it is going to be very hard to make an argument

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.580
[Guest]: that look, you know, we need to make some fundamental changes in the way medicine is

02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:15.520
[Guest]: practiced in the country.

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.520
[Guest]: And so that's what we do.

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.640
[Guest]: I mean, even today, you know, most of our efforts are essentially geared toward try

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:27.000
[Guest]: and collecting information to build a case that we really need to look at this area.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:33.740
[Guest]: And you know, I've said this in other places as well, you know, public health in India

02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:37.200
[Guest]: is not about access to qualified doctors.

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.200
[Guest]: We just don't have enough doctors.

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.360
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, I mean, in Mumbai, you do in Delhi, you know, in Gurgaon, we do, but go

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.360
[Guest]: to Western Europe, go to Bihar, you know, go to any Jharkhand, go to Chhattisgarh.

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.360
[Guest]: Our first line of defense is somebody falls sick, they walk up the stairs of the chemist

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.840
[Guest]: shop and says, can you give me some medicine to make this thing go away?

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:56.840
[Guest]: That is our first line of defense.

02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.540
[Guest]: That's our public health right now.

02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:02.600
[Guest]: We have poor ASHA workers who don't even, not even employees, we pay them an honorarium

02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.720
[Guest]: of 2500 rupees a month.

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:10.160
[Guest]: And we ask them to inoculate in newborns and give vaccines.

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:11.560
[Guest]: That is the extent of our public health.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.680
[Guest]: We've seen what has happened in the pandemic, right?

02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:18.560
[Guest]: We've seen what the consequence of our poor investment in public health has been.

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:23.860
[Guest]: So we really need to think holistically about what does it mean, you know, in terms of access

02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:27.600
[Guest]: to medicine and be honest with ourselves.

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.280
[Guest]: Okay, are we okay with this?

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:32.780
[Guest]: Are we okay with an industry that essentially is taking us for a ride?

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:33.980
[Guest]: Are we okay?

02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:37.280
[Guest]: Because you know, we have the ability to buy imported medicine or, you know, we can go

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:41.560
[Guest]: get ourselves treated in Singapore and get a tooth extracted or go to Mount Sinai to

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.720
[Guest]: get our cancer treated.

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:45.640
[Guest]: Is that okay for the rest of the country?

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:48.480
[Guest]: And that is a question I think nobody can answer but yourself.

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.680
[Guest]: At the end of the day, you have to answer it for yourself.

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.780
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of questions, but before that, an observation, you mentioned sort of long

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.240
[Amit Varma]: term effects of say, taking antihypertensive medicine.

02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:04.440
[Amit Varma]: But I think a point that is worth underscoring for the listeners is that there is a seen

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:08.820
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen effect to bad medicine getting out there as well or medicines made in this

02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:10.400
[Amit Varma]: way getting out there as well.

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And the obvious and seen effect, though this is unseen, but at least it's easy to think

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:20.840
[Amit Varma]: of conceptually, that if a medicine isn't made properly, it can number one, not treat

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.740
[Amit Varma]: the patient in the way that it should.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:27.080
[Amit Varma]: And number two, it can have an adverse side effect and it can, you know, kill the patient.

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:32.200
[Amit Varma]: But what it can also do is over a period of time, if you have substandard medicines going

02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:39.960
[Amit Varma]: around, then pathogens gain a chance to actually evolve and mutate and become much worse.

02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And also, what happens is that doctors who are used to generics, not acting properly

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.140
[Amit Varma]: might tend to over prescribe them to compensate for that.

02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And then that can, for example, create antibiotic resistance, you know, which also becomes a

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.120
[Amit Varma]: greater problem later down this line.

02:14:58.120 --> 02:14:59.600
[Guest]: Have I have I stated that correctly?

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:05.720
[Guest]: I mean, we see that, you know, because remember, tuberculosis is still endemic to us, right?

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.040
[Guest]: This is not a disease for wealthy nations.

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.180
[Guest]: This is a disease for us, for, you know, poor countries like us.

02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.440
[Guest]: And look at how tuberculosis is mutated.

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.480
[Guest]: You know, we had an original strain of the bacteria, the pathogen that actually created

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.480
[Guest]: tuberculosis, right?

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:23.040
[Guest]: And then now we have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:26.680
[Guest]: It doesn't respond to the standard care that we used to actually have.

02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.600
[Guest]: And we've gotten to a point right now where we are using super potent, you know, class

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:37.280
[Guest]: of drugs called carbapenems, because none of our standard of care antibiotics actually

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.760
[Guest]: work to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.

02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.940
[Guest]: What is going to happen if they become resistant to that, you know, in the 10 years from now?

02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out that there's a similar trajectory to malaria and dengue and all else

02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:51.120
[Guest]: well.

02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.520
[Amit Varma]: So here's my first question to you that before talking about the work that you do in trying

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.520
[Amit Varma]: to get the regulation up to scratch, if I ask you to define what is wrong with the Indian

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.800
[Amit Varma]: pharma industry today, like we've discussed what Ranbaxy did wrong, right?

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.800
[Amit Varma]: Now what you've pointed out and what Iban's book points out is that those were, at least

02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:14.160
[Amit Varma]: at the time, endemic within the Indian industry in general.

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:21.320
[Amit Varma]: She's mentioned companies like Wachard and Dr. Reddy's and so on, and various other companies.

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.720
[Amit Varma]: Those were endemic then.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I read out that passage of how so much data was invented, falsified.

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.200
[Amit Varma]: There is even this amusing story of when someone in your team was talking processes and they

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.800
[Amit Varma]: said that we'll build a software which gathers together data like this.

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.920
[Amit Varma]: One alarmed person listening to that turned to his boss and said, but how will we backdate

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.760
[Amit Varma]: documents?

02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And I found that hilarious.

02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Has that culture changed or does that culture still exist?

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Is data still being falsified?

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Is a lot of the medicine that we are getting in India still substandard and unreliable?

02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.040
[Guest]: So Amit, again, you know, I cannot make a blanket statement, right?

02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.800
[Guest]: Because I have to back up whatever I say with real examples.

02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.480
[Guest]: I mean, if I make a statement without that, then the industry will come after me, which

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:11.600
[Guest]: is fine.

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.960
[Guest]: But I think it's important to back up whatever you say with data.

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:22.280
[Guest]: The same industry that makes medicines for Indians makes medicine that actually sells

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:24.160
[Guest]: in the United States, right?

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.840
[Guest]: It complies with their regulation.

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:31.280
[Guest]: It makes sure that, you know, when the U.S. FD inspectors come in, yes, I mean, there

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:33.640
[Guest]: are problems, but they're fixing them.

02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.480
[Guest]: They're training their people better.

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:39.360
[Guest]: They're trying to make sure that their equipment is of the standard quality.

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.840
[Guest]: They're making sure that they're cleaning, you know, between making batches of different

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:45.360
[Guest]: products so that, you know, you don't have cross-contamination.

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.320
[Guest]: They're doing all of this right now, but they're doing it for the export market.

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.240
[Guest]: A few hundred yards away from that factory is another factory that makes medicine for

02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:56.240
[Guest]: Indian market.

02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:58.560
[Guest]: They don't even use distilled water.

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:04.120
[Guest]: They use tap water to mix the chemicals in order to, you know, create the product and

02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:05.600
[Guest]: punch tablets in it.

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.080
[Guest]: And you know the quality of the water, the general water that we have right now, the

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.960
[Guest]: microbial contamination that we see.

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.400
[Guest]: Why does this happen, right?

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:20.240
[Guest]: I mean, why is it that even as late as last year, we had documented cases where the U.S.

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:25.360
[Guest]: FDA puts out an inspection report saying, we found when we came to inspect your facilities

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.080
[Guest]: that your people were shredding documents.

02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:28.560
[Guest]: Why do you do that?

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:32.000
[Guest]: If you're doing everything by the book, why are you shredding documents?

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.920
[Guest]: As late as last week, on 16th of September, the U.S. FDA has now for two contract research

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.400
[Guest]: organizations, once in Mumbai and once in Ahmedabad, they've essentially revoked all

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:49.940
[Guest]: approvals gotten from these two contract research organizations because they do not have confidence

02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:51.800
[Guest]: in the clinical data that they are supplied.

02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:52.800
[Guest]: Why does that happen?

02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:53.800
[Guest]: Ranbaxy was 2013, right?

02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:54.800
[Guest]: We are in 2021.

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:58.160
[Guest]: It's eight years now.

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.120
[Guest]: Why do we still have to deal with the Wimta Labs, which was the genesis of the Ranbaxy

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.580
[Guest]: situation, a contract lab that was fabricating data?

02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:07.200
[Guest]: It is happening right now.

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.320
[Guest]: Last week, the U.S. FDA revoked licenses for two different CROs, once in Mumbai and once

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:13.320
[Guest]: in Ahmedabad.

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:17.520
[Guest]: So, it clearly is happening because there's something going really wrong, right?

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.520
[Guest]: Otherwise, why would they do that?

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:25.820
[Guest]: Now, I am yet to find a single instance of a publicly reported inspection report done

02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:34.160
[Guest]: by our regulator that says that we found that documents were being shredded, that patient

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:35.880
[Guest]: data was being fabricated.

02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:38.360
[Guest]: Now, I can interpret it one of two ways.

02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:41.240
[Guest]: I can say, well, never happens, right?

02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:42.920
[Guest]: For India, they follow the book.

02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:45.760
[Guest]: Everything happens great.

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:48.800
[Guest]: Just my experience tells me that's not the case.

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:53.760
[Guest]: So the question that I have to ask myself is that why is it that our regulator cannot

02:19:53.760 --> 02:20:01.240
[Guest]: find these kind of violations that the U.S. FDA finds, that the European Union regulator

02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:02.960
[Amit Varma]: finds, the French inspector finds?

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:04.320
[Amit Varma]: What's the answer to that?

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:06.720
[Guest]: We're just not incentivized properly.

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.920
[Guest]: How do we change that?

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:13.920
[Guest]: First of all, I think that the governing law, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, was written for

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.460
[Guest]: the 1940s.

02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:19.280
[Guest]: It was written when we had a very limited number of drugs and actually lists out the

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:23.200
[Guest]: number of drugs in the appendix of that law, right?

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:27.320
[Guest]: And the kind of diseases we were treating them were essentially infectious diseases,

02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:28.320
[Guest]: right?

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:31.320
[Guest]: We were dealing with typhoid, we were dealing with cholera, we were dealing with malaria

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:32.640
[Guest]: at that point in time.

02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:35.480
[Guest]: Look at the prevalence of diseases today.

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:38.840
[Guest]: Majority of the diseases that we are dealing with right now are lifestyle diseases.

02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:43.040
[Guest]: Diabetes, we are the diabetic capital of the world.

02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:47.440
[Guest]: Hypertension, you know, oncology, cancer-related diseases, right?

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:53.600
[Guest]: So what I'm saying to you is that the premise of the reason why the law was framed has changed

02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:54.600
[Guest]: completely.

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:56.280
[Guest]: Science has changed.

02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:58.480
[Guest]: We have never caught up with it.

02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:01.560
[Guest]: We have never caught up with the situation, right?

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:04.120
[Guest]: It's not like every drug they make is a bad drug.

02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.440
[Guest]: It's not.

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:11.360
[Guest]: Many drugs that are manufactured by Indian pharma companies for the Indian market, because

02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:13.600
[Guest]: the way physiology works are just fine.

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.960
[Guest]: You take an antibiotic, if you have the right dosage, right?

02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:20.240
[Guest]: I'm telling you, if you have the right dosage, that's the biggest issue that we have here.

02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:22.120
[Guest]: We just don't know what the dosage is.

02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:23.400
[Guest]: The antibiotics just work just fine.

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:26.480
[Guest]: So if you have an infection, the antibiotic kills something, you know, the pathogen that's

02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:29.520
[Guest]: causing the infectious diseases in you.

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:34.720
[Guest]: Problem is that if you have anything to do with, you know, psychiatry, anything to do

02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:40.160
[Guest]: with mental health, anything to do with hormonal, you know, treatment, like if you have a thyroid

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:43.960
[Guest]: medication that you're taking, anything to do with, you know, you're in the hospital

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:49.040
[Guest]: and you have an autoimmune disease like lupus, or if you've undergone some kind of organ

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:54.640
[Guest]: transplant surgery, these drugs act in a very narrow band.

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:57.040
[Guest]: You really have to get the right dosage.

02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:02.080
[Guest]: And if you don't have control over the right dosage, unlike antibiotics, we see large and

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:08.840
[Guest]: disproportionate side effects, which our systems are not capable of catching right now.

02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:15.180
[Guest]: So if you don't catch those, if you don't report those, then how can I make an argument

02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:18.560
[Guest]: that things are not working?

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's double click on the bit about how our regulations were designed in 1940, when the

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Act basically came about, how would you change them today?

02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:31.640
[Guest]: So there are a couple of different things that we have to look at in multiple layers,

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:32.640
[Guest]: right?

02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:38.800
[Guest]: Remember, at the time the regulation was framed, health according to Indian constitution is

02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:39.800
[Guest]: a state subject.

02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:42.680
[Guest]: We have heard this many, many times right now during the pandemic, any time you talk

02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:48.440
[Guest]: about central government's response, the response is health is a state subject, go talk to your

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:49.440
[Guest]: state, right?

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:55.800
[Guest]: What has happened is that parliament delegated responsibility for drug regulation to the

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.920
[Guest]: central government.

02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:01.080
[Guest]: Central government turned around and delegated back to the states.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:07.280
[Guest]: Now, you cannot, I mean, legally, an authority that's given to you without the explicit permission

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.640
[Guest]: of the government, of the parliament, you cannot sub delegate.

02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:10.640
[Guest]: That's a major issue.

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:14.160
[Guest]: This was an issue that we were going to contend in the court, unfortunately, didn't go down

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.960
[Guest]: that way, number one.

02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:22.760
[Guest]: Number two, most of the drugs that are manufactured in the various states are governed by state

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.440
[Guest]: drug regulators.

02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:29.920
[Guest]: What happens is that these state drug states actually derive manufacturing license revenue

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.680
[Guest]: from these states.

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:37.480
[Guest]: So why does most of our drug actually gets manufactured in Himachal Pradesh in Baddi?

02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:40.840
[Guest]: Or why does most of our API gets manufactured in Hyderabad?

02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:44.560
[Guest]: It's because we have specific tax incentives that we've enabled these companies to set

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:49.240
[Guest]: up this special economic zones, where they go ahead and manufacture their medicines.

02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:51.920
[Guest]: Now, here is the big issue with us, right?

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:57.480
[Guest]: Because state, healthiest state subject, a drug regulator in Karnataka, right, who finds

02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:02.520
[Guest]: out or Maharashtra, who finds out there is a specific batch made by a specific company,

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:06.680
[Guest]: which is located in Himachal Pradesh, has a product that is not a standard quality,

02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:11.200
[Guest]: which is what we call adulterated drugs in our parlance here.

02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:12.840
[Guest]: What does that person do?

02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.760
[Guest]: There is no jurisdiction for any drug regulator in Maharashtra to go and enforce it.

02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is not hypothetical, this has actually happened here.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.320
[Guest]: This is happening right now.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:31.120
[Guest]: The drug regulator in Maharashtra will find and flag drugs that are not a standard quality.

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.400
[Guest]: But beyond flagging those is nothing.

02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:39.880
[Guest]: The drug regulator in Maharashtra has no jurisdictional control over what is happening in Himachal

02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:40.880
[Guest]: Pradesh.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:44.080
[Guest]: So, what he can do or she can do is write a letter to the Himachal Pradesh drug controller

02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:48.360
[Guest]: and say, we found this batch that is not of standard quality.

02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.120
[Guest]: And that person will, once they get the letter, crumple it and throw it in the basket.

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:57.720
[Guest]: Because for them, the revenue from the licensing is more important.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.680
[Guest]: Incentive there is about generating revenue from the licensing authorities of the manufacturing

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:03.680
[Guest]: facilities.

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:07.440
[Guest]: Now, did we imagine this, you know, when we wrote that?

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:08.720
[Guest]: Obviously not, right?

02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:09.720
[Guest]: Things have changed.

02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:11.760
[Guest]: Another simple example, right?

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:14.640
[Guest]: How we think about quality, right?

02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.440
[Guest]: Quality in the rest of the world is thought about as a part of the process.

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.640
[Guest]: So you build quality by design.

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:23.760
[Guest]: That is our concept of how we think about quality.

02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:27.360
[Guest]: Every step has a measure that you measure quality.

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:30.920
[Guest]: The way that we think about quality in India is the final product.

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:33.340
[Guest]: We don't care about how you manufacture it.

02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:38.720
[Guest]: The way that we think about quality is that every state in the union actually has a state

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:42.160
[Guest]: drug regulatory authority who has a budget.

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:47.800
[Guest]: And it's a pittance, you know, we've kind of done RTI work on this, it's a pittance.

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:53.200
[Guest]: That budget is given to the state drug regulators and say, you go and buy medicines from retail

02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:54.480
[Guest]: outlets.

02:25:54.480 --> 02:26:01.240
[Guest]: And then that samples are then sent to the state drug labs who then analyze that.

02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.480
[Guest]: They tell you which of a standard quality or not.

02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:07.840
[Guest]: Our definition of quality is the end product.

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.560
[Guest]: That's not the process by which.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.560
[Guest]: Why is this important?

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:17.520
[Guest]: The reason it's important is because initial quality and the quality before the drug product

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.120
[Guest]: expires is very different.

02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:24.800
[Guest]: Think about when you buy a car, J.D. Power Associates actually measures the quality of

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:29.880
[Guest]: what they do, say initial quality, not after you've ridden the car around 200 miles and

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:32.080
[Guest]: then come back and check the quality of the car.

02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:35.200
[Guest]: There's a difference between those two, right?

02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.600
[Guest]: Initial quality is very different than what is on the market.

02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.800
[Guest]: Now, when the inspector goes out there and actually sort of buys the product, do you

02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.160
[Guest]: know that you're getting a batch that has recently come into the market?

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.120
[Guest]: Do you know that the batch has been sitting out there for the market for two years right

02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:50.120
[Guest]: now?

02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:51.440
[Guest]: There's no idea.

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:52.440
[Guest]: Number one.

02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.840
[Guest]: Number two, this is the biggest issue that we have in the country.

02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:03.360
[Guest]: When we adjudicate something as not of standard quality, we only look at the active ingredient.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.880
[Guest]: And I'll tell you why this is really important, right?

02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:12.280
[Guest]: So when you think about drug quality, when you make a formulation, when you make a tablet,

02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:17.200
[Guest]: a capsule, a liquid, whatever that you want to make, right, the chemical, the biological

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:21.640
[Guest]: that are actually in there that is active, that treats the ailment that you have is only

02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.640
[Guest]: one part of it.

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.800
[Guest]: There are other things in there that are fillers, right?

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.080
[Guest]: For example, how do you take powder and make it look like a capsule?

02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:31.120
[Guest]: You have to put some binder in it, right?

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:34.600
[Guest]: And then you put a lot of pressure in it to make it look like a tablet.

02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:39.600
[Guest]: How do you take a bitter tasting chemical and make a syrup out of it and make sure the

02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:40.740
[Guest]: kids actually drink it?

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:43.760
[Guest]: Because you add sugar in it, you add sucrose in it, you add some flavoring in it.

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.440
[Guest]: These are all protocol excipients.

02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:51.280
[Guest]: Our testing protocol, as written in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, only looks at the active

02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:52.280
[Guest]: ingredient.

02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:56.120
[Guest]: It does not look at the excipients and what really happens to them.

02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:57.400
[Guest]: Why is this important?

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:03.060
[Guest]: The reason it's important, and this has been very recent, is that there's a class of drugs

02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:04.980
[Guest]: called Sartans.

02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.980
[Guest]: These are essentially prescribed for cardiovascular diseases.

02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:14.680
[Guest]: It has been found that many of the Sartans actually have a small carcinogenic impurity

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.680
[Guest]: called NDMA.

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.720
[Guest]: It's been written up, recently it's been written up as well.

02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:25.200
[Guest]: If you're not looking for impurities to begin with, how the heck are you going to find this?

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.920
[Guest]: You're only measuring for what is the active ingredient.

02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.240
[Guest]: When we adjudicate our drug quality in terms of what we consider good quality drugs, we

02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.680
[Guest]: don't even consider impurities.

02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:41.600
[Guest]: So there are systematic issues of this nature which really have to be thought through.

02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.120
[Guest]: So when the rest of the world looks at impurities, they look at related substances, they say,

02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.840
[Guest]: look, you know, if you have this impurity over a certain threshold, it becomes not of

02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:51.840
[Guest]: standard quality.

02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.400
[Guest]: We don't do that because it's not written in our law.

02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:58.700
[Guest]: So I mean, I'm just giving you certain examples here.

02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:00.560
[Guest]: We really need to take a step back.

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:07.600
[Guest]: We really need to do this and think very carefully about what is it that we want our drug quality

02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:08.600
[Guest]: system to be.

02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:13.860
[Guest]: Because, you know, as a country, we only talk about what the central government spends in

02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:15.840
[Guest]: terms of health, right?

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:17.680
[Guest]: We have some number, 2%, 3%.

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.000
[Guest]: We never account for what our out-of-pocket expenses are.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.560
[Guest]: There is no accounting for that.

02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:28.200
[Guest]: And you know, health care is primarily paid out-of-pocket in the country today.

02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.580
[Guest]: We spend a lot of money on health care.

02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:35.160
[Guest]: Look at the quarterly earnings of all the pharma companies, you'll know exactly what

02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:36.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm talking about.

02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:38.240
[Amit Varma]: So here's the thing.

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.240
[Amit Varma]: We take that step back.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:42.920
[Amit Varma]: I can see that, okay, number one, what needs to be done is that you can't just say it's

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:44.240
[Amit Varma]: a state subject.

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:49.640
[Amit Varma]: You need a central regulatory authority which can then, you know, regulate the entire country.

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So if in Maharashtra you find out that some medicine manufactured in Himachal is a problem,

02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:54.760
[Amit Varma]: you can fix it.

02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:55.760
[Amit Varma]: That's number one.

02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:58.600
[Amit Varma]: Number two, you need to modernize the laws beyond 1943.

02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, you're not just looking at active ingredients, you're looking at expeciency.

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:03.200
[Guest]: Expeciency.

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Impurities.

02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:06.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:07.200
[Amit Varma]: You're looking at all of that.

02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's say you modernize them in every way.

02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:09.840
[Amit Varma]: You just gave one example.

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:15.480
[Amit Varma]: You'll still run into what I will take inspiration from you and call the Toyota Corolla problem,

02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:20.920
[Amit Varma]: where you have described that back in the 2000s when you were at Ranbaxy, there was

02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:25.880
[Amit Varma]: some drug which went to CDSCO, which is the Indian version of the FDA for approval, and

02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:30.840
[Amit Varma]: the Toyota Corolla, a new version of the Toyota Corolla had just come out, and basically those

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:34.920
[Amit Varma]: guys were going to pass it if that Toyota Corolla was given to them.

02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:36.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is regulation in India.

02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:43.500
[Amit Varma]: It is as cultural and essential a part of Indian regulation and Indian law that all

02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:49.360
[Amit Varma]: regulation and law essentially, the purpose of it is not to control some desirable social

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.260
[Amit Varma]: outcome, but for all practical purposes, it's rent-seeking.

02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:55.720
[Amit Varma]: So how would you get past the Toyota Corolla problem?

02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:58.980
[Amit Varma]: Because it seems to me at a deeper level, and we can, of course, go to the root causes

02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.280
[Amit Varma]: of that as well.

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:03.800
[Amit Varma]: But at some level, it's a cultural problem at two levels.

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:08.560
[Amit Varma]: One is it's a cultural problem within companies, within individuals, within society of this

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:13.320
[Amit Varma]: jugaru mindset that I have to comply with X regulation.

02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:18.120
[Amit Varma]: Let me figure out how to game that, irrespective of what the purpose of that regulation might

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:24.920
[Amit Varma]: be, and the other on the part of those who govern us is this rent-seeking mindset that

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:26.880
[Amit Varma]: I have power over people.

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:31.600
[Amit Varma]: How can I use that power for personal profit?

02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:37.280
[Guest]: And when you put these two together, you know, it is a conundrum.

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:38.680
[Guest]: There's no question about it.

02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:43.520
[Guest]: The only way that I have thought about this is you try and make the process as transparent

02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.520
[Guest]: as possible.

02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.520
[Guest]: Right?

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:51.720
[Guest]: So let me give you a simple example, when Covaxin was approved, right, the CDSCO had

02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:57.960
[Guest]: a subject expert committee, which looked at the data and said, you can give it emergency

02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:01.520
[Guest]: authorization, right?

02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:03.560
[Guest]: Same situation happened in the US.

02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:09.200
[Guest]: The US FDA gave emergency authorization to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine.

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.260
[Guest]: Two examples.

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.300
[Guest]: On one hand, the US FDA basically said, here is a list of experts that we are getting.

02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:18.440
[Guest]: We are going to do an open meeting, live streaming.

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:23.220
[Guest]: You can dial in, listen to everybody, what questions they ask.

02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:27.080
[Guest]: You may agree, disagree, but it's a completely transparent process at the end of which they

02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:28.680
[Guest]: will vote.

02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:33.440
[Guest]: And they will make a recommendation to the US FDA, what they should do with this particular,

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:37.640
[Guest]: you know, vaccine candidate that Pfizer has given us.

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:43.600
[Guest]: In our case, not only did we not know who the members of the committee was, we have

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:46.640
[Guest]: no idea what the deliberations were.

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:51.280
[Guest]: The outcome that was put out is basically like a two-sentence thing.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:52.280
[Guest]: It is so opaque.

02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:55.320
[Guest]: Now, why is this a state secret?

02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:56.320
[Guest]: Right?

02:32:56.320 --> 02:33:02.880
[Guest]: Malini Ayesola, who works for ADAN, she had to fight arm, you know, basically in Siddharthan,

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:07.760
[Guest]: they had to fight and to try and get names of people who were actually a member of that

02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:12.720
[Guest]: subject expert committee, took them two months to try and get their names.

02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:15.560
[Guest]: Okay, tell me, why is that a state secret?

02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:19.600
[Guest]: Shouldn't the people in the country know who are these experts and, you know, they're actually

02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.240
[Guest]: making a decision that impacts the rest of the country?

02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:23.880
[Guest]: What data is it that they're looking at?

02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:28.480
[Guest]: US FDA put the portfolio out there and basically said, here are the patients who are enrolled.

02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:31.120
[Guest]: This is how long the study went for.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:33.040
[Guest]: This is what we saw in the clinic.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:38.600
[Guest]: We still do not have a published paper on Covaxin.

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:39.600
[Guest]: We have preprints.

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.840
[Guest]: Now, after, you know, nine months, we have preprints.

02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:46.600
[Guest]: The point I'm trying to make to you is that transparency, I think, is one big thing that

02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:47.600
[Guest]: we need to do.

02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:50.720
[Guest]: Accountability comes in when you make things transparent, right?

02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:56.640
[Guest]: Build it in the regulation that, you know, when you establish an advisory committee,

02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:01.720
[Guest]: the membership of the committee, the documents that they review, their deliberations and

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:06.160
[Guest]: the outcome, whatever recommendation they make, put it on the web within a reasonable

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:09.760
[Guest]: time, day, two days, whatever it takes, you know, for you to be able to do that.

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:11.280
[Guest]: Let people have at it, right?

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:15.360
[Guest]: Why is that a state secret?

02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:17.760
[Guest]: Bring transparency into the process.

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:22.680
[Guest]: I will tell you, like, you know, one of the things that we did, the Parliamentary Standing

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:28.560
[Guest]: Committee in 2013 had identified a set of four different drugs, you know, that they

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:33.720
[Guest]: found there was some hanky-panky going on there and was written in the Parliamentary

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:36.040
[Guest]: Standing Committee report.

02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:39.920
[Guest]: And one of those drugs is a drug called buclizine, okay?

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.560
[Guest]: In India, it's marketed for as an appetite stimulant for children.

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.800
[Guest]: There is zero data for this, zero, none.

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.960
[Guest]: So we essentially sort of, you know, followed through with the drug regulator to tell us,

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.720
[Guest]: you know, on what basis did you approve this?

02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:56.720
[Guest]: Never did, okay?

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:57.720
[Guest]: They never gave us answers.

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:02.680
[Guest]: So we had to go through the RTI process, the Appellate process, the Chief Information Commission

02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.680
[Guest]: process.

02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:10.000
[Guest]: You see, the day before the CIC hearing at 7 o'clock p.m. at night, Prashant gets an unsigned copy

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:17.280
[Guest]: of that report that names three former DCGIs by name saying they're the ones who essentially,

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:20.040
[Guest]: you know, sort of committed fraud.

02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:21.480
[Guest]: It's still not signed.

02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:25.440
[Guest]: And we still don't have the actual sort of the deliberations of what the interviews were

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.480
[Guest]: done by the Mahapatra Committee report.

02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:30.200
[Guest]: We are litigating in the Delhi High Court right now.

02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:32.560
[Guest]: Why this lack of transparency?

02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:38.400
[Guest]: If you're following science, if you're doing your job, make it transparent, yeah?

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:44.120
[Guest]: That drug does not have, it is sold to children as an appetite stimulant, has zero data for

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:45.120
[Guest]: it.

02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:49.240
[Guest]: 15 crores annual turnover for that drug in India today.

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:53.360
[Guest]: It's been two years in Delhi High Court, we are litigating this.

02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:57.940
[Guest]: So Mahapatra Committee was established by Dr. Harshvardhan, was one of the good things

02:35:57.940 --> 02:35:58.940
[Guest]: that he did.

02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:02.560
[Guest]: After the Parliamentary Standing Committee report came out, he instituted a committee

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:05.240
[Guest]: under the leadership of Dr. Mahapatra.

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.760
[Guest]: He did the investigation and he made a report.

02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:13.680
[Guest]: They sat on that report for years and they strung us along for years.

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:18.920
[Guest]: And finally, you know, after going through multiple levels, CIC level, the day before

02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:22.840
[Guest]: they give us a report, unsigned report, and they don't tell us who all they interviewed.

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.120
[Guest]: You want to know?

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:25.440
[Guest]: Why is that a state secret?

02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:31.560
[Guest]: If a company is selling 15 crores worth of stuff to children without any clinical data

02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.080
[Guest]: showed the drug actually works, don't people in this country have a right to know why they're

02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:39.200
[Guest]: doing this?

02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.000
[Guest]: Transparency is really important.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:46.320
[Guest]: We need to bring in, you know, transparency into the process, into the system, so that

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:48.160
[Guest]: people can be held accountable.

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.800
[Guest]: At the end of the day, you know, the CDSCO or the directors there ultimately work for

02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:55.520
[Guest]: people of India.

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:59.000
[Guest]: If they're making decisions that, you know, they're not in the interest of the people

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:02.280
[Guest]: of India, people of India need to know that, right?

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Why hide this kind of stuff?

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:09.200
[Amit Varma]: It just strikes me thinking aloud that maybe one of the things that this needs, it might

02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:14.480
[Amit Varma]: even be an inapt sort of comparison to draw, but it just came to mind that maybe the drug

02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:19.120
[Amit Varma]: industry needs this Nirbhaya moment, where you need a particular case that you can focus

02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:26.600
[Amit Varma]: on and that case can evoke horror and empathy from people all over the place, and then change

02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:27.600
[Amit Varma]: can happen.

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:31.280
[Amit Varma]: And that almost sounds like a horrible thing to say, because you're all, because I'm sure

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:35.160
[Amit Varma]: that there are bad things that happen because of this, not just with this one drug, but

02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.720
[Amit Varma]: so many other drugs, you know, is it then an attribution problem, let's say, there's

02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:44.520
[Amit Varma]: a side effect, someone dies, but you can't attribute it so easily to the medicine, because

02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:48.360
[Amit Varma]: the medicine as it should work would never have caused that side effect.

02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:51.920
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, that all of this kind of goes unseen.

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.400
[Guest]: I mean, I wish, I wish what you had said was true.

02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.560
[Guest]: I'll tell you another anecdote.

02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:08.360
[Guest]: Earlier this year in January, 12 children in Jammu, who consumed cough syrup, succumbed.

02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:14.440
[Guest]: It was causally linked to this cough syrup made by this company called Digital Vision

02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:16.700
[Guest]: based in Himachal.

02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:21.080
[Guest]: They had mistakenly substituted ethylene glycol for diethylene glycol.

02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:26.760
[Guest]: One is an excipient, the other one is antifreeze.

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:32.200
[Guest]: Investigation was done by PGIMER in Chandigarh, qualified people, we're litigating in court

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.480
[Guest]: right now.

02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:37.160
[Guest]: This is the fourth instance in India, fourth.

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:41.320
[Amit Varma]: So, where's the outrage, where are the people writing about it?

02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Like it's…

02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.320
[Guest]: Prabha has written.

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:46.720
[Guest]: The Indian Express, Prabha has written extensively about this, Priyanka has written.

02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:52.840
[Guest]: The point here is that we don't care until it hits home, until it hits, it happens to

02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:56.400
[Guest]: me and my family, there is no outrage.

02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.200
[Guest]: Those 12 children were essentially children of people, of laborers who live below the

02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:01.200
[Guest]: poverty line.

02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:05.880
[Guest]: God forbid, if it happened to somebody who was, you know, in Delhi, in one of the posh

02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:10.700
[Guest]: colonies, a defense colony and our friends colony, you would have seen the outrage.

02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:17.840
[Guest]: It happened to these 12 young kids, whose parents were laborers in Jammu.

02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:23.640
[Guest]: And it's been written, I mean, Priyanka is writing about it, you know, Anu has written

02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:29.280
[Guest]: about it, Prabha has written about it in Indian Express, you did multiple stories on it.

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:36.820
[Guest]: This is something that we think, okay, it's not me who's affected, somebody else is affected.

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.560
[Guest]: This is not the first instance, fourth instance in India.

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.320
[Guest]: Lenton Commission report, this happened in Mumbai.

02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:47.240
[Guest]: We had ethylene glycol poisoning in Mumbai in the 1950s.

02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:52.440
[Guest]: Just as Lenton actually held an open inquiry, open inquiry here and made recommendations

02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:54.560
[Guest]: that now we need to fix it.

02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:57.160
[Guest]: Same stuff happens in Chennai.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:59.440
[Guest]: And now happens in Jammu.

02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:02.520
[Guest]: And happens in Haryana 10 years ago.

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:03.520
[Amit Varma]: Why?

02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I have to confess, I missed all these reports.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.800
[Amit Varma]: So in any of these cases where a causal link has been found, where there's clear malpractice,

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.520
[Guest]: has anything actually ever come out of it?

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:16.600
[Guest]: In cases where, so first of all, our legal justice system is such that, you know, things

02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:17.600
[Amit Varma]: drag on forever.

02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:18.600
[Amit Varma]: Nothing goes anywhere.

02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:23.000
[Guest]: There have been cases when they actually have proven, drug inspectors have proven a causal

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.720
[Guest]: link with something bad that has happened.

02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:29.880
[Guest]: The outcome has been, and I'm not kidding you, these are actual judgments of Indian

02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:31.040
[Guest]: courts.

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:38.920
[Guest]: The punishment was, stand in the court until the court rises.

02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.900
[Amit Varma]: So this is the kindergarten judgment that just keeps standing till the court rises and

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:43.900
[Amit Varma]: then go and that's it.

02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:44.900
[Amit Varma]: That's it.

02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:47.760
[Amit Varma]: People have died and that's it.

02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.080
[Guest]: Argument was an elderly person, he didn't know what he was doing.

02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:58.440
[Guest]: Our IPC has so many holes.

02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.920
[Guest]: I don't even know where to begin.

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:06.480
[Guest]: I've seen judgments that basically after great effort, some drug inspector has gone through

02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:11.760
[Guest]: the, persisted through the entire process, proven that there was malefied intention and

02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:13.920
[Guest]: negligence on the part of the manufacturer.

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:15.080
[Guest]: Guess what the judgment is?

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:18.120
[Guest]: The judgment is, stand until the rising of the court.

02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is even worse than what I expected because I thought that what you'd probably

02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:27.800
[Amit Varma]: get is that even in that rare case, where a company is actually punished, there's no

02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:29.560
[Amit Varma]: systemic change.

02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Some company somewhere is punished, maybe some individual somewhere, there's no systemic

02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:34.600
[Amit Varma]: change.

02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:35.600
[Amit Varma]: This of course is even worse.

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:36.600
[Amit Varma]: They aren't even punished.

02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:37.600
[Amit Varma]: They're made to stand in court.

02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:39.880
[Guest]: But I mean, what message are we sending?

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:46.960
[Guest]: I mean, there are guidelines that are written that the CDSCO has issued that basically says

02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:53.560
[Guest]: it actually advises the court that if you in case adjudicate that there was a problem,

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:59.640
[Guest]: there's something really bad that the manufacturer did, don't impose too harsh a penalty.

02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:05.120
[Guest]: This was written by the regulators quite like, but kidding you.

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:11.280
[Guest]: And they stand and the judges read them and take that into consideration when imposing

02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:14.480
[Guest]: penalties and sentencing.

02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:19.080
[Guest]: How do I justify this?

02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:24.720
[Guest]: Mental Commission Mumbai, seven people died here, Chennai, we had like 12 or 13 people

02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:25.720
[Guest]: died.

02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:28.760
[Guest]: Haryana and Jinn, they had the same situation.

02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:37.320
[Guest]: How is it possible that we continue to mistake an excipient for anti-freeze?

02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:39.280
[Guest]: I don't get this.

02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.000
[Guest]: And there is no accountability, none.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.640
[Amit Varma]: This puts into perspective the kind of environment that you're trying to function in, that you're

02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.640
[Amit Varma]: trying to reform.

02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:53.080
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about what you've been doing the last few years, since that judgment to

02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:54.080
[Guest]: make things happen.

02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:55.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:57.680
[Guest]: So, I mean, the only thing that we can do is collect data, right?

02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:58.680
[Guest]: And argue.

02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:03.680
[Guest]: So, we are in Delhi High Court arguing about transparency, we are in Karnataka High Court

02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:08.240
[Guest]: arguing about bucleusin and this entire situation around that.

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.960
[Guest]: The other thing which is really important, which I think is really important, is that

02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:18.680
[Guest]: we need to now create an environment where I'm not the only person saying this.

02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:21.480
[Guest]: We need the academia to start paying attention to this.

02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:26.840
[Guest]: We need other activists who are invested in public health to start saying this.

02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:30.560
[Guest]: This has been the biggest disappointment for me over the last three or four years.

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:37.840
[Guest]: I just don't find aptitude within our academia here in India to actually do real research.

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:39.080
[Guest]: I just don't find that.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:40.080
[Guest]: I'm sorry to say.

02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:44.400
[Guest]: So, you know, as a part of the foundation, we try and look for people to give grants

02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:47.800
[Guest]: to study public health-related issues.

02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:53.560
[Guest]: It's extremely hard to find people who want to actually do real work, okay?

02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:58.720
[Guest]: I mean, in the academia, you find professors and say, okay, we'll give you a grant, please

02:43:58.720 --> 02:43:59.720
[Guest]: study this area.

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:02.320
[Guest]: I'll give you a very simple example.

02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:07.560
[Guest]: There are tons of studies about effectiveness of the ASHA program, which is essentially

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:13.360
[Guest]: the basis of our public health in the country, in rural India, because, you know, vaccinations

02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:16.080
[Guest]: are run by them, maternal health is run by them.

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:17.920
[Guest]: There are lots and lots of studies.

02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:23.240
[Guest]: There isn't a single study so far of how we deliver public health in urban areas.

02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:25.360
[Guest]: Why is this important?

02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.480
[Guest]: Migration is actually making people move from rural areas to cities like Mumbai, right?

02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:31.920
[Guest]: We have a couple of different models.

02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.240
[Guest]: We have a Mohalla Clinic model in Delhi.

02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:38.120
[Guest]: We have a good model here, and BMC actually runs a reasonably good model.

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:42.920
[Guest]: There is zero academic studies evaluating the effectiveness of this program.

02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:44.960
[Guest]: Isn't this important?

02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:49.920
[Guest]: As a country, should we not pay attention to why, you know, maybe these are great programs,

02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.760
[Guest]: maybe they're doing very well.

02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:55.600
[Guest]: If that is the case, let's replicate them.

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.800
[Guest]: Let's copy what these guys are doing and put them in all the other cities in the country,

02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:05.720
[Guest]: because it's not just Mumbai that has a migration problem, every city in India has a migration

02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:08.280
[Guest]: problem, right?

02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:13.440
[Guest]: And if the model that BMC is running is so great, let's take that model, lift it and

02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:18.800
[Guest]: put it in their cities and tell them, guys, if you do it this way, you get better outcomes.

02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:19.800
[Guest]: Right?

02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:24.100
[Guest]: No, shouldn't we study that?

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.120
[Guest]: Not a single study.

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.360
[Guest]: Why is that?

02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:34.880
[Guest]: I can also say that, look, the problem is funding is also an issue here.

02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:38.880
[Guest]: Getting government to fund these kinds of studies is next to impossible.

02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:44.720
[Guest]: The funding process is so mired in approvals and bureaucracy that you just sit, wait, apply

02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.360
[Guest]: for a grant and wait for years for the government to be able to fund something like this.

02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:52.760
[Guest]: But then, you know, we have to change our mind or change our perspective, right?

02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:56.280
[Guest]: The government says, you know, we're going to take two years to evaluate a proposal.

02:45:56.280 --> 02:45:59.500
[Guest]: Don't make it hard for private funders to fund it.

02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Is it hard for private funders to fund it?

02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Extremely hard.

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:03.560
[Guest]: Because of restrictions on foreign capital?

02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:04.560
[Guest]: Foreign funding, right?

02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:11.960
[Guest]: I mean, there is an organization here in Mumbai that we wanted to support, we wanted to give

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:15.200
[Guest]: a grant to, to study the BMC model.

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:19.160
[Guest]: It's been eight months they're waiting for HMSE approval from the health ministry to

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:20.160
[Amit Varma]: start the funding.

02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:21.800
[Unknown]: And why isn't the approval coming?

02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Who knows?

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:29.160
[Amit Varma]: So they won't solve the problem, they won't let you solve the problem.

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:30.160
[Guest]: What do you do now?

02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:31.160
[Guest]: Right?

02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:32.160
[Guest]: Fine.

02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:33.920
[Guest]: You know, you don't have the means to be able to do it.

02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:34.920
[Guest]: I understand that.

02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:35.920
[Guest]: Okay.

02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:36.920
[Guest]: Maybe, you know, your processes are…

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:40.720
[Guest]: Don't question the intent of people who are trying to do the right thing, right?

02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.880
[Guest]: I mean, you're not saying that we are going to come and dictate what, you know, what you

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:45.880
[Guest]: want to do.

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:49.240
[Guest]: All we're saying is, this is an important thing, let's study it.

02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:53.760
[Guest]: You know, the organization that gets the funds has a free hand to report what they need to

02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:54.760
[Guest]: report.

02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:55.760
[Guest]: It's a good thing.

02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.040
[Guest]: Let's take that into consideration next time you make a budget.

02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:02.240
[Guest]: Replicate this in Nagpur, replicate this in Pune, right?

02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:03.480
[Amit Varma]: And if it's a bad thing, fix it.

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:04.480
[Guest]: Fix it.

02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:05.480
[Guest]: Right?

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:10.660
[Guest]: Why do we have such a huge reluctance in studying our systems, right, documenting with data?

02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:14.480
[Guest]: Why is it so difficult to do this?

02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:17.160
[Guest]: We don't want our NSSO to study economic data.

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.600
[Guest]: We don't want the health ministry to study health data.

02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.240
[Guest]: How are we making policy then?

02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:28.440
[Guest]: These are like, you know, simple things, right?

02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:36.400
[Guest]: Look, Ayushman Bharat is a goldmine because, you know, the program has been running for

02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:37.960
[Guest]: a few years right now.

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:40.760
[Guest]: We know how many people have been enrolled, right?

02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:47.120
[Guest]: Why don't you open up the database to, you know, academic researchers and say, find out

02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:48.600
[Guest]: what is the real benefit?

02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:52.160
[Guest]: How many people have actually claimed the five lakh benefit?

02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.160
[Guest]: Wouldn't you want to know, right?

02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:56.160
[Guest]: Wouldn't you want to?

02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:57.800
[Guest]: This government data, right?

02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:02.200
[Guest]: Happens in the US, the Center for Medicaid Services, every quarter they do a data dump

02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:05.680
[Guest]: and put it out there and say, go knock yourself out.

02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:08.360
[Guest]: Why is this a state secret?

02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.760
[Amit Varma]: So I'll throw back that question at you and change it from a rhetorical question to an

02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:19.520
[Amit Varma]: actual one, and maybe offer possible contender answers, and I'm sure the answer is very complicated.

02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:22.300
[Amit Varma]: But why is it a state secret?

02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:26.280
[Amit Varma]: Why does the state have this attitude like, at one level, it is, of course, inertia at

02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:31.960
[Amit Varma]: one level, it is this reflexive thing of protecting that turf, you know, why let outsiders in,

02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.160
[Amit Varma]: why have to go through that shit, and so on and so forth.

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.680
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, but beyond it being a rhetorical question, what would you say structurally?

02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:41.520
[Guest]: You need people who want to do this.

02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.840
[Guest]: I mean, there's no other way, right?

02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.960
[Guest]: I mean, I worked very closely with Keshav Desi Raju, who just passed away, he was on

02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.520
[Guest]: the board of my foundation.

02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:53.200
[Guest]: We need people like that, very progressive bureaucrat, who wanted to make a change on

02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:54.360
[Guest]: the ground.

02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:58.720
[Amit Varma]: But you know, to me, not a satisfactory answer, because whenever people say we need people,

02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:01.760
[Amit Varma]: we need good people here, or we need good people in politics, or we need good people

02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:06.520
[Amit Varma]: wherever, where I always go back to is that people will come if the incentives are there.

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, to me, that's a core problem.

02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:12.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even going back to the academic thing, if there are things that academics don't want

02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:16.640
[Amit Varma]: to do, the question that I ask is, what are their incentives?

02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Why don't they want to do this?

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, one you've pointed out is that it's very hard to get government funding for

02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.320
[Amit Varma]: these kinds of studies and all of that.

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.320
[Amit Varma]: That's legit.

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:27.240
[Amit Varma]: And equally, even if someone like you is to fund it from outside, it can take months or

02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:30.760
[Amit Varma]: years or never for that to kind of get through.

02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:34.000
[Amit Varma]: But I'm just trying to then solve that deeper.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is, of course, a question that's working at many levels, what are the incentives

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:38.320
[Amit Varma]: of academics?

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.160
[Amit Varma]: What are the incentives of people in the government to stop this?

02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:44.600
[Amit Varma]: We kind of know that the reflexive thing is status quo bias to protect your turf, all

02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:45.600
[Guest]: of that.

02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:46.600
[Guest]: No, no, you're right.

02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:48.320
[Guest]: I think I'm not saying that people are the only solution.

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:51.040
[Guest]: I think that systems have to change as well, right?

02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:56.660
[Guest]: Part of it is also making sure that the way that we think about health is cannot be only

02:49:56.660 --> 02:49:59.440
[Guest]: when we need health care, right?

02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:00.800
[Guest]: That's the way that we normally think.

02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:04.600
[Guest]: We only think about hospitals and health is when we need it.

02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:05.600
[Guest]: Normally we don't, right?

02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:10.640
[Guest]: Tell me the last election where health care was an issue that was actually litigated between

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:12.280
[Guest]: state parties.

02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.080
[Guest]: I can't remember one, right?

02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:18.120
[Guest]: So the point here is that you need to first create awareness.

02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:20.080
[Guest]: You need to first educate people.

02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:24.760
[Guest]: I'll tell you a really interesting episode, I always use this as a really good example

02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:26.040
[Guest]: when I talk to people.

02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:29.480
[Guest]: Atul Gawande had written this piece in The New Yorker.

02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:33.560
[Guest]: And it's an excellent piece, if you maybe should look it from your show notes.

02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:39.040
[Guest]: He basically compared the progression of two different medical procedures.

02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:43.040
[Guest]: One is anesthesia, the other is antiseptic, you know, sort of stuff.

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:49.080
[Guest]: So this takes you back to about early 1800s, you know, when there was no anesthesia.

02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:52.280
[Guest]: I mean, even if you had to do tooth extraction, you really had to do it very quickly because

02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:54.160
[Guest]: it's really painful, right?

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:58.160
[Guest]: So in those days, somebody at Mass General, you know, one of the dentists actually went

02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:03.040
[Guest]: up to the surgeon and basically said, I found something that actually will numb pain down,

02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:04.040
[Guest]: you know.

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:07.360
[Guest]: And obviously, ether was the one that was used to sort of, you know, you get people

02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:12.640
[Guest]: to smell ether and then it knocks you out and you get the tooth extraction, you do your

02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:13.640
[Guest]: surgery.

02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:16.400
[Guest]: But that spread like a wildfire.

02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:22.680
[Guest]: Within a few months, pretty much every hospital began using that as a procedure for essentially

02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:25.320
[Guest]: making sure that, you know, patients don't suffer much, right?

02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:27.960
[Guest]: And then he compares that with antiseptic behavior.

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:34.480
[Guest]: So, you know, there was a time when the scalpels and instruments were not sterilized, right?

02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:38.160
[Guest]: And that was the cause of lupus and septic shock.

02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:39.880
[Guest]: People went into septic shock.

02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:45.040
[Guest]: And he talks about how, you know, Joseph Lister, using carbolic acid basically, you know, came

02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:50.720
[Guest]: up with this concept that if you wash your, you know, instruments and your hands and everything

02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:53.940
[Guest]: else with carbolic acid, you kill the germs essentially from causing.

02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:58.600
[Guest]: But that never took off at the same pace as anesthesia did, right?

02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:04.040
[Guest]: And he compares why, incentives of why, you know, the fact is one is very visible.

02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:09.600
[Guest]: You have a patient who's like shouting really bad because they're under a lot of pain.

02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:11.680
[Guest]: You don't see the germs, right?

02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:14.360
[Guest]: Surgeons don't look at the germs, you know, they don't, you know, they don't think about

02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:19.800
[Guest]: I mean, this is the times when, you know, aprons covered in blood was a mark of, you

02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:22.740
[Guest]: know, that you were doing so many surgeries, right?

02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:24.900
[Guest]: You were a good doctor, you did so many surgeries.

02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:27.600
[Guest]: People don't think about the fact that, you know, you need to change your apron, you need

02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:31.480
[Guest]: to change your gauzes, you need to wash your hands properly before you went into another

02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:32.480
[Guest]: surgery.

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:36.420
[Guest]: Because, you know, if you appeared as somebody with blood on your, you know, your apron,

02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:37.420
[Guest]: you were a really good doctor.

02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:40.080
[Guest]: You had a really good practice and people came to you with that.

02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:41.080
[Guest]: Incentives are very different.

02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:47.960
[Guest]: So what he talks about is that, look, because anesthesia is so visible to people, right?

02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:56.240
[Guest]: The patient is screaming in pain, the adoption is so much faster.

02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:00.600
[Guest]: But it's not like antiseptic behavior was any less effective, it was equally important

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:04.500
[Guest]: because people were dying of septic shock, of the fact that, you know, people were getting

02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:08.680
[Guest]: infected because, you know, you wouldn't have clean procedures and carbolic acid and Joseph

02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:13.160
[Guest]: Lister's work actually proved that if you did that, you'd save a lot of patients.

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:19.160
[Guest]: But because it was not visible, it wasn't adopted as quickly as it did.

02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:20.960
[Guest]: I come back to the same thing.

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.640
[Guest]: Healthcare is, it's not visible.

02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:24.560
[Guest]: We don't think about healthcare.

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:25.880
[Guest]: We don't think about a doctor.

02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:30.040
[Guest]: We don't think about going to a really healthy hospital unless something really bad happens

02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:31.360
[Guest]: to us.

02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:35.720
[Amit Varma]: This is such a fantastic and profound point and along with carbolic acid, there's also

02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:40.900
[Amit Varma]: the resistance that Ignaz Semmelweis found where, you know, when he spoke about the importance

02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:45.520
[Amit Varma]: of just washing hands, washing hands, and it took decades for that to get accepted.

02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And if I remember correctly, Semmelweis died in a lunatic asylum.

02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:54.480
[Amit Varma]: So just a sad state of some kind of pioneers and this whole thing of the seen and the unseen

02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:58.920
[Amit Varma]: that where the effect of something is immediate, your incentives drive you to do it.

02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And if it is unseen, and you know, you mentioned an anesthetic, I remember writing about agriculture

02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:10.040
[Amit Varma]: once, the problems of agriculture and pointing out that sometimes, for example, farm loan

02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:13.800
[Amit Varma]: waivers are a necessary anesthetic because the farmers are in so much pain, you have

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.440
[Amit Varma]: to kind of get it.

02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:18.000
[Amit Varma]: But you're not tackling any of the root causes.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.720
[Amit Varma]: And if you look at what's popular among politicians, tackling the root causes is not because a

02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:25.040
[Amit Varma]: politician has his eyes on the next election.

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.320
[Amit Varma]: And if you solve the fundamental problems, you'll see benefits 15 years down the line

02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:31.320
[Amit Varma]: and they'll never be attributed to you.

02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:32.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.680
[Guest]: Whereas farm loan waivers are immediate.

02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:35.680
[Guest]: And it's almost like…

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:37.720
[Amit Varma]: You recognize that you got a farm loan waiver.

02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.680
[Amit Varma]: And if one not intended, they become almost a hygiene factor now, every politician has

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:42.680
[Guest]: to…

02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:44.640
[Guest]: No, but I mean, that's the thing, right?

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:49.480
[Guest]: I think we need to start this level of awareness among us, right?

02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:51.760
[Guest]: Because at some point in time, right?

02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:56.640
[Guest]: If not me today, 30 years from now, 20 years from now, I'm going to need help, you know,

02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:57.920
[Guest]: medical help.

02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:04.920
[Guest]: But if I wait until that time to try and affect the system, it's going to be too late, right?

02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:09.200
[Guest]: We need to start now and it's not like, you know, whatever we do right now within a year

02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:10.200
[Guest]: is going to burn through.

02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:11.200
[Guest]: It's not going to happen.

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:15.860
[Guest]: This is a systemic, longer term problem that we have to think about.

02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:19.960
[Guest]: And unless this becomes a part of mainstream political dialogue, I'm sorry, this is not

02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:20.960
[Amit Varma]: going to change.

02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Well, what I'm using, and I'm just thinking aloud again, is that at one level, we are

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:33.160
[Amit Varma]: wired to not think of mortality, to assume, to be delusional about our mortality almost.

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.980
[Amit Varma]: We all behave as if we will live forever, right?

02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:41.760
[Amit Varma]: And is our taking health for granted sort of an extension of that, that we assume we

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.760
[Amit Varma]: will never be ill.

02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.000
[Amit Varma]: We assume we will never see the inside of a hospital.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.320
[Guest]: But reality is we all will at some point, right?

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:51.320
[Guest]: Reality is we all will.

02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:55.160
[Guest]: We're just, you know, wired that way that we won't think about the morbid thought of

02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:57.900
[Guest]: us needing, you know, hospitalization.

02:55:57.900 --> 02:56:03.160
[Guest]: But the fact is that, you know, there has to be an academic community that does think

02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:04.520
[Guest]: about this, right?

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:09.840
[Guest]: Because education and healthcare, if you're not going to make public investments in this,

02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:11.240
[Guest]: then the society is going to degrade.

02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:15.080
[Guest]: You know, if you don't educate your people and you don't provide proper healthcare, those

02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:18.000
[Guest]: are the two basic things any administration ought to do.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about the kind of pushback you get from people who matter.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, I would assume that say, for somebody like a Narendra Modi, who obviously

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:30.200
[Amit Varma]: cares about legacy and narrative and all of that, right?

02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:35.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, for me, it would seem sitting here to be such a fantastic narrative that in 2013,

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:37.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, this was what they announced.

02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And then I came and I've cleaned it all up.

02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:43.640
[Amit Varma]: And I have made this actually the, you know, deservedly the pharmacy of the world and all

02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:44.640
[Amit Varma]: of that.

02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:45.640
[Amit Varma]: Why would he not do that?

02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:47.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and you've met ministers trying to explain.

02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:48.880
[Guest]: No, no.

02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:49.880
[Guest]: So I, you know, here's the thing.

02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:51.640
[Guest]: I mean, I've never met.

02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:53.160
[Guest]: So I don't know.

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:57.280
[Guest]: I think part of this is when you are at that level, there are 50 things in front of you.

02:56:57.280 --> 02:56:58.760
[Guest]: This is one of them, right?

02:56:58.760 --> 02:56:59.760
[Guest]: That's number one.

02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:04.040
[Guest]: Whether that registers against perhaps a farmer's protest, I don't know where the priorities

02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:05.040
[Guest]: are, right?

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:07.480
[Guest]: This requires a longer term vision.

02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:11.520
[Guest]: And I've never been able to find somebody in the administration who's willing to give

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.240
[Guest]: me an hour's worth of time.

02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:15.540
[Guest]: We've been talking for several hours right now.

02:57:15.540 --> 02:57:17.120
[Guest]: This is a luxury.

02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:18.340
[Guest]: This is a luxury, right?

02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:20.000
[Guest]: You get 10 minutes.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.160
[Guest]: And in 10 minutes, if you're able to sort of convey the import of what you're trying

02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:29.720
[Guest]: to do to somebody who's distracted, I mean, it happened with Harshvardhan, half the time

02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:30.880
[Amit Varma]: I was looking at the television screen.

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.880
[Amit Varma]: No, you met Harshvardhan as you've described.

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:35.480
[Guest]: I mean, he made me wait outside his office for two hours.

02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:38.200
[Guest]: And then in the 10 minutes that I've been there, he was looking at the TV screen half

02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:39.200
[Guest]: the time.

02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:42.680
[Guest]: And he asked me to write and send me a report, which, you know, I did.

02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:46.240
[Guest]: But the point here is that if that is the attitude you have, then you're not going to

02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:48.240
[Guest]: be able to get anything out of it, right?

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.000
[Guest]: I think maybe the right approach is states are the laboratories of democracy.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.120
[Guest]: Maybe there is a progressive leader in one of the states that believes in the kindness

02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.400
[Guest]: that we're talking about, implements it, shows that the model that, look, we've really made

02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:03.400
[Guest]: a difference.

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:07.240
[Guest]: Because one good thing about health care is that you can measure outcomes very easily.

02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:09.560
[Guest]: You can measure infant mortality.

02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:11.200
[Guest]: You can measure maternal health.

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:13.160
[Guest]: You can measure non-communicable diseases.

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:16.320
[Guest]: You can measure the number of infections, hospitalization.

02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:21.140
[Guest]: This is very, you know, computational-driven, you know, problem, unlike several other things

02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:23.240
[Guest]: which are difficult to measure.

02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:26.400
[Guest]: But it requires you to put some effort into it, right?

02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:27.640
[Guest]: You really have to.

02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:29.440
[Guest]: And this doesn't pay back in eight months.

02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:33.640
[Guest]: It requires a two-year, three-year window where you really – I mean, I would love

02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:39.000
[Guest]: to see a state basically saying that in every district or village that we have, we have

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.160
[Guest]: a properly staffed public health center.

02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:46.400
[Guest]: And I'm not talking about the one that exists on paper, properly staffed, right, with a

02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:51.040
[Guest]: paramedic or a nurse, where the doctor comes in once a week to be able to – that would

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:54.040
[Guest]: be such a huge accomplishment if you're able to do that.

02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'd love to, at some point, get you together with Karthik Muralidharan and do

02:58:58.360 --> 02:58:59.360
[Amit Varma]: a joint episode.

02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:03.320
[Amit Varma]: We've already discussed how our mutual friend Ajay Shah, we'll invite him once and the three

02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:05.320
[Amit Varma]: of us can have a conversation.

02:59:05.320 --> 02:59:06.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's going to be so insightful.

02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:10.400
[Amit Varma]: By the way, the reason I'm giving you so much time and ministers don't give you ten minutes

02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:13.320
[Amit Varma]: – it's all about how important the person is.

02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:17.520
[Amit Varma]: You can gauge the importance of people by how much time they give you.

02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:26.880
[Guest]: Ministers are very important people, podcasters sadly are not so high on the scale of things.

02:59:26.880 --> 02:59:31.120
[Guest]: But I think, you know, your reach, I think, is far greater than what any minister can

02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:32.120
[Guest]: say.

02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:36.620
[Guest]: I mean, the people who listen to your podcast are a select few who really understand the

02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:39.840
[Guest]: importance of, you know, the conversation that is happening.

02:59:39.840 --> 02:59:45.720
[Guest]: And the diversity of topics that you entertain, the guests that you have, and the depth into

02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:47.120
[Guest]: which you explore these things.

02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:50.480
[Guest]: I mean, that's, you know, it's not something that anybody, you know, not everybody can

02:59:50.480 --> 02:59:51.480
[Amit Varma]: pull this thing off.

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:52.480
[Amit Varma]: This is really, really important.

02:59:52.480 --> 02:59:53.480
[Amit Varma]: No, thank you.

02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:54.480
[Amit Varma]: That's very kind of you.

02:59:54.480 --> 02:59:55.480
[Guest]: But I wasn't wishing for a compliment.

02:59:55.480 --> 02:59:56.480
[Guest]: No, no, of course.

02:59:56.480 --> 02:59:57.480
[Guest]: This is reality.

02:59:57.480 --> 02:59:58.480
[Guest]: Because I am one of those.

02:59:58.480 --> 02:59:59.480
[Guest]: I'm one of those.

02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:03.200
[Guest]: Because I do listen to a lot of, you know, what your episodes are and I thoroughly enjoy

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:04.200
[Guest]: it.

03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:07.960
[Guest]: I think that, you know, this is, I always look forward to, because for me it's Monday

03:00:07.960 --> 03:00:11.960
[Guest]: morning there, by the time that your podcast drops, so.

03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:15.000
[Amit Varma]: It's probably Tuesday morning because I shifted release from Sunday to Monday.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.000
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:17.000
[Amit Varma]: It's Tuesday morning.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me something.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:21.480
[Amit Varma]: I've taken enough of your time and now I have to seem important in somehow bringing this

03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:22.480
[Amit Varma]: to a close.

03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:26.080
[Amit Varma]: But no, I've taken a lot of your time and you've also been kind with so much of your

03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:27.080
[Amit Varma]: time.

03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Going forward, when you sort of map out what you want to do, like I presume at one point

03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:37.200
[Amit Varma]: when you were younger, you were driven by whatever was imperative at that point in time.

03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Maybe you come to Renbeck C and it's like, oh, we'll do these innovative things in this

03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:44.960
[Amit Varma]: new market and build a market leader and whatever.

03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:49.680
[Amit Varma]: But obviously the direction that your life took, partly due to circumstances outside

03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:53.960
[Amit Varma]: your control, have taken you into a very different place.

03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:59.360
[Amit Varma]: So one is there sometimes a sense that something is lost there, that a career that you could

03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:04.960
[Amit Varma]: have had and a body of work that you could have built has just gone with the years.

03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: And two, and I frankly think what you're doing is incredibly more important than anything

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.720
[Amit Varma]: else could have, any counterfactual could have been.

03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:18.680
[Amit Varma]: But going forward, over the next 10, 15 years, how have you planned out, you know, how have

03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you looked at what you want to do in those years to come?

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.920
[Guest]: So I think the first question, it's an easy question.

03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:28.640
[Guest]: I honestly am not enamored of a career.

03:01:28.640 --> 03:01:36.480
[Guest]: You know, so for better or for worse, I think that I've always had the satisfaction, you

03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:41.680
[Guest]: know, in my limited corporate career, that I think that I've achieved a few things.

03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:47.200
[Guest]: I mean, they may not be all that great, but, you know, I'm quite happy with that part of

03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:48.200
[Guest]: it.

03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:51.480
[Guest]: And I don't miss, I mean, the one thing that I certainly don't miss is managing people.

03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:55.360
[Guest]: I just, being very honest with you, I don't have the patience.

03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:00.120
[Guest]: I did once, I mean, when I left Phyphormix, there were 600 people.

03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:01.640
[Guest]: I don't miss managing people.

03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:07.400
[Guest]: I think it requires a certain aptitude and test that I just don't have anymore.

03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:11.440
[Guest]: So I'm very happy with, you know, just being an individual contributor at this point in

03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:12.560
[Guest]: time.

03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:15.840
[Guest]: The second question, I think, is a more important question.

03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:22.600
[Guest]: I think that, you know, when I look in another 10 years down the road, if I think India has

03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:30.040
[Guest]: a drug regulatory system that is on par with what the European Union has and the US FDA,

03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:36.120
[Guest]: US does, I'd be the most happiest person, you know, in terms of the competence of the

03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:42.040
[Guest]: people that we have, in terms of the processes that we execute, and in terms of the responsiveness

03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.960
[Guest]: to the people of the country, right?

03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:51.080
[Guest]: If we get to that point in the next 10 years, no one would be more happier than I.

03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And how possible do you think that is?

03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:56.360
[Guest]: That is not in my control, right?

03:02:56.360 --> 03:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: That is not...

03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:59.840
[Amit Varma]: But if you had to, like, think of probabilities...

03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:08.060
[Guest]: I think that there is a more than 50% probability that it will happen, and I'll tell you why.

03:03:08.060 --> 03:03:14.600
[Guest]: One of the things that, you know, both Prashant and I and other people who are with my foundation

03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:20.560
[Guest]: are doing is making substantial investments in creating awareness.

03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:25.480
[Guest]: And we're hoping that over a period of time, that percolates down in the society, in the

03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:26.480
[Guest]: system.

03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:30.640
[Guest]: So just a simple thing that we're doing is that, you know, we have a project where we

03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:31.640
[Guest]: have now...

03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:36.440
[Guest]: We've come halfway, the other half is beginning, starting right now, where we've commissioned

03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:42.600
[Guest]: a bunch of people to write down the history of how we evolved, how our public health system

03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:44.080
[Guest]: has evolved.

03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:47.520
[Guest]: It's an 18-episode series, one hour each.

03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:51.520
[Guest]: And, you know, so the script is done, the research is done, and now we are in the process

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:56.520
[Guest]: of working with a media partner to commission the production of that.

03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:02.960
[Guest]: And the goal is to try and dump it down to a point where a common person should understand

03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:09.120
[Guest]: that, you know, if there is a pandemic that comes next time, right?

03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:15.180
[Guest]: That there are systems and institutions in this country whose job is it to respond.

03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:19.720
[Guest]: And if they're not included in that response, we have to ask why.

03:04:19.720 --> 03:04:24.040
[Guest]: Like I'll give you a very simple example this time.

03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:32.720
[Guest]: Why is it that when the pandemic broke, we had people from ICMR speaking to the country?

03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:36.400
[Guest]: ICMR is a research institution.

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:39.040
[Guest]: We have an institution called NCDC, right?

03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:41.180
[Guest]: National Center for Disease Control.

03:04:41.180 --> 03:04:45.040
[Guest]: That is the one that actually does the work in terms of pandemic response.

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.480
[Guest]: That is the one that does surveillance, right?

03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:53.160
[Guest]: Why is it that the NCDC did not play a larger role in developing a pandemic response?

03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:58.400
[Guest]: Why is it that we have celebrity doctors, one of whom is a pediatrician, not a virologist,

03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:02.680
[Guest]: not an epidemiologist, the other one is a cardiovascular surgeon?

03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:06.380
[Guest]: What do you know about epidemiology?

03:05:06.380 --> 03:05:07.880
[Guest]: What do you know about pandemic response?

03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:09.760
[Guest]: What do you know about public health?

03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:17.320
[Guest]: Why do you undercut institutions that you've set up on your own, right?

03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:21.960
[Guest]: Next time if we ever happen to be in a situation like this, the layperson should have this

03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:28.960
[Guest]: understanding to say, you know what, my taxpayer money is going into funding NCDC in the country,

03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:33.720
[Guest]: whose job is to look for outbreaks, whose job is to develop a pandemic response, whose

03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:37.720
[Guest]: job is to figure out how do we inoculate and vaccinate people.

03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:44.880
[Guest]: Yes, the ICMR people and the AIMS people can certainly be contributors to this, but we

03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:49.700
[Guest]: need people qualified from a pandemic response point of view, right?

03:05:49.700 --> 03:05:56.400
[Guest]: Why did we choose a vaccine candidate that requires BL-3 or BL-4 facilities, the highest

03:05:56.400 --> 03:06:00.800
[Guest]: class, because we are using inactivated virus to make a vaccine, right?

03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:08.680
[Guest]: Most of the world was using virus-derived vector-borne, if you look at COVID shield or mRNA vaccines.

03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:14.000
[Guest]: We chose the most complex process to make our vaccine, and then we wonder why it wasn't

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.800
[Guest]: scaling up.

03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:19.720
[Guest]: Who made that decision, right?

03:06:19.720 --> 03:06:25.000
[Guest]: And if you don't include people from NCDC who are qualified to be able to look at this,

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:29.040
[Guest]: then can we really find fault with them?

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:35.980
[Guest]: Why is it that there is no medical malpractice law in the country?

03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:38.480
[Guest]: Why doesn't it really happen, right?

03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:43.160
[Guest]: I'm not advocating for it, but the fact is that how many times have you really heard

03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:46.720
[Guest]: somebody who's been wronged actually litigated in a court?

03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:50.520
[Guest]: I mean, you say go to consumer courts, yeah, you go to consumer courts, get a resolution

03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:53.360
[Guest]: in two years, I'll tell you, right?

03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:57.880
[Guest]: There are some systemic issues we have, and I really think that we need to have a conversation

03:06:57.880 --> 03:06:58.880
[Guest]: about this.

03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:00.440
[Guest]: I don't have a solution.

03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:02.880
[Guest]: I don't think that anybody that I know has a solution.

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:07.160
[Guest]: But I think it's important to have a conversation, talk about it, right?

03:07:07.160 --> 03:07:10.240
[Guest]: So that people understand that, you know what, there is a solution to this.

03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:15.320
[Guest]: It's just that we're not doing it, but there is a solution to this.

03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:20.320
[Guest]: And if I'm so inclined to lend my voice, perhaps something will happen.

03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:21.320
[Amit Varma]: This series sounds fascinating.

03:07:21.320 --> 03:07:25.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I can see you fighting an information war on two fronts, right?

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:31.040
[Amit Varma]: At one level, you build up that awareness of what the system is like in the mind of

03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:35.800
[Amit Varma]: the citizen, the taxpayer, so that they know what, and everybody's a taxpayer, so that

03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:39.800
[Amit Varma]: they know, so that background of information and that context is there.

03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:44.240
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you're working on building data about things that happen now, things

03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:46.320
[Amit Varma]: that happen around us all the time.

03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:52.240
[Amit Varma]: So we can respond with the adequate outrage to things that should drive us to outrage.

03:07:52.240 --> 03:07:57.480
[Amit Varma]: If someone listening to this is asking a question, what can I do?

03:07:57.480 --> 03:08:01.160
[Amit Varma]: And this is a question at two levels, like at one level is like yesterday during dinner,

03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:05.680
[Amit Varma]: I asked you that as an individual consumer, when I go out to buy medicine, what can I

03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:06.680
[Amit Varma]: do?

03:08:06.680 --> 03:08:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Is there something I should avoid?

03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:09.800
[Amit Varma]: Is there something I should look for?

03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And so on.

03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:11.880
[Amit Varma]: That's one level.

03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:14.320
[Amit Varma]: And the second level is, what can I do for the larger cause?

03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Like what one of the laments that you've just sort of mentioned is that there are not enough

03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:23.320
[Amit Varma]: people who are active in fighting for this cause.

03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:27.560
[Amit Varma]: And in that sense, I guess, you know, it's been a lonely battle for you.

03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:31.120
[Guest]: No, I think, you know, there are people, but they're not enough of us, right?

03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:34.980
[Guest]: Anything requires a critical mass awareness, I mean, like what you're doing right now,

03:08:34.980 --> 03:08:36.360
[Guest]: this is your contribution, right?

03:08:36.360 --> 03:08:42.440
[Guest]: You are essentially informing your audience about an issue where, you know, this perhaps

03:08:42.440 --> 03:08:45.040
[Guest]: wouldn't have registered on people's radar, right?

03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.040
[Guest]: This is a huge public service, right?

03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:52.080
[Guest]: Likewise, I think the people who are listening, take a moment to read up, right?

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:57.720
[Guest]: Take a moment to just inform yourself above and beyond the normal television debates that

03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:03.080
[Guest]: we see about how public health works in our country, right?

03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:05.320
[Guest]: What institutions are there?

03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:10.480
[Guest]: How does states, you know, sort of regulate healthcare versus the center does, right?

03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:17.120
[Guest]: How does our regulatory system respond to issues of, you know, what we actually, you

03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:21.440
[Guest]: know, face, like, you know, emergency-related issues, like pandemics come our way.

03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:24.040
[Guest]: We still have endemic tropical diseases, right?

03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:28.320
[Guest]: No pharma company is going to develop a cure for sickle cell anemia because there's not

03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:29.880
[Guest]: enough of a market for them.

03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:35.000
[Guest]: They are not going to develop, you know, novel therapeutics for cholera, for example, or

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:36.400
[Guest]: typhoid, or for malaria.

03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:40.760
[Guest]: I mean, malaria, at least there's some vaccination work happening in that we have a vaccine candidate

03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:41.760
[Guest]: for malaria.

03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:47.040
[Guest]: What I'm saying is that, you know, there are things that are endemic to us, right?

03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:53.340
[Guest]: Pharma companies will only do it if they see dollars, big tons of money behind it, right?

03:09:53.340 --> 03:09:58.040
[Guest]: Those big pharma companies are not going to develop solutions for us.

03:09:58.040 --> 03:09:59.040
[Guest]: Inform ourselves, right?

03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:00.040
[Guest]: Ask these questions, right?

03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:04.840
[Guest]: I mean, it's great that, you know, our pharma companies are earning a lot of money by manufacturing

03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:07.200
[Guest]: all of this stuff for the Western markets.

03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:11.040
[Guest]: Why can't, you know, you hold them to the same standard when you make drugs for the

03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:13.180
[Guest]: local market here, right?

03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:17.360
[Guest]: The argument that I always get is, oh, it's, you know, price points in India are very,

03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:20.760
[Guest]: very, very tight here because you can't make the same amount of bullshit.

03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:25.120
[Guest]: I've actually shown that the price points are actually very similar in India compared

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:31.240
[Guest]: to what, you know, they get paid by the government-negotiated insurance companies over there.

03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:32.600
[Guest]: Very similar price points here.

03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:36.920
[Guest]: See, what happens is that if we don't know enough, right, we accept a lot of what somebody

03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:37.920
[Guest]: says.

03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:40.480
[Guest]: Don't take what I'm saying, you know, as gospel read up.

03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:43.840
[Guest]: There's tons of information available out there.

03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:46.920
[Guest]: You don't, I don't need medicine right now, but my parents do.

03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:51.880
[Guest]: How much medicine can I buy from them from the US and bring to India every time I come

03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:52.880
[Guest]: here?

03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:53.880
[Guest]: I can't do that, right?

03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:57.200
[Guest]: I have to make sure that our medicine gets better here.

03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:02.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, the more kind of frivolous of those questions at an individual level, you know,

03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:03.720
[Amit Varma]: what can we do?

03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, when I go to a pharmacy for whatever, what do I need to watch out for?

03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Are there companies I need to avoid?

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:13.000
[Guest]: No, I mean, by and large, I think that the larger companies usually, you know, they should

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:17.040
[Guest]: make good drugs, right, because the reputational damage for them from bad kind of stuff is

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:18.040
[Guest]: really bad.

03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:22.160
[Guest]: They don't want, you know, something get reported that the drug that they made actually caused

03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:23.480
[Guest]: harm to people.

03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:24.960
[Guest]: By and large, that's true.

03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:31.600
[Guest]: The issue is more, I think, what we need to do is to put some pressure on the, our administration

03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:36.520
[Guest]: to say that provide us a mechanism to report when things don't go right, right?

03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:40.400
[Guest]: When, you know, like, you know, when you've taken a vaccine and you see adverse events,

03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:45.040
[Guest]: you know, a couple of days later, you see, you know, a sore arm or you develop a rash,

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:47.120
[Guest]: they encourage you to report that right now, right?

03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:49.360
[Guest]: Why don't we do the same thing for medicine?

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:50.360
[Guest]: We should do that, right?

03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:54.520
[Guest]: I mean, the government has set up a National Pharmacovigilance Center in order to collect

03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:55.520
[Guest]: this data.

03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:56.520
[Guest]: But we don't talk about it.

03:11:56.520 --> 03:11:57.520
[Guest]: We don't.

03:11:57.520 --> 03:11:59.800
[Guest]: There's no public service announcement saying, okay, if your medicine doesn't work.

03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:03.320
[Guest]: I mean, nine or ten times what happens if the medicine doesn't do what it's supposed

03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:06.240
[Guest]: to do, you go back to the doctor and doctor says, we'll change your prescription.

03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:09.760
[Guest]: We'll find, give you another different, you know, different medicine or the one from a

03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:11.160
[Guest]: different manufacturer.

03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:12.160
[Guest]: That's the end of it.

03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:16.520
[Guest]: Well, if you don't report, then I can't really complain about data, can I?

03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:17.520
[Amit Varma]: No.

03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:22.720
[Amit Varma]: And if all this data in a frictionless way was just being collected, then over time,

03:12:22.720 --> 03:12:27.320
[Amit Varma]: you'd just be able to, you know, figure out problems before they sort of take lives.

03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:31.480
[Guest]: So I mean, these are things that we can do at our own individual level, which we have

03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:32.480
[Guest]: to.

03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:35.120
[Guest]: Otherwise, this is not going to change, right?

03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:40.520
[Guest]: There are significant vested interests that create inertia in any kind of progress that

03:12:40.520 --> 03:12:44.320
[Guest]: you want to make in this space, and unfortunately, it's a reality.

03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, Dinesh, thanks so much for coming on the show, sharing your time and insights.

03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:55.040
[Amit Varma]: It's been, you know, I'm going to sort of listen to this episode again and kind of process

03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:57.920
[Amit Varma]: a lot of what you said, because I just think it's incredibly important.

03:12:57.920 --> 03:12:58.920
[Guest]: So thank you.

03:12:58.920 --> 03:12:59.920
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

03:12:59.920 --> 03:13:01.720
[Guest]: This has been, you know, an absolute pleasure.

03:13:01.720 --> 03:13:06.360
[Guest]: And I have to tell you that I've been the beneficiary of a lot of your conversations,

03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:11.920
[Guest]: you know, when I go for a run or a walk, you know, you know, where I am, a lot of times

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:15.680
[Guest]: I've learned so much from, you know, all the guests that you invite, the conversations

03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.600
[Guest]: that you have, and it's been an incredible honor to be here.

03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:24.840
[Amit Varma]: If you like this episode, do check out the links in the show notes for more, and also

03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:47.320
[Amit Varma]: during this episode.

03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:49.440
