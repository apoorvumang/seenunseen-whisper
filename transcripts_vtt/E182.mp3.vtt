00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
[Amit Varma]: We are born communicating with other people, so you'd think communication would be easy

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.280
[Amit Varma]: and intuitive for us, right?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Our first cry on this earth, in fact, is a form of communication.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.680
[Amit Varma]: And we go through our lives as social animals, learning by interacting with others.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.880
[Amit Varma]: And yet, so often, whatever else we succeed at, we fail at communicating.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.440
[Amit Varma]: And this failure harms every area of our lives, from our relationships to our careers to our

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.400
[Amit Varma]: own intellectual growth.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.640
[Amit Varma]: I got a sense of the importance of communication in general, and conversations in particular,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: when I started The Seen and The Unseen.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.200
[Amit Varma]: As I learned the craft, one of the rules I drew for myself was that I had to listen more

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400
[Amit Varma]: than talk, actually pay attention to the people I was speaking with, and keep my own sense

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.960
[Amit Varma]: of ego out of the conversation.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
[Amit Varma]: Good conversation isn't about showing off how much you know, how smart you are, or even

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.680
[Amit Varma]: winning an argument.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.400
[Amit Varma]: The interesting thing is that there are so few interview shows around that actually share

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.880
[Amit Varma]: this philosophy.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Interview shows, especially on TV, are often full of hosts interrupting their guests all

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.480
[Amit Varma]: the time, which makes for choppy, shallow conversation.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And their main purpose often isn't to gain insight from the guest, but to catch them

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.960
[Amit Varma]: in a gotcha moment, so they can show off their own superior intellect.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.600
[Amit Varma]: This is both rude and toxic.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.760
[Amit Varma]: Every single person on this planet knows something that we don't.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Every conversation gives us a chance to expand our universe.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.080
[Amit Varma]: And that is why, when we are in a conversation, our focus should not be on how we talk, but

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080
[Amit Varma]: on how we listen.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.160
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.760
[Amit Varma]: I've been thinking for months that I should ask Russ Roberts on my show, but I hesitated

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.960
[Amit Varma]: because it felt almost audacious.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Russ is the ultimate master of what I try to do, have deep conversations with people

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.480
[Amit Varma]: that expand our brains and our sense of the world.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.240
[Amit Varma]: His podcast, Econ Talk, began in 2006, and he has had more than 700 amazing conversations

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.480
[Amit Varma]: on it since then.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.640
[Amit Varma]: It's a marvelous show that's, over the years, not only given me great insights on economics

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.520
[Amit Varma]: and politics, but has also shown me the craft of how to have a conversation.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Besides being the original podcaster, Russ has also been an economics educator.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.200
[Amit Varma]: I first came across him a decade and a half ago through Cafe Hayek, the brilliant blog

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.940
[Amit Varma]: he co-wrote with Don Boudreau.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.900
[Amit Varma]: He has written a bunch of brilliant books as well, and has been a guiding light to generations

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.440
[Amit Varma]: of people learning about economics and the world around us.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: So I finally gathered up the courage to invite him on my show and was delighted when he agreed.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.240
[Amit Varma]: What you're about to hear now is a wide ranging conversation across subjects.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.760
[Amit Varma]: The art of conversation, the nature of morality, our changing political discourse, and yes,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.960
[Amit Varma]: some economics as well.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.240
[Amit Varma]: I've had trouble thinking of a title for this episode, in fact, because we covered so much

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240
[Amit Varma]: ground.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.980
[Amit Varma]: This was one of the conversations that I have most enjoyed on The Seen and The Unseen.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.200
[Amit Varma]: But before we get started, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Hi, I'm Vivek Kaul.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'm Amit Verma, here to tell you about a new weekly podcast that Vivek and I have

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720
[Amit Varma]: launched called Econ Central.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.680
[Unknown]: In Econ Central, we will help you make sense of the economic news of the last week.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.520
[Unknown]: And we'll also try to explain complex subjects in a simple language.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.520
[Amit Varma]: We will also take events outside the world of economics, like from politics, sports,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.920
[Amit Varma]: literature, and explain them through the lens of economic thinking.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.600
[Unknown]: Why is the stock market going up when the economy is going down?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.920
[Unknown]: What's the deal with high petrol prices?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.880
[Amit Varma]: Should we boycott Chinese goods?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.680
[Amit Varma]: What does free speech have to do with incentives?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.520
[Amit Varma]: Why are the roving bandits of Uttar Pradesh in competition with the biggest protection

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.040
[Unknown]: racket out there, the Indian state?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.880
[Unknown]: All this and more in our new weekly podcast, Econ Central.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.960
[Amit Varma]: Econ Central launched a few weeks ago, and is free on all podcast apps, you can browse

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.400
[Amit Varma]: our archives at econcentral.in.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.160
[Unknown]: Econ Central, you have an incentive to listen.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.600
[Amit Varma]: Don't forget the URL, econcentral.in.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.440
[Amit Varma]: Russ, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440
[Guest]: Great to be with you, Amit.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.360
[Amit Varma]: Russ, it's a great pleasure to have you on the show because not only are you, you know,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.880
[Amit Varma]: the writers I used to read very seriously a decade and a half ago, for your insights

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200
[Amit Varma]: on economics, but you're also one of the early podcasters.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.440
[Amit Varma]: In fact, so early that at that time, I didn't really take podcasting very seriously.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.080
[Amit Varma]: But yours, Econ Talk was the one podcast, which, you know, just captivated me for the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.080
[Amit Varma]: incredible range of guests and conversations that you've had.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've done more than 700 episodes of that, which is, you know, I've just done like

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.360
[Amit Varma]: this is episode 182.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.080
[Amit Varma]: So it sounds a bit daunting.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.600
[Amit Varma]: I want to take you a bit further back and sort of ask you about your intellectual journey

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.800
[Amit Varma]: from the time you kind of started and became a student and got interested in economics.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Why economics and sort of who shaped your views of the world, who were the thinkers

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000
[Guest]: who influenced you and so on.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.440
[Guest]: So we could go as deep as you want.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.720
[Guest]: You'll steer me maybe and give me some suggestions on where you want to head with that.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.200
[Guest]: But the simple starting point is that I was good at economics.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.200
[Guest]: I enjoyed it.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.720
[Guest]: I saw it as a puzzle to be solved the way that the theory fit together of consumers

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.680
[Guest]: and producers yielding prices and quantities in the marketplace.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.640
[Guest]: I found that kind of beautiful and satisfying intellectually.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.760
[Guest]: And then I saw that it was a way to think about how to make the world better.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.960
[Guest]: A vision that I've now become much more skeptical of, but when I was younger, it appealed to

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.840
[Guest]: me deeply, this idea that we can help make people's lives better through economic policy.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.800
[Guest]: We can improve certain policies, get rid of others, add new ones.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.960
[Guest]: And in theory, encourage opportunities for people to grow financially as well as in other

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960
[Guest]: ways.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.360
[Guest]: I saw it as a way to think about what kind of country and where we want to live in in

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.280
[Guest]: terms of structure, capitalism versus socialism, free markets versus command and control.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.840
[Guest]: So all of that was very captivating to me.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.720
[Guest]: And the intellectual influences in those early days, I was much more libertarian, I think,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720
[Guest]: than I am now.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.000
[Guest]: I'm still pretty libertarian, but I was more of an ideologue than I am now.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.240
[Guest]: I was very influenced by Milton Friedman, Robert Nozick.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.280
[Guest]: Those are the two, I would say, big influences of my youngest, and Ayn Rand, who I'm not

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.480
[Guest]: as nearly as fond of now as I was when I was a teenager.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.360
[Guest]: But those are people that got me interested in this idea of liberty, of freedom, and particularly

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.680
[Guest]: of economic policy that would allow that freedom.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.600
[Guest]: And that was, you know, I went off to graduate school and found a new set of mentors and

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.200
[Guest]: intellectual mentors, people like Gary Becker, Deirdre McCloskey, George Stigler, Sam Peltzman.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.960
[Guest]: These are people who affected how I viewed economics, how I viewed politics.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:34.480
[Guest]: And then, interestingly for me, maybe of interest to you, but in 2003, I joined the faculty

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.080
[Guest]: George Mason.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.280
[Guest]: And at that point, I started getting very interested in the ideas of Hayek, the great

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.760
[Guest]: Austrian economist, Nobel laureate.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.760
[Guest]: And I spent a lot of the next years thinking about the idea of emergent order, the idea

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest]: of complexity, and how individual choices get magnified and aggregated into outcomes.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.240
[Guest]: And that was another big influence, you know, people like Don Boudreau there, I learned

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.960
[Guest]: an immense amount from him about economics that I just hadn't thought about enough in

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.040
[Guest]: different ways.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.440
[Guest]: And I had many, many colleagues there who influenced me.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:24.600
[Guest]: But the real change was that in 2006, as you pointed out, back in the Pleistocene era,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.400
[Guest]: I started EconTalk.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest]: And originally, EconTalk was me talking for an hour with an economist who either I knew

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.120
[Guest]: or I could talk into coming on the program in the early days.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.480
[Guest]: As you know, when you're getting started, it's a little challenging, and if you build

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.320
[Guest]: up a guest list, it gets easier.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.440
[Guest]: And I started to talk to my, you know, former professors and other people who were doing

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.120
[Guest]: interesting work.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:59.840
[Guest]: And that forced an immense broadening of my horizons, first to be aware of the fallibility

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.120
[Guest]: of my viewpoint.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.480
[Guest]: I didn't turn against my viewpoint, but I realized that the viewpoint that I had, I

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: realized that a lot of the reasons that I thought it was the right way to think about

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.160
[Guest]: the world weren't really the reasons that I adopted that viewpoint.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.160
[Guest]: I assumed, you know, I just assumed I had all the best studies, all the right studies,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160
[Guest]: all the good facts.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.120
[Guest]: The other side, they were just wrong.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.200
[Guest]: And at some point, probably after interviewing Robert Frank, who looks at the world differently

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.320
[Guest]: than I do, and other people, I started to realize that, you know, this sounds kind of

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
[Guest]: – this is embarrassing.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.360
[Guest]: It sounds kind of childish and naive.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.320
[Guest]: But I started to become aware of my own confirmation bias.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:43.880
[Guest]: And I was reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb at the time, his book Fooled by Randomness.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:52.440
[Guest]: And that set me on a path of a very different intellectual arc of exploring uncertainty,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.200
[Guest]: overconfidence, humility.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.920
[Guest]: And similarly – and I'm almost done with this travelogue – and similarly, I started

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.360
[Guest]: – I had a set of conversations with Dan Klein, my colleague at George Mason on Adam

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.240
[Guest]: Smith and his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.680
[Guest]: And that was another complication to my worldview because, you know, Smith is thought of as

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.760
[Guest]: this free market economist who wrote The Wealth of Nations, which of course he is.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.360
[Guest]: But he also has this other book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, where he's very interested

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.000
[Guest]: in our moral sympathies and the fact that we sometimes act altruistically and what's

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.720
[Guest]: the source of happiness.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:42.600
[Guest]: And I started to really open up my mind to the richness of philosophy and saw my past

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.080
[Guest]: training in economics as just a little bit sterile, a little bit too narrow.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.600
[Guest]: So in a way, I haven't changed much at all.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.160
[Guest]: The things I care about, the principles I stand for, they're pretty much the same.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.480
[Guest]: I just have a different way of thinking about them and a willingness to realize that the

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.120
[Guest]: world is not as open and shut as I probably thought when I was 30 years old.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.320
[Guest]: And so that's really the – that's a quick look at what I've been – how my thinking

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.720
[Guest]: has changed over time.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.080
[Guest]: I'm increasingly interested in philosophy, and philosophy is about asking good questions,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
[Guest]: not about answers.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.960
[Guest]: I'm increasingly interested in risk and uncertainty, too.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.040
[Guest]: I'm always struck by how subtle and challenging it is to think about those topics thoughtfully.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.400
[Guest]: The people who are very confident in themselves in those areas are dangerous.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.440
[Guest]: It really is important to know what you don't know.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:42.320
[Guest]: So that's what I'm interested in, and at the same time, the country I live in has gone

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.280
[Guest]: off the rails, become unmoored, discourse has been degraded.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.320
[Guest]: So I've been increasingly interested in trying to understand how that happened.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.560
[Guest]: What is going – and it's not only in America, of course.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.200
[Guest]: The rise of populism, the really rearrangement of what is considered left and right, what's

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.720
[Guest]: considered sort of mainstream liberal-conservative differences, I'm very interested in how that

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.280
[Guest]: has come to pass.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.320
[Guest]: So that's another set of interviews and topics and reading I'm doing to try to wrap my head

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320
[Guest]: around that.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:20.120
[Amit Varma]: There are a lot of threads I want to pick from what you just spoke about and kind of

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
[Amit Varma]: unpack them.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.120
[Amit Varma]: But the first one I look at is, you know, I just finished rereading your book, How Adam

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.400
[Amit Varma]: Smith Can Change Your Life, which is, of course, quotes a lot from a theory of moral sentiments.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And one of the first things that strikes you there, of course, is that, you know, we can

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.320
[Amit Varma]: post-facto, we can think of Smith as an economist, but he was also a moral philosopher.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.140
[Amit Varma]: He was also a political philosopher.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:45.600
[Amit Varma]: He was also an economist, of course, I mean, practically the founder of modern economics.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.080
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, when I was looking at the sort of people you studied with and worked with,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.440
[Amit Varma]: like Gary Becker, who strikes me almost as a quintessential 19th century intellectual

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.920
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that his interests are so wide ranging.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.720
[Amit Varma]: He has, you know, studied and written on so many different subjects.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.260
[Amit Varma]: Whereas, if you look at the modern time, my impression of it is that everyone is expected

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.780
[Amit Varma]: to be a specialist.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.440
[Amit Varma]: You don't have an economist talking about moral philosophy or vice versa.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And how much do you feel that that's a trap for people who are in academics today or maybe

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.520
[Amit Varma]: over the last few decades that you tend to increasingly specialize and how important

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.240
[Amit Varma]: it is to then do that kind of wide ranging thinking and studying, which, in a sense,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, you were forced to do by the nature of the conversations you had to have on EconTalk

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.320
[Amit Varma]: because you're talking to so many disparate people.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.800
[Amit Varma]: But how important is that?

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.960
[Guest]: And is it a rare thing?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.480
[Guest]: So that's a really interesting question.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.440
[Guest]: I've actually started thinking about aspects of that in the last year or so because I think

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:54.040
[Guest]: a lot about what's happened to my discipline over the last 30, 40 years, economics.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.000
[Guest]: When I was being trained and in the decade or so after I came out into the job market

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.040
[Guest]: and became an academic, the emphasis was on very high powered mathematics.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.560
[Guest]: The people who were respected and had prestige were the people who could use the most advanced

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.320
[Guest]: mathematics.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320
[Guest]: That's changed.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.320
[Guest]: Today, the people who are most respected in economics are the people who can do the most

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.400
[Guest]: sophisticated statistical techniques to manipulate data and try to understand it.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.880
[Guest]: And both of those are interesting.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:35.080
[Guest]: But what I've come to realize and to think about your question in terms of specialization,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.920
[Guest]: there's a really funny kind of specialization that I think is the most important one.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.360
[Guest]: First, let me react to what you said about Gary Becker.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.400
[Guest]: Gary Becker had, as you said, had incredibly wide ranging interests.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400
[Guest]: He wrote on the family.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.900
[Guest]: He wrote on crime, wrote on discrimination.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:56.480
[Guest]: He was the ultimate economic imperialist on politics, of course, also.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.600
[Guest]: He was trying to use the tools of economics to understand all those things.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.240
[Guest]: So in one sense, he was incredibly diverse.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.240
[Guest]: In other sense, he was incredibly narrow because he forced every one of those areas into the

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.600
[Guest]: economic lens.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.720
[Guest]: And let's digress for a minute and talk about what that economic lens is.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:23.520
[Guest]: That economic lens is the idea that rationality, the right behavior, is to maximize something

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.360
[Guest]: subject to the constraints of your situation.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.520
[Guest]: So the simplest way to think about this in economics is the economist's view of human

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:39.600
[Guest]: behavior is that we try to get the maximum satisfaction out of life, given that we don't

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.320
[Guest]: have an infinite amount of money.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.120
[Guest]: Now, that's a really powerful tool, as it turns out.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.640
[Guest]: In a way, it's kind of it's almost a tautology.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.960
[Guest]: It's almost not so interesting by itself.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:57.040
[Guest]: But economists take that tool, and Gary Becker was the master of it, and use it to see what

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.840
[Guest]: insights they can get or what predictions they can get about human behavior.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.240
[Guest]: So just to take one crazy one that part of the reason Gary Becker got a Nobel Prize is

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.080
[Guest]: that he said, let's treat the decision to have children the way we treat every other

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.640
[Guest]: decision.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.440
[Guest]: We have children because we enjoy them, and then we invest in them.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.240
[Guest]: We give them knowledge, time, and then they go out into the world.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.760
[Guest]: They might, in a primitive society, be a literal investment.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.880
[Guest]: They might end up taking care of me or working on my farm or taking care of me in my old

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest]: age.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.960
[Guest]: In modern times, the investment is more to turn them into a kind of person I'm going

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
[Guest]: to like.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.720
[Guest]: That would be one way to think about child raising.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.480
[Guest]: And what Becker talks about is the trade-off between quantity and quality of children.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.120
[Guest]: Now, this offends people tremendously.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.400
[Guest]: It offends me a little bit now, but I want to be clear with the nature of the offenses.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:00.840
[Guest]: So what he meant by that was if you want to have children of a certain ability and have

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.480
[Guest]: them have a certain set of skills to go through life with, in particular, let's say you want

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.920
[Guest]: them to be college graduates, but you can't have eight kids.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.760
[Guest]: You can't have 13 kids.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.640
[Guest]: They're too expensive.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.960
[Guest]: So just financially and time-wise, not just money, time-wise also.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:24.920
[Guest]: So what he was trying to explain by that insight, which is trivial but deeply true to some extent,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.480
[Guest]: not the only factor, of course, but what he's trying to explain is that why do wealthy people

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.160
[Guest]: have more nights out at restaurants?

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.120
[Guest]: Why do they have more cars?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.600
[Guest]: Why do they have more square footage of house?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
[Guest]: Why don't they have more children?

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
[Guest]: They like kids.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600
[Guest]: Kids are things they like.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.600
[Guest]: They have lots of money.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.600
[Guest]: Why don't they have more of them?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.080
[Guest]: The answer is, which is interesting and provocative, is that, well, the more you have, the harder

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.120
[Guest]: it is to have the level of investment you might want in knowledge and time to have them

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.360
[Guest]: turn out a certain way.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.760
[Guest]: So that's really interesting.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.320
[Guest]: That's Becker's one insight that you get from using the economic tools.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.440
[Guest]: But you really wouldn't want to, I think, I don't think you want to assume that people

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.640
[Guest]: sit around and think when they're getting married, honey, let's make sure we take care

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.400
[Guest]: of the quantity quality trade off when we decide how many kids to have.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.560
[Guest]: Now Becker was a very wise man.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:28.080
[Guest]: He didn't think that's what people literally did, perhaps, that they were calculating machines.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.480
[Guest]: What he was trying to do is often called the as if hypothesis, saying, well, people act

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.080
[Guest]: as if they're trying to maximize how much pleasure they get from their children.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.320
[Guest]: So I think that's a very powerful tool.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.400
[Guest]: But most economists don't realize, and this is where I want to get back to your question.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.480
[Guest]: It's a long, rambling answer, but most economists struggle to remember that their models of

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.920
[Guest]: reality aren't the same as reality.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.140
[Guest]: I don't think, I'm not sure Gary Becker ever made that mistake.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.280
[Guest]: But most of us being human, more human, we make that mistake all the time.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.680
[Guest]: And you might argue, well, what's the difference?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680
[Guest]: Not a big deal.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.240
[Guest]: But what the difference is, is that it starts to change how you look at human beings and

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240
[Guest]: how you look at yourself.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.280
[Guest]: And, you know, the example I like to use is the dance floor.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.160
[Guest]: When you go out on a dance floor with a partner, is your goal, the economist would say, oh,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.120
[Guest]: your goal is to get as much pleasure as you can from this experience.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.080
[Guest]: You might want to show off or have people think you're a great dancer.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.600
[Guest]: And what Adam Smith would actually say is that when you're out on a dance floor, there's

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.240
[Guest]: certain rules of propriety, certain rules of conduct that you should live up to, certain

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240
[Guest]: expectations.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.200
[Guest]: So you're not trying to maximize anything.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.200
[Guest]: What you're trying to do is live by the rules.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.520
[Guest]: You're trying to be a good person.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.280
[Guest]: Now, those two worldviews, which are get the most out of every experience versus, well,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.200
[Guest]: in some settings, you know, I just try to do the right thing.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.120
[Guest]: Obviously, there's sometimes intention.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.120
[Guest]: A lot of times doing the right thing is expensive in some fashions, so we don't do the right

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.120
[Guest]: things.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.480
[Guest]: I don't think you want to argue that the economic way of thinking is irrelevant.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.680
[Guest]: It's just that it's not the only thing.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.040
[Guest]: And so many times economists, I think, forget that.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.120
[Guest]: So to come back to your question about specialization, you know, most economists know very little

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.160
[Guest]: about other things outside of mathematical theory and statistics.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.840
[Guest]: You might think, oh, it's because they're so – they don't have time, and it's not

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840
[Guest]: the reason.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840
[Guest]: The reason is they're not interested.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.440
[Guest]: They're not so interested in art history.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.840
[Guest]: They're not so interested in poetry.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.920
[Guest]: It's just not – that's the kind of person who's interested in math and statistics often

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:33.440
[Guest]: sometimes, isn't interested in a wider range of things.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.720
[Guest]: So I think the biggest challenge that academics face today in the world isn't just that they're

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.560
[Guest]: not interdisciplinary.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.360
[Guest]: That's one way to phrase your – the point you raised.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.800
[Guest]: They don't understand things outside their narrow silo of how they were trained.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.680
[Guest]: I think it's more – there's a meta-understanding there that's missing, which is we don't

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:03.480
[Guest]: understand often as academics how much our worldview is conditioned on the way we were

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480
[Guest]: trained.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.680
[Guest]: Let me give you an example.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.440
[Guest]: You're raised in a household that has a respect for religion, and you end up adopting – most

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.120
[Guest]: people do – their parents' religion, or they leave their parents' religion, which

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.800
[Guest]: is the other thing that happens.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.200
[Guest]: But let's say you keep your parents' religion.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.880
[Guest]: The idea that you spend much or any time thinking about whether it's the right religion is

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.200
[Guest]: almost zero.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.480
[Guest]: It's like it's discomforting.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.240
[Guest]: You don't want to think about it, and you're happy.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.080
[Guest]: You got a good thing going.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.200
[Guest]: That's the way you were raised.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.720
[Guest]: There's deep primal things that are going on there with family and the transition from

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.760
[Guest]: childhood to adulthood, the existential angst of being a human being that you don't want

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.000
[Guest]: to tamper with.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.400
[Guest]: So academics have that same problem.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.720
[Guest]: They don't even realize it.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.280
[Guest]: We're trained in a certain – I can't – I don't want to repeat the actual people,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.720
[Guest]: but friends of mine, colleagues of mine, and fellow economists will write me and say – or

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.800
[Guest]: talk to me and say, you sound like you're kind of skeptical about fill-in-the-blank.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.400
[Guest]: I'm thinking, well, sure, aren't you?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.960
[Guest]: I realize, no, they're not.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960
[Guest]: They haven't thought about it.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.640
[Guest]: This isn't like, oh, I'm so much better than them.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640
[Guest]: They don't think about it.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:19.000
[Guest]: I'm talking about the fact that when you're a fish in water, you just don't realize you're

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
[Guest]: in the water.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.400
[Guest]: I mean that's just such an obvious challenge of being a fish.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.760
[Guest]: If you're a fish, you don't need to think about it.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760
[Guest]: It's not important.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.760
[Guest]: You're in the water.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760
[Guest]: You can't live on land.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.160
[Guest]: It's not like you're missing a big opportunity that all you're thinking about is the water.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.760
[Guest]: But if you're an academic and all you can see are the studies that confirm your way

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.600
[Guest]: of looking at the world, you're in water and it's costing you because you don't

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.560
[Guest]: realize that the world is more complicated.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:55.280
[Guest]: So even super intelligent, high IQ, prestigious, successful academics that I talk to, they

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.040
[Guest]: don't spend any time questioning the tools they've been trained in.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.120
[Guest]: I mean it's like saying, I wonder what it would be like to live in a thatched hut.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.440
[Guest]: Most people who live in suburban America don't think about thatched huts that much.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.560
[Guest]: I wonder what it's like to live in a yurt or what it would be like to ride a bicycle

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560
[Guest]: to work every day.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560
[Guest]: That's a stretch.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.960
[Guest]: Some people do that and they realize, oh, it's kind of fun.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.080
[Guest]: But within your academic discipline to turn on it or to imagine that there's a richer

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.240
[Guest]: or more complicated view of the world or that you're leaving out stuff, that's another

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.440
[Guest]: way to think about it.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.560
[Guest]: One thing I've been increasingly interested in is this challenge of thinking about data

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.360
[Guest]: and measurability and so much of life is not measurable.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.440
[Guest]: Just don't even think about those things that aren't measured.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.200
[Guest]: It's not like, oh, well, we can't measure that, but we'll keep it in mind.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200
[Guest]: It's out of mind.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.480
[Guest]: It's out of sight.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.320
[Guest]: My line is dignity is not in the data set.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.880
[Guest]: There's no variable called dignity that goes on a scale of zero to 10.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.000
[Guest]: It's like if I go to an out-of-work coal miner in West Virginia and say, on a scale

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.760
[Guest]: of zero to 10, how much self-worth are you feeling today?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
[Guest]: We don't ask those questions.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
[Guest]: Nobody asks those questions.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.200
[Guest]: If you do, the answers don't mean anything, and they vary from day to day.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.680
[Guest]: But that's important.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.440
[Guest]: Dignity is important.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.440
[Guest]: Work is important.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.720
[Guest]: It's not just how much we earn.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.560
[Guest]: It's the work we do and how satisfied we are by it and how proud we are of it.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.120
[Guest]: Economists just ignore all this stuff because it can't be measured.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.120
[Guest]: We say in the back of our mind, well, of course, we know about that, but after a while, we

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.840
[Guest]: forget about it.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.320
[Guest]: That leads to policy mistakes.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320
[Guest]: It leads to hubris.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.360
[Guest]: That's a really long answer.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.360
[Guest]: I apologize.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:49.680
[Guest]: But this question of narrowness, I think, is much more than just that we're not interdisciplinary,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.800
[Guest]: which most of us aren't.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:57.160
[Guest]: In fact, George Stigler, another one of my professors at Chicago, said there's only one

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:04.120
[Guest]: social science and we are its practitioners, meaning economists.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.800
[Guest]: That's the way a lot of economists feel.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.080
[Guest]: It's like our tools, that's the only way to look at the family.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080
[Guest]: Sociologists don't have anything.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.560
[Guest]: They just make up stuff.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.600
[Guest]: That's sort of the – just as another biographical note, Gary Becker was interested in sociology

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.400
[Guest]: and he realized there's nothing here.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.920
[Guest]: Now, there's some brilliant sociologists, but the field of sociology doesn't have

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.160
[Guest]: an organized theories.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.520
[Guest]: So I think economics was deeply appealing to him because it gave him a framework for

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.120
[Guest]: organizing his thinking about the family, about what we would normally call sociology

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.120
[Guest]: or anthropology.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.760
[Guest]: It's a powerful tool, but it's not the whole story.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760
[Guest]: I think Gary knew that.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.800
[Amit Varma]: I think a lot of economists struggle to remember it.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I'm very interested in sort of the question of how we form our belief systems.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.680
[Amit Varma]: Like when we are young, we're trying to make sense of the world and suddenly you come across

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.160
[Amit Varma]: a framework that explains everything and it feels so powerful.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.280
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like your eyes pop out of your head because you see everything clearly for

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.240
[Amit Varma]: the first time and then that's like a hammer you apply to every single nail and you've

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.800
[Amit Varma]: made the analogy for a bunch of people have lost a key and they're all gathered around

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.040
[Amit Varma]: the lamppost looking for the key, even though the key is somewhere else, but they are where

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040
[Amit Varma]: the light is.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, and that strikes me as being very accurate.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.200
[Amit Varma]: I was sort of saving my question on ideology for later about how one deals with ideologies

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and things about ideologies.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.400
[Amit Varma]: But since you've sort of brought that subject up in your book on Adam Smith's, you quoted

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.560
[Amit Varma]: Sam Thompson as saying, quote, the universe is full of dots, connect the right ones and

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.880
[Amit Varma]: you can draw anything.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.520
[Amit Varma]: The important question is not whether the dots you picked are really there, but why

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.800
[Amit Varma]: you chose to ignore all the others.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've also, you know, you've had Arnold King on your show and he wrote this great

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.440
[Amit Varma]: book called The Three Languages of Politics.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Before I ask you to elaborate, I'll quickly sort of summarize that for my listeners.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Arnold's argument essentially is that if you look at the three major ideologies in America

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.760
[Amit Varma]: today, it's not a question of somebody being right or wrong.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.000
[Amit Varma]: It's just that they are starting from different first principles.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And from that point on, they are completely coherent.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'll, you know, quote from your piece in this, where you write, quote, liberals

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.880
[Amit Varma]: see the world as a battle between victims and oppressors, conservatives see the world

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.760
[Amit Varma]: as a battle between civilization and barbarism, libertarians see the world as a battle between

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760
[Amit Varma]: freedom and coercion.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And by liberals, of course, you mean the American style liberals, I guess we could also call

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920
[Amit Varma]: them progressives.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, you know, you and I would call ourselves liberals, I think broadly.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.560
[Amit Varma]: And you wrote a very interesting piece where you sort of pointed out that, well, of course,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.960
[Amit Varma]: this is true, that we are often talking past each other and not to each other, because

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.760
[Amit Varma]: we don't recognize each other's priors and try to understand where the person is coming

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760
[Amit Varma]: from.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.240
[Amit Varma]: But you also pointed out that these three tribes, as it were, also have their own sort

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.840
[Amit Varma]: of blind spots, which stop them from, you know, seeing the world, which I found incredibly

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.960
[Amit Varma]: fascinating, because when I read it, my first instinct was, yeah, he's right about the liberals

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960
[Amit Varma]: or the progressives.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, he's right about the conservatives.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Well, how is he right about the libertarians, but, you know, then one kind of reads it carefully

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.440
[Amit Varma]: and sees the points that you're making.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800
[Amit Varma]: What are these blind spots?

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, before you get to that, is that something that you have changed your

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.160
[Amit Varma]: mind over time?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Like were you once sort of more dogmatic than you are today?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a good question and hard to, I'm going to get lost answering it, but maybe

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.600
[Guest]: you could steer me back if I get in trouble.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.240
[Guest]: So let's start with the three languages.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.680
[Guest]: That comes from Arnold Kling, as you point out in his book, The Three Languages of Politics,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.840
[Guest]: a fantastic short read that will change the way you look at politics, one of the most

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.560
[Guest]: influential books on my thinking.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.440
[Guest]: You know, those three lenses, those three frameworks, so I'm going to call them progressive

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.240
[Guest]: to keep that confusion from happening.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.560
[Guest]: So progressives say the world is full of victims and oppressors.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.280
[Guest]: Conservatives say the world is a fight between barbarism and civilization, and libertarians

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.080
[Guest]: say the world's a fight between freedom and coercion.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.920
[Guest]: So let's take an example in the current situation in America, police brutality.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.840
[Guest]: The death of George Floyd recently, the tragic death of George Floyd, the progressives look

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:26.200
[Guest]: at that and say black people are victims and the police are oppressors.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.280
[Guest]: The conservatives look at it and say being a policeman is a very hard job.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.260
[Guest]: Police officer is a very hard job.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.720
[Guest]: If we don't honor them, we're going to have a breakdown in order.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.680
[Guest]: We're going to have looting and rioting and look, look what's happening.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.200
[Guest]: The libertarians say the police are doing all the wrong stuff.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.680
[Guest]: They're obsessed with the drug war, which causes them to really run amok.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.800
[Guest]: Policing should be a personal choice of an individual, shouldn't be the government's

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800
[Guest]: role.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.080
[Guest]: Police should stay out of that and most of these problems would go away.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.040
[Guest]: Now the irony is I think all three of those things are true.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.960
[Guest]: I think all three of those things are true.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.040
[Guest]: I think black people are oppressed in America.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.440
[Guest]: I think civilization is a threat from barbarism, and I think the government ought to get out

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: of the drug war.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
[Guest]: That's not what's interesting.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.360
[Guest]: What's interesting is that it's very hard for each of us to see beyond our own lens.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:29.680
[Guest]: And so all I can see when I put my glasses on, if I'm a conservative is, oh my gosh,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.440
[Guest]: this looting is out of control.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.480
[Guest]: My house could get attacked.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.800
[Guest]: I could get attacked.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.040
[Guest]: We need strong police.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.560
[Guest]: The progressives look at it and saying, do you know what it's like to be black in America?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.840
[Guest]: Police look at it and saying, yeah, those police have all this military equipment.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.840
[Guest]: So every person is seeing it through their own lens and they're not wrong.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.600
[Guest]: What changed for me from Arnold's book and other conversations and thinking about is

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.120
[Guest]: that you got to realize the other side's got some good points.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120
[Guest]: They're not wrong.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.640
[Guest]: They're not right.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.120
[Guest]: Not the whole story, but they're not wrong.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.280
[Guest]: So all three of those I think are correct.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.540
[Guest]: And now what do you do?

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.400
[Guest]: And my point in that essay that you're referring to is that I think each of those views, while

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.280
[Guest]: correct, has a blind spot.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.080
[Guest]: So in the case of progressives, they think the victims have no agency.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080
[Guest]: They can't help.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.480
[Guest]: They have no options, no freedom.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.480
[Guest]: That's absurd.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.080
[Guest]: That's a ridiculous thing to believe, right?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.240
[Guest]: So that lens of, of course, blacks are oppressed at times and have a tough time.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240
[Guest]: That's true.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.040
[Guest]: But to then go so far as to say they have no agency, there's nothing they can do about

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.800
[Guest]: their situation.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.240
[Guest]: It's impossible to make any progress as a black person in America.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.480
[Guest]: That's absurd.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.180
[Guest]: That's not, that's not consistent with the data, the facts, the reality that we all understand.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:53.320
[Guest]: And similarly, the conservative is right that we want to make sure that the people can go

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.400
[Guest]: safely about their business and, and, and walk down the street and have good businesses.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.720
[Guest]: But they often don't think that everything's the fault.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.200
[Guest]: The police never make a mistake, but of course they do.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.880
[Guest]: They do some terrible things.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.880
[Guest]: They're human beings and it's, they're a small portion, perhaps, doesn't matter.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.880
[Guest]: It should be smaller if we can do it ideally.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.840
[Guest]: So the conservatives, you know, I have a lot of conservative friends and I'm increasingly

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.000
[Guest]: interested in conservative ideas.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.160
[Guest]: You know, they'll say things like, well, there's all this employment opportunity.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.960
[Guest]: Not right now, of course, because the pandemic, but before the pandemic, they'd say, why are

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.440
[Guest]: all these people in, in inner cities in America, why are they doing drugs?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.680
[Guest]: Why aren't they working?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.680
[Guest]: That's their fault.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680
[Guest]: Why aren't they getting a job?

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.280
[Guest]: There's, look at all the employees, if I were black, I wouldn't be like that.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.880
[Guest]: I'm thinking, how could you say that?

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.600
[Guest]: You have no idea what it's like to be black.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
[Guest]: You're not black.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.680
[Guest]: And you really think you'd be different?

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.800
[Guest]: You wouldn't be like them if you didn't have a decent education, if you grew up in a bunch

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.040
[Guest]: of streets where everything was boarded up, you really think you'd be this?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.880
[Guest]: So, so the progressives think that poor people have no agency.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.680
[Guest]: They're just victims of rich exploiting companies and, and a racism.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.040
[Guest]: The conservative makes the opposite mistake.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.240
[Guest]: Oh, you can do anything you want.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240
[Guest]: It's a free country.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.840
[Guest]: Why aren't you making something of yourself?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.600
[Guest]: The answer is because you've got too many handicaps, racism, bad education, a tough

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.120
[Guest]: home situation, a horrible neighborhood.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.360
[Guest]: So the each side is having to learn from each other.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:26.120
[Guest]: But the I think the deeper point is that our discourse, which in America and elsewhere

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.280
[Guest]: now is increasingly tribal.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.880
[Guest]: It's increasingly, I'm not just right and you're wrong.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.040
[Guest]: It's I'm right and you're a threat.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.920
[Guest]: You're a threat to civilization.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.640
[Guest]: You're a threat to poor people, black people.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.720
[Guest]: Each side sees the other as an existential threat.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.560
[Guest]: And I, you know, I learned this from Sebastian Junger.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.480
[Guest]: He wrote a beautiful book called Tribe.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.240
[Guest]: So, you know, if you think that the other side is destroying the country, which is what

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.600
[Guest]: is the case in America right now, the progressives think the conservatives are literally destroying

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.280
[Guest]: the country and the conservatives literally think that the progressives are destroying

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.640
[Guest]: the country.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: You're accusing your opponents of treason.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.160
[Guest]: And treason is usually punishable by the death penalty in human history.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.840
[Guest]: And you start to think about what these kind of attitudes are going to justify.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.040
[Guest]: And we see it right now.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:29.240
[Guest]: We see in America the media is spiraling out of control because they feel that the quote

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:35.960
[Guest]: other side, doesn't matter which side we're talking about, the other side is an existential

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.240
[Guest]: threat to the future of the country.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240
[Guest]: It can't last.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.240
[Guest]: It's got to either get fixed or it's going to end up in violence.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.960
[Guest]: It's a scary, scary time.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.320
[Guest]: So to come back to your original question or observation, the quote from Sam Thompson,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.120
[Guest]: one of my listeners or readers, I don't remember whether I got heard from him in an email,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.880
[Guest]: that beautiful quote about cherry picking facts.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.160
[Guest]: There's so many facts.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.280
[Guest]: It's very easy to convince yourself that the facts support your view.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.680
[Guest]: Can't tell many people I debate with it.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:12.960
[Guest]: They actually believe that a handful of facts means they've proved their case, forgetting

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.960
[Guest]: that sometimes the facts are literally not facts, that there are other facts that contradict

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.160
[Guest]: their case and they don't even imagine it.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.280
[Guest]: I mean, it's not like, oh, I have a pretty good case and maybe, maybe I need to rethink

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280
[Guest]: some things.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.680
[Guest]: It's like, this is open and shut.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:35.240
[Guest]: And so the idea of being open to things, not being open and shut, I think is really important.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.600
[Guest]: It's not that good for your podcast audience.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:44.720
[Guest]: I think the angrier you are and the more confident you are, you then gather around you, your

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.480
[Guest]: choir of voices that will reinforce your attitudes.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.560
[Guest]: And I just don't want to be part of that.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560
[Guest]: I think that's a mistake.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.760
[Guest]: I think that's wrong.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.800
[Guest]: And I think that's part of the problem.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.600
[Guest]: Everybody's in their own silo right now of, of, of reinforcing their own views.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.240
[Guest]: And the internet's really good at that.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.720
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm just thinking aloud.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.880
[Amit Varma]: It strikes me that what we are probably seeing today is an intersection of a particular way

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.720
[Amit Varma]: in which we are hardwired coming together with the way technology has evolved.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.840
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sort of going to, you know, forgive me if I ramble, but I'm going to quote from

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Adam Smith, a theory of moral sentiments, as I try to sort of elaborate on this, where

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.380
[Amit Varma]: Smith says, quote, the chief part of human happiness arises from the consciousness of

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.380
[Amit Varma]: being beloved.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote, which is, in a sense, you know, almost banal, obviously, we are all seeking

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.160
[Amit Varma]: validation, we are hardwired to seek validation.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.560
[Amit Varma]: And what's happened in modern times is that earlier, you know, that when the theory of

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.800
[Amit Varma]: moral sentiments was written, obviously, it was written with a small group of people in

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.760
[Amit Varma]: mind, which is your family and your friends and the people you know, personally.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.520
[Amit Varma]: And we also evolved at a time where we knew very few people, we didn't have access to

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.040
[Amit Varma]: millions and billions of people.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So our instincts evolve accordingly.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.520
[Amit Varma]: So when we seek validation from a small group, you know, there is the sort of the benefit

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.480
[Amit Varma]: of posturing is a little less because they will be with us long enough to see through

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.280
[Amit Varma]: that and we aren't being able to posture at scale to so many people.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And what technology has done is that it becomes really easy to go online to find an echo chamber

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.160
[Amit Varma]: of people who happen to believe whatever frame you view the world through or whatever worldview

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160
[Amit Varma]: you have.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.280
[Amit Varma]: And then the incentives are aligned, not towards having conversations with people who might,

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, behave differently with you, but towards raising your status within this little

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520
[Amit Varma]: in group.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And increasingly, the way to do that is to get more and more shrill, whether you're attacking

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.800
[Amit Varma]: the other side, or whether you're signaling your own virtue, or whether you're attacking

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.680
[Amit Varma]: people on your own side for not passing, you know, a specific purity test.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, Cass Sunstein use the phrase group polarization for what basically

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200
[Amit Varma]: happens.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that you kind of started your podcast and your great blog cafe hype

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.600
[Amit Varma]: when you co wrote that with Don Woodrow, you know, back in the day before things became

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.520
[Amit Varma]: so bad, like, I think this is really happened, maybe post Twitter really taking off post

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.680
[Amit Varma]: 2010, that things have gotten so polarized and ugly.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what was that journey for you like of, you know, first seeing all of this

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.520
[Amit Varma]: evolve, making sense of it.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And then in a sense, you are part of the circus, right?

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120
[Amit Varma]: You are on Twitter?

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on all of this?

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120
[Guest]: Does it make you despair?

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I want to add one thing to your very nice summary of where we are right now.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.960
[Guest]: I think the especially relevant comment given the title of your program, The Seen and the

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.040
[Guest]: Unseen.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:51.040
[Guest]: So what we see is the Twitter mob, cancel culture, the descending anger of people on

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:59.360
[Guest]: a particular individual who has violated some norm of civility or not civility, a norm of

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.200
[Guest]: the right way of thinking.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.040
[Guest]: So that's what we see.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.160
[Guest]: And we're having a conversation about that right now in America.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:13.320
[Guest]: There was a recent letter signed out of Harper's Magazine about criticizing cancel culture.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.780
[Guest]: Fascinating sociological moment in America, because the people who signed that letter

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.920
[Guest]: were very diverse politically.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:28.200
[Guest]: And that meant that there were some people who signed the letter who you're not supposed

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.440
[Guest]: to like.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.160
[Guest]: And some people rescinded their signature because they said, oh, I didn't realize so-and-so

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160
[Guest]: signed it.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.960
[Guest]: I saw that this person signed it, and I think she's OK.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.840
[Guest]: But when I realized, oh, my gosh, so-and-so signed it, I'm sorry, I'm off, I'm out.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.520
[Guest]: So that's on the table right now.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.720
[Guest]: That's what's being talked about.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720
[Guest]: That's what's seen.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.920
[Guest]: But I think the unseen is what's more interesting right now.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:58.760
[Guest]: And it's always more valuable to point out or more fun to point out what's not obvious.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.800
[Guest]: We just had a conversation about the three languages of politics.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.560
[Guest]: I chose to talk about police brutality as an example.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.000
[Guest]: You can take what's amazing about Kling's insights or you can apply it to almost every

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Guest]: issue.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.860
[Guest]: It breaks down that way.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:17.280
[Guest]: I was a little bit uneasy, mentioned in George Floyd on this program.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.960
[Guest]: It's like in the back of my mind, it's a sort of nagging fear.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:27.160
[Guest]: What if I make a misstep and I say something that's politically incorrect and somebody

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:32.080
[Guest]: takes it out of context and puts it on Twitter and accuses me of being a racist?

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.600
[Guest]: Like that's no fun.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.600
[Guest]: I took a chance.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.600
[Guest]: I talked about it.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600
[Guest]: That's so dangerous.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:45.840
[Guest]: But I think the unseen that's important in this cancel culture moment is the thoughts

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.640
[Guest]: that we have and the words that we say, that we either push back down those thoughts because

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.040
[Guest]: oh, that's trouble.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.040
[Guest]: I'm staying away from that.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
[Guest]: Or quiet.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:01.600
[Guest]: Better not say that because that's a minefield, better to be safe.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.160
[Guest]: And what that does is it destroys discourse.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:12.280
[Guest]: It destroys conversation, kind of like, just to be, this is a crude stereotype, probably

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.840
[Guest]: shouldn't say it.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.360
[Guest]: Stereotypes are troubling, you get in trouble for stereotypes, but I'll use the difference

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: between, say, a stereotypical upper class British gentleman and somebody from, let's

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.880
[Guest]: call it a Mediterranean culture, could be Israel or Greece or Italy.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:40.000
[Guest]: So in the British salon, drawing room, certain things aren't talked about.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.080
[Guest]: Certain emotions are not expressed.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.720
[Guest]: Everything is a bit restrained.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.040
[Guest]: Could even say it's civilized.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.120
[Guest]: In the Mediterranean culture, everything's out on the table.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.360
[Guest]: People are yelling at each other, calling each other names sometimes.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.000
[Guest]: Now those are two different ways of living.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.120
[Guest]: I think there's some middle path that's the right path where you have an authentic conversation,

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.520
[Guest]: but you don't necessarily tell somebody everything you're thinking.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.240
[Guest]: That I think does require some forms of restraint.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.960
[Guest]: But if you go too far in either direction, you're going to destroy the opportunity to

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.960
[Guest]: learn.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.960
[Guest]: You're going to destroy the opportunity to live vividly.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: So I feel like we're heading, certainly in academic life in America, we're heading toward

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.320
[Guest]: a world where a bunch of things are not on the table and it can't be talked about.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.240
[Guest]: In fact, I just saw somebody tweeted this morning that if there are any differences

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.760
[Guest]: between groups, that's racism.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760
[Guest]: It's all because of racism.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760
[Guest]: It can't be anything else.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.880
[Guest]: If you see statistical differences by race, all of it's racism.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: So that's a beautiful example, tragic example of what we're talking about earlier with the

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.560
[Guest]: blind spot.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.960
[Guest]: And somebody, you know, responded like, what, I mean, there's no agency, there's no ability.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.880
[Guest]: Nobody has any responsibility.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.120
[Guest]: Everything is a result of other people.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.840
[Guest]: I mean, if you think about that, ultimately that's dehumanizing the people you're supposedly

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.560
[Guest]: caring about.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.040
[Guest]: But that's where we're going.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.280
[Guest]: If we're not careful, we're going to head to a world where you can't raise those other

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280
[Guest]: possible explanations.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.440
[Guest]: And once you do that, you stop learning.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440
[Guest]: You're in religion.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.440
[Guest]: I like religion, by the way.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.480
[Guest]: You probably know I'm a religious person.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.480
[Guest]: I'm Jewish.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480
[Guest]: I think religion is great.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.480
[Guest]: I'm a big fan of it.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.240
[Guest]: I think it helps you organize your life and it's powerful and it gives meaning.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.680
[Guest]: And I like religion a lot.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.840
[Guest]: I don't think it belongs in academic life.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.820
[Guest]: That needs, that's supposed to be something different.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.280
[Guest]: And as it tends toward religion, I think we're heading toward a world where knowledge is

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.320
[Guest]: not going to be created.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.880
[Guest]: We're just going to have priesthoods.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880
[Amit Varma]: That's not good.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And I also do this weekly Econ podcast called Econ Central.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.720
[Amit Varma]: I co-host it with a friend.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.560
[Amit Varma]: And our latest episode we just dropped today, we are recording this on July 16th, is called

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.240
[Amit Varma]: The Economics of the Chilling Effect, where, you know, we speak about exactly what you

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.880
[Amit Varma]: just spoke about, that, you know, the incentives are now aligned for people to shut up.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So there might be a silent majority that disagrees with the vocal minority, but oh my God, you're

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.120
[Amit Varma]: not going to speak out because why, you know, invite the mob upon yourself, which is, you

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.480
[Amit Varma]: know, incredibly worrying for our discourse.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.240
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break now.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'm looking forward to continuing this conversation when we come back.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Great.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.560
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and The Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.840
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.880
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen has been a labor of love for me.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.480
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.800
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and The Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.800
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.200
[Amit Varma]: And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.320
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.680
[Amit Varma]: So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.360
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Scene and The Unseen that you

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.560
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:27.360
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.360
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.440
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:37.480
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.080
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:47.920
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going sceneunseen.in slash support.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Russ Roberts about his intellectual journey, about his podcast, Econ Talk, and

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.000
[Amit Varma]: about these strange times that we find ourselves in.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the themes that has sort of interested me, not just at a level of,

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, what's happening to our political discourse, but also while trying to kind of

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.760
[Amit Varma]: understand the craft of podcasting and just, you know, introspecting on the ways that it's

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.860
[Amit Varma]: changed me, the way I sort of relate to the world.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And that has to do with the subject of communication, how we talk to each other, like one of my

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.840
[Amit Varma]: favorite novelists, Georges Simenon, had once said, quote, the fact that we are, I don't

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:30.520
[Amit Varma]: know how many millions of people, yet communication, complete communication is completely impossible

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.200
[Amit Varma]: between two of these people is to me one of the biggest tragic themes in the world.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, while I was going through a book about Adam Smith, I found it very interesting

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.760
[Amit Varma]: about how you brought up the theme of communication in a context in which is not usually brought

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.400
[Amit Varma]: up, which is from his famous quote from the wealth of nations about the butcher and the

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.480
[Amit Varma]: baker, where, you know, he wrote, quote, it is not from the benevolence of the butcher,

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.960
[Amit Varma]: the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.480
[Amit Varma]: self interest, we address ourselves not to the humanity, but to their self love and never

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.480
[Amit Varma]: talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, then you go on to say as a commentary on this quote, the idea that other people

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.960
[Amit Varma]: care about themselves is generally a good thing to remember if you want them to do something

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.440
[Amit Varma]: for you in return.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of interesting that you know, when like I teach a writing class also, and

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.480
[Amit Varma]: one of the sort of themes of communication there is that very often we communicate as

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.600
[Amit Varma]: if the only purpose of communication is to express ourselves.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, to say what we have to say without thinking of the other person and what value

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.440
[Amit Varma]: our communication or our writing as it were, provides to them.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, while doing the podcast, which is a long form interview podcast, and I've

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:52.240
[Amit Varma]: only done it for three years, not 14 years like you, one of the sort of areas of communication

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.240
[Amit Varma]: I realized was that, you know, the biggest trap that you can fall into when you're interviewing

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.200
[Amit Varma]: someone is to make it about you.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Instead, you have to learn to just take a step back and listen.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And you've described, you know, you wrote a piece where you, you know, took off from

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.480
[Amit Varma]: Jordan Peterson's 12 rules, and you wrote your own 12 rules.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.440
[Amit Varma]: And the first of them was about how you have to enjoy saying, I don't know, and, you know,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.240
[Amit Varma]: not listen to others merely to, you know, respond to whatever they are saying with what

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.360
[Amit Varma]: you want to say, but actually step back and try to understand.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and this is something that kind of has a dual relevance.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.920
[Amit Varma]: One is obviously the personal one that when you started podcasting, you know, what was

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.180
[Amit Varma]: the sort of attention you started paying to this, like, do you think that you would at

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:41.040
[Amit Varma]: any level intellectually or otherwise be a different person if you'd never done the podcast?

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.400
[Amit Varma]: Did having all of these conversations make a difference?

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.920
[Guest]: Well, we talked earlier about the intellectual impact on me.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.280
[Guest]: I think there is a personal impact that I think you're getting at with this, these insights

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.280
[Guest]: about conversation.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.640
[Guest]: And your observations caused me to think about something I don't think I've ever thought

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:04.080
[Guest]: about, which is, and it's also prompted by that George Simenon quote, I've never thought

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:12.120
[Guest]: about the fact that we don't think about how to be good at conversations.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:21.800
[Guest]: I can't think of any format or any parenting idea that where we teach people or ourselves

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:27.680
[Guest]: or accept instruction or practice conversation.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.920
[Guest]: In our minds, we don't need to, because that's what we do all day long.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.920
[Guest]: We talk.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920
[Guest]: We talk to people.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:40.760
[Guest]: Listening is involuntary, right, in theory, but hearing is not, or the vice versa.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.800
[Guest]: You can hear, but you may not be listening, I think is a better way to say it.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:49.120
[Guest]: So here's something that's the most essential part of being human, one of the most, not

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.000
[Guest]: the most, the ability to be one of those two, two of those people on the face of the millions

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.680
[Guest]: and billions who are trying to share ideas.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.960
[Guest]: And it's just something that happens, we're so good at it, we don't need to practice it.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.000
[Guest]: But what's not obvious is that maybe we could be a lot better.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.440
[Guest]: And I think one of the things I've learned from EconTalk, and I think I still have a

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.160
[Guest]: lot to learn, even though I've done it for 14 years, is how to have a good conversation.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.840
[Guest]: And the reason I say that is that I've had a handful of conversations in my life that

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: I've never forgotten.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
[Guest]: We all have those.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.080
[Guest]: If we're lucky, it's a big number, relatively, but we also know that there's thousands of

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.160
[Guest]: conversations that never dent our consciousness again.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.360
[Guest]: They may be below the surface, of course, but they're literally, you couldn't bring

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:45.520
[Guest]: them up consciously, and they had no discernible impact on your thinking or behavior.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:51.200
[Guest]: But then you have the ones that are unforgettable, the ones that are transformative.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.960
[Guest]: And you can ask yourself, well, how do I have more of those?

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.120
[Guest]: And nobody talks about that.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.960
[Guest]: Maybe we ought to write a book on how to talk.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.920
[Guest]: I'm sure there are such books, but it's interesting to me that they're not like bestsellers that

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.920
[Guest]: everybody knows about and says, oh, you've got to read this.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.520
[Guest]: Books like Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, a lot of people like to talk about

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.160
[Guest]: the fact that men and women have different conversational styles.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:20.000
[Guest]: And I think men, if they're sensitive, understand that they probably should talk to women differently

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.920
[Guest]: than they talk to their male buddies.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.960
[Guest]: And women, if they're sensitive, understand that if they want to be effective as a partner,

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.080
[Guest]: spouse, friend, that they might want to talk differently to men than they talk to their

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.540
[Guest]: women buddies, friends.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:40.240
[Guest]: But this whole idea of how to talk and how to talk effectively really does come back

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:45.720
[Guest]: to this Adam Smith issue, which is, you know, I think I've written about it in that book.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.880
[Guest]: I've written about it in a few other essays.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.600
[Guest]: A lot of times, it depends on your personality, of course, but a lot of times people just

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.600
[Guest]: like to talk.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.320
[Guest]: I like to listen.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.760
[Guest]: And the idea that they're in, it comes back to the metaphor I used earlier of the dance.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.960
[Guest]: I mean, a conversation is a dance.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.040
[Guest]: So if I'm a dancer with a partner and all I'm thinking about are my moves, not much

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.040
[Guest]: of it.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040
[Guest]: I'm not a good dancer.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:13.680
[Guest]: So I think the opportunity to certainly be a better listener, but more than a better

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.840
[Guest]: listener, to be a more engaged conversationalist is an art that we really could get a lot better

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840
[Guest]: at.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.240
[Guest]: I know that my favorite interviews on EconTalk are the ones where there's magic.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.000
[Guest]: That doesn't happen often enough, where, you know, we just had one for me just now, this

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.600
[Guest]: idea that we don't get trained in conversation.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.120
[Guest]: That to me is the high point of this conversation, because I hadn't thought about that.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.480
[Guest]: And the only reason I thought about it is you said something that stimulated it in me.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:46.000
[Guest]: And I think when you feel that in a conversation, the novelty either of your insight you didn't

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:54.080
[Guest]: have before or an insight of your fellow conversationalist, that's when you really feel that delight that's

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.040
[Guest]: possible at a good conversation.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:02.560
[Guest]: I think most people think of conversation as people taking turns talking.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.200
[Guest]: It's not what it is.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.920
[Guest]: That's a mediocre conversation.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.360
[Guest]: It's better than people talking at the same time or one person doing almost all the talking.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.560
[Guest]: And if you're the host, you're letting me do most of the talking.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:19.360
[Guest]: I try to give my guests the same respect and floor that you're giving me, which I appreciate.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.520
[Guest]: But I think there are a handful of times in my life where I've been able to step back

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.560
[Guest]: and remember that it isn't all about me.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:33.000
[Guest]: And the more I do that, the better conversation I have, the more alive I feel, the more I

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
[Guest]: learn.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.720
[Guest]: So I think there's a lot to be said there, a lot to think about.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud here, but do you think it could then be said that becoming

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:48.640
[Amit Varma]: better at conversation, which I think we both define as being more mindful of the other

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:54.600
[Amit Varma]: person and not just being, you know, engrossed in ourselves, that becoming better at conversation

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.240
[Amit Varma]: would make us better people and have a moral impact in the sense that, you know, I go back

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.960
[Amit Varma]: to Kant, another philosopher you've referenced in your book on Adam Smith, where Kant's,

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, the second categorical imperative is all about not treating another person as

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.280
[Amit Varma]: a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.640
[Amit Varma]: And what happens is that very often, if you are in conversation, but you're obsessed about

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.680
[Amit Varma]: what you want to say in your point of view, and you're not really listening, you are treating

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:24.320
[Amit Varma]: them as a means to an end as a vessel into which you empty your thoughts or whatever.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.640
[Amit Varma]: But if you can learn that sort of mindfulness and regard for the other person where you're

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.000
[Amit Varma]: really listening and taking in their views and trying to, you know, open your own mind

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.960
[Amit Varma]: through that, then possibly you're fulfilling that categorical imperative.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I don't know if I'm taking this thought a bit too far.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.160
[Guest]: No, no.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160
[Guest]: I think it's a deep truth.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.600
[Guest]: I think it's really incredibly important.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:52.760
[Guest]: I want to raise a variation on this issue, which seems to be unrelated, but it's not,

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.360
[Guest]: which is silence.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:06.080
[Guest]: You know, I talked to Ryan Holiday about Marina Abramovich, the performance artist, where

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:12.960
[Guest]: she did this exhibit performance where she would sit for, I think it was eight hours

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:20.180
[Guest]: a day, and strangers would sit three feet across from her and stare and look at her.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.200
[Guest]: She would look back at them.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.200
[Guest]: No talking.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:30.880
[Guest]: So for eight hours a day or so, she didn't talk at all.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:38.200
[Guest]: And she engaged visually with another human being without words, which should be the most

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest]: boring thing in the world.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.840
[Guest]: And, you know, people lined up overnight to be one of the people to be able to, she did

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.880
[Guest]: this for months, by the way, which is also extraordinary.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:52.120
[Guest]: It's an incredible performance of stamina and devotion.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.200
[Guest]: But on the surface, it's just like, what a stupid, that's just like a really, just a

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.880
[Guest]: ginormous waste of time, what's the point of looking at somebody for 15 minutes or half

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880
[Guest]: an hour?

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.560
[Guest]: You don't talking.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.880
[Guest]: And yet, many of the people who she sat across from would just cry because they were seen,

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880
[Guest]: right?

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880
[Guest]: It's not.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.840
[Guest]: So I think, you know, it's a very interesting thing in the English language.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.920
[Guest]: We talked about hearing versus listening.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:23.220
[Guest]: There's also watching and seeing or looking and saying, so I look at you and that makes

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.400
[Guest]: you feel good because you're being looked at.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.280
[Guest]: But I can look at you in a way that makes you feel seen and I can look at you in a way

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.280
[Guest]: that doesn't convey that.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.680
[Guest]: And there's a, I'm going to give you a bizarro digression, but it speaks to me.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:45.360
[Guest]: I was watching, this is so tawdry, I mean, I was watching a clip from the Academy Awards

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:53.240
[Guest]: a couple of years ago, when Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga sang the song from A Star is

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240
[Guest]: Born.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.080
[Guest]: He's called The Shallow.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest]: And in the movie, it's the best, to my mind, it's the best.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.800
[Guest]: I didn't like that movie at all.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.520
[Guest]: I thought it was horribly flawed.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.800
[Guest]: But the first 45 minutes is unbelievable and it's great.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:10.360
[Guest]: And the best moment in that movie for me is when Lady Gaga, who's been trying to start

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:16.000
[Guest]: her songwriting career, is invited to come on stage, just a little throwaway thing in

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.440
[Guest]: the middle of a concert and sing the song, I think, that she's written.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:27.680
[Guest]: And she's a very good actress and she conveys an ease and nervousness.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.760
[Guest]: And over those three minutes, she becomes more confident.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.560
[Guest]: And to me, the greatest moment in that is that there's a moment where Bradley Cooper

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:44.600
[Guest]: looks over at her and has pure joy that the audience loves her.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600
[Guest]: And he loves her, too.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.400
[Guest]: You know, that's part of the show, part of the idea of the movie.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.680
[Guest]: He's not saying anything, he's not saying, oh, you're doing great, just looking at her.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.640
[Guest]: But the way he looks at her, and he's a great actor, the way he looks at her tells her it's

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.480
[Guest]: worth a thousand words.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:05.240
[Guest]: So they recreated that, not recreated, they also sang that song at the Academy Awards.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.800
[Guest]: And the most entertaining part of that, to me, is the way they look at each other.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.800
[Guest]: And they're actors, they're obviously not, it's not a, might not be a real moment of

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800
[Guest]: human interaction.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:24.120
[Guest]: But the reason it moves us is because we recognize the emotion and importance and humanity of

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:28.300
[Guest]: being seen and being paid attention to.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.240
[Guest]: And that connection is so precious.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.680
[Guest]: So I think it's a deep part of morality, and I think, you know, to tie back to what we're

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:42.200
[Guest]: talking about before, I think being able to see the challenges of people in difficult

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:49.440
[Guest]: situations, whether it's their safety or the way they move through their neighborhoods

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.640
[Guest]: or their economic challenges or hardship, if you don't notice those things, you're not

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.640
[Guest]: a full person.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.680
[Guest]: It's not enough to notice them because we don't always have a solution or a way to make

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.920
[Guest]: it better, obviously, it's tricky.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.920
[Guest]: But that's starting place, right?

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.440
[Guest]: It's a starting place.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.120
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'm going to come back to morality.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.480
[Amit Varma]: But just to take a small digression, you know, first of all, that's a lovely song.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And if you go on YouTube, what I you know, I haven't seen the film, but I really got

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:21.160
[Amit Varma]: into that song, because there are some great cover versions of it on YouTube by, you know,

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.160
[Amit Varma]: different talented people.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So it's like, yeah, so you should search for some of those as one by a bunch of school

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.200
[Amit Varma]: kids, some school choir, which is quite terrific, I'll link it from the show notes, in fact.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.560
[Amit Varma]: But what got me thinking was also the moment that you've pointed out that Bradley Cooper

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.920
[Amit Varma]: looks across at her, and he's happy for her success that she's singing and the crowd is

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920
[Amit Varma]: into it.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And she's happy for her.

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.840
[Amit Varma]: And in your book, you quoted, you know, Gore Vidal, as saying that every time a friend

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.960
[Amit Varma]: of mine has some kind of success, or part of me dies, right.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:56.160
[Guest]: And it also and I was horrible, horrible, terrible thing to say.

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, a couple of decades ago, a friend of mine said exactly the same thing to me.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.040
[Amit Varma]: And it was while reading your book that I realized that that guy was quoting Gore Vidal.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.120
[Amit Varma]: It wasn't his own sort of sentiment.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.440
[Amit Varma]: But the you know, because I am, perhaps, you know, using the hammer of the economic way

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.880
[Amit Varma]: of thinking a little bit too much, the economic concept that came to mind was of, you know,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.200
[Amit Varma]: zero sum games that at that moment in time, and Bradley Cooper looks across at her, the

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.120
[Amit Varma]: world is not a zero sum thing to him.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Her success doesn't take anything away from him, you know, unlike Gore Vidal sort of zero

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480
[Amit Varma]: sum view.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.200
[Amit Varma]: And it, it strikes me that, you know, we evolved, our brains evolved in prehistoric times where

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.280
[Amit Varma]: we lived in small tribes, and there was tremendous scarcity.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.160
[Amit Varma]: So it's possibly natural for us to view the world in a zero sum way where somebody else

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.720
[Amit Varma]: doing well, affects our own opportunity.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we feel kind of resentful of that.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.440
[Amit Varma]: But it's not, you know, in modern times is completely irrelevant, because we live in

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:00.560
[Amit Varma]: a world which is largely positive some but I had a question to ask you, which I have

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.280
[Amit Varma]: earlier asked people and it's more a question in an Indian context, but I'm still interested

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.680
[Amit Varma]: in seeing what you think about it, which is that I think the economist Jagdish Bhagwati

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:15.840
[Amit Varma]: had once commented in 2000 or something, that in China, people tend to have a positive some

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: mindset towards interactions, where in India, it's more that they have a zero sum mindset,

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.080
[Amit Varma]: they're out to kind of exploit the other guy.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's a quote from your book on Adam Smith, which, you know, I'll just quote, where

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.720
[Amit Varma]: you're referring to, you know, Smith's usage of the term lovely by which you mean, he means

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.360
[Amit Varma]: somebody worthy of being loved, and your quote is quote, how do you create loveliness?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.200
[Amit Varma]: In some cultures, it's as if a memo went out saying, quote, there's a sucker born every

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.800
[Amit Varma]: minute, all you have to do is find such people and exploit them.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.800
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.960
[Amit Varma]: In other cultures, a memo seems to have gone out that says, quote, be a decent human being,

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.160
[Amit Varma]: it's okay to make money, but keep your word and don't exploit people in distress.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote wise.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And my sort of question here is that one sort of theory I have for why India is this way

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.840
[Amit Varma]: for, you know, why such a common tendency is to try and pull a scam to try and exploit

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:14.160
[Amit Varma]: somebody, is the institutions that we chose in our economy, post independence, where we

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.960
[Amit Varma]: had a very statist system, where the state controlled everything and gave permission

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.120
[Amit Varma]: for everything.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.200
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there was this culture of rent seeking everywhere to get anything done, like

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.040
[Amit Varma]: I grew up in the 80s and the 90s.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And I saw the change that at the 80s to get anything done, you know, to getting a telephone

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.240
[Amit Varma]: would take seven years, and you'd have to, you know, bribe somebody for it.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And that mindset, which was in our institutional arrangements, creeped into the culture, and

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.800
[Amit Varma]: it's not necessarily something inherent in the culture.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is just me thinking aloud, I don't have any sort of, I haven't done any studies

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.600
[Amit Varma]: or surveys on this.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.920
[Amit Varma]: But what would you think of, you know, culture being shaped by institutional arrangements

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920
[Amit Varma]: in such a way?

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.920
[Guest]: Does that make any kind of sense to you?

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that's a fantastic insight.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.280
[Guest]: I'm going to try to see what I can, if I can riff on it a little bit.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:12.040
[Guest]: But I wanted actually, I want to add one thing you said about zero sum and conversation and

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.680
[Guest]: the success of our friends, because I never thought it as another nice thing, I don't

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:25.080
[Guest]: think I've thought of before, which is, I think, we think of conversation as a zero

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.680
[Guest]: sum game, because if you're talking, I'm not talking.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.720
[Guest]: Just a fixed amount of airtime, right?

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.840
[Guest]: And that ignores that our dance of back and forth creates something more than just the

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.920
[Guest]: transcript of my words and your words that just alternate.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:51.080
[Guest]: And I think that's really, that whole idea that you're getting at with culture is enormously

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080
[Guest]: important.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:58.120
[Guest]: In particular, I'm thinking about, you know, I just read a book called Everything Flows

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.800
[Guest]: by Vasili Grossman.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.160
[Guest]: And there's two versions of it in English, one's called Everything Flows, one's called

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
[Guest]: Forever Flowing.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:11.280
[Guest]: It's a terribly imperfect novel, you know, he died before he could finish it.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.040
[Guest]: It's a sort of mishmash of beginnings of a novel mixed in with some essays on the Soviet

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.240
[Guest]: character, an essay on Lenin, an essay on Stalin.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.620
[Guest]: But it's an incredible read.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.680
[Guest]: And I recommend it.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.680
[Guest]: It's dark.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.680
[Guest]: It's a book of despair.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.800
[Guest]: To me, it's a must read about the modern world.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.800
[Guest]: And one of the things that you're talking about that comes to mind is how, you know,

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.520
[Guest]: if everybody has to wait seven years for a telephone, yeah, you want yours first, I got

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.520
[Guest]: to cut in line.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.960
[Guest]: I don't want to wait seven years.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.160
[Guest]: I got to get ahead of you.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.120
[Guest]: And you getting ahead of me, because if I don't, by the way, you're going to get ahead

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.040
[Guest]: – somebody else is going to get ahead of me.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:56.960
[Guest]: So that whole way of thinking is so destructive, that zero-sum.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.840
[Guest]: And the point is that in some areas of life, it is zero-sum.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.240
[Guest]: And so that's a tragedy.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.320
[Guest]: You think about right now, we're in the middle of this pandemic.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:11.320
[Guest]: I've been appalled at how badly the American economy has performed in the following sense.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.920
[Guest]: So be very careful what I mean by that.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.720
[Guest]: There's still some shortages of stuff.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.200
[Guest]: How do we understand that?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:24.760
[Guest]: This greatest economic engine, the productive capacity of the United States is enormous.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.760
[Guest]: And yet we're struggling.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.880
[Guest]: Now, there are no mask shortages anymore.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.880
[Guest]: There were in the beginning.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.600
[Guest]: And I think most of that was due to laws against prices being allowed to move freely.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.080
[Guest]: But there's just some weird products that have some funky natures to them, that everything's

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.000
[Guest]: taking longer.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.040
[Guest]: And that's just unusual, right?

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.800
[Guest]: The idea that – oh, and in the beginning, by the way, the CDC, Center for Disease Control,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.400
[Guest]: and the World Health Organization said, oh, masks don't help.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.800
[Guest]: And people say, oh, yeah, well, they're just kidding.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.320
[Guest]: They're saying that because they're afraid people are going to buy masks.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.280
[Guest]: Well, that's horrible, because they were suggesting it is a zero-sum game.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.840
[Guest]: If you buy a mask on the street, you person who lives in a house, a doctor who desperately

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.720
[Guest]: needs it more than you do won't get it.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.920
[Guest]: And the economist answers, well, let's let the price rise and let the people willing

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.800
[Guest]: to pay the most get it.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.920
[Guest]: And the non-economist says, well, that's horrible.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.680
[Guest]: I mean, there aren't enough to go around.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680
[Guest]: It's a zero-sum game.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.240
[Guest]: And you're saying the people with the most money should get it?

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.800
[Guest]: And that's not what the economist means.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.560
[Guest]: What the economist means is that it's not going to be a zero-sum game if you let the

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560
[Guest]: price rise.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.060
[Guest]: You're going to get a lot more masks if you allow it to be profitable to make masks.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.560
[Guest]: And I think that whole mindset of the way of thinking about the world is extremely important.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.200
[Guest]: And it has ramifications way beyond how you treat the person who's get, you know, whether

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:53.700
[Guest]: you bribe the person who can put the telephone in quicker and because it changes this whole

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.400
[Guest]: interpersonal interaction that we're talking about, these day-to-day interactions that

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:04.200
[Guest]: are really the essence of life, you know, the essence of life is small things, not big.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.280
[Guest]: Most of the time, we're not doing big things.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.080
[Guest]: We're talking to our wife, talking to our husband, talking to our children, talking

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080
[Guest]: to our parents.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:17.960
[Guest]: And if you have an attitude towards those interactions that's, what's in it for me?

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.060
[Guest]: That's not as good as a world, I don't think, where you're wondering how it all fits together

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.260
[Guest]: and to sometimes step back.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:30.640
[Guest]: That whole idea of stepping back, you know, come back to Bradley Cooper in that scene,

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640
[Guest]: he steps back.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:37.160
[Guest]: He lets the spotlight shine on Lady Gaga, which is the whole thing's kind of funny

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.960
[Guest]: because Lady Gaga's kind of like created the spotlight.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.880
[Guest]: But she's an actress in the movie and she's not famous.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:50.000
[Guest]: So there is some, you know, the fourth wall of the movie gets kind of transparent at that

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
[Guest]: point.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.280
[Guest]: You start thinking, is that Lady Gaga who's a nobody?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.120
[Guest]: But that whole idea of stepping back, of him saying, I'm gonna let her get the glory.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.800
[Guest]: I wrote a story, an essay, I don't know if you've seen it, called The Story of My Life.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:10.200
[Guest]: And, you know, I think we see ourselves as heroes, stars of the show, you know, the movie,

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.800
[Guest]: the movie version of my life.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.000
[Guest]: I'm the main character, right?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.880
[Guest]: And I suggest in that essay that it's really useful to think of yourself, instead of being

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:24.440
[Guest]: the star of the show, as more of an ensemble player, you know, one of the cast.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:30.200
[Guest]: And if you can put your head in that space, rather than, hey, spotlight over here.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.080
[Guest]: If you can put yourself in that space, you're gonna be a better parent, you're gonna be

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.320
[Guest]: a better friend, you're gonna be a better spouse, you're gonna be a better conversationalist.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.320
[Guest]: It's just interesting talking about your observation about being hardwired.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.080
[Guest]: We are built that way, most of us.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.640
[Guest]: Most of us aren't built to step back.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.080
[Guest]: We're built to step forward.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.000
[Guest]: And you could argue that what civilization is about is figuring out ways to encourage

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.320
[Guest]: people to, those institutions you're talking about, to encourage people to step back.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.080
[Guest]: You know, it's complicated.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm sort of going to go back to the question of our hardwiring and how we mitigate that.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.040
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, my listeners keep asking me about interviewing and the art of

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.280
[Amit Varma]: the interview and so on.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's a great quote from you that, there's a great passage that you've written that I

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.880
[Amit Varma]: just want to read out for their benefit, because I couldn't agree with it more, I think it's

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.120
[Amit Varma]: profoundly insightful.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.560
[Amit Varma]: You're right, quote, take the most basic human interaction conversation.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.440
[Amit Varma]: Everyone knows people who talk too much about themselves, hogging the conversation and taking

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.240
[Amit Varma]: more than their share of the airtime.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.000
[Amit Varma]: It's harder to notice that sometimes you are that person, we like to talk about ourselves,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.600
[Amit Varma]: we like to make our points, we have so much to say.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.700
[Amit Varma]: How many times do you answer a question in conversation and wait for another, instead

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.600
[Amit Varma]: of asking the person you're talking to about herself?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.560
[Amit Varma]: How often do you listen for understanding, rather than waiting for the other person to

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.960
[Amit Varma]: finish so you can make another point or tell another story?

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.480
[Amit Varma]: How would an imaginary spectator judge your conversational style, imagining an impartial

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.640
[Amit Varma]: spectator can help you turn your conversation into more of a dance and less an exercise

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:10.520
[Amit Varma]: in taking turns, a dialogue rather than competing monologues, stop quote, and of course, by

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.400
[Amit Varma]: impartial spectator, you're invoking Smith himself who sort of use that term, I want

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.080
[Amit Varma]: to sort of come back to our hardwiring because you know, a thought that's always struck me

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:27.160
[Amit Varma]: and one way in which you know, humans are unique is that it's turned out by accident

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.020
[Amit Varma]: that our hardwiring allows us to fight itself.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.040
[Amit Varma]: We are the only species which is always trying to mitigate the way we are wired in different

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040
[Amit Varma]: ways.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.400
[Amit Varma]: We are not wired to care about ourselves and to be tribalistic, but we learn and of course,

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.800
[Amit Varma]: we have competing instincts as well.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And we are wired in a bunch of different contradictory ways.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.840
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of the ways that we consider harmful the tribalism, the sort of selfishness, we

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.880
[Amit Varma]: learn to mitigate that through culture, we build these norms that this is what we should

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
[Amit Varma]: do.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, if you go to a restaurant, even if you're never going there again, we will

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.240
[Amit Varma]: tip because there's no self interest.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.680
[Amit Varma]: It's just a normative thing.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.560
[Amit Varma]: We vote in elections because it's a normative thing.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:12.280
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of the sort of the growth of humanity, especially, perhaps since the Enlightenment

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.160
[Amit Varma]: is figuring out ways in which nurture can mitigate nature.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And of course, it often reinforces nature as well.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I had, I think until a few years ago, naively assumed that this is an inevitable

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.840
[Amit Varma]: process that will continue fighting this battle, and sort of winning it that the arc of history

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.600
[Amit Varma]: will go in a particular good direction, whether it's towards liberty or towards justice or

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600
[Amit Varma]: whatever.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.640
[Amit Varma]: But in our modern times, you know, we discussed earlier in the show how the tribalistic that

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.880
[Amit Varma]: discourse has become how it's so polarized, no one's talking to each other anymore, everyone's

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.800
[Amit Varma]: talking past each other.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, without taking names, you look at the politics in your country or the politics

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.920
[Amit Varma]: in my country, and suddenly you feel like the world is going backward very fast.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.720
[Amit Varma]: So how do you look upon this?

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Because I just feel profoundly disillusioned that I thought, okay, this is like the defining

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.320
[Amit Varma]: battle of our species, we'll beat our hardwiring in all these different ways.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.840
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly the worst aspects of it are getting reinforced.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.160
[Guest]: Boy, I don't know, I'm not sure I have anything to say about that.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.480
[Guest]: You know, I think a lot about my own hardwiring.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.520
[Guest]: It's weird, we're hardwired as a species.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.960
[Guest]: But I get a few special things in my brain, and you have different special ones in yours

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.400
[Guest]: that aren't the same as mine to overcome.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.760
[Guest]: You know, we all have our own, everybody's flawed, but our flaws are all a little bit

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.000
[Guest]: different.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.360
[Guest]: We share some common flaws, but we get our own dose of it, our own variation, our own

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.680
[Guest]: style of flaw.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.320
[Guest]: And I've been thinking lately about this, it's, I don't know if I'm going to answer

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.320
[Guest]: your question, Amit, this might just be off the deep end, but I've been thinking lately

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:57.600
[Guest]: about my two selves, the self that's hardwired and the other self.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:06.360
[Guest]: So to give a simple version, it's five o'clock, maybe it's 5.30, I'm going to be eating

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:13.080
[Guest]: dinner pretty soon, but I want to eat something, just, I don't know why, I'm not hungry really.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:21.160
[Guest]: But my head says, grab a handful of peanuts or eat a banana or what it really wants is

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.120
[Guest]: a bowl of ice cream, but I'm not that depraved.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:33.840
[Guest]: But my mind, a set of habits that I've developed over time of snacking, say, go for it.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.960
[Guest]: And it's interesting, there's one level, so we're talking about this overcoming our

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.840
[Guest]: hardwires, that's where I'm trying to get at.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:49.280
[Guest]: At one level I can say, oh, I have an urge for food that's not really hunger-based, but

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.200
[Guest]: I eat it anyway most of the time, right?

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.200
[Guest]: Weird.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.280
[Guest]: I'm aware that I'm doing something I don't really want to do, but I do it anyway.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.840
[Guest]: But being aware is a starting point, that's a good thing.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:07.120
[Guest]: But sometimes I'm trying this new trick where I say, that's not me, this is a very common

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:13.960
[Guest]: theme in Buddhism, I see it in Judaism as well, certain thematic ideas of this sort

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960
[Guest]: of split self.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.240
[Guest]: And when you can step, this comes back to the impartial specter a little bit, when you

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.000
[Guest]: step outside yourself and say, oh, I don't want to be that guy that's snacking, or I

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.840
[Guest]: don't, that's a trivial example, I don't want to be that guy who gets irritated.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:35.800
[Guest]: Let's say something that annoys you, not an injustice, but something that just annoys

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800
[Guest]: you.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.000
[Guest]: It might be traffic, habit of a friend, just something that gets on your nerves.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.720
[Guest]: And you think, if you step outside yourself, you go like, well, that's stupid, that's not

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.840
[Guest]: important, why is that bothering me?

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.360
[Guest]: And how hard that is to do, why is that so hard?

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.440
[Guest]: So I really think, I think that, I like to say that being grown up is learning how to

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.480
[Guest]: be aware of those things and fight against them.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.840
[Guest]: And I think, now to come back to your more serious part of your question, and to bring

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:12.360
[Guest]: it back to your question of a minute ago, institutions, in theory, can help you become

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.960
[Guest]: more civilized, or they can push you the other way.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.480
[Guest]: And right now in America, maybe in India, institutions are pushing us away from civilization.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.680
[Guest]: And the problem with institutions is, they're not designed, they emerge.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.960
[Guest]: You can't just say, I want to fix that, I'm going to stop that institution.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.520
[Guest]: A better way to say it is, there are certain norms of behavior that have become standard

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.160
[Guest]: that those are bad norms, like, and then how do you reverse them?

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.760
[Guest]: A lot of people have been writing some depressing, but I think thoughtful quotes, I don't remember

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.440
[Guest]: where they're from, who said them, but they're basically things like, it might take centuries

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.920
[Guest]: to build up a habit of a culture.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.240
[Guest]: You could destroy them in a month, and you can't build them back in a month, takes another

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240
[Guest]: few centuries.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.880
[Guest]: I feel like we've torn down a lot of useful things recently, like that, interactions.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.760
[Guest]: So I'm very worried about that.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.720
[Guest]: Like you, I used to be much more optimistic about the arc of history, turning, tending

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.080
[Guest]: towards justice or truth or civility.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:19.000
[Guest]: And my new quote, which is, my depressing quote is, the veneer of civilization is thin.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.160
[Guest]: Not that much separating us from a much darker set of behaviors.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:30.460
[Guest]: And I think, depending on what circles you travel in, there's a naivete about the security

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:36.200
[Guest]: of the world we live in and how persistent and reliable it is.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.760
[Guest]: A lot of this could go south.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.320
[Guest]: This pandemic's exposing a lot of problems like that.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.760
[Guest]: Certainly the response in America, these issues of race are very much in flux of how they're

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760
[Guest]: going to, where they're going to go.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.760
[Guest]: I don't know where they're going to go.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.920
[Guest]: Or more importantly, our national narrative, you know, what does it mean to be an American?

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.720
[Guest]: What does it mean, what is the American narrative?

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.400
[Guest]: And there's more than one.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:08.240
[Guest]: And when you don't share one, and you don't respect the other person's narrative, it's

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.360
[Guest]: hard to have a country.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.240
[Guest]: So those are the things that bother me.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.960
[Guest]: But to come back to your other question, I think, just at the personal level, it's just

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.000
[Guest]: really hard to overcome our hardwiring.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.960
[Guest]: Being aware of it, as you say, is a remarkable human trait.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.360
[Guest]: No squirrel thinks, you know, I really shouldn't be eating that bird food.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.880
[Guest]: That's for the birds.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.120
[Guest]: He gets on that bird feeder with zeal.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.600
[Guest]: He is so excited to be on that bird feeder.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600
[Guest]: That's a squirrel.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600
[Guest]: We don't want to be squirrels.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600
[Guest]: We want to be human beings.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.680
[Guest]: And yet, we got a squirrel side that's pushing us that way all the time.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And one could argue that another trait that we have, which other species possibly don't

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.760
[Amit Varma]: have, and you've devoted a chapter to this trait in your book on Adam Smith as well,

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.760
[Amit Varma]: is that of self-deception.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:58.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's a great quote by Smith from the Theory of Moral Sentiments, where he says,

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.320
[Amit Varma]: quote, the violence and injustice of our own selfish passions are sometimes sufficient

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.640
[Amit Varma]: to induce a man within the breast to make a report very different from what the real

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:15.480
[Amit Varma]: circumstances of the case are capable of authorizing, stop quote, and a slightly oldish language.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:21.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the broad sense is that we are constantly deluding ourselves.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And a tangential question, are we deluding ourselves to the extent that there is no free

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.000
[Amit Varma]: will, but we behave as if there is?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.680
[Guest]: Well, I can't, I don't think I have anything useful to say about that.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.880
[Amit Varma]: But which side of the free will debate do you fall into?

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:41.240
[Guest]: I tend to be on the pro-free will side, you know, you know, what's the joke?

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.600
[Guest]: Of course, I believe in free will, I don't have a choice.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.160
[Guest]: But I think that's some truth in that joke, obviously.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.400
[Guest]: We certainly feel like we have free will.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.640
[Guest]: We know that feeling because, you know, I mentioned the snacking challenge.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.160
[Guest]: There are times in my life when I say no to a snack.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.040
[Guest]: So it means it's possible.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.680
[Guest]: I don't fully understand what those times are, or how to get more of them.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.040
[Guest]: And it could just be that those are just moments when there's a set of chemicals going on that

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.920
[Guest]: I don't control, but it feels like I control them for sure.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.480
[Guest]: And I lost the track of what your first part was.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.520
[Amit Varma]: I kind of began to ask a question and ended in an aside.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.480
[Amit Varma]: So I'll kind of finish the rest of the question, which is, you know, a theory that I've had

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.200
[Amit Varma]: is that to be good at anything is necessary to be self delusional, because otherwise,

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.200
[Amit Varma]: we don't begin doing something because we suck at it.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we never get good at anything, because we don't iterate enough to learn from

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400
[Amit Varma]: practice.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400
[Amit Varma]: But that's an aside.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.600
[Amit Varma]: But my question is that, you know, through your long intellectual journey that has taken

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.360
[Amit Varma]: all of these decades, and you mentioned about how you grew intellectually through the conversations

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.600
[Amit Varma]: you had on econ talk, the more than 700 episodes, looking back at yourself, do you think that

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.920
[Amit Varma]: there are times where you were self delusional in some way or the other?

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of managed to take a step back?

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And now you look at things differently?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm sorry, that question sounds rude.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.760
[Guest]: It's not intended.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760
[Guest]: No, no, I know.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760
[Guest]: I understand.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:11.160
[Guest]: And I think the I see my dark side on Twitter, when someone says something that I think is

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.680
[Guest]: wrong.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.740
[Guest]: And I jumped to announce that it's wrong.

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:21.480
[Guest]: And I failed to see if it's taken out of context, if it's, you know, or I retweet something

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.720
[Guest]: and then later realize that was a terrible study that why would I retweet that?

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.720
[Guest]: Oh, because it confirmed my attitude toward the pandemic.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.920
[Guest]: That's why.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:35.640
[Guest]: So I think it's, we all have this self delusion problem.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.780
[Guest]: You know, I can't, I won't get the quote right.

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:43.280
[Guest]: But Smith says something like, bold is the surgeon whose hand does not tremble when he

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.040
[Guest]: operates upon himself.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:51.240
[Amit Varma]: That is, you know, I have it, I'll read it out.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.520
[Amit Varma]: Smith says, quote, he is a bold surgeon, they say, whose hand does not tremble when he performs

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.180
[Amit Varma]: an operation upon his own person.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And he is often equally bold, who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil of

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.880
[Amit Varma]: self delusion, which covers from his view, the deformities of his own conduct.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:13.320
[Guest]: Yeah, we don't like to see those deformities, or we revel in those deformities, and we become

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.800
[Guest]: dysfunctional because we see ourselves as failures.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.480
[Guest]: That's a tough road to navigate.

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.640
[Guest]: We don't want to be overly confident.

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.920
[Guest]: But we also don't want to have such low self esteem that we can't be effective.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.740
[Guest]: You talked earlier about a minute ago about the challenge of, I will call it the challenge

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:32.740
[Guest]: of ineptitude.

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:38.640
[Guest]: You start off playing an instrument or learning a language or almost any skill, as you point

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.640
[Guest]: out.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:46.400
[Guest]: And I've been playing a lot of chess online, at chess.com, chess.com gives you a score

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.500
[Guest]: for it's bad enough that there's winners and losers, pretty much a zero sum game in chess.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:58.360
[Guest]: But they give you a score so you can see how am I doing, which seems like a good thing.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.360
[Guest]: That's like, oh my gosh, I lost that game.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360
[Guest]: I had checkmate.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360
[Guest]: I missed it.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.360
[Guest]: And I lost eight points.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.920
[Guest]: It's like, what do you do?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.920
[Guest]: What's wrong with you?

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.440
[Guest]: Why are you doing that to yourself?

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:19.000
[Guest]: So I think it's very hard, very hard for us to, you know, to suffer through the feeling

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.800
[Guest]: of inadequacy that comes when you tackle something new.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.040
[Guest]: And we're afraid of those things.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.040
[Guest]: We don't want to deal with that.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.480
[Guest]: Why would I want to feel bad about myself?

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.480
[Guest]: So we shy away.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.440
[Guest]: I was back to earlier conversation about inappropriate remarks and cancel culture.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.200
[Guest]: I don't want to be seen as one of those people.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.840
[Guest]: I better keep quiet.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.760
[Guest]: And similarly, I don't want to be seen as incompetent.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.720
[Guest]: I better not try to do that because I'll just be bad at it.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720
[Guest]: That kills growth.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.080
[Guest]: That kills exploration.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.680
[Guest]: That's a terrible handicap.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.280
[Guest]: I should not fool myself and go try out for the National Basketball Association, the NBA.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.400
[Guest]: I'm five foot six and 65 years old and don't have much athletic ability.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:06.180
[Guest]: So that would be, it's smart to not try to be a professional basketball player.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.160
[Guest]: But it's fun to learn, get a little better at chess.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.360
[Guest]: I'm kind of enjoying it.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.240
[Guest]: But you know, for a while I had a really low score and my kids laughed at me.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.440
[Guest]: So this comes back to that observation that you quoted of mine where I said, don't be

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.960
[Guest]: afraid to say, I don't know.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:26.480
[Guest]: Once you are comfortable saying, I don't know, it's very liberating.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.120
[Guest]: And similarly, we're talking now about the comfort of saying, yeah, I'm not that good

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120
[Guest]: at that.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.040
[Guest]: We don't like to admit that to ourselves.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040
[Guest]: Sometimes it's false modesty.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.360
[Guest]: Sometimes, of course, we're really good at it.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.200
[Guest]: We just say that to try to look modest.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.520
[Guest]: But there are a lot of things I do badly that I still enjoy.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.120
[Guest]: And I love the progress and the getting better part of it.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.840
[Guest]: I think that's an important part of the human enterprise.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.680
[Guest]: So I think that's a really interesting insight that we don't like to be reminded of our own

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.040
[Guest]: failures and incompetencies.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.840
[Guest]: You know, one more thought, I'm sorry I'm rambling, but there's this really interesting

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:05.320
[Guest]: idea of the imposter syndrome, this idea that people are going to figure out that you don't

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.320
[Guest]: know what you're doing.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.280
[Guest]: None of us know what we're doing.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.920
[Guest]: We're all imposters to some extent.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.760
[Guest]: We're all brave.

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:22.400
[Guest]: We're all wearing this armor to keep us from being revealed of our true mix of imperfection.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.880
[Guest]: And that's a bad way to go through life.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:31.960
[Guest]: And I understand how hard it is to be revealed that your true self, like Smith says.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.800
[Guest]: But most of us could use a little more of it.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.240
[Guest]: I think it's probably a good thing.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I play a lot on chess.com as well, though, under a pseudonym and a girl's avatar.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.400
[Amit Varma]: So I get hit on a lot as well by horny Indian boys.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And a couple of thoughts before I sort of move on to the great sociological insight

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.120
[Amit Varma]: though, right?

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Because how else would I get that insight?

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.040
[Amit Varma]: And one is that, you know, therefore, it kind of strikes me thinking aloud that self delusion

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.320
[Amit Varma]: might actually in some ways be a feature, not a bug.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.240
[Amit Varma]: If you're not hardwired with it, how do we cope with the complexity of the world and

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.640
[Amit Varma]: the complexity of whatever we try to do?

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And there's also something called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which, you know, works two ways.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.880
[Amit Varma]: One of the ways, of course, is that people who are incompetent don't know enough to know

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.160
[Amit Varma]: how incompetent they are.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.520
[Amit Varma]: So they think they are better than they otherwise would be.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.360
[Amit Varma]: But the other side is that people who are extremely good, they imagine because it's

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.360
[Amit Varma]: so easy for them, they imagine that it must be easy for others also.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And they are probably the ones more likely to suffer from the imposter effect.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, sort of what you said about Twitter kind of brings me to my next question, because

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I sort of see the worst side of myself on Twitter as well, where somebody will say something

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.560
[Amit Varma]: so rude or so stupid or so outrageous that I kind of, you know, these days, I try to

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.480
[Amit Varma]: stop myself from tweeting reactively and, you know, just let it go.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:56.200
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing there is that the cost for someone entering that kind of conversation,

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:01.040
[Amit Varma]: the person who's making the tweet or trolling me or calling me names or whatever, is literally

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040
[Amit Varma]: zero.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.400
[Amit Varma]: There is practically no cost there as well, while typically in the real world, you enter

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.720
[Amit Varma]: a conversation, there is a cost to it.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And part of what enables it is technology and the access to gadgets that we have, which

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.400
[Amit Varma]: brings me to a related question.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.560
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, another Adam Smith quote from the theory of moral sentiments,

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.520
[Amit Varma]: where Smith writes, and this is 250 years ago, and he could be talking about cell phones,

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.440
[Amit Varma]: quote, how many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of frivolous

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440
[Amit Varma]: utility?

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.720
[Amit Varma]: What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility as the aptness of the machines

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.320
[Amit Varma]: which are fitted to promote it.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.120
[Amit Varma]: All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.520
[Amit Varma]: They contrive new pockets unknown in the clothes of other people in order to carry a greater

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.240
[Amit Varma]: number, stop code.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And my question here is that it strikes me that, in a sense, we are shaped by our gadgets.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.840
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, neuroscientists have found that every time we are in deep concentration

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.840
[Amit Varma]: at some kind of work, and we are distracted by something, it takes, you know, more than

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:08.520
[Amit Varma]: 20 minutes to get back into that state of deep concentration.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.040
[Amit Varma]: And because we are surrounded by distractions all the time, because we are seeking out the

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.400
[Amit Varma]: dopamine rushes of the Twitter notifications and the Facebook likes, that we are constantly

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.040
[Amit Varma]: in a state of shallow concentration.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, where we could once pursue deep learning or deep conversations, we now

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.000
[Amit Varma]: have to make do with shallow knowledge where we'll click something on social media or react

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
[Amit Varma]: to a headline.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if you're interested in a subject, quickly scan the Wikipedia page rather than

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.640
[Amit Varma]: read actual books.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And this shows through in our conversations.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And my question is, as an educator, which is, you know, a part of your persona, we haven't

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.000
[Amit Varma]: really explored enough today, and maybe we'll leave it for another day.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.760
[Amit Varma]: But as an educator, do you find that that changed the way people learn?

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Do you see that in your students, for example, is that another competitor for, you know,

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.760
[Amit Varma]: their attention along with what you're what you're teaching?

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Does it make a difference to how we accumulate knowledge and learning?

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.240
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.240
[Guest]: That's a deep question.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.240
[Guest]: Right.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240
[Guest]: It's hard to know.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.240
[Guest]: Hard to measure those things.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.120
[Guest]: I think education is part of the issue.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.800
[Guest]: The other part is the conversational part you're talking about, the fact that, you know,

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.800
[Guest]: you and I are having this conversation.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.680
[Guest]: I think it's very high quality.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.480
[Guest]: By the way, I'm really enjoying it tremendously.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.400
[Guest]: You asked me to be on your program for two to three hours, and I thought, oh, that sounds

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.400
[Guest]: horrible.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.400
[Guest]: Two to three hours.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.520
[Guest]: That's too long.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.160
[Guest]: But I'm really enjoying it.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.000
[Guest]: And one of the reasons I'm enjoying it is that my cell phone is on airplane mode, and

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.840
[Guest]: I have not looked at it since we started talking.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.560
[Guest]: That doesn't happen in real life anymore.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.240
[Guest]: I don't talk to anybody for an hour without looking at a cell phone.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.040
[Guest]: Well, I do on EconTalk.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:50.960
[Guest]: But outside of these kind of conversations, when is the last time in my casual life that

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.920
[Guest]: I go that long without looking at my phone?

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.920
[Guest]: Not that often.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.420
[Guest]: Now, I keep the Jewish Sabbath.

01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:02.400
[Guest]: So for 25 hours a week, from sunset on Friday to dark on Saturday, I do not look at my phone.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.280
[Guest]: So I have to add that footnote.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.640
[Guest]: And I think that's very valuable.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.960
[Guest]: I encourage people to keep a Sabbath of technology of some kind.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:15.880
[Guest]: It's a lot easier to keep it, though, if you think it's part of a servant of the divine.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.880
[Guest]: It's hard to do.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.720
[Guest]: It's just sort of a habit you've adopted, in my experience, anyway.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.080
[Guest]: But that degrades, that constant checking.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.240
[Guest]: I've turned off most of my notifications.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.240
[Guest]: That's not what distracts me.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.360
[Guest]: It's just the phones being there.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:37.800
[Guest]: So we talk at different times about, oh, I should put my phone away during dinner.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.480
[Guest]: I don't consult my phone during dinner, except that's not 100% true.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.040
[Guest]: Sometimes we'll be talking about something, and some question will come up, and I'll just

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.960
[Guest]: Google it real quickly, or I'll check the weather.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.680
[Guest]: Because I wonder what it's going to be like this week.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680
[Guest]: What should we do?

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.200
[Guest]: Instead of just saying, I'll check the weather later, I check it now.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200
[Guest]: It's hard to wait.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.720
[Guest]: Delayed gratification of that kind has become very difficult.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.360
[Guest]: And then what if I forget?

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.720
[Guest]: What if I don't check the weather when I'm done talking about it later?

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.320
[Guest]: There's no consequence to that at all, really, ever.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.800
[Guest]: I'm going to check it when I'm about to go out, and I'll know whether to take the umbrella

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.760
[Guest]: or the thicker coat or whatever.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.080
[Guest]: So the whole thing is kind of silly.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.240
[Guest]: It's a compulsive addiction.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.680
[Guest]: So I think to come back to our earlier conversation about conversation, I think what technology

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.440
[Guest]: has done is it's made some of the conversations harder, and it's made some easier.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:31.080
[Guest]: We wouldn't be having this conversation if it weren't for Twitter and Zoom and podcasting

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.560
[Guest]: and iTunes and all the things that came before this and my headset, and it's an extraordinary

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:41.440
[Guest]: amount of technology that's making the quality—and by the way, you and I are looking at each

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:47.920
[Guest]: other on Zoom, muted, while we're recording this on Zencaster, and you think about what

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:54.680
[Guest]: a gift that is that we can interact visually 10,000, 12,000 miles apart.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.680
[Guest]: That's extraordinary.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:01.760
[Guest]: So, you know, but the optimistic side of me says that norms will emerge about how to use

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:08.080
[Guest]: our phones and how to interact with technology that will help make it better.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.960
[Guest]: But it's a real mixed bag.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.600
[Amit Varma]: There's no doubt about it.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.280
[Amit Varma]: And how do you think this will impact education in the long run?

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Because of this pandemic, people are now getting so much more used to Zoom classes, for example.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.380
[Amit Varma]: And I know that just being on Zoom for a couple of hours is just more exhausting than being

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.380
[Amit Varma]: somewhere in person.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.200
[Guest]: Yeah, it's very hard.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:34.000
[Guest]: I think that the real problem with Zoom right now and remote education like this is the—you

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.360
[Guest]: know, when you're in a class of 50 people, 100 people, and there's—let's call it just

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.360
[Guest]: a webinar.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360
[Guest]: You're in a webinar.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:46.760
[Guest]: You're not in a normal Zoom call of, say, four or five people at a meeting.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:49.080
[Guest]: You're listening to somebody who's teaching something.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.320
[Guest]: How many people are actually listening with anything close to 100% focus?

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.400
[Guest]: Everybody's checking their email.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.400
[Guest]: Oh, but not that much.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.400
[Guest]: It's OK.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.400
[Guest]: I didn't check it that much.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.120
[Guest]: I mean, that's a big problem.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.400
[Guest]: You know, when I give a lecture in person, I know when people are paying attention and

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.400
[Guest]: when they're not.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.400
[Guest]: I know when they're daydreaming.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:09.680
[Guest]: They're not checking their phone usually in a lecture I'm giving, either rude or they're

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.560
[Guest]: actually interested.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.120
[Guest]: But I know when they're paying attention, even if they're not using their phone, they

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.720
[Guest]: could still be not paying attention.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720
[Guest]: I can feel it.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.160
[Guest]: A good speaker knows when they've captured the attention of the audience.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:30.760
[Guest]: And in classes today, almost nobody's paying attention, really, 100% full attention engaged.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:36.160
[Guest]: It's really hard to do for us as one of many participants.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.560
[Guest]: So I think that's got a lot of limits right now.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:45.920
[Guest]: When I lecture in educational programs, I ask people to turn off their phone.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.760
[Guest]: But a lot of people say, well, I want to take notes on my laptop.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.360
[Guest]: Well, OK.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:53.960
[Guest]: But that's really hard, really hard to take notes on your laptop and not go check the

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:57.520
[Guest]: weather, your email, Twitter, Instagram, whatever.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.280
[Guest]: I think it's a real challenge.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:06.060
[Guest]: So it's interesting, again, technology has so much potential, I think, to allow large

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:09.040
[Guest]: groups of people to learn from great teachers.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.440
[Guest]: And yet we've not really figured that out yet.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.000
[Guest]: So I think mainly it's degrading education right now, not enhancing it.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.160
[Guest]: Having said that, in the pandemic, it's been a lifesaver, a world saver to be able to continue

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.440
[Guest]: to interact with people.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.160
[Guest]: If you think about forget the gains of information and knowledge that people have been able to

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.480
[Guest]: use to reduce the worst effects of the pandemic, but just the ability to still stay connected

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.480
[Guest]: to other human beings.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.920
[Guest]: I mean, I don't think we can imagine what it was like to be part of the plague in medieval

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.960
[Guest]: times where you couldn't leave your house.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.800
[Guest]: And remember, when you were stuck in your house, there wasn't any Internet, so you didn't

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.280
[Guest]: know what was happening anywhere else.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.680
[Guest]: You know, part of the thing I found so interesting about the pandemic is that we don't know when

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.000
[Guest]: it's going to end.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.680
[Guest]: So it's giving us a tiny taste of what it's like to be in war.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:05.360
[Guest]: In war, you know, you can lose, but even if you win, when's it going to end?

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.600
[Guest]: When do we get normal life back?

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600
[Guest]: When can I go out at night?

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:13.360
[Guest]: You know, when the bombs are falling and you know death is lurking, you want it to end

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.640
[Guest]: and you could deal with it better if you said, okay, it's horrible right now, but in six

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.760
[Guest]: weeks it's over.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.760
[Guest]: But it's not.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.080
[Guest]: We don't know when it's over.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.360
[Guest]: We don't know when the last day is.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.660
[Guest]: So that's really, really hard.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.600
[Guest]: Now put yourself in medieval times in the plague.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.920
[Guest]: Not only do you not know when it's going to end, you've got no access to information about

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:33.480
[Guest]: when it's going to end.

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:39.320
[Guest]: You're just sitting, holed up in your house, worried about your kids dying, and you're

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.640
[Guest]: cut off from almost everything.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.680
[Guest]: So that's just, I mean, that's just really, that's tough.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.520
[Guest]: So technology has helped us get through this a little bit.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.760
[Guest]: But that uncertainty is very hard for us, I think, as human beings.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, we are almost at the end of the two hours, which you'd promised me.

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.440
[Amit Varma]: So I won't take much more of your time.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440
[Amit Varma]: A bunch of final questions.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, as an educator, especially teaching economics, I guess one of the challenges you

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:08.760
[Amit Varma]: must have faced, certainly a challenge when I face when I write about these subjects is

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.540
[Amit Varma]: that so many of the ideas we talk about are so counterintuitive, like the positive sumness

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:16.080
[Amit Varma]: of the world, like emergent order.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, we tend to we are again wired to think of what Adam Smith called the man of

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.840
[Amit Varma]: system where you can plan everything from the top down.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you had to pick sort of one idea, which you can implant into everybody's brain as

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.660
[Amit Varma]: a hardwired idea, what would that be?

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And if you could take out a little bit of hardwiring in everyone's brain from what they

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.240
[Amit Varma]: already have, what would that be?

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.520
[Guest]: I don't know the answer to that.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.520
[Guest]: It's a good question.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.760
[Guest]: You know, there are some core ideas in economics, emergent order being one of them, the idea

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.920
[Guest]: that not everything that you see in the world around you is the result of somebody's scheme.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.240
[Guest]: That's a super counterintuitive idea.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:02.680
[Guest]: And once you appreciate it, you start to see it in a lot of places that you wouldn't otherwise

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.680
[Guest]: notice it.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.360
[Guest]: You know, something trivial like the noise level in a restaurant, like, why is everyone

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360
[Guest]: yelling?

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.080
[Guest]: Can we all just quiet down or traffic?

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.240
[Guest]: You start to realize this isn't somebody's fault, this is just how things are set up

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240
[Guest]: right now.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.440
[Guest]: I mean, an example would be we've spent a lot of time, you and I, in this two hours

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:30.960
[Guest]: talking about the state of discourse, conversation and political discourse in particular for

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.440
[Guest]: a good chunk of our conversation.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:40.400
[Guest]: And we didn't, I don't think we talked enough, much about, explicitly about the media, but

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:46.160
[Guest]: the media is off, you know, doing all this weird stuff right now, advocacy, ideology,

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.520
[Guest]: weird, different time.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.520
[Guest]: I think it's very destructive.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.520
[Guest]: Why?

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:52.560
[Guest]: Why don't they just stop doing that?

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:57.960
[Guest]: And the answer is, well, all the incentives are lined up to make them that way.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.440
[Guest]: So don't get mad at them.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.000
[Guest]: Understand it, see if you can think of ways to change the incentives.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.440
[Guest]: Try not to make the incentives work on you.

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.040
[Guest]: Try to step back from them when you can.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:16.260
[Guest]: And we talked about the dopamine you get from crushing someone on Twitter or whatever.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:20.760
[Guest]: Recognize that that's not a great thing to be incentivized by, even though you do have

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.320
[Guest]: that incentive.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.880
[Guest]: So in terms of economic ideas, I think that idea that there are things that emerge without

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:32.520
[Guest]: anyone's attention is probably the deepest inside of economics that, you know, I've tried

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520
[Guest]: to help people understand as best I can.

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.680
[Guest]: I don't know what else, what I take away.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.480
[Guest]: I don't have an easy, quick thought on that.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I had an episode on the importance of emergent order and everything with Matt

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.760
[Amit Varma]: Ridley called the evolution of everything, I'll link that from the show notes.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.200
[Amit Varma]: My penultimate question, I just have a couple of more questions.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.200
[Amit Varma]: My penultimate question, in your book, you quoted from the Talmud, where you said, quote,

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.280
[Amit Varma]: it is not up to you to finish the work, but you are not free to desist from it, stop quote.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.200
[Amit Varma]: And I get the sense from your work from listening to econ talk.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.400
[Amit Varma]: And I know that much of econ talk, whatever the model behind it might be much of econ

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.160
[Amit Varma]: talk just feels so much like a labor of love that all your listeners should be truly grateful

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160
[Amit Varma]: for.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.400
[Amit Varma]: It's like it's being driven by a sense of a mission.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, what drives you now and how has it changed from what used to drive you in

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.040
[Amit Varma]: the past?

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, what drives you to do this?

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:26.840
[Guest]: Well, I get paid.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.480
[Guest]: I mean, econ talk is a project of Liberty Fund, which is a institution organization

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:38.760
[Guest]: in Indianapolis that publishes great books that are often forgotten, like David Ricardo

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.740
[Guest]: and Adam Smith and works on the American founding and law and economics.

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.080
[Guest]: So it's not like it's a charitable endeavor.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.080
[Guest]: I don't want people to misunderstand that.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.500
[Guest]: But it is a labor of love, like all good work can be.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:57.320
[Guest]: It's a strange thing, because every Monday, an hour or so of my conversation gets put

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.040
[Guest]: up on the web, a conversation with another person.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.920
[Guest]: And a lot of people download it compared to, say, five, 10 years ago.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.760
[Guest]: But I don't know how many listen.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.880
[Guest]: We're going to have technology soon.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.760
[Guest]: I hope that'll help me figure that out.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.800
[Guest]: But even if they listen, you don't know if they're really, as we've been talking about,

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:14.800
[Guest]: pay attention.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:21.760
[Guest]: We don't know how many of them grasp or engage with or absorb the information.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.700
[Guest]: And so I have this weird relationship, which you have, too, with tens of thousands of human

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:32.120
[Guest]: beings on our planet who are used to hearing me for an hour a week, week in, week out.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.380
[Guest]: And I've never met almost—I've met hardly any of them.

01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.860
[Guest]: So they know me.

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.360
[Guest]: They feel close to me, which is interesting, right?

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.400
[Guest]: We have no real relationship, but they feel close to me, which occasionally they send

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.800
[Guest]: me an email and I feel it, which is beautiful.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.840
[Guest]: But most of what I'm doing with EconTalk, I can't—it's the same—talk about the

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.840
[Guest]: seen and the unseen.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.400
[Guest]: I can't measure it.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.600
[Guest]: I can't grasp it.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.320
[Guest]: I'm just—you know, it's kind of like we send out these signals to other civilizations

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:07.480
[Guest]: on other stars, other planets, other, you know, planetary systems.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.440
[Guest]: We don't know if anybody's listening.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.680
[Guest]: Could be nobody is.

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:12.680
[Guest]: Maybe there's nobody out there.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.640
[Guest]: It could be there's all these people laughing at us or enjoying it, but it's too far

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.640
[Guest]: away.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.640
[Guest]: They don't get it until after we've died.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.160
[Guest]: Podcasting is a little bit like that.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.800
[Guest]: It's a strange, strange, beautiful thing.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.920
[Guest]: Radio is the same way, where—or writing a book, it's not much different, right?

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.240
[Guest]: I know thousands of people bought my book called How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life.

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.200
[Guest]: I know at least one person read it carefully, his name is Amit Varma, but that's just

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.200
[Guest]: all I get, you know?

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.680
[Guest]: I don't get a lot more than that.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.680
[Guest]: You know, my dad passed away this past March, and I've been thinking about him a lot,

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.760
[Guest]: of course, over the last few months.

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:55.280
[Guest]: He loved to write author's letters, and it always amazed him that they wrote back,

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280
[Guest]: and they would often.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.280
[Guest]: It's not like he did it relentlessly, but he did it sometimes.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.640
[Guest]: And he would write poets and novelists, and sometimes he would point out things in their

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.360
[Guest]: work that he didn't agree with, or he thought they made a mistake, it was an error, and

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360
[Guest]: he wanted to let them know.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.440
[Guest]: And sometimes he just wanted to tell me that he loved their work, and they would often

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.440
[Guest]: write back.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.280
[Guest]: And I always thought, and he often thought, isn't that strange?

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.800
[Guest]: Why do they bother to write me back?

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.960
[Guest]: And the answer is because somebody read it.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.960
[Guest]: Somebody read my book.

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.320
[Guest]: Oh, I've got to write back.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.080
[Guest]: What are you talking about?

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.000
[Guest]: Because otherwise you're in the dark.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.080
[Guest]: You don't know.

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.720
[Guest]: And so I think that's just really interesting, you know?

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:39.880
[Guest]: My dad had a letter from Robert Penn Warren, one of my favorite poets, one of my favorite

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880
[Guest]: novelists.

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.760
[Guest]: That's so cool, but why would Robert Penn Warren write my dad?

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.760
[Guest]: Because it was a human interaction.

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:53.360
[Guest]: It was a chance to have a conversation, not email, a different kind of letter, not talk,

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.360
[Guest]: but something.

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.120
[Amit Varma]: That's so insightful and even moving.

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:05.320
[Amit Varma]: A final question before we end this conversation, which I've also enjoyed so much, is that sitting

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.720
[Amit Varma]: now in 2020 with vision that is anything but 2020, when there is so much uncertainty all

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:15.320
[Amit Varma]: around and we can see what's happening to our politics, to our discourse, to our media,

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.440
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out, to our education.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.560
[Amit Varma]: If you were to look forward to the year 2030, what gives you despair and what gives you

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.560
[Guest]: hope?

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:30.960
[Guest]: You know, I don't have as much hope as I used to have.

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.240
[Guest]: I used to be much more optimistic.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.240
[Guest]: Part of my optimism used to be because of the institutions we talked about that help

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:45.560
[Guest]: things work well, and that would be free markets.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.580
[Guest]: All those institutions are being degraded right now in America.

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:50.960
[Guest]: So that's very concerning.

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:52.640
[Guest]: So I have a little less optimism.

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.280
[Guest]: I guess I fall back on the James Buchanan quote, the great economist who said, when

01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.460
[Guest]: I look to the future, I'm pessimistic.

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.280
[Guest]: When I look to the past, I'm optimistic.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.080
[Guest]: And what he meant by that was, like right now, like you're saying, we're in troubled

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.080
[Guest]: times.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.080
[Guest]: It seems really scary.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.680
[Guest]: Don't know where we're headed, very unclear.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:13.520
[Guest]: There have been such times in the past.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.520
[Guest]: And we got over them.

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.520
[Guest]: We got through them.

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:19.920
[Guest]: He would pick, when I heard him say that, I think he talked about the 1930s.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.600
[Guest]: That was depressing.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:28.000
[Guest]: You had a monolithic communist state, the Soviet Union, that was wicked, that did horrible

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.880
[Guest]: things to its citizens.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:36.240
[Guest]: You had a rising Nazi regime in Germany, which would lead to, both those together would lead

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.160
[Guest]: to tens of millions of deaths.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.800
[Guest]: There was a Great Depression, a worldwide thing that in the United States at a point

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.960
[Guest]: was 25%.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.060
[Guest]: So things got better.

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.220
[Guest]: So one argument says things usually get better.

01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.120
[Guest]: So I fall back on that.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:01.160
[Guest]: I fall back on the idea also that if you live in a moderately free society, as we both do,

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:06.200
[Guest]: we're blessed we're not in North Korea, we're not in Cuba, we're not in Syria.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.200
[Guest]: Those are tough places.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.360
[Guest]: But in our, you know, you and I are talking a lot about the tragedy of the current political

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:19.760
[Guest]: situation, the lack of civility, the distraction of technology.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.720
[Guest]: It still remains the case that I'm going to have in a few minutes, my wife and I are going

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.520
[Guest]: to have lunch.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:32.040
[Guest]: And I can smile and we can laugh and we can share each other's company.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.480
[Guest]: And you and I are having this conversation, not quite as good as the one I'm going to

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.080
[Guest]: have with my wife and me, but it's been a special conversation.

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.680
[Guest]: Not everything takes place in the political realm.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.800
[Guest]: Not everything takes place in Washington, D.C.

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:46.360
[Guest]: Not everything takes place on Twitter.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:52.880
[Guest]: Still plenty of places where you can let your heart sing and you can dance.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.640
[Guest]: And you can't dance on the dance floor right now so well with the pandemic, but I can put

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.320
[Guest]: on the shallow and dance plenty in my living room, in my underwear if I want, you know,

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:03.680
[Guest]: it's just, there's plenty of good things left in life.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.000
[Guest]: So it's easy to get depressed about the state of the world.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.120
[Guest]: It's probably better to focus more on your own smaller corner, your own garden, keep

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.920
[Guest]: it clean, let some things grow there and not try to solve all the world's problems, even

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.120
[Guest]: though it's tempting that you and I probably think we ought to be trying, but got plenty

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.040
[Guest]: of problems at home to work on, make those better, enjoy lunch.

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.440
