00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
[Amit Varma]: In the online writing course I teach, I often talk about the importance of regular writing.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.320
[Amit Varma]: I think of the ability to write as akin to a muscle. If you want to develop your muscles

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.520
[Amit Varma]: to build your body, you have to work out regularly. Similarly, if you want to develop your writing

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.720
[Amit Varma]: muscle, you have to build a habit of reading and writing. And one nuance here that I'm

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.000
[Amit Varma]: beginning to appreciate more and more is that your writing habit will not only change your

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.080
[Amit Varma]: writing, it will change you as a person. The more we write, the better we understand the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.240
[Amit Varma]: world and the more we understand ourselves. Writing, in a sense, can be like therapy even.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.280
[Amit Varma]: This is especially so if it takes a form of journaling. Previous guests on the show, like

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Amitabha Kumar and Samarth Bansal, have spoken about how journaling changed who they were,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.400
[Amit Varma]: made them more self-aware and reflective. And my guest today, by writing about her life,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.240
[Amit Varma]: her parenting, her relationships, has also shown us a power of turning our gaze inwards.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.480
[Amit Varma]: It's hard to do, because it can mean abandoning the comfort of our self-delusions. It can

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.200
[Amit Varma]: mean confronting all that is ugly about us. But it can be so, so rewarding.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.600
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is Natasha Bhadwar, who started off

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.720
[Amit Varma]: as a cinematographer in the first wave of Indian satellite television, established herself

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.400
[Amit Varma]: there and then left it to reinvent herself as a writer of personal essays. A mother of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.740
[Amit Varma]: three daughters, she started writing about parenting, first on a blog and then in a celebrated

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.840
[Amit Varma]: column for Mint Lounge. Her first book was a wonderful collection of essays called My

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Daughter's Mum. I recorded an early episode with her about this book a few years ago.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: This was back in the day when my episodes were half an hour miniatures, which is ironic

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.680
[Amit Varma]: because someone as self-reflective as Natasha is perfect for the current format of the show,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.400
[Amit Varma]: which is akin to oral history and is more about people than subjects. Since we last

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: recorded, she's published another fine book, Immortal for a Moment, shifted her column

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.680
[Amit Varma]: from Lounge to the Tribune, started a newsletter on Substack, and she also now teaches a memoir

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.480
[Amit Varma]: writing course. Her personal essays are more than just personal. Franz Kafka once described

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.800
[Amit Varma]: literature as an axe for the frozen sea within us. By writing about her own life and relationships,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Natasha reveals deeper truths about all of us, about our lives and relationships. Even

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.880
[Amit Varma]: when she writes about parenting, which I have zero interest in, I keep finding nuggets of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.480
[Amit Varma]: wisdom which force me to think about my own self. Her writing also tells us a lot about

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.400
[Amit Varma]: the society around us. She talks about mental health issues, especially of children, and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.080
[Amit Varma]: how we often, quote, do not name the estrangement we feel, stop quote. She writes about how

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.440
[Amit Varma]: so much of what would qualify as child abuse is normalized in our schools. She talks about

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.220
[Amit Varma]: her decision to unschool her children and why our education systems are so broken. She

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.520
[Amit Varma]: speaks about her search for home. She speaks about how every marriage is a work in progress

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.720
[Amit Varma]: and the different ways in which our society is broken today. Most of all, she speaks about

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.840
[Amit Varma]: the value of living an examined life. I learnt a lot from this episode, which is one of my

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.120
[Amit Varma]: favourites and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well. Before we begin though, let's take a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.880
[Amit Varma]: quick commercial break.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.120
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.560
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.480
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.800
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.440
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs Rs 10,000 plus GST, or

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.440
[Amit Varma]: about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register at IndiaUncut.com

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.080
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing. That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.120
[Amit Varma]: require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.400
[Amit Varma]: need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.760
[Amit Varma]: Natasha, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400
[Guest]: It's wonderful to be back.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's wonderful to have you back because the show was very different when we last recorded

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.120
[Amit Varma]: with the conception of the show was shorter conversations. It is about a subject. So the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: name of our episode was parenthood. And I've kind of moved on to much longer episodes where

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm not so interested in subjects per se, but more on people, you know, and since I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.480
[Amit Varma]: now do five, six hour conversations, I thought you are like literally, you know, a tailor

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.640
[Amit Varma]: made guest for the show, because one of the things that you do so well, is self reflection.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And which is, you know, all your writing is just so powerful for that reason. And I think

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.200
[Amit Varma]: that's why people who read you also feel that strong connection. Because by writing about

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.280
[Amit Varma]: yourself, I think you're writing about all of us. But anyway, I could go on with the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.680
[Amit Varma]: praise. But let's, you know, we're sitting here in 2022. To begin with, let's catch up.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, how have the COVID years been for you? Like, what have you been doing? How have

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.120
[Amit Varma]: the COVID years been? How have things progressed?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:46.040
[Guest]: Yeah. COVID's been such a shock. And I think we're still in it. We really haven't had the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:53.000
[Guest]: time to process the first lockdown, which was all about the huge, you know, the hunger

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.800
[Guest]: crisis and the migration in India and civil societies suddenly waking up in nearly a state

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.160
[Guest]: of panic and trying to help people who were out there on the streets, and in many ways

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.200
[Guest]: also coming together. And then of course, when we thought it was all over, we were hit

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:22.440
[Guest]: by the second wave. And second wave just left us with a collective trauma that will take

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.840
[Guest]: years to process. And I think that it has, it has touched all of us in terms of the kind

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.680
[Guest]: of choices that we've been making, in terms of what it's doing to the way we work, the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.560
[Guest]: way we look at our relationships, the way we are connected to the generation before

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:49.560
[Guest]: us and the one next to us. I think it's shaping us in many ways. So for me, it's been extremely

00:06:49.560 --> 00:07:01.960
[Guest]: significant. I, like many other people, had not had so much time to be at home ever before,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.400
[Guest]: to be stuck with each other, in the way that we were, to be able to understand the good

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:17.160
[Guest]: and the bad and the ugly of it also. But at the same time, it slowed us down, to some

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:26.760
[Guest]: extent, the tragedies, the deaths, the hunger, all of that. I hope that we stay with this

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.760
[Guest]: time a little longer. And don't just kind of erase it all and try to get back to a normal

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.000
[Guest]: life. I don't think that normal is ever going to come back.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.760
[Amit Varma]: So there's a weird thing that's been happening to me in the last few days, which could be

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.240
[Amit Varma]: an interesting metaphor for this, where, you know, I'm here in Delhi recording 12 episodes

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.840
[Amit Varma]: in 12 days is kind of a foolhardy venture. Yours is the 10th, I've done nine before this.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And the average runtime has been four and a half to five hours. There's been one which

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.800
[Amit Varma]: went to six hours. And during these episodes sitting exactly as we are now, this weird

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: thing would happen in the second half of some of the recordings, where I felt as if the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.200
[Amit Varma]: face of the guest has changed, where I would see something else than what it was earlier.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And I would wonder that, why is this person looking so different? And you know that if

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.160
[Amit Varma]: I met them outside, would I now recognize them? And sometimes I'd feel that I wouldn't

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.360
[Amit Varma]: recognize them at all. Or sometimes I'd feel that I was seeing the wrong thing earlier.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.080
[Amit Varma]: And it's really purely a visual sort of illusion, where the quality of the face just seems like

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.280
[Amit Varma]: someone else like, you know, I did an episode with Mahima Vashisht, a friend of mine, and

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.440
[Amit Varma]: at one point, her face suddenly started looking just like Pallavi Joshi's and I was, and she

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.400
[Amit Varma]: doesn't look like that. And I was wondering what kind of optical illusion is this and

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.440
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Pratap Bhanu Mehta. And his face seemed to sort of become softer

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.880
[Amit Varma]: and gentler and which of course goes with the person that he is, he's a very soft and

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:06.840
[Amit Varma]: gentle person. But it just had this sort of different quality to it. And I'm speaking

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.080
[Amit Varma]: at an optical level. But I'm just wondering thinking aloud, that when you're at home,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.280
[Amit Varma]: and you're forced to spend time with all of these people, and you know them so well, right,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.520
[Amit Varma]: they are your family, you know them so well. Are there moments where it feels like you're

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.280
[Amit Varma]: looking at something else? Are there moments where you feel like you've seen something

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:34.320
[Amit Varma]: you haven't seen before? That I mean, at one level, there is that sense that we are always

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.720
[Amit Varma]: destined to be strangers to one another, we figure out little parts of the puzzle now

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.640
[Amit Varma]: and then. And that gives us the illusion of knowing the other, but we never truly can.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:50.640
[Amit Varma]: But was there any of that because of the enforced physical closeness that happened in these

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.000
[Guest]: months?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:05.400
[Guest]: I would say that, particularly within the family, we surprised each other. You know,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.520
[Guest]: it had been a really hectic time before the lockdown was announced. I'd been very busy

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.080
[Guest]: with the Karwane Mohabbat campaign, we were travelling, we were making films, the anti-CIA

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.040
[Guest]: protests had, you know, we had participated in them rather robustly in Delhi, travelling

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.840
[Guest]: with them, then the Delhi violence had happened, we were involved in rehabilitation. And suddenly,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.480
[Guest]: you know, we're setting up refugee camps, and the next day, lockdown. So my children

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:46.880
[Guest]: had not seen me at home for a long time. I'd been very busy. And now I was home all the

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.680
[Guest]: time, except that because of the huge hunger crisis, and because of the way that people

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.880
[Guest]: were on the streets without any food, people had also started connecting with each other

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: and mobilising the distribution of food. And I found that I was now working very feverishly,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.160
[Guest]: but from home. And I thought I was doing my children a favour. I, you know, I was, I thought,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.720
[Guest]: you know, I'm there. And they were like, it took a while, it took a while. But my oldest

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:26.560
[Guest]: daughter, she called me out. She said, you're not there at all. We miss you. You know, and

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.480
[Guest]: I realised that I didn't know how to be at home. That we had to, you know, we had to

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.080
[Guest]: then, we stumbled upon things, a group of cats came to our house, we began to take care

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:45.040
[Guest]: of them. One had babies, we began to take care of those. And somehow, my life with my

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.600
[Guest]: daughters began to centre around the cats and dogs that we had begun to feed. Nurturing

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:58.680
[Guest]: them nurtured us. My husband was stuck. He was at home in his village with his father.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.480
[Guest]: And in the beginning, we were really relieved that he was stuck there, because we would

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.240
[Guest]: have been so worried about his 90 year old father being alone. But it was more than a

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.880
[Guest]: month before we saw each other again. And these had been months where we had suddenly

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.840
[Guest]: seen too much of life, we had seen things that we were not quite sure how to how to

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.480
[Guest]: process, there was so much fear and panic around us. I think we were also a little bit

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.480
[Guest]: in denial. We were, you know, all the breads that were being baked and the pasta that was

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.200
[Guest]: being eaten. We kind of tried to keep it light and celebratory. But there was a sense of

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:45.520
[Guest]: panic about what was going to happen to the world. I mean, countries had gone into lockdown.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:53.680
[Guest]: The news was bad every day. So when I had that experience, quite literally when my husband

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:02.320
[Guest]: came back home, and now he had come via road through many districts, so he was exposed.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.520
[Guest]: You know, we had to isolate him according to those times, the norms of those times.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.640
[Guest]: And we were looking, we were looking at each other as if we were not quite sure who the

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.440
[Guest]: other person was. I mean, I remember evening after evening, I'm sitting just outside the

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.600
[Guest]: door and eating while he's eating on his bed. And he's telling his friends, I'm spending

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:31.040
[Guest]: more time with my wife than I've ever spent while I'm isolating in the house. So it did

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:38.600
[Guest]: bring out different sides of us. And I'm not surprised you're having this experience in

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.680
[Guest]: these long conversations, because at some point, our masks fall. And, and our faces

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:51.520
[Guest]: do change. You know, at some point, we are not in a safe environment, we're not so cautious

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:58.040
[Guest]: anymore. And then we have to kind of recognize each other in a new way. And I think, but

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.760
[Guest]: I did experience that, particularly with my growing children. In my head, they were much

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:11.680
[Guest]: younger than they they had become, they had to knock it into my head that, you know, that

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.800
[Guest]: I needed to have different expectations from them. And they had different expectations

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800
[Guest]: from me.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And often, we have a mask, not just for the world, but also for ourselves. We're always

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of there's a persona we've built up even for ourselves. And sometimes there's a crack,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.560
[Amit Varma]: and the light slips through as it were, that's something that you more than anyone else,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.600
[Amit Varma]: you've always been examining that through all your writing and your personal essays

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.800
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. But during this time, were there moments like that? And what are they

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.280
[Amit Varma]: like where when you see yourself through somebody else's eyes, and you see something that you

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.240
[Amit Varma]: know is true, but you were just ignoring it. So, you know,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:15:00.000
[Guest]: you know, I, I really feel that it's a privilege to be surrounded by people to know people

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.080
[Guest]: who will call you out. It really is a privilege. And my daughter at one point said to me, every

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:15.200
[Guest]: time I talk to you about something I'm feeling you make it about yourself. And I was like,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:24.280
[Guest]: whoa, now this is what I know not to do. And yet, if she's saying it, she's feeling it.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:31.520
[Guest]: And I wondered what I was doing. And, and I realized I, you know, when I'm when I'm

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:41.120
[Guest]: nervous with my own child, I have no tools. And I quickly begin to tell her my story or

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.960
[Guest]: I quickly begin to tell her what I had done in this time of my life. And her context was

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:54.880
[Guest]: completely different. And she had to tell me that. I would, I wouldn't imagine that

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.800
[Guest]: I would make that mistake. I wouldn't imagine that I with all my awareness, and you know,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.240
[Guest]: all my reading on mental health and all my work in the field would need to do that. But

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.160
[Guest]: she did. And it's, it's really quite beautiful, because it slows you down, it stops you in

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.240
[Guest]: your tracks. In the in the middle of 2020, I had stopped writing the column for Mint

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.800
[Guest]: Lounge. And also, I'd not been writing so much about parenting or children because they

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:31.600
[Guest]: were in their middle teens. And we were kind of reassessing things. But Kartika VK from

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.520
[Guest]: Westland, she called me and she said, we'd like to commission essays. And I want you

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.840
[Guest]: to write two essays on parenting. And in the middle of, you know, just this post lockdown

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.520
[Guest]: world, where mobility is still quite strapped, I had to write this essay. And this is what

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:58.240
[Guest]: these were the conversations I was having with my daughter. And it was a moment of reckoning,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.520
[Guest]: it was a moment of recognizing that they are actually much older, much more mature, and

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:14.680
[Guest]: very different from where I have frozen them in my imagination. And and of course, all

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.120
[Guest]: of those moments in relationships will be like hiccups. They do sometimes momentarily

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.200
[Guest]: feel like failures. But that's because we also build up expectations from relationships

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.320
[Guest]: to such an extent. And yeah, I mean, similarly, I think many couples also went through this

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:38.080
[Guest]: where it was such a different way of being married that you were in the same space all

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.440
[Guest]: the time that you had to kind of wonder if you would marry him. Now, you know, if you

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.680
[Guest]: had a choice, would you still choose each other now that you were looking at each other

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:56.520
[Guest]: so closely, so many years into your original marriage. And I think it was a gift in some

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:05.400
[Guest]: ways to reassess, to decide to change your patterns, if you'd like.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.520
[Amit Varma]: And when you talk about it as a privilege and a gift, and that is so true. And it's

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.760
[Amit Varma]: also rare, because one thing that I observe more and more around me is that people kind

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.560
[Amit Varma]: of get stuck in the grooves that they are in, whether it is of their work or whether

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.220
[Amit Varma]: it is in their relationships. So you adopt a particular role, which may more or less

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.640
[Amit Varma]: conform to the social expectation, or it may not, or it could be whatever. But you get

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.240
[Amit Varma]: stuck in those grooves. And the other person becomes a fixed point in your head, a fixed

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.140
[Amit Varma]: thing in your head, like you, you mentioned that in you, you know, your kids were frozen

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:45.440
[Amit Varma]: in your imagination till you kind of snapped out of it. And then we go along those grooves,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.160
[Amit Varma]: and being completely alone, because you're just in those grooves. Other people are sort

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.720
[Amit Varma]: of instrumental to you, they're performing roles in your life, and you're performing

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.340
[Amit Varma]: roles in their lives. But you're never really coming out and taking that moment and stopping

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:04.640
[Amit Varma]: and kind of talking which can be so valuable. And it seems that your act of spending all

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.580
[Amit Varma]: these years writing your column writing about all of this is something that therefore within

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.320
[Amit Varma]: your family kind of make sure that everybody, all of you never really get trapped in those

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.020
[Amit Varma]: grooves. Because there's always that examination, there's always on the part of everyone else

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.620
[Amit Varma]: awareness that you're watching them, ki hum toh content ban gayi, I suppose might well

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.560
[Amit Varma]: be a legitimate complaint. But I guess the sort of that self aware gaze you bring to

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.920
[Amit Varma]: yourself and the family where you take a step out, everyone, I guess would kind of be forced

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.560
[Amit Varma]: to do that. And I agree that it's a blessing. But do you think that we are sort of wired

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.040
[Amit Varma]: to actually just be in grooves because life is easier. You know, you don't always have

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.220
[Amit Varma]: to reevaluate stuff. You don't have to work at relationships, right? You don't have to

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:58.200
[Amit Varma]: face deep truths about yourself. If a daughter tells you you're making everything about yourself,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.620
[Amit Varma]: instead of having to think about it, you can just snap back and say just finish your homework,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.360
[Amit Varma]: you know. And I think most people are in those kind of grooves. And I think that is natural

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.580
[Amit Varma]: to us. And, and I'm just thinking aloud, it seems to me that that's a great human and

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.040
[Amit Varma]: social tragedy. What are your sort of thoughts on that?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.800
[Guest]: I would definitely second you on using the word tragedy. I don't know whether we are

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:27.560
[Guest]: wired or not. I don't think we're wired. We would not have, you know, such a large scale

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:39.020
[Guest]: mental health, unspoken, unacknowledged mental health crisis in every family, literally in

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:45.560
[Guest]: every family, in every workplace, in every school space, every institution that we are

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:52.880
[Guest]: connected to. And in a way, the pandemic has exacerbated all of this. You know, there was

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.920
[Guest]: a lot that we were kind of pretending that things in the groove are fine. It's those

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:04.040
[Guest]: who are not fitting in with that pace. They need some fixing and we've got some. And we

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.120
[Guest]: are finding that more and more people are not coping. They're not coping with coming

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.480
[Guest]: back. They're not coping with being at home. They're not coping with each other. And I

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:23.540
[Guest]: think that we do not, we do not name the estrangement that we feel and that we do experience it.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:32.820
[Guest]: You have a safe personal conversation with anybody. And one after the other stories begin

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:40.560
[Guest]: to come out. And now, I think more so in the post 2020, we are able to call it anxiety,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.800
[Guest]: call it panic, call it depression, you know, rather than just, I'm in a low phase or I'm,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.520
[Guest]: you know, I'm just going through tough times or something like that. It is because we insist

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:03.840
[Guest]: on the grooves, that it doesn't work for us. And I mean, I'm doing these, you know, just

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:12.720
[Guest]: like that, Amit, I started the memoir workshops. I announced the first one, with the help of

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:22.480
[Guest]: Arpita of Yoda Press. And last year, November, December, we did the first one. And it's just

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.360
[Guest]: been so popular. And so much, you know, there's such a waiting list that I'm now concluding

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:37.400
[Guest]: the seventh of the workshops in eight months. And what are the, I mean, first of all, I

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.800
[Guest]: had no idea that that many people wanted to write their own stories, wanted a place where

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.880
[Guest]: they could tell their own stories. And when they do begin to tell their stories, we're

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.160
[Guest]: all telling the same stories. We're all remembering the grandmother who died unacknowledged, who

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:03.680
[Guest]: kept the family together, whose mental health was not taken care of, or, you know, the young

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:10.240
[Guest]: people in the family who have specific needs that schooling ignores, that makes you put

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:17.960
[Guest]: labels on them, but you recognize that actually, you're just wasting a beautiful life by not

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:26.480
[Guest]: acknowledging their special needs. So I feel that it's actually a disaster. It's a tragedy

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:33.800
[Guest]: that we have believed in the grooves. And this whole collapse of governance, collapse

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:42.040
[Guest]: of education, collapse of workplace ethic is taking place, because it never worked.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:49.480
[Guest]: And a little maladjustment, a little push, and it just seems to have all come apart.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:55.560
[Guest]: And we hear so much now about young people don't want to work, young people have attitude.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.760
[Guest]: And I think that what they're showing us is that they do not accept the systems that we

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:08.240
[Guest]: have normalized. They, you know, they have the, for the first time, many of them have

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:16.360
[Guest]: the privilege to make choices, and they're choosing to do that. And we need to read the

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.920
[Guest]: writing on the wall, in most cases.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Well said. And just speaking of the hunger for learning and the hunger for writing, like

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.880
[Amit Varma]: for my writing course, which I started when COVID started, really, I've had some 1900

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.800
[Amit Varma]: students so far, and perhaps it'll go to 2000 by the time the episode airs. And there is

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.140
[Amit Varma]: sort of that hunger. And, you know, I think a lot of stereotypes about young people come

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:47.640
[Amit Varma]: about because you only see Sri Lankan young people on Twitter. But from the wider interactions

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.880
[Amit Varma]: that I've had, you know, I would say that any stereotype I would come up with for young

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.400
[Amit Varma]: people is overwhelmingly positive, you know, much more aware, much more self aware, they

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:05.640
[Amit Varma]: work much harder. There's, you know, so you can't kind of look at one particular breed

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and kind of judge, I want to sort of double click on what you spoke about the explosion

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.160
[Amit Varma]: in mental health issues, which we don't recognise, you know, whether it is in the home or in

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.440
[Amit Varma]: the workplace or in the schools or whatever, because this is not spoken of, right? The

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.320
[Amit Varma]: common impression indeed is that I mean, I've even heard people say that, hey, this is just

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.320
[Amit Varma]: young people whining, they're making too much of whatever all of that nonsense. But if you

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.640
[Amit Varma]: even look at basic statistics, like one of my previous guests this week, I think Samad

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Bansal was talking about the rising rate of suicides among housewives, for example, that's

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.800
[Amit Varma]: just one indicator. And, and those are very blunt tools, those kind of stats, but they

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:57.880
[Amit Varma]: clearly is a problem. And it clearly is, you know, its roots lie somewhere within our modern

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.520
[Amit Varma]: society in a sense. So can you elaborate on that? What is the extent of the problem? How

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:09.800
[Amit Varma]: did you discover that, you know, this is happening? And, you know, what do you think of what can

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.760
[Amit Varma]: be done about it? What are the things that make it worse, and so on and so forth?

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:25.720
[Guest]: I think, and I'm speaking simply from observation, from constantly reading about it, from reading,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:36.240
[Guest]: you know, new papers in psychology and psychiatry, and from following, practicing psychotherapists.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.280
[Guest]: In a way, it's my it's my special interest. I've kind of been reading about mental health

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:51.800
[Guest]: since I was a child. And I feel very strongly that I would say that there are as many mental

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:59.920
[Guest]: health issues as there are physical health issues. You know, we, we have so many hospitals,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.200
[Guest]: and we have so many doctors, and we have this one small department of psychiatry, we'll

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:13.120
[Guest]: have one psychologist in 10 neighborhoods, when we will have 10 doctors in one neighborhood.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:21.760
[Guest]: And we are seeing a growing awareness, we are seeing that schools and offices and particularly

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:30.040
[Guest]: universities are creating, you know, whole departments and counseling centers where people

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:36.920
[Guest]: can go and seek help. But what we are not changing enough is the conversation around

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:43.800
[Guest]: it. We are continuing to see somebody whose, you know, mental health may be flaring up

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.360
[Guest]: to the point that they don't seem to be normal anymore, or they don't seem to be functioning

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.600
[Guest]: anymore. It's only those people who are being isolated and, and we're trying to fix them

00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:01.920
[Guest]: in some way. Just from, you know, my experience of being in school, so I was in what was at

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:09.320
[Guest]: that time the most popular, the most sought after school brand in Delhi, Delhi Public

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.800
[Guest]: School, RK Puram. There was a, there were very bright kids. I mean, first of all, there

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.440
[Guest]: were too many kids, we were like in the 1000s, they were in class 12, we were 12 sections,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.400
[Guest]: and now there are 24 or even more sections in that school. So it's a factory, it's a

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.920
[Guest]: huge schooling factory. So there was a lot of really good teaching. But there was also

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.760
[Guest]: a lot of very abusive teaching. There were very smart kids who were doing very well.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.440
[Guest]: There was a lot of violence, there was a lot of bullying, there was a lot of fun, also.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:51.000
[Guest]: But within all of that, there was still some kind of support system that that held that

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.760
[Guest]: held us through that took us through. When my children have been through schooling, I

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: did realize as soon as my first child was ready for school that I nearly had a kind

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.200
[Guest]: of a galloping sense of panic in me. Because I hadn't thought about everything that was

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:19.680
[Guest]: not okay with school, but it had stayed in my body. And I had this huge sense of what

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:27.040
[Guest]: not to do, but not necessarily what one could choose from. So anyway, we thought we were

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.560
[Guest]: really aware and we were making very, very careful choices. We moved out of the city,

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:38.760
[Guest]: we went to a quiet neighborhood, we chose a small school, we made choices, we remained

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.800
[Guest]: flexible about it, trying to get the best that we could. But my children's experience

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:49.840
[Guest]: of school, the kind of bullying that they report, the kind of Islamophobia that they

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:58.680
[Guest]: report, the kind of skewed gender, you know, behavior and preferential treatment that they

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:05.640
[Guest]: continue to report in the 21st century in the finest, most expensive schools of India,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:16.780
[Guest]: you know. And also the kind of self-harm that children are doing in literally every classroom.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:25.480
[Guest]: So from talking to young people, they are reporting a distress level in themselves and

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: in their peers of a magnitude that schools are not equipped to deal with. And, you know,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.520
[Guest]: because we've been very invested in this, you know, I have three children in school.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:45.680
[Guest]: I had them in school till about three years ago. We've been talking to the best educators,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:53.000
[Guest]: you know. And finally, when my children quit school three years ago, this very, very fine

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.720
[Guest]: elderly principal of the school, she looked at the child, she looked at us, she knew us.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.680
[Guest]: She said, you're doing the best thing that you can. We cannot fix the problem. We know

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.760
[Guest]: it exists, but we cannot fix the problem. So protect your child from it if your child

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:18.920
[Guest]: is reporting this as a problem. And she actually gave me the names of unschoolers and, you

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:25.200
[Guest]: know, other people and, you know, sent us off with her blessings. So I'm talking about

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:34.440
[Guest]: a level of awareness that is there, but a lack of tools, a lack of holistic kind of

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:44.160
[Guest]: reactiveness from institutions about how to, you know, how to fix it, how to acknowledge

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.040
[Guest]: that it's actually really quite bad. And in a way to acknowledge it, Amit, we will have

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:58.240
[Guest]: to, we will have to re-examine hierarchies. We will have to re-look at how do we talk

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.480
[Guest]: to men in power? How do we empower women in the workplace? Because all of that is playing

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:10.260
[Guest]: out in the school as well. And that then becomes a much larger conversation.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:15.960
[Amit Varma]: So lots to double click on. And I'll begin with what this lady told you, we cannot fix

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.200
[Amit Varma]: a problem. What is the problem? What was she referring to? Can you like dig a little deeper?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:29.280
[Guest]: So let's say we're talking about a twelve and a half year old who's in grade seven.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.080
[Guest]: And in the same year, she's gone on a school trip. And while the company that has taken

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest]: them has been completely wetted, they've made these fancy presentations to the school, to

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:50.120
[Guest]: the parents, all the safety gear has been taken care of, you know, all the overtly everything

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:56.120
[Guest]: is supposed to be safe for your child. But what is her experience, you know, when when

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:02.560
[Guest]: a group of boys and girls are without a structure suddenly out there in the mountains staying

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:09.160
[Guest]: in tents? There are coaches who are talking in a certain way to the young women. They're

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.680
[Guest]: referring to them as you're my princess. You don't have to run. I'll save you from this.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.400
[Guest]: Now here's a very athletic girl. She wants to run. She's faster than the boys. She also

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.960
[Guest]: wants to get the medal. But suddenly, you know, young girls are being singled out. They're

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.160
[Guest]: being sexualized in a way that they don't have a language to call out yet. But there

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:40.400
[Guest]: are also women teachers. They can see it, but they don't know how to address it either.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.280
[Guest]: So they come back. All the children talk to their parents. The parents are up in arms.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.560
[Guest]: I literally had to quit the WhatsApp group at that time because it was on fire. And I

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.560
[Guest]: was like, this is not going to help. We are just screaming our heads off. So we try to

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:01.320
[Guest]: address it with the school. We know it's a problem. Yes, we're talking to them. I can't

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:08.040
[Guest]: believe this happened. I mean, you know, we don't really have the training, the system,

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: the wherewithal to address it. You've got football for girls, but you've got a coach

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.280
[Guest]: who decides, oh, there are only three or four girls. Let them play with younger boys. You've

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.480
[Guest]: got younger boys. So like, why should we play with girls? But so all of this, I mean, it's

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:34.400
[Guest]: common gender socializing playing out in the play field. But people in authority do not

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:49.080
[Guest]: know or do not care to address it. So how is, you know, an average Indian girl who knows

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.920
[Guest]: about equality, who knows about justice? She doesn't have to read it anywhere. She knows

00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:01.080
[Guest]: her capabilities. But suddenly she's in a world, which has been her safe world, that

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:10.680
[Guest]: is diminishing her because she's a girl and at multiple levels. So, you know, teachers

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:16.040
[Guest]: don't know how to deal with the bullying and aggression in the classroom. They really,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.520
[Guest]: they look at some of the more aggressive children, they could be girls or boys, and they don't

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.080
[Guest]: know how to address this. So we're always telling the sensitive kid, don't take it to

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.440
[Guest]: heart. Don't sit with him. You know, we're always trying to fix the one who doesn't need

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:39.080
[Guest]: fixing. And so I escalate to the class teacher, we escalate to the teacher above that we finally

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:47.680
[Guest]: go to the principal. And they don't know what to do. And I'm not blaming them. Because it's

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:53.800
[Guest]: it's really, I mean, at the same time playing out everywhere, isn't it? I mean, we had the

00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:00.680
[Guest]: Me Too movement blowing up right after that. And look at the extent of the filth that came

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.920
[Guest]: out. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Look at the backlash against the women who

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.360
[Guest]: spoke up and the kind of cases they are still continuing to fight. You know, we're seeing

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:20.200
[Guest]: what's happened in the West as well as in India. So the world is much slower to change

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:26.720
[Guest]: and much more resistant and the kind of literally the backlash that people are having to live

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.680
[Guest]: with is problematic. It's the same thing if you belong to a minority, you're just going

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:38.760
[Guest]: to have to swallow your humiliation on a daily basis. Because we don't know how to question

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:45.840
[Guest]: those in authority. And somewhere we have to begin to chip at it. You know, those of

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:53.560
[Guest]: us who feel strongly about it, we have to take the risks and find ways to creative ways,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:59.720
[Guest]: not necessarily ways that put us in danger. Through storytelling, through filmmaking,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:09.200
[Guest]: through solidarities with those who are risking more than we are. Things need to happen. And

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:17.240
[Guest]: in a way, our schools and our workplace institutions are aligning more and more with those in authority

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:25.560
[Guest]: who have fascist tendencies, who want to take the world back into a much more patriarchal,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:32.800
[Guest]: you know, set up. So instead of kind of going forward as we thought the world would go,

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.280
[Guest]: it really wasn't in my immature imagination that we would be dealing with this kind of

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:44.080
[Guest]: regression in the social and political space. And that's affecting families as well.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I agree. We all, you know, I grew up thinking the arc of history will bend

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.480
[Amit Varma]: towards a good place, you know, more freedom, more justice, more whatever. And the last

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.000
[Amit Varma]: few years kind of make you question that and make you question whether you build that narrative

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.320
[Amit Varma]: based on a really small sample size, you know, there are so only so many years that we have

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:08.280
[Amit Varma]: actually, you know, should we make assumptions about the future from that? I'll continue

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.400
[Amit Varma]: digging into this subject in the sense that you've spoken about what's going wrong at

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.420
[Amit Varma]: the school. And that's, of course, a reflection of what is already wrong in society in terms

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:23.800
[Amit Varma]: of the perpetuation of these structures and these grooves, as it were. Let's broaden it

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:31.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit and talk about beyond the school, just society and the way kids grow up today

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.080
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that Jonathan Haidt once pointed out how the mental health problems among teenage

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.120
[Amit Varma]: girls specifically over the last 10 years and the point that he was making is that it

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.880
[Amit Varma]: was more a problem with girls and with boys. You know, once upon a time, people used to

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.760
[Amit Varma]: worry that boys are playing too many video games, and they'll become violent and they'll

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.640
[Amit Varma]: become this. But it didn't really make much of a difference. If anything, it helped boys

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.760
[Amit Varma]: with problem solving and all of that. But with girls, what social media did was it put

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:08.680
[Amit Varma]: them in this competitive performative space, where, you know, a generation of girls earlier,

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.440
[Amit Varma]: perhaps when you grew up, you'll have girls just talking to each other about normal things

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.880
[Amit Varma]: and chilling out and being themselves building their own little safe spaces, as it were.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:23.080
[Amit Varma]: But the contention runs that because of social media, because of what Instagram has become

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.720
[Amit Varma]: and Instagram shows the best version of everyone, right, the version they want to put out, and

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:34.480
[Amit Varma]: your real self has to compete with the imagined self of everybody else. And that leads to

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.720
[Amit Varma]: enormous amounts of pressure, enormous amounts of anxiety, and that whole classic anxiety

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:46.160
[Amit Varma]: of somehow fitting into a world which is really a world of, you know, imagined and constructed

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.240
[Amit Varma]: selves can be a huge problem. And I think Facebook many years ago suppressed a study

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:56.960
[Amit Varma]: which showed that teenage suicide rates among girls were rising, and it was partly because

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, social media and FB itself in a sense. So what's your observation on this?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.160
[Amit Varma]: Because the challenges of girls growing up today at the time your daughters are, are,

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.240
[Amit Varma]: in some ways, you have the same damn issues that you did when you were a kid, the patriarchy

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.040
[Amit Varma]: and the fixed roles, they have to move on and the condescension and all of that. But

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.720
[Amit Varma]: there are also these newer, tougher challenges.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:30.280
[Guest]: I absolutely agree with you, there are newer, tougher challenges. I'm also happy to report

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:39.560
[Guest]: that in my observation, these are newer, tougher, smarter girls. And I see a lot of them resisting

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.560
[Guest]: the pressure as well. But the fact that the pressure exists, the fact that if you fit

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.760
[Guest]: in, you're, you're masking to the extent that you are no longer in touch with your authentic

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.280
[Guest]: self. If you don't fit in, you are not sure whether you're doing the right thing, you're

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:02.480
[Guest]: too young, you're too young to be able to feel okay. Despite the fact that, you know,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.360
[Guest]: you are skipping out on the parties and not dressed the way the others are not being able

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.440
[Guest]: to talk the other ways, the others or don't want to behave in the way that your peers

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:21.320
[Guest]: may be. And I really saw this conundrum play out in my family. I really did. When we shifted

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:28.520
[Guest]: from a neighborhood school, to a much bigger school, closer to the city, you know, we thought

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:37.560
[Guest]: we were choosing a more liberal education, a more liberal education institution. But

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:44.640
[Guest]: who are the children and the families who are coming to these schools, we are all consuming

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:52.040
[Guest]: the same shallow media, whether it is social media, mainstream media, you know, all the

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:58.880
[Guest]: stuff that's coming in through our phones, and on our OTT channels. And because in many

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.840
[Guest]: ways, you know, we are the first and second generations that are experiencing this, I

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:13.920
[Guest]: do feel that many of us are completely overwhelmed, overwhelmed with choices. So I, you know,

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:21.200
[Guest]: I even wrote this article that was, in many ways, a little viral, but also very contentious,

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:28.480
[Guest]: where I wrote about raising our three children in a home without television and keeping mainstream

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:36.280
[Guest]: media entirely out of our home, there were no screens for them, till they had all crossed

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:42.400
[Guest]: the age of 12. And, you know, and everybody was like, but how can you and you're depriving

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.120
[Guest]: them and how dare you and stuff like that. But so when they were very little, we didn't

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.680
[Guest]: have anything streaming, we watched films, but we chose what we would watch, we would

00:42:52.680 --> 00:43:00.960
[Guest]: get a DVD, watch it. And then when they kind of began to, you know, they crossed adolescence,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.400
[Guest]: they began to have access to the internet, and they began to make those choices. And

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.760
[Guest]: they also moved to a big school where they came, you know, where they were surrounded

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:17.280
[Guest]: by children who were literally staying up all night watching American series and coming

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.520
[Guest]: into school and talking about them the next day. They were wired enough to be able to

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:30.400
[Guest]: do that. My observation is that because they had grown up without it being normal to constantly

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:37.520
[Guest]: have things unfiltered be playing around you because they had taken, you know, been through

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:43.760
[Guest]: a slowish process where we were making active choices of what we want and what we don't

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:50.840
[Guest]: want. They, they did feel a dissonance when they came into a world where you were supposed

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.880
[Guest]: to know things, not because they were good, but because they were the popular choice of

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: the time, because that's what was trending. And so our middle daughter, who's the first

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.320
[Guest]: child who really alerted an alarm, you know, raise the alarm, in a sense, I'm just going

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:18.160
[Guest]: to narrate this incident as an as an example. She's been in this new school for for a year,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:26.280
[Guest]: and we went to attend a wedding and it was in a very fancy hotel in Delhi, not a place

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:33.600
[Guest]: that we often go to. And just these two older daughters of mine, they they began to suddenly

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.600
[Guest]: put a lot of distance between themselves and us they were walking far much further away.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.600
[Guest]: And my husband calls out to them and says, Why are you walking so far away, walk with

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:49.960
[Guest]: us. And she turns around and says, I don't want to be seen with you. And he's like, what?

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:55.880
[Guest]: And she just turned to me and she said, That's how children in my school talk. Now either

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:03.640
[Guest]: I can be like them, or I can be like you. Give me a choice. And it was it was like,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:11.800
[Guest]: really, it's a moment that stayed with me. In her own way, she's articulating that either

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:22.440
[Guest]: I can be cool like them, or I can be this slow, small town family on the, you know,

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:34.360
[Guest]: corner of Delhi, like you give, I can't belong to both, I'm confused. And I mean, the fact

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:39.240
[Guest]: that she could say it, the fact that I could hear it, the fact that we could process it

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:48.640
[Guest]: helped us to make, you know, to finally make the choice to actually keep the internet and

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:57.600
[Guest]: let the school go, you know, to, to, to say no to all the extra pressures that came with

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:05.240
[Guest]: mainstream schooling. And it's not made life easier for my children. I'm not saying we've

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:12.800
[Guest]: got a magic key that, you know, that has that works. It's a longish process, we're learning

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:22.880
[Guest]: on the go, and and so are they. But at least they are able to see something toxic and say,

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:30.360
[Guest]: I don't have to participate in this. You know, even if it means that I am going to be isolated,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:38.080
[Guest]: or I'm not going to have the same friend circle in the same network. And it sure it, it also

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:45.600
[Guest]: triggers a kind of anxiety in them. But but at least they're able to make informed choices.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.160
[Guest]: I'm not sure I answered your question.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.000
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, questions aren't meant to really even be answered. They're just meant to lead

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.240
[Amit Varma]: to things and lead here and there and all of that, which is always the way it should

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.200
[Amit Varma]: go. And you did kind of answer my question, I guess. I mean, in terms of at least how

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.480
[Amit Varma]: you guys have fought in your own way to, you know, protect your kids from that and get

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:14.120
[Amit Varma]: them out of that kind of toxic situations. And you are, of course, unschooling your kids,

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:19.560
[Amit Varma]: which is fascinating to me. So I want to dig in a little bit into that, in the sense that

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.320
[Amit Varma]: as we were speaking before, you know, the recording, I've always sort of believed that

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.800
[Amit Varma]: the just the way that we think about schooling is fundamentally wrong and broken. This current

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:35.360
[Amit Varma]: system was designed in the early 19th century, to turn out workers for the Industrial Revolution.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.640
[Amit Varma]: So you have, you know, kids of the same age studying together studying the same bunch

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.080
[Amit Varma]: of subjects, everything proceeds in a particular way. And it was perhaps okay for that time

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:51.200
[Amit Varma]: and for that purpose. And even that can be argued. But today, it doesn't seem to really

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.640
[Amit Varma]: do anything for the kids, you know, a lot of their education really comes from outside

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.840
[Amit Varma]: either through living life or through the internet, or a lot of the useful things they

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:07.240
[Amit Varma]: learn come from outside, there is a lot of toxicity even within schools as well. And,

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.320
[Amit Varma]: and in a sense, the real purpose of a school in society is as a daycare center, where,

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, the parents are doing whatever they're doing, and the kids have to be there somewhere

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.340
[Amit Varma]: for the whole day. And so schools are a purpose for that, you know, education is just sort

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:28.000
[Amit Varma]: of the mask we put on it. And that also indicates that if schools are daycare centers, that

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.800
[Amit Varma]: most parents don't, they've had the kid, but they don't want to be involved beyond a point,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.800
[Amit Varma]: right? It's too much for them, the pressure and all of that, that, you know, comes along

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.800
[Amit Varma]: with that, you know, so when you look at the schooling system, when did you start, you

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.720
[Amit Varma]: know, thinking about how flawed and how broken it is, and you've described some of the ways

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:55.560
[Amit Varma]: in which it is broken. And then when you began to think of alternatives for your own kids,

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, like I imagine, initially, there must have been the sense of fear, this great

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.680
[Amit Varma]: unknown that if they don't go to that particular setup, that structure that has been set, you

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.140
[Amit Varma]: know, what will it do in terms of socializing? What will it do in terms of whatever they

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.080
[Amit Varma]: have to do later in life in terms of college and education and credentials and all of that.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.840
[Amit Varma]: So take me through your processes of, you know, how you're thinking on this evolved

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.160
[Amit Varma]: right from the start, where you started saying that, no, this is wrong, to the point where

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.200
[Amit Varma]: you said that I am taking my daughters out of this and so on.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:37.600
[Guest]: I used to say, I, when I finally came out of my own school, I was, in many ways full

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:50.520
[Guest]: of rage for the system that marginalized a majority of the children in every class. Literally,

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:57.160
[Guest]: you know, you have a class of 50 and 10 are managing, 20 are floating in their own way

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:09.520
[Guest]: and 20 are just miserable. And I did well in school. I participated in everything. But

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:20.920
[Guest]: I remember coming out of there and saying, you know, it made me by breaking me. I had

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:28.440
[Guest]: something like that in my head. And, and I developed a very, I was very young for these

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.900
[Guest]: kind of thoughts. But in retrospect, I can see that I had, you know, the whole the big

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:41.000
[Guest]: deal about my school was that it was the brand, the name of the school, because it was supposed

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.240
[Guest]: to be good, you had to be in it. And it didn't feel good. I'd gone from a small school that

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.360
[Guest]: felt like heaven. And, and this felt like hell, really. So when I had to choose a college,

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:58.280
[Guest]: I said, I'm not going to go, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go for the brands. And

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:03.600
[Guest]: you came out of school like mine, with the kind of marks we had, you could go to Stephens

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:11.080
[Guest]: if you wanted to, you could certainly go to Hindu. And I, and I went to Indraprasth College.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:19.600
[Guest]: I consciously decided not to go to LSR, and not to go to Stephens, and to go to IP, which

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:27.640
[Guest]: was famously called the Bhenji College of that time. And in IP, it was such a novelty

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:34.320
[Guest]: to see a DPS RKP kid come in that people came to see me. She's the one who because there

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:40.160
[Guest]: was only one of one person from my school who had gone to that. But I chose to study

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.680
[Guest]: psychology. And because, you know, I had kind of figured out what I needed, and what I didn't

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:53.560
[Guest]: need. I couldn't articulate it like that. But I can look back and, and, and kind of

00:51:53.560 --> 00:52:02.420
[Guest]: tell that. So when, when our first child, Seher was born, I was the idea of homeschooling

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:10.320
[Guest]: is something that was in my head. But I didn't know whether I could do it. I didn't have

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:16.080
[Guest]: the confidence. I didn't know how to do it. I wasn't connected to anyone else. And we

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:23.280
[Guest]: were too early in our marriage to know, you know, where we where we stood on very important

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.520
[Guest]: topics like this. And also, we come from very different backgrounds. So my, my husband's

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.340
[Guest]: favorite line in every school admission would be, it doesn't matter to me whether you take

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.620
[Guest]: my kid or not, I can always put her in the village school, I went to the village school,

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:43.000
[Guest]: I turned out fine. You know, I'm not intimidated by the big city. And he would drop this line.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.520
[Guest]: And everybody would kind of want to take his kid because I mean, there was one interview

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:56.320
[Guest]: in which they looked at me and said, Where did you find him? I'm glad you're impressed.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:05.400
[Guest]: So so I did, I was thinking about homeschooling. At that time, I was also thinking about, I

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:12.640
[Guest]: had friends who were running, who were running a school for tribal children in a village

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:17.840
[Guest]: in Madhya Pradesh and raising their own children there. And we took our little children and

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:23.000
[Guest]: went there with the idea that maybe we can live there. But my husband and I looked at

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.400
[Guest]: each other from a distance and said, I don't think we can live with each other over here.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:35.200
[Guest]: This is, this is, you know, it would have, we were not ready for that. So they did go

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.320
[Guest]: to school in the way and I, and I remember, I was just reading on my phone, there's a

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.840
[Guest]: note that my daughter's written in 2015, in which she's made a list of ways in which our

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.760
[Guest]: family is different from other families. And the top thing she's written is, our parents

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:58.720
[Guest]: say go out and play. Don't, you don't have to study. Other parents say study, study,

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.120
[Guest]: study. So, so we were, I guess, in a, that was the message we were trying to give them

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.680
[Guest]: that you don't have to take anything too seriously. If you don't want to go, you don't have to

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:16.400
[Guest]: go. This is not something that we are going to internalize as this great hierarchical

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:22.080
[Guest]: thing that we have to kowtow to. But yeah, and I, you know, when I began to write my

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:29.680
[Guest]: column, I know school used to turn up, the subject of schooling used to turn up consistently.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:38.120
[Guest]: Coincidence or not, Amit, literally 2014 onwards, schools have changed. The manner in which,

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:46.080
[Guest]: you know, those in authority in school speak, the manner in which they lay down rules, in

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:56.800
[Guest]: which they marginalize some holidays versus other holidays, you know, it's very much like

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.000
[Guest]: the governance of this country, where you can just lay down a rule, no questions asked

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000
[Guest]: and karna hai toh karo, varna, you can, you know, find your own way. So, that has changed.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.680
[Guest]: It was more participative before. And yeah, to answer your question, we came to a point

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: where we felt that we had tried every option that was available to us from alternate schooling,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:29.000
[Guest]: from slow schooling, from very involved participatory, you know, schooling in which we were volunteering

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:36.160
[Guest]: in the schools, everything. And I guess because the children were older, because we were older

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:43.920
[Guest]: as a couple, we then began to connect with community of unschoolers and homeschoolers

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:51.960
[Guest]: in this country, which is a fairly decent number of people spread across and many, many

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.800
[Guest]: people who were much older than us, who'd been doing, you know, making these choices

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:08.800
[Guest]: for decades. So, we had examples of people who we could meet, there's Manish Jain and

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.200
[Guest]: this organization in Udaipur, there is Swaraj University that's also in Udaipur, then we

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:22.120
[Guest]: met Claude Alvarez from Goa, he's a passionate speaker about unschooling, we met many families

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:29.960
[Guest]: from Pune and Bangalore and Chennai. And, and we found, so we found a tribe, in a sense,

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:37.800
[Guest]: you know, here are people like us from disparate backgrounds, who've tried things, who have

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:44.560
[Guest]: made choices. And here are these wonderful young people, older than our kids, or the

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:54.640
[Guest]: same age as our kids who are doing very well. So, I guess we had matured as parents, and

00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:01.000
[Guest]: it became an emergency literally for the children. So, when we offered them the choice, two of

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.880
[Guest]: them took it. The younger was in a slower Waldorf school, she said, I like my school.

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:12.760
[Guest]: Two years later, she said, I think they've forgotten how to be Waldorf. So, I'm coming

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:22.920
[Guest]: home. And she came back. And being connected with other families like us, that's been,

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.640
[Guest]: that's been amazing. It's been an amazing journey. So, not a week goes by where we are

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:34.520
[Guest]: not in some way, either speaking to a younger family, who is considering not sending their

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:41.200
[Guest]: children to school or speaking to an older family or our own peers, and discussing all

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:49.200
[Guest]: the options. And because we are also in this prime of the internet age in some way, there

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:57.520
[Guest]: are, there are just so many options that you can choose. So long as you've got some confidence

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.200
[Guest]: in yourself, you know, and you also need the confidence to make mistakes. You know, you're

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:08.200
[Guest]: not just handing over to a brand name and saying, you know, when they come out of that

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:15.600
[Guest]: side of the pipe, they should be employable or something like that. So you're okay.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'll go back to something you mentioned about your own experience in school, where

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.760
[Amit Varma]: you said that you were full of rage, that, you know, if you had a class of 50 people,

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.120
[Amit Varma]: you'd have 10, who would be perfectly fine, 20, who would float along, and 20, who would

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.800
[Amit Varma]: be miserable. So can you drill down on that a bit and talk about that experience? And

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.480
[Amit Varma]: why the rage and why the misery? Because, like, when I think back on my schooling years,

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:45.600
[Amit Varma]: I hated school. But a lot of my angst was a typical angst that teenage boys will feel

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:50.880
[Amit Varma]: the whole rebel without a cause thing. One of my songs that kind of defines that period

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:55.360
[Amit Varma]: for me was unsatisfied by the replacements. I link it from the show notes. That was exactly

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.960
[Amit Varma]: my vibe. But there was no reason for it. It was just that teenage boys tend to be rebellious,

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.720
[Amit Varma]: they tend to be angry, all of that it was almost like a fashionable thing. But I would

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:10.800
[Amit Varma]: imagine that, you know, a the experience can be much worse for everybody and be the experiences

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.400
[Amit Varma]: always much worse for girls that the world they're living in is a different world from

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:21.680
[Amit Varma]: what the boys experience. Right? So and I'm wondering, like, how much of your rage and

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:27.200
[Amit Varma]: anger just had to do with those layers that come only because of gender? And how much

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.560
[Amit Varma]: of it was just because bad aspects of the schooling that I might not have noticed or

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.000
[Guest]: been blase about?

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:43.080
[Guest]: Hmm. Things are bad for girls in very peculiar particular ways. That is not always acknowledged.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:53.760
[Guest]: I agree with that. I'm not sure they're worse off. I'm not sure that I feel that even though

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:59.600
[Guest]: boys will not typically self harm, they will harm others. You know, they will they will

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.840
[Guest]: get into a different kind of violence. Their self harm will not involve cutting themselves.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:15.160
[Guest]: But substance abuse is is self harm. And, and I think I really do worry. I worry for

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:23.280
[Guest]: the boys and I worry for the men. And but to come back to my own experience, you know,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:30.880
[Guest]: I started with a I went to school first in Ranchi. And, and of course, so there was one

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:38.160
[Guest]: Loreto convent and one St. Xavier's. And it was, you know, that that's what you were supposed

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:46.680
[Guest]: to do. So I went to Loreto convent. And I remember the name of my nursery teacher. And

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:55.160
[Guest]: she was, she was, she was much admired by the parents. But she just believed in corporal

01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:03.720
[Guest]: punishment. She had a cane. And, you know, this is the late 70s. And there were some

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.200
[Guest]: children who would not get instructions, did not understand English in the way that children

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:18.280
[Guest]: from a different kind of family would understand. And they were the ones being caned. And this

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:25.320
[Guest]: is a girl's school. You know, it's not behavioural, oppositional behaviour, particularly that

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:31.520
[Guest]: the child is displaying, it's just a child who didn't understand homework or didn't can't

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:37.640
[Guest]: make the line like you asked her to make it, or came back late from lunch or, you know,

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:50.960
[Guest]: spilled something. And I, I have not forgotten the, the pain of witnessing other children

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:58.000
[Guest]: being humiliated, you know, wanting this beating to stop and, you know, and just that act,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.360
[Guest]: Amit, where we, we make the child participate in the violence, you know, we say, put out

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.680
[Guest]: your hand. And when they can't put out their hand, we keep yelling till they voluntarily

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:17.240
[Guest]: put out their little palm. And if they take it back, then they are abused. So you, it's,

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:27.040
[Guest]: it really is child abuse. You know, when you look at it, and it's normalised. That, so

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:35.640
[Guest]: my, my, my brain as a child, could understand that there were some people in the family

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.880
[Guest]: who were cruel, that there were some men in the family who had rage issues. But a school

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.680
[Guest]: was supposed to be a safe space. You were sent there with trust, you wore this uniform

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:55.560
[Guest]: to become a better person. And then for that to be violated. Then we moved to Calcutta.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:03.200
[Guest]: And I was in school there for three or four years, we came to Delhi. And I went to a school

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:09.400
[Guest]: very close to where we are recording right now, which was a new school, very, it was

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.160
[Guest]: set up by the founders. And the founders of that school had all come from modern school

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:23.700
[Guest]: Barakamba with this dream of starting a child friendly school. And by luck, my younger brother

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.400
[Guest]: and I, we landed there because we were late into the city. And this was a new school they

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.760
[Guest]: took us. They even gave us a double promotion because we were smart little kids. They said,

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:38.280
[Guest]: you're good enough to go to the next class. They were very loving, but they were not the

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:44.600
[Guest]: top brand. So my parents, you know, middle class, upwardly mobile, putting all their

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:53.080
[Guest]: investment into the idea of giving us the best education put me in this large school.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:04:02.760
[Guest]: Now that I look back at it, being in a class of 50, 11 year olds and 12 year olds being

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:10.640
[Guest]: with teachers who could not cope with the workload, they could not cope with the kind

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:17.040
[Guest]: of syllabus that they had to cover with the kind of PTMs that were expected of them. So

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:26.160
[Guest]: the only way they had to control us was punishment, yelling, abuse. It was par for the course.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.040
[Guest]: It still is. You know, India hasn't changed in that sense. The world hasn't changed in

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:44.800
[Guest]: that sense. At 11 and 12, I can only look back and say, I gave up. You know, so I was

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:54.560
[Guest]: seriously suicidal at 12. And so I look back and I wonder what would make a 12 year old

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:03.720
[Guest]: make a serious suicide attempt. And I guess the sense that that child had was, this is

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:12.680
[Guest]: such a cruel place. I don't want to be here. This is the last step for my parents. I can't

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:21.120
[Guest]: negotiate with them. They've put their all into this. Something made me invisible in

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.120
[Guest]: the family. Perhaps I was a middle child. Perhaps my parents were too caught up with

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:33.120
[Guest]: the big city and all its own demands on them as a service class family, a single income

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:39.760
[Guest]: family. But something made me feel that it wouldn't matter to the world if I ceased to

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:46.600
[Guest]: exist. And of course, nothing could be far from the truth. And I'm just lucky to have

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:54.720
[Guest]: survived and therefore witnessed what would have happened to these people if they had

01:05:54.720 --> 01:06:04.720
[Guest]: lost their daughter. You know, I was witness to my parents' shock, their mourning, their

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:11.960
[Guest]: incredible sense of loss that there was actually a child in the family, so much on the brink

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:21.280
[Guest]: and they couldn't, that they hadn't seen it. So personally, for me, it was a turning point

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:28.440
[Guest]: to the in the sense that I decided when I was coming back to life that I was never going

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:37.400
[Guest]: to make this mistake again. And I never did. And it has, it kind of gave me not only an

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:46.800
[Guest]: emotional strength, I think I could say some kind of a spiritual strength. You know, that

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:53.480
[Guest]: there's a reason you're alive. There's no way, you know, there is a purpose. You wouldn't

01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:00.760
[Guest]: have come back if it hadn't been for that. So it carried me through. But it also gave

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:08.520
[Guest]: me a kind of an outsider's view of the world that I had kind of departed from in a sense.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:16.360
[Guest]: I, you know, I came back to school after a year because I had disabilities and, you know,

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:23.320
[Guest]: my surgeries took a very long time to heal. So and now I was a special kid. So no pressure

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:34.360
[Guest]: would be put on me. I didn't have to take exams for some time. In a way, I kind of made

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:41.160
[Guest]: the world made some space for me. And I then began to feel more like a witness to what's

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:47.520
[Guest]: happening around. And of course, the rest of the years, one continued to watch the same

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.160
[Guest]: things that there are some children who are completely, you know, kind of falling through

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.360
[Guest]: the cracks. They're being bullied for being fat, for being short, for not being able to

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:09.240
[Guest]: speak in a certain accent, for belonging to a certain social class. And yeah, so I did

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:17.560
[Guest]: come back while I earlier felt completely helpless that I wanted to help somebody who

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:24.000
[Guest]: was feeling humiliated in class and I had no tools. When I came back, I felt that I

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.320
[Guest]: could reach out to this person that, you know, that that's what I could do. And that's literally

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.320
[Guest]: how I spent the rest of the four years in my school kind of being a little bit on the

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:49.120
[Guest]: margin, but being okay with that. And that is what came back to me when the parenting

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:56.080
[Guest]: years started, particularly when the schooling years started. You know, how much has the

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:02.400
[Guest]: world changed? And I did go into the whole system with the expectation that all that

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.920
[Guest]: primitive stuff is over. But that's not what I discovered.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And when this incident happened, what was it like to try and figure out the why? Like

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.920
[Amit Varma]: both for you and your parents? Like, how do you figure out the why? Because for your parents,

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.400
[Amit Varma]: I can imagine it would have come like a bolt from the blue, they would have had no idea.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:28.920
[Amit Varma]: How do you come to terms with why, you know, how do they come to terms with why their little

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.760
[Amit Varma]: girl felt that way? And what should they do about it? Because as a parent, you want to

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.760
[Amit Varma]: be able to control that. And for you, you know, in that moment, when you come out of

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:45.600
[Amit Varma]: it, how do you process that in terms of why I tried that and why I won't try that again?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.960
[Guest]: How did that play out?

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:56.720
[Guest]: One of the big kind of awakening things that I experienced while I was still very much

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:09.280
[Guest]: in pain and in hospital, between surgeries even, was that my parents were not as invincible

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:18.920
[Guest]: as I had imagined them. They were not able to cope with the hospital system. They didn't

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.720
[Guest]: know what was happening. They didn't know what was the right thing to do. They had two

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.200
[Guest]: other children who had to keep going to school or who, you know, needed some kind of daycare

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:42.440
[Guest]: while they were here. I saw how the world functioned also in a very positive way. Extended

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:49.400
[Guest]: family turned up. People moved down, you know, they came from wherever they were. They took

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:55.520
[Guest]: trains and flights. They would just turn up in my hospital room in solidarity with my

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:03.880
[Guest]: parents. So one was that, you know, I could understand what the doctors were saying better

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:11.560
[Guest]: than my father was being able to process it. And I was listening to all the conversations

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:19.400
[Guest]: about the bills and, you know, how the house is going to, how the other, my younger brother

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:25.400
[Guest]: is 10 years old. He's like, he's not even like awakened into a human hood yet. He's

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:34.320
[Guest]: just a little brat who's looking for a place to play all the time. So, so I, you know,

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:43.840
[Guest]: I'm kind of witnessing them in this kind of distress. And what I, what I held against

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:51.640
[Guest]: them earlier that they were not mindful, they were not paying attention, they were not aware,

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:57.800
[Guest]: you know, I kind of realized how helpless they were, how much they were, didn't really

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:10.520
[Guest]: belong to the city. They're both first generation, you know, urban dwellers. And on their part,

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:19.400
[Guest]: while they were handling all the logistics, they really didn't have the capacity to understand

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:27.780
[Guest]: it as a mental health issue or to know what to do about it. There was such a massive stigma

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:35.680
[Guest]: attached to a suicide attempt by a young child, that actually the community, the family, everybody

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.700
[Guest]: rallied around them to not talk about it, to just invisibilize that, to never bring

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:49.960
[Guest]: it up. And they needed their own coping mechanisms. So they were doing a havan and they were calling

01:12:49.960 --> 01:13:00.560
[Guest]: a pandit and, you know, my mother was reading her Guru Granth Sahib all the time, and also

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:11.040
[Guest]: giving it to me to read. And so while I, I mean, over time, I realized that this is this,

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: you know, that I accepted them as they are, and kind of took it upon myself to go on this

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:29.800
[Guest]: journey by myself, in a sense. And that shift in how I understood these adults around me,

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:36.360
[Guest]: that was huge, because as a child, you can make the mistake, and I think it's not a mistake

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:42.440
[Guest]: from the child's perspective, you know, the parents have all the power, and you're completely

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:50.360
[Guest]: powerless. And in a sense, your growing up years reveal, you know, that that shifts.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:59.440
[Guest]: And for me, that shift, I also realized how traumatic it was for them. It was my father's

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:08.080
[Guest]: hair grayed in a month's time. You know, from a young 40 year old, he was suddenly looking

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:16.040
[Guest]: like an older man, my mother's body went into shock. And so that's that ridiculous idea

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:24.040
[Guest]: that I don't matter, completely, completely shifted. You know, that I would never want

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:32.840
[Guest]: to do that to them. I mean, that that kind of became a reality. And while my mother and

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.800
[Guest]: my father did not have a language to talk to me about it, it's also true that in that

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:47.800
[Guest]: world, there was no support system that could help them to find that language. If they wanted

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.240
[Guest]: to find a child counselor, they couldn't, you know, that there wasn't one. There was no family

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.640
[Guest]: counseling, even in the hospital itself. It was the the pastor who's coming in blessing

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:06.880
[Guest]: the family. Beyond that, there were no tools in a sense. And but, you know, many years

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:17.640
[Guest]: later, my daughter turned 12. And and she, you know, became quite anxious and unable

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.160
[Guest]: to deal with school, which we've spoken about before. And I and my mother looked at her

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:30.040
[Guest]: and she looked at me and she said, nobody can help this child more than you. Nobody

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:37.520
[Guest]: is better equipped to understand what Alisa is going through than you are. And I realized

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:44.240
[Guest]: in that moment that, you know, that all these years later, my mother's memory of myself

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:53.040
[Guest]: as a 12 year old is, is just as vivid. And and she, you know, she sees me as that, as

01:15:53.040 --> 01:16:01.280
[Guest]: a woman who has grown from that moment of giving up. So in in in these big and small

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:11.600
[Guest]: ways. Yeah, it's it's it's been something that kind of turned around and became like

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.640
[Amit Varma]: a gift to the family.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.040
[Amit Varma]: And it seems like what you describe of seeing your parents in a new way, that it humanize

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.720
[Amit Varma]: them for you, in the sense that I think, especially when we are kids, our parents are what they

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.320
[Amit Varma]: are, they are a role, they are a stereotype, they are, you know, in that groove. And to

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.440
[Amit Varma]: see them like that somebody's hair is graying, somebody, you know, to see them vulnerable

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.560
[Amit Varma]: to see them unable to cope. And I, I think a lot of people don't see their parents like

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:48.600
[Amit Varma]: that ever through their lives. And for it to happen at 12. And then later, when you

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:55.400
[Amit Varma]: are a parent, you know, what do you do to break that in the sense that, like, of course,

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:02.120
[Amit Varma]: your daughters would be more aware of you as a person than you perhaps were until that

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:09.040
[Amit Varma]: incident. But do you, you know, at some level, the relationship is going, you know, settles

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.400
[Amit Varma]: into these grooves. And how do you snap out? How do you like as a mother, do you sometimes

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.880
[Amit Varma]: sing that I must not be vulnerable in front of them? Or I can't show this side of myself?

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, if I am telling them to be disciplined in a particular way, I have to be that person

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.400
[Amit Varma]: and be disciplined. Like there's one moving story from one of your essays, where at one

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.760
[Amit Varma]: point, you are with your parents, and you think your father was a stern man, and you

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.960
[Amit Varma]: want to impress him that you are also a disciplinarian, and you raise your voice to one of the kids.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.720
[Amit Varma]: And the next day, your mom calls you and says, you know, your father, he was saying, don't

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:48.120
[Amit Varma]: do that. You don't know what kind of, you know, scars they can cause. So, you know,

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.640
[Amit Varma]: so what was that? You know, how do these play into each other?

01:17:52.640 --> 01:18:01.280
[Guest]: Yeah. So I'm, I try to be very mindful of that. And I think it's a bit of a it's, you

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:08.520
[Guest]: know, it's a scale that keeps moving back and forth. They're in that time where, you

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:15.280
[Guest]: know, sometimes they feel so, so lost and defeated themselves that they, they will,

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.600
[Guest]: they will say, nothing's going to come out of this. I'll never be able to cope. I, you

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:27.200
[Guest]: know, I'll never get and you have to let them be in that moment. But you also, I guess that's

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.840
[Guest]: where I bring myself into the picture too soon. You know, you also want to share that,

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:44.440
[Guest]: look, I felt exactly like that. And I found a way and you'll find a way. I do. I show

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:52.920
[Guest]: my vulnerable side to my children a lot. Sometimes my friends tell me that, that, that I should

01:18:52.920 --> 01:19:03.320
[Guest]: go a little slow and not, not be so open with them. But my experience with them, Amit, is

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:15.120
[Guest]: that there really isn't anything I can hide from them. They know. And, you know, particularly

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:25.600
[Guest]: when they were younger, they were really attuned to one's mood. And it's, I did, I did spend

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:31.120
[Guest]: the early years being very strong and always kind of trying to seem like I'm okay, when

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.080
[Guest]: I'm holding a child, when I'm in front of a child. But in retrospect, I think they can

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:43.640
[Guest]: always tell. And they tell me, they tell me, you know, they, so we've got, because I've

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.040
[Guest]: been a very keen photographer, you know, we've got a very rich family album that we often

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.920
[Guest]: go over and they'll, they'll look at my phone, they'll look at my computer. And there'll

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.720
[Guest]: be this beautiful, happy picture from a moment and they'll tell me, you know, I was really

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:07.840
[Guest]: scared that day. And I'll be like, I didn't know that. But if I remember what else was

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:16.560
[Guest]: happening, then I then I'm able to put together that yeah, so there was some chaos. And I'm

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.320
[Guest]: putting on this smile and so is the child, but she remembers that she was not feeling

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.560
[Guest]: okay in that moment. And sometimes it's very shocking for me because again, you can very

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:34.680
[Guest]: quickly begin to feel that it was all a lie. And you know, I thought it was okay, but it

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.280
[Guest]: was not okay, etc. But there's no there's no reason to have a meltdown. It's just it's

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:47.720
[Guest]: really a reminder that, you know, that it's not there is no binary of we were happy, or

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:53.720
[Guest]: we were not happy, or we're doing okay, or we're not doing okay. We're literally simultaneously

01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:00.520
[Guest]: constantly moving between, between different states, we are anxious, but we're also, you

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:09.800
[Guest]: know, fine, at the same time. And we just need to be capacious enough to, to be able

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:19.200
[Guest]: to name both and to be comfortable with the idea that both exist.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.560
[Amit Varma]: It's a very intriguing phrase capacious enough to be able to name both. And even earlier

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.160
[Amit Varma]: in different contexts, you've spoken about how, as a kid, you may not have had the language

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.680
[Amit Varma]: to put a word to something when you're talking about what things might be in your daughter's

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.000
[Amit Varma]: school, you're saying sometimes kids go through these things, but they don't have the vocabulary

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.960
[Amit Varma]: to express what is kind of going on. Like how much of a role do you think parents should

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:51.480
[Amit Varma]: play or how important rather is, is having that vocabulary, having those kind of frames,

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, you obviously you don't want to sit with your kids and tell them about the

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.800
[Amit Varma]: big bad world and all the ways in which it is big and bad when they're like seven years

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.800
[Amit Varma]: old. But at the same time, you don't want them beveled or not able to understand something

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:10.040
[Amit Varma]: not able to process something, you know. So how does this happen? Like I imagine to a

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.400
[Amit Varma]: large extent in your own case, you learn by living things happen, you figure them out,

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:20.680
[Amit Varma]: you think about them later. But in retrospect, you can put frames on things and understand

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:27.360
[Amit Varma]: them. But when it's your kids, I guess there is that dual imperative that on the one hand,

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.440
[Amit Varma]: you want them to be better prepared than you were to understand better than you were. But

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.240
[Amit Varma]: on the other hand, you don't just you know, you know that sometimes you just got to be

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.280
[Amit Varma]: spontaneous go through life, you can't control everything.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.360
[Guest]: So all of these are, you know, the fallacies of control in a sense, that you want to protect

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.020
[Guest]: them, I won't let what happened to me happen to them, man, you have no idea what will happen

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:56.680
[Guest]: to them. You want to prepare them better, you have no idea what they're going to choose,

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:07.240
[Guest]: you know, to go towards. And, and also how, while children tend to be remarkably similar,

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:13.280
[Guest]: you know, what needs to be underlined even more is how individual, how individualistic

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:23.960
[Guest]: each one is, how we are different, and how much we change as we go. And, and so our relationships

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:33.800
[Guest]: constantly need to make space for that. And mine are forever surprising me, in a sense,

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:40.520
[Guest]: with, you know, being sometimes understanding things beyond the years, but then at other

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:47.360
[Guest]: times, not being able to cope in a way that I would think is, you know, much that they

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:56.920
[Guest]: should be able to at this age. And it kind of makes you realize that they live in a world

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:04.440
[Guest]: that you don't live in, that you, you know, that you can, you're familiar with, you can

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:12.640
[Guest]: get to know it. But what is it that they are experiencing constantly when my daughter opens

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:21.480
[Guest]: the same newspaper, as I do? What is it that speaks to her from it? What is it that she

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:27.280
[Guest]: catches from an adult conversation? What is it that she brings back from something that

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:36.080
[Guest]: she's heard outside the house, and how it sits in her psyche? Is, you just, you really

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:45.600
[Guest]: need to be open to discovering how these things play out. And I think that that is perhaps

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:53.560
[Guest]: an subconscious reason why I have been such a documentator of everything, you know, of

01:24:53.560 --> 01:25:03.000
[Guest]: things we experience, of things they say, of, yeah, and I mean, so when I go back to

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.360
[Guest]: read some of the things that they've said, when they were very little, when we didn't

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.680
[Guest]: take them seriously, if somebody said, Oh, I dreamt of this, or I imagine a world in

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:18.560
[Guest]: which something can happen. But I mean, I'll just give you another example. I just read

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:28.160
[Guest]: in a journal, my four or five year old is saying, you know, heaven is a place where

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:35.360
[Guest]: once you go there, you don't age. So you, you just remain like that forever. So actually,

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:43.320
[Guest]: I know you'll die before me. But when I reach there, I'll find you. And we'll be together.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:48.440
[Guest]: And then she goes on to say, I will invent a video game. And then I will put you in that

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:54.160
[Guest]: video game. And you will be able to find, you'll have to find a treasure, which you

01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:00.040
[Guest]: will, and then all your problems will be solved. And I was just reading it like many years

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.800
[Guest]: later and thinking, this little child is imagining me as a person who's looking for some treasure

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:14.680
[Guest]: that will solve my problems. And she's trying to solve it for me by, so just like a, makes

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:21.080
[Guest]: me kind of think that while you're going about your job, keeping your face, you know, trying

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.600
[Guest]: to keep it, trying to keep your stress from your children, they probably know better than

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:31.840
[Guest]: you what your state of mind is that you're probably hiding it from yourself in a way

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:39.520
[Guest]: that it can't be hidden from a child who's connected to you. And because I suppose they're

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: so I wouldn't, I wouldn't just say dependent on you. It's also because they love you so

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.400
[Guest]: much. They want to protect you as much as you want to protect them. And we don't always

01:26:53.400 --> 01:27:02.320
[Guest]: dignify that. You know, they try to be as clued into you as, as, as you are to them.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:08.920
[Guest]: And just being with them in that sense, not you don't necessarily need to do a course

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.200
[Guest]: in how do you talk to your child about good touch, bad touch, or, you know, strangers

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.080
[Guest]: and who to talk to and who not to talk to and stuff like that. None of those things,

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.080
[Guest]: really. I mean, it's, it's good to know those things as concepts to be aware of them. But

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.200
[Guest]: how they will all play out, when they will play out, what you will learn from your child

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:37.720
[Guest]: is actually going to be much more surprising than what you are going to give to your child.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:46.000
[Guest]: And I one of the things I realized Amit was that the world doesn't feel safe to children.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.040
[Guest]: You know, that, that, that idea that we have that he doesn't even know. You know, he's

01:27:52.040 --> 01:28:00.760
[Guest]: the free child, who is unaware of what can happen to children. They're either just imbibing

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:07.760
[Guest]: our anxieties, as they are, or they are, you know, they are actually growing up in a noisier,

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.720
[Guest]: more chaotic, louder world. And, I mean, if you just pay attention to 20 minutes of television

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.280
[Guest]: in anybody's house, you'll get a sense of why. I mean, if that's the idea of the outside

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.200
[Guest]: world, it's not a surprise that they're they don't feel safe.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.840
[Amit Varma]: First of all, I have to say, I'm pretty stunned by that journal entry, because just for a

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.360
[Amit Varma]: four or five year old girl at a conceptual level to think of death in that way, or that

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.480
[Amit Varma]: we'll stay the same age or that treasure hunting is pretty mind blowing to me. And I'm also

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.720
[Amit Varma]: struck by what you said about how parents think they can control more than they actually

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.200
[Amit Varma]: can. There was this sort of seminal book of social science, which came out in the 1990s

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.320
[Amit Varma]: called The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris, where she essentially spoke about

01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:03.360
[Amit Varma]: how her study showed that kids were most influenced not by her parents, but by her peers, that

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.840
[Amit Varma]: the influence of parents was vastly overstated in popular culture, and that mostly it was

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:14.400
[Amit Varma]: peers and there was just a limited amount of difference that parents could make. While

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.600
[Amit Varma]: at the same time, it strikes me that parents can make a lot of difference in just the sense

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:28.000
[Amit Varma]: that I would imagine that your daughters have a greater sense of self awareness and questioning

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.240
[Amit Varma]: than they would if they weren't your daughters. Because that just seems to be what they see

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.240
[Amit Varma]: in you and you must be their primary role model in a sense. And it must then become

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:44.040
[Amit Varma]: a natural way that you're always thinking at that one extra level. I mean, the very

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.560
[Amit Varma]: act of journaling is something you would have encouraged and what is journaling but a way

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:53.240
[Amit Varma]: of examining yourself and shaping yourself.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:30:02.400
[Guest]: I mean, your comments are making me think that I'm also kind of now reflecting on the

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:08.080
[Guest]: same incident that she told me this story and then she probably saw me write it. And

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.960
[Guest]: you know, she probably knows it's in my phone. She probably knows where she can read something

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:21.640
[Guest]: that she would have said 10 years ago. And I guess at least what it gives the child is

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:31.440
[Guest]: a sense of being important, of you know, what I say and what I feel and what I imagine matters

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:42.840
[Guest]: because it matters to my mother. And perhaps that's what I'm trying to reverse in how

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:47.680
[Guest]: I felt when I was a 12 year old that I could vanish from this family and it won't make

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:54.960
[Guest]: a difference to anyone. It was absolutely wrong, you know, in my imagination, but it

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:01.520
[Guest]: did feel like that. The child felt like that. And I don't want to raise I don't want to

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:13.880
[Guest]: make that mistake, raising a child. And hopefully, that has been the outcome of what I've been

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:22.760
[Guest]: writing and sharing. And I know that there are two things that surprise me. You know,

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.400
[Guest]: ever since my books came out, particularly since my books came out, but even before that,

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:33.720
[Guest]: a question that comes constantly, because I have written about the family as we are

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.840
[Guest]: growing up and children as we're growing up, and I'm using our names. And you know, nothing

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:45.800
[Guest]: is camouflaged in any way. So a question that comes is what about privacy? And what will

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:50.800
[Guest]: they feel about this when they grow up? And have you thought about that? And do you have

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:58.080
[Guest]: the right to tell this story? And, of course, it's a question that kind of alerts me, but

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:03.520
[Guest]: it's not a question that I'm not already very alert to, you know, as the adult who's kind

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:10.680
[Guest]: of taking control of the narrative of the public narrative, which does influence the

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:21.960
[Guest]: private space. So while it's for me to constantly be aware of it, two things that have answered

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:29.280
[Guest]: the question for me in some way is that when I actually slowed down on writing about them,

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:34.840
[Guest]: because they had become teenagers, because they were not only were they reading everything,

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:39.480
[Guest]: which they'd been doing for years, but now their friends or, you know, random strangers

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:46.080
[Guest]: would come up to them talk about it. And I felt that I need to minimize this to some

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:51.640
[Guest]: extent, or I need to be very careful of when and what I write. And also, they're changing

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:57.840
[Guest]: so much that I don't want to write something till I know what's going on. So therefore,

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:05.800
[Guest]: the gaps are longer. And my oldest daughter, she came to me and this she came to me during

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:11.440
[Guest]: the first lockdown in the pandemic years. She said, write about me. She said, I want

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:19.320
[Guest]: to see you write about me because I want to know what you're thinking. And, and I realized

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:29.320
[Guest]: that in that sense, it was, you know, it mattered to her that it wasn't just me creating content.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.320
[Guest]: It felt so real and authentic to her that it mattered to her that she was not reflecting

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:42.560
[Guest]: in my, in my thoughts and my expression. And the other thing is this ritual that my, again,

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.240
[Guest]: something that started in the pandemic years, but the middle and the younger daughter, they

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:52.160
[Guest]: have a daily ritual. They don't have phones yet, but they will come one time in the day,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:59.400
[Guest]: take my phone, open my Facebook, go to memories, and read Facebook updates that may feature

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.160
[Guest]: them. And then they will laugh, they will giggle, they'll show it to each other, they'll

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.680
[Guest]: come to me and say, what do you think this means? They'll show me something I may have

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:12.000
[Guest]: written about myself and forgotten about, but it's something that they enjoy. So it's

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.240
[Guest]: like they're kind of referring to the history of the family via the updates. And, and, you

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:23.160
[Guest]: know, so that kind of some, to some extent answers the question of do they mind? They

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:31.640
[Guest]: don't mind. They're, they're, they're enjoying it. And yeah, so I, I mean, I've, I never

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.840
[Guest]: really have had a doubt because I process things to such an extreme extent before they

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.240
[Guest]: go out into the public domain. So I do kind of do a lot of work before it goes out. I

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.320
[Guest]: delayed the books for them to be a certain age. I've delayed my third book for them to

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.640
[Guest]: cross a certain age. So I mean, I am actually doing a lot of homework in my head, but it's

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:03.400
[Guest]: also nice to see how they react. And it strikes me that when your elder daughter came to you

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:09.880
[Amit Varma]: and said, write about me, I want to, you know, know what you're thinking. It seems as much

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:16.080
[Amit Varma]: sparked by concern for you as anything else, that the sense that maybe it'll help you to

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.200
[Amit Varma]: write about her and to write about whatever. And earlier, we were speaking about, you mentioned

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:28.040
[Amit Varma]: therapy at one point, to what extent is writing like therapy, in the sense that it helps you

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.600
[Amit Varma]: make sense of yourself, and it helps you make sense of the world. Like, you know, earlier,

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.040
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned that when we were talking about mental health, you mentioned how there are

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.720
[Amit Varma]: so many hospitals all around you for physical health, but mental health, no one takes that

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.700
[Amit Varma]: seriously. And it is as big a problem. And I guess one reason for that would be the title

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:52.240
[Amit Varma]: of the show, right mental physical health, what happens to your body is a scene, mental

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.240
[Amit Varma]: health, what's happening in your mind is the unseen. And, you know, and I had sort of had

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:02.000
[Amit Varma]: occasion to think about this recently, because I started doing pretty dramatic things for

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.480
[Amit Varma]: my physical health in the sense that I realized at one point that all of us make so much of

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:15.040
[Amit Varma]: an effort to understand the world as intellectuals and writers, but we don't know our own bodies.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.080
[Amit Varma]: And the trigger for this was one of my good friends said, why don't you get a continuous

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.420
[Amit Varma]: glucose monitor, a CGM, which I got the data from that was so alarming that I just changed

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:28.880
[Amit Varma]: everything about my life. And I became so much more aware of what I was putting in my

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.160
[Amit Varma]: body and how I was harming myself by say, not sleeping enough or, you know, sitting

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:39.200
[Amit Varma]: being too sedentary and all of that. And it's good to have that CGM for the body. But where

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.120
[Amit Varma]: is the CGM for the soul, as it were, if one can get metaphorical? How does how does one

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:50.880
[Amit Varma]: keep track of that? How can I examine my own mind and see what's going right and see what's

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:55.960
[Amit Varma]: going wrong, because the tendency is always to be self delusional about everything. So

01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:00.000
[Amit Varma]: again, tying back to that whole thing of, you know, writing a therapy is writing one

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.560
[Amit Varma]: way of doing that is writing one way of always looking within yourself and figuring out what's

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.200
[Amit Varma]: going right and what's going wrong. And even apart from that, in a larger sense, what is

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:19.240
[Guest]: the CGM for the soul? Yeah, so I would absolutely I would say yes to that writing can be that.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:27.320
[Guest]: And then I and I feel that, you know, actually, call it journaling, call it memoir writing,

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:36.680
[Guest]: call it personal writing. I think that it has a very important place in civilization.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:42.280
[Guest]: It's it's something that, you know, we only kind of dignified very famous people with

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.960
[Guest]: writing autobiographies. You you that that mattered because we wanted to be like them.

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.760
[Guest]: But we only wanted to be like them because they had become famous or rich, or they were

01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:05.200
[Guest]: born into a privilege. But what when we when we say that nobody wants to read your diary

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.120
[Guest]: or nobody wants to know your story or why does your story matter? In a way, what we

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:16.640
[Guest]: are repeating is, you know, caste, class, racial hierarchies, right? We are saying the

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.920
[Guest]: white man's story matters. The brown person's doesn't. The man's story matters. The woman's

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:27.540
[Guest]: doesn't. The adults matters. The child's doesn't. And, you know, who are you? You're just an

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:36.640
[Guest]: ordinary person. But no life is ordinary, right? And nobody has become anything without

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.920
[Guest]: at some point being ordinary. You have built on your ordinariness and discovered your extraordinary

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.440
[Guest]: or it has been recognized by the outer world as extraordinary and you've been rewarded

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:58.780
[Guest]: for it. And I just I feel that that this is something that it's like a magic pill that

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:08.420
[Guest]: nearly everybody has. And those of us who are unable to tell our stories are suffering

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:20.160
[Guest]: for it. And it reminds me of your comment about girls have it tougher. I feel that men

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.000
[Guest]: also have it really tough because they are not able to tell their story because they

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.420
[Guest]: are they are never, you know, they don't have that circle, even that circle of friends in

01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:40.060
[Guest]: which somebody will just listen to what you feel or what you experienced or what happened

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:47.260
[Guest]: to you. You know, even it's rarer for men's friendships to support them in the way that

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:54.460
[Guest]: sometimes, you know, socially women are able to often offer each other support. But to

01:39:54.460 --> 01:40:02.700
[Guest]: just to come back to writing as therapy, I feel very strongly that that this is something

01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:10.780
[Guest]: that we need to build on as as a civilization, literally, that we need to introduce it, you

01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:17.300
[Guest]: know, into schooling, we need to introduce it into our university experience. Who am

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:25.180
[Guest]: I? Where do I stand? How am I connected? Where have I come from? And so many of us, you know,

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:32.500
[Guest]: wait for so long, or wait for some kind of dramatic, near death experience before we

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:40.460
[Guest]: pay attention to, you know, what what shapes me? And what is it that I can, therefore,

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:47.220
[Guest]: give to the world? How can I make my existence significant? And it doesn't have to be in

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:54.860
[Guest]: a much large, you don't influence the outcome of a country's elections. But, you know, you

01:40:54.860 --> 01:41:00.740
[Guest]: do influence those who are around you, with every choice that you make, whether it's about

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:08.220
[Guest]: planting a tree or feeding a cat, or just being kind to your employees. And there are

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:16.900
[Guest]: just so many ways in which the human this this pinnacle of, of the biological world

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:24.540
[Guest]: can actually change things around us. And I and so so I, I really strongly feel that

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:32.180
[Guest]: it's very important for us to have spaces. We don't have to publish books, and we don't

01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:40.140
[Guest]: necessarily have to maintain years of blogs, but spaces in which we tell each other our

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:46.300
[Guest]: stories and discover how much we have in common and discover our strengths. It's literally

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:54.980
[Guest]: the same story that has your worst mistakes, as well as embodies your best coping mechanisms.

01:41:54.980 --> 01:42:02.900
[Guest]: You know, I can cloud my suicide attempt at 12 and a half in layers of shame, and write

01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:16.020
[Guest]: it off as the worst thing I did. Or I can also look at the same story and see what made

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:22.620
[Guest]: a child come to that point? And then what is it that sustained us after that? What did

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:28.420
[Guest]: it do to us? And there's so much, there's so much to learn from it, and therefore then

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:36.580
[Guest]: to share with others. And, yeah, so that's really what I've also now learned from doing

01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:43.820
[Guest]: the memoir workshops. Because I didn't know these people existed. The ones who are coming

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.300
[Guest]: and who are writing and they're damn good writers.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:54.260
[Amit Varma]: There'll be many more who will come and I'm struck by what you you know, about how men

01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:59.340
[Amit Varma]: also would be so much helped by journaling, obviously, and, you know, you go through different

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.900
[Amit Varma]: things. But I think one thing about men is that we are socialised to believe that being

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:11.300
[Amit Varma]: vulnerable is to be unmanly, right? So even in our conversations with each other, we don't

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.380
[Amit Varma]: show that vulnerable side, you know, if we tear up while watching a movie in a theatre,

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:20.660
[Amit Varma]: we'll figure out the most surreptitious way. So no one notices that a tear is kind of dripping

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:26.060
[Amit Varma]: down. And what you just said about journaling, and I keep telling all my writing students,

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:30.220
[Amit Varma]: obviously, that you must journal, it's, you know, even if you're never going to publish

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:34.060
[Amit Varma]: it, even if you write a couple of hundred words a day, no matter what it is, that it's

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.860
[Amit Varma]: so important. I had a very resonant episode with Amitabh Kumar, where, you know, he published

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:43.420
[Amit Varma]: a journal as it were the blue book, beautiful book. And he'd spoken about the value of journaling

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:50.140
[Amit Varma]: in just sort of, you know, being a way to shape yourself, you know, if in one parallel

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:54.980
[Amit Varma]: universe, I journal for the next two years, and another one, I don't, I am, it's literally

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:59.860
[Amit Varma]: two different people, you know, and if you want to be the best version of yourself, the

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:04.220
[Amit Varma]: most clear eyed version of yourself, journaling is so important. So perhaps the answer to

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:10.060
[Amit Varma]: that question, where is the CGM for the soul? The answer is, it's a journal. So on that

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:14.460
[Amit Varma]: note, let's take a quick commercial break. And we'll continue talking on the other side.

01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:19.260
[Guest]: Wonderful. Thank you.

01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:24.180
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:29.900
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog, India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009, and

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:34.540
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:40.220
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.660
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.820
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:54.660
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at India

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:30.420
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Natasha Badwar about her life

01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:38.060
[Amit Varma]: and her work and all her insights on various subjects, not just parenting, but also humaning.

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:43.140
[Amit Varma]: Is there a word like humaning? We can create one. You can create a word called humaning.

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:49.860
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, we are all humaning. So take me back to sort of your childhood then. You know,

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:54.660
[Amit Varma]: at one point, there's a sort of an interesting para by you, which I'll read out where you

01:45:54.660 --> 01:46:00.500
[Amit Varma]: say, it was a very dissonant world for me. I admired my mother, but I wanted to be like

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:05.740
[Amit Varma]: my father. I wanted to travel, I wanted credit for my intelligence. I wanted to be a part

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:11.820
[Amit Varma]: of a larger world that all men seem to slip into with ease. I wanted to become somebody

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:17.020
[Amit Varma]: unlike my mother who apparently was a nobody, stop code, which is, you know, I guess a pretty

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:24.340
[Amit Varma]: accurate description of how the world is set up in terms of how families are structured

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:29.260
[Amit Varma]: and you know, what really goes on and the scene and the unseen as it were. So tell me

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:35.740
[Amit Varma]: a little bit about your childhood, about your parents, both your mom and your dad. You know,

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:39.980
[Amit Varma]: what was it like? Where did you you've already spoken a bit about school, but apart from

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.860
[Guest]: that.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:49.300
[Guest]: Something interesting about both my parents is that they were both four years old in 1947.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:58.460
[Guest]: And that they were both born in Lahore. So the midnight straddlers. Yeah. And, but my

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:09.220
[Guest]: mother was a refugee. My father was only born in Lahore. My grandparents were in India and

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:15.340
[Guest]: remained in India on the Indian side. So they didn't go through the trauma of partition.

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:24.860
[Guest]: My mother's family is a Punjabi family who had to move under very traumatic circumstances,

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:34.220
[Guest]: leave behind a fairly affluent rural life and rebuild in Delhi and then Amritsar and

01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:44.860
[Guest]: then back in Delhi again. I think my maternal grandparents ultimately died young because

01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:51.540
[Guest]: of the aftermath. They did manage to settle their children as we say in Indian families

01:47:51.540 --> 01:48:04.580
[Guest]: and the daughters were married and the sons were had a business to work with. But there

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:12.780
[Guest]: was trauma in the family, which I find very interesting in the sense that nobody talks

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:16.020
[Amit Varma]: about it.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.140
[Amit Varma]: So you mentioned in one of your essays that your mother Sudha, she was a fifth daughter

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.860
[Amit Varma]: and the sixth child of her parents. And there were eight siblings. In fact, the sister she

01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:30.460
[Amit Varma]: was closest to had killed herself in early 20s. Her name was Chanchal. Tell me a little

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:38.780
[Amit Varma]: bit about what you sort of, what was their sense of family in the sense, were they always

01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:43.780
[Amit Varma]: relatives around, were these much larger families than you would find today? So what was that

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:50.580
[Amit Varma]: sort of a family environment, which was there when you grew up? And you also mentioned that

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:55.460
[Amit Varma]: your mother would talk to you about a sister. What are the other kinds of conversations

01:48:55.460 --> 01:49:01.180
[Amit Varma]: that you would have with both your parents?

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:08.940
[Guest]: My mother remembers her growing up years very fondly. She has no pre partition memory. She

01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:16.340
[Guest]: has heard stories from her own family. But she remembers those growing up years of all

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:23.900
[Guest]: of them being in a house in Amritsar, of her mother being this very extremely talented

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:31.420
[Guest]: woman who was milking the cows, cooking on the tandoor, embroidering everything in the

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:39.380
[Guest]: house and raising these amazing children. At the same time, her father was a gifted

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:46.140
[Guest]: entrepreneur, what we would call today a serial entrepreneur. At one point, he did well enough

01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:56.460
[Guest]: to go to Germany, buy a Mercedes and come back to Delhi driving it from Berlin. So quite

01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:08.260
[Guest]: an adventurer. But he did pass on in his 50s. And so, mum remembers it all very fondly.

01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:15.100
[Guest]: She remembers a large family. In fact, what I find quite amusing and interesting is when

01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:22.740
[Guest]: my husband, who also grew up in a large extended family in a village, you know, where these

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:29.420
[Guest]: brothers are living together, and they have visiting relatives throughout summer every

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:37.660
[Guest]: year. So when my husband and my mother sit and chat, they have so much in common. And

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.380
[Guest]: I who grew up in a city will just kind of sit on the margin and hear the two of them

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:49.900
[Guest]: exchanging notes on their cows and their animals and their farms and the things they grew and

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:56.720
[Guest]: what they did as children. And it makes me wonder, it makes me wonder how I went and

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:05.100
[Guest]: found someone who would, you know, match with my mother in this way. So, yeah, so, you know,

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:16.060
[Guest]: this would be our, in popular terms, we would call this a family that did very well, despite

01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:25.300
[Guest]: adverse circumstances, that survived well, that is a, you know, a well to do Punjabi

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:36.540
[Guest]: family who found their feet. What we all saw, and what we all lived through was also alcoholism,

01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:48.580
[Guest]: addiction, preferential treatment towards the brothers or the sisters. My mother hates

01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:59.980
[Guest]: to phrase it like that she won't do it. But I need to, I need to, because I don't want,

01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:04.820
[Guest]: you know, I didn't want as a child, as I wrote in that essay, I didn't want as a child to

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:14.500
[Guest]: be to grow up to enter a marriage in which I had to minimize myself to fit in. As I saw

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:24.180
[Guest]: my mother having to do, my mother is as capable as my father, she's very smart, very bright.

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:31.820
[Guest]: But she has to be careful around the male egos in the family. She plays her role, you

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:41.340
[Guest]: know, good naturedly. But it was not something that I could emulate. As an Indian woman of

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:49.300
[Guest]: the 70s, who grew up in the 70s. And I just want to, as an aside, Amit, share with you

01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:53.860
[Guest]: that one of the films that came out when I was a very little child, the first one I remember

01:52:53.860 --> 01:53:00.500
[Guest]: seeing is Sholay. And there's Hema Malini and her tanga. And there are all the rescue

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:07.940
[Guest]: scenes, you know, that despite the fact that she's playing the dumb ballet in the beginning,

01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:14.900
[Guest]: she's an independent woman. She's growing up with her aunt, without any parents. She

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:22.380
[Guest]: knows how to control a horse. The whole village is dependent on her for commuting. And, you

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:32.260
[Guest]: know, she does these amazing rescue acts when required. And, you know, that's the world

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:38.260
[Guest]: I grew up in. That's the woman I saw on the screen. And this other film that came out

01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:44.060
[Guest]: around that time was Bobby. And while I didn't see Bobby as a very young child, I saw it

01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:52.620
[Guest]: later, much later. I remember one of the early scenes when Dimple Kapadia stands in a doorway,

01:53:52.620 --> 01:54:04.300
[Guest]: I think, with her hand on her waist and says, I'm a 21st century girl. And, you know, and

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:09.180
[Guest]: my little brain is going 21st century. So this is the 20th. So if she's the 21st century,

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:15.940
[Guest]: then so am I. And therefore, this is the kind of woman, this is the kind of assertiveness,

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:25.860
[Guest]: the kind of agency that I can have. And those are, you know, just some early decisions that

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:35.100
[Guest]: one took. It estranged me from my mother for many years. But I can say that, that over

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:43.540
[Guest]: the years, as I grew more aware and more mature, and also, you know, read good fiction and

01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:53.700
[Guest]: nonfiction and, and became aware of feminist ideas, I began to, to not to see her as the

01:54:53.700 --> 01:55:00.940
[Guest]: gifted person she is and not as a person who may have chosen to be chosen the roles that

01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:08.340
[Guest]: are thrust upon her, you know, I began to see what else she's doing to express her individuality,

01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:14.300
[Guest]: and how much I can gain from actually choosing my mother as my role model. It took me many

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:22.300
[Guest]: years, it took me decades, but I got there. And I think that that's, to be fair, been

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:28.900
[Guest]: a kind of a personal mental health journey for me. I cannot imagine a worse estrangement

01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:36.220
[Guest]: for anybody than to not be able to identify with the parents who care for you. Because

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:40.140
[Guest]: then you're kind of lost in the world, you're just kind of looking for something else to

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:48.620
[Guest]: attach yourself to. And, and you don't necessarily have the best healthy boundaries, when you're

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:58.420
[Guest]: in that kind of state of mind. My father is a very interesting man. He's, he grew up in

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:06.820
[Guest]: a very authoritarian home. My grandfather, who was, interestingly, very, very kind to

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:14.580
[Guest]: me, he was, he was my grandfather, I was the chosen granddaughter, in a sense, I was favoured

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.820
[Guest]: over in terms of affection, in terms of his show of affection, I was favoured over the

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:28.180
[Guest]: boys, the grandsons, but Dadaji raised three boys, and he raised them very, very strictly

01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:35.580
[Guest]: to the extent that they would hide when he came home. And also, my grandmother was very

01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:44.860
[Guest]: ill and not able to, not able to withstand what partition had done to her family in many

01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:56.100
[Guest]: ways. So Papa became an engineer, got a scholarship to study and joined the steel industry. And

01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:04.540
[Guest]: in, in that, I think that that truly liberated my parents in a very interesting way. In that

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:14.620
[Guest]: his, when they got married, he was in Bhilai. And in Bhilai, they were no longer of their

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:23.340
[Guest]: village, no longer of their community. They belonged to this community of young engineers,

01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:30.380
[Guest]: and their spouses, who had come from all over the country, who became friends, who kind

01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:38.220
[Guest]: of offered support and solidarity and friendship and happiness and laughter to each other.

01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:45.300
[Guest]: And I think it freed all of them in a in a very interesting way from the baggage of their

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:53.100
[Guest]: growing up years. And there was also, I guess, they were building the nation in a sense,

01:57:53.100 --> 01:58:01.420
[Guest]: that he was part of Steel Authority of India. In the beginning, then he moved on to be a

01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:09.500
[Guest]: design engineer in Mekon. So he came to Ranchi. And he's, he's been an engineer all his life.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:19.340
[Guest]: He's still working in his late 70s. He's still working. So he's a workaholic. Clearly, he

01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:25.900
[Guest]: cannot stop. He tried, you know, the lockdown made him stop. And he felt so miserable that

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:31.940
[Guest]: he said, I'm now, I know, I know what I'm going to feel like if, if or when I retire.

01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:38.020
[Guest]: So I have decided that I'm not going to retire, I will work till the very end. And we have

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:50.180
[Guest]: learned reluctantly as his adult children to honour his need, in a sense. So, so yeah,

01:58:50.180 --> 01:59:03.180
[Guest]: I come from these two Indian, ordinary Indians, who were part of the building of this nation,

01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:10.420
[Guest]: to an extent. So none of them are, you know, both of them are first generation, English

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:19.260
[Guest]: speakers. None of them speak it very fluently. So for them to raise children in Bhilai, in

01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:27.220
[Guest]: Ranchi, in Calcutta, the whole idea was, you know, to raise this modern generation of Indians

01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:33.700
[Guest]: who would be global citizens. And they made the choices that were available to them, standing

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:40.100
[Guest]: in long queues to make sure that we got admission in good schools, saving and scrounging to

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:46.620
[Guest]: pay the fees, when they chose schools that had the highest fee, etc. You know, for the

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:53.700
[Guest]: for a very long time, when I when I grew up, and I kind of joined some of the civil society

01:59:53.700 --> 02:00:02.260
[Guest]: movements, when I was in college, the Narmada Bachao Andolan was at its peak in the just

02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:10.340
[Guest]: around the 90s, the early 90s. And, and here was, you know, my parents are raising these

02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:17.980
[Guest]: three children, yeh doctor banega, yeh engineer banega, yeh teacher banegi. So she can raise

02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:25.820
[Guest]: children on the side, etc. But because of, because of our education, because of what

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:34.180
[Guest]: we were exposed to in a rapidly changing India, because this was a post emergency, post

02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:40.820
[Guest]: Naxalite movement world, you know, we were aware of the fact that the youth is very

02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:46.700
[Guest]: powerful, that you can resist, you can exercise dissent, you can, you can have a new

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:52.380
[Guest]: imagination. Now, you're no longer building the nation, you are asking some very important

02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:58.420
[Guest]: questions about the environment and about indigenous people. So I was drawn to the Narmada

02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:05.100
[Guest]: Bachao Andolan. And one of the first questions that one of the activists asked me at that

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:11.940
[Guest]: point, they said something about all the problems of this country are because of middle class

02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:17.740
[Guest]: of the middle class. And I remember thinking, my father is middle class, what has he done?

02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:25.020
[Guest]: What has he done wrong, that that these people are blaming someone like him for and it took

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:32.660
[Guest]: me a very long time to make the connections about what we blame the middle class in a

02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:36.620
[Guest]: very generalized form for.

02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:42.860
[Amit Varma]: So I want to dive deeper into each of these people you mentioned. But first, I want to

02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.780
[Amit Varma]: ask about your nani. Like you've got this quote in one of your essays about how your

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:55.500
[Amit Varma]: nani shifted from, you know, Lahore to Amritsar. And you write quote, it took years, decades,

02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:00.660
[Amit Varma]: generations for them to feel at home again. And I noticed that in right at the start of

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:06.100
[Amit Varma]: your first book, you have this biographical line, which says Natasha Badwar was born in

02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:11.420
[Amit Varma]: Ranchi grew up in Kolkata and refused to accept Delhi as home for the next three decades.

02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:18.260
[Amit Varma]: So I want to sort of ask you to talk a little bit about what did you mean by your nani and

02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:22.620
[Amit Varma]: presumably other members of the family as well, not feeling at home for the longest

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:28.300
[Amit Varma]: time, and the concept of home as well. Like I read elsewhere, that one of your husband's

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:32.820
[Amit Varma]: favorite books is Aadha Gaon by Rahim Asom Raza, which is also a little bit about this

02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:39.140
[Amit Varma]: right about coming to terms with what home is. So, you know, tell me a little bit about

02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:44.700
[Amit Varma]: this that, you know, what is home, you had another essay about it later, you know, within

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:49.580
[Amit Varma]: your nuclear family, as it were, we're talking about the concept of home and about your husband

02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:55.580
[Amit Varma]: can really just chill anywhere, but it's not quite like that for you and how you've, you

02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:01.060
[Amit Varma]: know, eventually learned to come to terms with what home could be for you. So take me

02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:06.500
[Amit Varma]: a little bit through this journey of thinking about it, because, you know, I think particularly

02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:12.380
[Amit Varma]: for that generation, and my father also was born in Lahore. So that means so that's like

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:21.100
[Amit Varma]: a lot of Lahore bonnies, as it were. So that notion of home and feeling that you belong

02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:25.100
[Amit Varma]: in a particular place is really interesting to me, especially for the generation of our

02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:31.580
[Amit Varma]: parents and even for us in just, yeah, even for us.

02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:38.740
[Guest]: So what I know of my nani from my mother, and my mother is quite a storyteller, particularly

02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:45.740
[Guest]: of those childhood years that are just, if she doesn't tell anyone, then they don't exist.

02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:54.020
[Guest]: So her daughter becomes her witness in that sense. But they come from, I actually grew

02:03:54.020 --> 02:04:01.020
[Guest]: up, went to Lahore, and looked for the place and it was the village has now been, you know,

02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:09.860
[Guest]: kind of taken in by the city. So they came from a large village home. They were landowners,

02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:19.380
[Guest]: my nana and nani. And my, my mother describes my nani as somebody who was, you know, when

02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:25.540
[Guest]: the when the marriage proposal came, then she was chosen because she was such a talented

02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:34.380
[Guest]: young girl, she could do everything herself. And in my maternal grandparents home is the

02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:44.580
[Guest]: charkha that my nani used, is this contraption, I forget what it's called, in which she made

02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:52.340
[Guest]: butter out of milk. And what they did when they came, she was actually expecting. My

02:04:52.340 --> 02:05:04.060
[Guest]: aunt was born in September 47. And my grandfather brought his pregnant wife over first to Shimla

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:09.700
[Guest]: in July or August to make sure that she was safe, and then brought the rest of the children

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:17.900
[Guest]: and the extended family across the border, when they knew that they would have to shift.

02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:25.580
[Guest]: So in the course of the years where they first lived in a small place in Delhi, then they

02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:32.460
[Guest]: moved to Amritsar, where he started a transporters business, he, he had trucks, and then later

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:39.500
[Guest]: he had buses. And then they came back to Delhi and bought a large piece of land on the out

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:44.900
[Guest]: skirts of Delhi. They call that they refer to that home as border, because it's the Delhi

02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:56.940
[Guest]: Ghaziabad border. And in that home, I think, the way it's described to me by my mother,

02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:06.060
[Guest]: she recreated her village life. It was for after years, it was a big enough plot, a small

02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:13.660
[Guest]: house. They kept their own cows. They she had she built a tandoor with her own hands,

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:20.180
[Guest]: she would make chapatis with the house help in that tandoor every day. And, you know,

02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:29.300
[Guest]: this battery of sons and daughters, and extended family and in-laws that that Nani served.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:37.500
[Guest]: So yeah, Nani is a bit of a superhero. In my mom's retelling, as well as in my imagination,

02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:47.500
[Guest]: I only knew her as an old woman. And as somebody who rarely got out of bed. She wore white,

02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:52.340
[Guest]: because Nana had passed on by then. And I think a lot of us remember these grandmothers

02:06:52.340 --> 02:07:04.820
[Guest]: who were white Muslim and had very soft hands. I also grew up visiting my father's parents

02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:13.460
[Guest]: in Punjab. And in in almost every, every, every summer vacation, we would visit them

02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:20.460
[Guest]: and every two years, we would visit them in a new place. Because Dadaji was a postmaster.

02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:27.340
[Guest]: He was. Yeah, so he worked in the post office. And for us as little children, he was a very

02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:33.060
[Guest]: important man because wherever he was posted, he was the top boss in the post office. He

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:42.700
[Guest]: had a house next to the post office. He had people who worked for him. So towns like Fagwada,

02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:53.260
[Guest]: Mirkotla, Barnala, and then finally Jalandhar were like home to us. Those were places we

02:07:53.260 --> 02:08:02.540
[Guest]: used to visit. Also, Dadi's home, her maternal home was a very small village called Makhu.

02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:12.780
[Guest]: And they had migrated. They were refugees from the Pakistan side of Punjab. And they

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:20.820
[Guest]: later, after 1984, left their village again and came to Delhi and settled on the outskirts

02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:33.340
[Guest]: of Delhi in a more rural place. So being uprooted, losing home, building home, these are perhaps

02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:42.220
[Guest]: these are themes that kind of run in the family in a sense. My grandfather's village, which

02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:48.940
[Guest]: would be, you know, the village from where we originated as the Badwar family, is a village

02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:56.660
[Guest]: called Khemkaran. And Khemkaran's in the history books because it's the site of the largest

02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:07.740
[Guest]: tank war in 1971 or maybe earlier, the Indo-Pak war, not 71, the Indo-Pak war. There's a film

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:14.380
[Guest]: with Devanand in it in which he's part of the tank war and it's taking place in Khemkaran.

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:22.100
[Guest]: So Khemkaran barely exists anymore, because while it survived on this side of India, it

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:31.340
[Guest]: was too close to the border to survive the war. I never felt an affiliation to go to

02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:39.860
[Guest]: Khemkaran or not. But in my late 20s, I was working closely with a sociologist. And he

02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:46.420
[Guest]: asked me once over dinner, where are you from? And I mentioned Khemkaran. And he said, so

02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:52.300
[Guest]: what is it like? And I said, I've never been there. And, you know, he's an Englishman who

02:09:52.300 --> 02:10:03.140
[Guest]: had spent his life studying Indian communities. And he was quite shocked that he was meeting

02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:11.500
[Guest]: an adult who was a media person who was not curious about the village that she had come

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:19.660
[Guest]: from. And it gave me food for thought. It made me look for the answer to the question

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:27.540
[Guest]: of why I was not curious about Khemkaran per se. And over the years, I realized maybe I

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:36.500
[Guest]: identify stronger with my grandmothers than with my grandfather. And with the non-Badwars

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:47.460
[Guest]: of the Badwar clan, you know, than the Badwar men, in a sense, and that's fine, as well.

02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:56.900
[Guest]: I did, when I met my husband, who's from a village in East UP, and grew up in a very

02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:02.580
[Guest]: interesting town called Jaunpur, but his village home is actually a village continues. It's

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:10.980
[Guest]: still a village in Ghazipur. One of the, you know, one of the vaguely attractive things

02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:18.860
[Guest]: that vague seeming things that I was attracted to was the fact that being with him would

02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:25.500
[Guest]: give me a village. And it would give my children a village to go to. And it's a it's a very

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:31.300
[Guest]: strange and convoluted kind of thing. It doesn't rationally make sense, but somehow you want

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:42.500
[Guest]: to give them the childhood that you have experienced. And because of the because of the very oppressive,

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:52.060
[Guest]: patriarchal ways of both sides of my Punjabi family, and possibly because of the violence

02:11:52.060 --> 02:12:01.740
[Guest]: and the addiction that was not spoken about, I really didn't want to ever go back and look

02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:13.300
[Guest]: for home in that part. I kind of wanted to create a new home, not so consciously. But

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:18.700
[Guest]: perhaps in a subconscious way, which is why even when I began to volunteer with the Narmada

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:24.900
[Guest]: Bachao Andolan and went to work in a tribal area in Madhya Pradesh, and I spent some very

02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:31.700
[Guest]: significant months between my 20th birthday and my 21st birthday in a remote tribal village

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:37.660
[Guest]: in Jhabua. For the next few years, if someone asked me where are you from, I would say Jhabua.

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:46.220
[Guest]: I would say Madhya Pradesh. So I was missing home. I didn't have, I didn't want to belong

02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:56.060
[Guest]: where I was technically from. But I was trying to imagine a new home. And my husband's favorite

02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:02.220
[Guest]: story is that I tricked him. Because when he asked me, but are you a Punjabi? I said,

02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:08.460
[Guest]: no, I'm from I'm a Bihari. I'm from Ranchi, which is true. I am from Ranchi. And when

02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:15.900
[Guest]: we visited our relatives in Delhi and Punjab as children up to the age of 10, they would,

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:20.860
[Guest]: you know, perjuratively call us Biharis. They would say, Bihari aagay, Bihari aagay, ye

02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:26.900
[Guest]: chawal khaate hain, which was like a bitter joke in a Punjabi family. Because we would

02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:32.100
[Amit Varma]: look for rice when there was only roti. Chawal better than roti. I mean, they're both carbs,

02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.140
[Amit Varma]: but still on a relative scale, chawal better than roti. But sorry. Yeah. And, and, and

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:44.100
[Guest]: we had, we had an accent. We, we said ek tho, do tho, teen tho. And it made me, you know,

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:53.100
[Guest]: almost it, it made me more loyal to my accent, to my home, to the idea that yeah, I'm born

02:13:53.100 --> 02:14:01.100
[Guest]: in Ranchi and I am from Ranchi and who even wants to be from Punjab? Yeah, so it's, it's

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:09.580
[Guest]: kind of a shifting concept. Delhi was very hard for me to accept as home when for my

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:16.380
[Guest]: mother, it was a homecoming. For my father, it was the ultimate upward mobility. Because

02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:22.980
[Guest]: what better can you do if you, you know, as an engineer, then having a private sector

02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:28.980
[Guest]: job after all those years in the government sector in Delhi, where ultimately he buys

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:35.180
[Guest]: a DDF flat and he sends his children to public school. And, you know, for him, it was a kind

02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:44.220
[Guest]: of a culmination of all the hard work he had put in. But for me, it was the loss of a childhood.

02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:51.140
[Guest]: And my brothers didn't experience it like that. So I suppose it's somehow connects to

02:14:51.140 --> 02:15:00.580
[Guest]: the uniqueness of who we are as children. And maybe Amit in a way childhood is home.

02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:09.540
[Guest]: And when, when I imagined raising my children in Delhi, you know, I wondered, where is the

02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:17.660
[Guest]: home? Which is the home that I will take them to? And I was, I continue to be very excited

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:25.940
[Guest]: about what I now very openly call my village home, which is my husband's home. You know,

02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:32.340
[Guest]: we've been together for 20 years. I still stick out. I mean, I will always stick out

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:42.020
[Guest]: in that village. But it is my home. It is what I want to accept as my home. And of course,

02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:49.260
[Guest]: it is now my children's home. So there's no question about it. And I guess that is in

02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:57.660
[Guest]: a long winded meandering way about one's search for a place where you can belong, where you

02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:05.820
[Guest]: can feel rooted, where you feel accepted as you are, without, you know, where they are

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:12.740
[Guest]: happy to see you just as you, not because of what you're doing in your career, or what's

02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:18.700
[Guest]: in your, you know, what's your bank balance, or whether you're famous, or, you know, what

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:23.340
[Guest]: your social media followers are. It's just a place where you go, and everybody's just

02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:31.060
[Guest]: always happy to see that you have come. But I must add that the pandemic being locked

02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:37.180
[Guest]: down in our home, in Greater Noida, which again, I didn't want to belong to, I was very

02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:46.140
[Guest]: resistant about that corner of the world where we were together. And where we kind of began

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:52.420
[Guest]: to, where a community of cats adopted us, and now we have two dogs as well, became the

02:16:52.420 --> 02:17:02.660
[Guest]: place where we, I felt for the first time that I grew roots. And it is, for my husband,

02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:07.700
[Guest]: it's a temporary home, he still imagines where he will retire, what he will build, maybe

02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:11.820
[Guest]: in the mountains, maybe in Auroville. But his children are born in this house. So now

02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:20.060
[Guest]: they're like, you can go where you want, but we are here. So it's interesting. And it's,

02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:28.460
[Guest]: it's joyous to see how each generation actually defines their own sense of home.

02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:34.020
[Amit Varma]: And maybe for younger generations, and I'm thinking aloud, maybe for younger generations,

02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:37.620
[Amit Varma]: part of the concept of, I mean, the concept of home might be more nebulous, because part

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:43.100
[Amit Varma]: of their growing up is also on the internet. And in all these virtual spaces, and the geography

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:48.580
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter so much. But, you know, for your kids to one day be asked, where are you

02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:55.020
[Amit Varma]: from and for them to have to say Greater Noida doesn't sound exactly madly appealing to me.

02:17:55.020 --> 02:18:00.620
[Amit Varma]: So now I have a question about one of the Bhadwars, which is your Dadaji, right? And

02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:05.780
[Amit Varma]: at one point, you write about one, he's the only grandparent you really got to know, he

02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:11.580
[Amit Varma]: lived till 90. And you were both sort of loving and confrontational. And I'll ask you to elaborate

02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:16.580
[Amit Varma]: on that. But first, you know, you point out that when he got to know that you were going

02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:22.980
[Amit Varma]: to marry a Muslim, Afzal, he was very upset about it. And you write, quote, Dadaji took

02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:27.180
[Amit Varma]: the news of my decision to marry Afzal, a Muslim from Uttar Pradesh very badly. For

02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:31.620
[Amit Varma]: a few days, he seemed to lose his grip on reality. He began to hallucinate and became

02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:35.900
[Amit Varma]: paranoid. We did not know whether he would recover, but he did. When he met my in-laws,

02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:42.020
[Amit Varma]: eventually, he was gracious, soaking in conversations in Urdu with my father-in-law and Afzal. When

02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:45.940
[Amit Varma]: my when our youngest child Naseem was born, he called out to her each time we visited

02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:51.140
[Amit Varma]: and glowed with happiness when she responded to him. Stop quote. And I'm just thinking

02:18:51.140 --> 02:18:59.660
[Amit Varma]: here of that original reaction of his being so natural, because these people must have

02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:06.900
[Amit Varma]: carried with them these unspoken, perhaps invisible scars from what happened during

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:13.700
[Amit Varma]: partition. So and, you know, a lot of stories I hear about people from that time and somewhere

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:19.780
[Amit Varma]: hidden in some subterranean way, you know, that scar is there, those memories are there,

02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:25.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, any other generation, say a generation after that, you know, like your kids, for

02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:30.860
[Amit Varma]: example, would not, you know, their grandparents would have lived normal lives relatively,

02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:35.100
[Amit Varma]: but these your kids, grandparents, but your grandparents were uprooted. And that was part

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:40.520
[Amit Varma]: of what you saw. And you only got glimpses of it. And I'm guessing this was a glimpse.

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:49.180
[Amit Varma]: So when you see, like, how much of a psychic scar was partition, not just on that generation,

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:56.420
[Amit Varma]: but on our culture, in the sense that we can today see the religious polarization around

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.620
[Amit Varma]: us. I mean, it's not even that to just call it by its name, there is this vicious anti

02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:06.860
[Amit Varma]: Muslim politics that is destroying our society, right? And the question is that, are these

02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:12.700
[Amit Varma]: fissures that, you know, go back 10s, but go back decades and hundreds of years? Or

02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:17.580
[Amit Varma]: is partition still a big part of it, especially in the north? You know, nebulous question,

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:22.180
[Amit Varma]: but how does memory play a part in all of this, perhaps even a collective memory, because

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:28.620
[Amit Varma]: that generation is really, you know, old and whatever, but you see young people everywhere,

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:33.660
[Amit Varma]: seething with so much rage directed at the other, when they can't have any memory of

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:39.340
[Amit Varma]: what went on, you know, they watch Hindi films all the time, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan,

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:43.980
[Amit Varma]: etc, etc. So what's sort of going on here?

02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:53.140
[Guest]: I do agree that partition is a scar on our psyche. But I don't believe, Amit, that what

02:20:53.140 --> 02:21:00.500
[Guest]: we are living through in terms of this very vicious anti Muslim sentiment in Indian society

02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:09.220
[Guest]: at this moment, not only sentiment, but acts at this moment, in time are connected to the

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:18.740
[Guest]: tragedy of the partition. My grandfather, who did, who was alive, when Afzal and I decided

02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:27.220
[Guest]: to get married, is not, you know, he did not suffer the blow of partition at a personal

02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:37.380
[Guest]: level. My mother, who did, is a natural liberal. She knew Afzal from the day I knew him. She

02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:43.420
[Guest]: liked him from the day I liked him. She loved him from the day I loved him. She has a natural

02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:53.340
[Guest]: connection to him. So do many other members of my family, who are, you know, while there

02:21:53.340 --> 02:22:02.620
[Guest]: are some people who are not able to get over the loss and do hold a grudge against a community

02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:08.340
[Guest]: that would have perpetrated violence on members of their family. At the same time, there are

02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:17.100
[Guest]: enough partition survivors who mourned the loss of the social fabric that was actually

02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:25.500
[Guest]: very syncretic and very supportive of them. So on my mother's side, the stories that we

02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:34.500
[Guest]: hear again and again is how when my grandfather went back, and he went back many times. And,

02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:40.060
[Guest]: you know, like most people who cross the borders, they didn't realize for a very long time that

02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:44.580
[Guest]: very soon would come a day when the border would be sealed. They were not anticipating

02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:49.820
[Guest]: the wars. So they were actually thinking, okay, we have to live here, but we can go

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:57.140
[Guest]: back and forth. So my grandfather went back, and he went back a couple of times. And he

02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:03.860
[Guest]: was always received with great hospitality, people, his neighbors, his, you know, people

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:08.820
[Guest]: who worked on his farm, they would cry when they met him, they would host him, they had

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:15.060
[Guest]: kept with great protection, the things that he had left behind and given them to him when

02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:21.780
[Guest]: he went to pick them up. So he suffered loss, but he didn't have any rancor against people.

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:32.580
[Guest]: He saw it as a political act. He was able to see it like that. And what we see in our

02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:40.140
[Guest]: society today, what we are, you know, what a lot of young people are beginning to subscribe

02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:47.420
[Guest]: to is, I don't think we can blame the violence of partition for it. This is a systematic

02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:56.300
[Guest]: work done by the RSS and by the the Hindu right wing over years. And my grandfather's

02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:05.060
[Guest]: reaction to, you know, his granddaughter choosing to marry a Muslim came from his affiliation

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:15.580
[Guest]: with the RSS, not from his memories. And my brother told me, my older brother once told

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:22.340
[Guest]: me that, you know, when I was, he lives in the US, he went there as a doctor to study

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:28.220
[Guest]: further and settle there. And when I met him after that, the first time he told me, you

02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:38.180
[Guest]: know what Papa said to me when I was at the airport? And he said, listen, you'll meet

02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:46.340
[Guest]: people and you'll make choices. Just make sure it's not a Muslim. And I was like, really?

02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:52.420
[Guest]: It was not something that had ever been articulated in our home. We had never heard our father.

02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:59.780
[Guest]: He had never said anything like this in our home. But he said it to his son. And interestingly,

02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:08.700
[Guest]: he never said it to me. Of course, I am the special child of the family. That's also part

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:18.940
[Guest]: of the truth. But it alerted me to this code. And I think that when Dadaji reacted, Dadaji

02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:24.820
[Guest]: had earlier, when he had discovered that I had a friend, a male friend, his first question

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:31.820
[Guest]: was what caste is he? And I was like, goodness gracious. It's the 1990s. Are we still asking

02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:42.100
[Guest]: caste? I was blind. I was blind to how much how relevant this question still was and continues

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:49.380
[Guest]: to be. I'd just grown up in this kind of, you know, bubble that young people often do.

02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:53.420
[Guest]: They believe what is in their textbooks, and they believe what is in their inspirational

02:25:53.420 --> 02:26:03.740
[Guest]: stories that they have read or what the leaders are saying. So his, it was more of a patriarchal

02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:16.500
[Guest]: got, you know, keep the family within the caste class structure reaction. And even when

02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:23.660
[Guest]: the anti-CAA protest started, I remember my mother was very upset. And this is not a political

02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:28.940
[Guest]: woman. This is not a woman who's, you know, reading a lot or keeping, you know, she's

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:37.180
[Guest]: not a drawing room commentator of politics. But it hurt her enough to say to me, what's

02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:46.020
[Guest]: going on? This is too much. Ye zyada ho gaya. You know, and this was a natural reaction

02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:54.060
[Guest]: of a person. So I think that I often wonder what it is, what are the influences that take

02:26:54.060 --> 02:27:06.500
[Guest]: us towards liberal choices? And we are other people towards these very exclusionary ideas.

02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:12.420
[Amit Varma]: I'm in partition as a psychic fissure, which is a contributing factor. I think we've been

02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:17.140
[Amit Varma]: an illiberal society for the longest time. I'd done this episode with Akshay Mukul on

02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:24.140
[Amit Varma]: the Gita Press, and all of these issues that seem so toxic today, love jihad, cow slaughter,

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:28.620
[Amit Varma]: all of these, these were live political issues in the 20s, they were politicized, they were

02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:34.500
[Amit Varma]: kept alive. And, and yet there is also the other side, like I did an episode with Mukulika

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:39.540
[Amit Varma]: Banerjee, I don't know if you heard that, where she speaks about how she spent some

02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:45.380
[Amit Varma]: time in Pakistan, because she was, you know, writing a book on the Khuda-e-Khidmatgar.

02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:50.680
[Amit Varma]: And obviously the Khuda-e-Khidmatgar had died down soon after partition. But she was looking

02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:57.340
[Amit Varma]: for survivors and going from village to village to try and find people who still survived.

02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:03.460
[Amit Varma]: So all through rural northwest frontier province. And she realized as she set out on those journeys,

02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:08.700
[Amit Varma]: that over there, the food that was really cheap was beef. And but every house would

02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:12.420
[Amit Varma]: have one chicken and chickens were really expensive. But every house would have one

02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:17.100
[Amit Varma]: chicken for a special guest, if a special guest ever wanted it. And every time she would

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:22.580
[Amit Varma]: land up, you know, just out of basic mehman nawazi, they would give her the chicken and

02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:27.460
[Amit Varma]: she felt guilty that they are spending them, you know, so much money. And she didn't want

02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:32.180
[Amit Varma]: that. So she started eating beef. And then she speaks about how she went home and she

02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:36.500
[Amit Varma]: told her mother this. And her mother thought for a while and said, beta yeh toh karna hi

02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:43.420
[Amit Varma]: toh insaniyat hai, right, which shows that many of us we could be religious, but there

02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:49.180
[Amit Varma]: is also that strain that, you know, you have that empathy for the for everyone around you,

02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:54.580
[Amit Varma]: you have that sense of living together. And I'm reminded of this by a story I read about

02:28:54.580 --> 02:29:00.220
[Amit Varma]: Ehsan Jafri, which also ties in with one of the essays that you wrote in your first book

02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.100
[Amit Varma]: and you put on your newsletter recently. And the story about Ehsan Jafri is that he suffered

02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:12.820
[Amit Varma]: through riots in the 60s or early 70s or whatever. But he refused to shift to a Muslim only area.

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:16.180
[Amit Varma]: He said, I will not go to a ghetto. He said, that is not the India I believe in. In the

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:20.780
[Amit Varma]: India I believe in, we can all live together, nothing will happen. Right. And he did that

02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:25.420
[Amit Varma]: he made that choice. And we know what happened to him. Right. And you wrote this essay about

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:30.860
[Amit Varma]: how you tried to book a hotel for your husband and Amritsar. And you had a perfectly nice

02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:36.960
[Amit Varma]: conversation with the people who ran this guest house or gave out the house on rent

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:42.360
[Amit Varma]: and whatever, till they discovered that your husband's name was Muslim and you were booking

02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:48.820
[Amit Varma]: it for him. And you got really offended when you know, they just changed their tone completely.

02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:53.940
[Amit Varma]: And your thing was that forget it, we'll just find another place. But your husband said

02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:58.660
[Amit Varma]: that no, I want to talk to them. You know, they've probably never met someone like me.

02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:02.100
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned how he was from a school where he was the only one like that people

02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:06.260
[Amit Varma]: would come to look at him to see what he looks like. But then they all became friends. And

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:12.520
[Amit Varma]: he said, no, it's important for them to meet me. And what I find here is this common belief

02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:20.300
[Amit Varma]: between Ehsan Jafri, between your husband, between millions of Muslims who made the choice

02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:27.540
[Amit Varma]: in partition to stay in India to embrace a particular vision of what this country is

02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:34.540
[Amit Varma]: like. Right. And I find that very moving, because I now wonder if in a sense, either

02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:39.780
[Amit Varma]: they were wrong, or they have been betrayed. Because my sense growing up in the elite bubble

02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:43.620
[Amit Varma]: that I did the elite English speaking bubble is that by and large, we are tolerant, by

02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:47.980
[Amit Varma]: and large, we are liberal, by and large, we are secular. Right. And today, I'm beginning

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:53.660
[Amit Varma]: to feel that no, I was just mistaken all along. This is a delusion, right? By and large, we

02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:59.100
[Amit Varma]: were a bigoted, hateful society all along. And place where we are today, we were bound

02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:04.900
[Amit Varma]: to come here at some point or the other. So I feel that I might, of course, be veering

02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:10.700
[Amit Varma]: too much towards the pessimistic because that's just how I am. But what is what is your sense

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:20.420
[Guest]: of this? You know, how do you process all of this?

02:31:20.420 --> 02:31:27.580
[Guest]: I'm kind of looking forward to answering your question, because I process this all the time.

02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:38.140
[Guest]: You know, I just kind of by choosing to marry, even more than that, by having children in

02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:45.100
[Guest]: an interfaith marriage, children with, you know, growing up in these times, it's, it

02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:51.380
[Guest]: becomes literally a question that you have to process every day, including the question

02:31:51.380 --> 02:32:00.060
[Guest]: of are we delusional about the fact that we are safe? You know, we don't live in a Muslim

02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:11.700
[Guest]: majority area, we are the only interfaith marriage in a predominantly BJP voting locality.

02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:19.460
[Guest]: And when push comes to shove, what happened to Ehsan Jafri can happen in my street to

02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:28.080
[Guest]: my home. And we've seen, we've seen, you know, we've seen enough of this playing out in front

02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:35.660
[Guest]: of our lives starting from 47. Neighbors, you know, were the most viciously violent

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:42.420
[Guest]: towards each other in that time as well. And neighbors were the ones who were the ones who reached out

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:54.100
[Guest]: to save each other as well. I feel and I do actually get a lot, I am influenced a lot

02:32:54.100 --> 02:33:02.900
[Guest]: by what my husband shares. Because far more than me, I mean, I have not really experienced

02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:14.520
[Guest]: anything in comparison to his lived experience throughout his life. I feel that we're just

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:23.540
[Guest]: on a spectrum. We have the capability to be very bigoted. We also, at the same time can

02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:30.220
[Guest]: be extremely compassionate and hospitable towards the same people that we can exclude

02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:38.580
[Guest]: with our bigotry. We also have the capacity for extreme violence. Our best friends can

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:45.580
[Guest]: be the people who will point out our home to the mob when the moment comes. They can

02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:52.060
[Guest]: be the people whose home will be my refuge if the mob comes. I don't know which way it

02:33:52.060 --> 02:33:58.220
[Guest]: will go because from just reading the stories of what my mother's generation has lived through

02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:08.060
[Guest]: and what 2002 Gujarat has lived through, it can go either ways. And therefore, I don't

02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:19.820
[Guest]: feel defeated or pessimistic. I feel that we have the capacity to influence how the

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:30.740
[Guest]: other person reacts. I mean, I was in Delhi in 1984 when the riots broke out. And I lived

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:37.540
[Guest]: in a third floor flat from my terrace. We saw the fires being lit. We saw the mobs.

02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:43.180
[Guest]: It literally, I have witnessed those riots. So I know that in that moment, there is not

02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:50.340
[Guest]: very much that one can do. But I know that many of the people who participate in riots

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:54.700
[Guest]: are people who have done good things before that and people who go on to do good things

02:34:54.700 --> 02:35:02.380
[Guest]: after that. And we really are a very strange kind of species that just has the capacity

02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:13.980
[Guest]: for both within us. I mean, the RSS, even the Muslim right-wing organizations, student

02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:22.540
[Guest]: organizations, these are groups and communities that have also been in the forefront of rehabilitation

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:28.140
[Guest]: efforts, when there have been earthquakes, when there are floods, when there is a disaster

02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:33.700
[Guest]: like an air crash. And, you know, we have known to rely on them. They have been very

02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:42.820
[Guest]: important in terms of civil society groups as well. So, we certainly look like we are

02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:51.660
[Guest]: on a very fast kind of decline towards chaos and violence as a society. There are enough

02:35:51.660 --> 02:36:01.780
[Guest]: warning bells and we need to heed them. But what is it that one does when one sees a fire,

02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:08.660
[Guest]: you know, igniting or when you see a small fire that could become... There is a long

02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:14.100
[Guest]: time when you do have the power and the ability and the influence to be able to do something

02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:21.620
[Guest]: about it. And I think that people like you and me are, you know, we have the privilege

02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:29.700
[Guest]: in every which way to be able to influence our times in some way, to be able to influence

02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:38.380
[Guest]: the same people who are likely to engage in very bigoted or very violent behavior. And

02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:47.500
[Guest]: we, I mean, this is really a time when all of our energy should be in a sense ignited.

02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:53.180
[Guest]: And that story that I wrote about him not getting a room in Amritsar because he's a

02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:59.060
[Guest]: Muslim and then his insistence on having a cup of tea with that couple. I sat on it for

02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:11.620
[Guest]: a year and a half before I wrote it. It took me time to process what it was. And it took

02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:20.260
[Guest]: me time to get over my own feeling of protectiveness towards him. I was also more offended because

02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:25.860
[Guest]: she's a Punjabi and so am I. She's from Amritsar. I mean, Amritsar is my mother's city. Talk

02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:32.860
[Guest]: to me. I mean, how dare you, you know, do this to me. Some of it is kind of almost personal

02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:42.900
[Guest]: in that sense. But I didn't have an idea of what it would mean to write that story. It

02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:49.900
[Guest]: just stayed with me, lingered in my head that this is a moment that says something to us

02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:56.900
[Guest]: about us. And a lot of people ask me what happened. You know, I didn't write about what

02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:03.340
[Guest]: happened. He did have tea. He went over. He called them. He said, I will come over for

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:16.620
[Guest]: tea. He went there. They were just elderly and vulnerable and confused. And in that moment,

02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:22.620
[Guest]: he didn't hold a grudge against them. They were uncomfortable, but he could no longer

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:29.900
[Guest]: hold a grudge because they were also, you know, old. And they didn't have the support

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:37.180
[Guest]: of a society or an administration if, you know, if they did something that put them

02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:47.900
[Guest]: out of their comfort zone. So, yeah, I couldn't write it because it just made me very sad.

02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:53.500
[Amit Varma]: I love this quote where you quote your middle daughter, Aliza, and she says, quote, I'm

02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:59.380
[Amit Varma]: a Muslim, a Hindu, an Indian, and I love Harry Potter, stop quote, which is such a perfect

02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:05.780
[Amit Varma]: sort of illustration of the multitudes we contain and carry within us. But equally,

02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:09.020
[Amit Varma]: the counterpoint to that was a story you told of how you went with your daughters to this

02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:13.460
[Amit Varma]: hairstylist. And the hairstylist asked them that, what are you? You know, you're Muslim,

02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:17.620
[Amit Varma]: right? And one of your daughters said, no, no, I'm a Muslim and a Hindu. And the hairstylist

02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:22.140
[Amit Varma]: was no, no, you have to be one or the other. You can't be both. Right, which is, which

02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:25.900
[Amit Varma]: is tragic. And I'd say that perhaps in this country, we are getting to a point where the

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:30.860
[Amit Varma]: majority point of view is probably the hairstylist point of view. But leaving that aside and

02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:36.940
[Amit Varma]: going back in time, again, we've spoken about a couple of your grandparents, let's speak

02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:42.460
[Amit Varma]: about your mom, because there are two very interesting places where you mentioned her

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:47.840
[Amit Varma]: and you and you write about her. And one of them is where, you know, your daughters are

02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:54.620
[Amit Varma]: sitting at the table with you. And they are sort of discussing, I think, what they'll

02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:58.460
[Amit Varma]: be like, 20 years later, or something like that. And all the daughters say, oh, we will

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:02.620
[Amit Varma]: be the same. And then one of them says, but mommy will be like Nani. And then they all

02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:06.300
[Amit Varma]: look at you. And you can tell that they're looking at you and thinking that she's not

02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:11.460
[Amit Varma]: like Nani. She's completely different. Right? And you go on to elaborate on why. And in

02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:17.020
[Amit Varma]: another place, you write, quote, the first time I saw my mother when I looked into a

02:40:17.020 --> 02:40:21.860
[Amit Varma]: mirror, it startled me. I was getting ready for my wedding. My friend Reena had tied up

02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:25.940
[Amit Varma]: my hair and done my makeup. Oh my god, it was my mother looking back at me, my mother

02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:32.100
[Amit Varma]: from a wedding album. How was it even possible? We weren't supposed to be alike, stop quote.

02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:36.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me a bit about this, because I see this conflict. I see how, when we are

02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:42.820
[Amit Varma]: growing up, we might sometimes resent our parents not want to be like them, and so on

02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:48.180
[Amit Varma]: and so forth. But as we grow older, we understand them so much better. And as we grow older,

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:53.260
[Amit Varma]: it's possible for us to turn into them. I think that for many people is a great fear.

02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:57.940
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I think Ramanujan has a great poem about how he looks into the mirror and sees

02:40:57.940 --> 02:41:03.820
[Amit Varma]: his father staring back at him, right? So tell me a little bit about your relationship

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:07.860
[Amit Varma]: with your mother. Like, did you talk? When did you start talking? What was the nature

02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:14.180
[Amit Varma]: of the conversations? Like, at one point after your book was out, you mentioned how she read

02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:19.180
[Amit Varma]: the book and she told you, I never knew you could think so much, right? Which sort of

02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:25.060
[Amit Varma]: indicates that earlier in your relationship, you were both on grooves, where she's a mother

02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:29.220
[Amit Varma]: and you're a kid, and you're the kid, and she's a mother, and you're both on that groove.

02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:33.620
[Amit Varma]: And it takes something for you to look at each other as people again, perhaps with you,

02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:37.860
[Amit Varma]: it was that incident when you were 12. And you see your parents vulnerable and broken.

02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:43.780
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you see that. But tell me a little bit about how this evolved, how you

02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:53.260
[Guest]: started relating to each other in interesting ways. So yeah, like I shared earlier, because

02:41:53.260 --> 02:42:02.980
[Guest]: my mother didn't work, because my grandfather, he had a charming, attractive personality.

02:42:02.980 --> 02:42:10.700
[Guest]: My father doted on me, you know, as a young child. And both of them had this feature where

02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:17.300
[Guest]: they were not able to love the boys. They were not able to be affectionate to the boys,

02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:24.060
[Guest]: but they could be soft. And so, Papa only has one daughter, and my grandfather only

02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:32.460
[Guest]: had one granddaughter. And I got, I got, you know, I got access to the softer side of them.

02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:39.220
[Guest]: My father did better, but my grandfather was never able to be soft with his wife. He was

02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:46.580
[Guest]: always, he always had to be authoritarian, and he always had to be. But in that kind

02:42:46.580 --> 02:42:55.900
[Guest]: of dynamic family dynamic, I saw my mother as a worker. You know, as somebody who was

02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:05.500
[Guest]: always doing things, she rarely had time to be with the children. And when she did, I

02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:11.100
[Guest]: now understand that she needed to spend a lot of, she spent more time with my elder

02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:17.300
[Guest]: brother, because he was more vulnerable than us, because he got the brunt of my father's

02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:26.420
[Guest]: anger, and she was protecting him. But I resented that as a child, I felt neglected by her.

02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:33.380
[Guest]: And because I wanted to be part of larger society, I, you know, I wanted to be seen

02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:41.140
[Guest]: as a person, not just as a mother, wife, housemaker. And my mother never articulated any of these

02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:52.580
[Guest]: things to me. I did kind of distance myself from her psychologically, over time. She wouldn't

02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:59.740
[Guest]: take care of herself. She was always wonderfully turned out in social occasions, but at home,

02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:07.660
[Guest]: she didn't have the resources for self care. And, and, you know, as this smart school going

02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:18.540
[Guest]: kid, I didn't identify with her in that sense. I could say just in simply in one sentence

02:44:18.540 --> 02:44:25.140
[Guest]: that my mother always toned herself down. She would diminish herself to save herself

02:44:25.140 --> 02:44:32.260
[Guest]: from being demeaned by somebody else. And I didn't, I, because she didn't share it with

02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:38.260
[Guest]: me, she didn't articulate it with me, I didn't have any tools to see that till I was really

02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:48.900
[Guest]: grown up. And at a distance from her. I did have many years of, you know, estrangement,

02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:55.460
[Guest]: but also tremendous guilt, tremendous guilt that I could not be the daughter she wanted

02:44:55.460 --> 02:45:03.580
[Guest]: me to be. Because I had other dreams and aspirations, I had to go out. I just couldn't be the woman

02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:11.220
[Guest]: that she could show off at a wedding as the newly eligible, you know, for marriage person,

02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:18.500
[Guest]: I was not going to play that role. Of course, you can, you know, when you look back, everything

02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:24.980
[Guest]: you are is because your parents didn't stop you from becoming that. And you have to give

02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:30.620
[Guest]: them credit for that. We know, we know that parents have the power to do that. And we

02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:35.060
[Guest]: see that in other people's families. When we look at someone and we say, why does she

02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:41.900
[Guest]: not break free, you realize how strong those chains are. Clearly, they were not anybody

02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:47.700
[Guest]: holding me back, even if they were not saying, Jah Simran Jah, the fact that Simran was going

02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:53.380
[Guest]: and coming, according to her own wish, meant that, you know, that there was a permission

02:45:53.380 --> 02:46:03.980
[Guest]: to do that. This moment when I looked in the mirror and saw my mother, because I'm done

02:46:03.980 --> 02:46:09.580
[Guest]: up in the same way that she is, I've never been dressed up like this before. I've never

02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:14.700
[Guest]: worn jewelry before. My hair has never been parted in this way. I've never got a dupatta

02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:22.220
[Guest]: with gold on my head before. And then suddenly, that moment that, God, you are her daughter.

02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:30.380
[Guest]: And also, it is only subsequently that I seriously begin to set up home. I find that I need some

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:39.580
[Guest]: skills to be able to, you know, manage people who work in my home, to be able to manage

02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:47.180
[Guest]: time and resources so that when people turn up, the kitchen is able to serve them. But

02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:54.420
[Guest]: more than anything, it's when my third child is born. I actually went home to my mother.

02:46:54.420 --> 02:47:02.260
[Guest]: I opened her jewelry kit. I took out the two rings that she had worn all her life, that

02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:07.620
[Guest]: I kind of, that was the image of my mother's hand for us. We could recognize my mother's

02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:12.740
[Guest]: hand because she was wearing these two rings throughout our childhood. I took them out

02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:21.180
[Guest]: and I wore them. And I looked at them because now I needed the strength that this woman

02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:29.200
[Guest]: had that I had never recognized. What does it take to raise three independent children

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.940
[Guest]: in the kind of circumstances in which she is, you know, through the best years of her

02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:43.980
[Guest]: life, diminishing herself for fear of offending other people, or just being forever correct,

02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:51.140
[Guest]: forever obedient, forever available to other people so that everything is smooth and her

02:47:51.140 --> 02:48:00.020
[Guest]: children are safe. So it really did take my own journey as an adult, as a parent, as a

02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:06.540
[Guest]: person who finally began to build a home independently, to see that I needed all of my mother's strength

02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:13.140
[Guest]: and all of her skills to be able to do even what she had done, leave alone to do it better

02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:17.300
[Guest]: than her, as I had always imagined myself.

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:25.700
[Amit Varma]: So this diminishment of herself, was it like a conscious strategy in the sense that this

02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:31.220
[Amit Varma]: is the best way for me to get by in these times in these circumstances? Or is it something

02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:36.920
[Amit Varma]: that women happened, allowed to happen to themselves without even thinking about it.

02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.260
[Amit Varma]: So you might never think that, oh, my God, I want to do something else. I wish my life

02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:48.080
[Amit Varma]: was different. And this is so oppressive. Or do you simply get into your groove and

02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.460
[Amit Varma]: you play your role. And maybe somewhere there's an unexpressed sadness, and you don't know

02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:57.140
[Amit Varma]: why it's there and you don't think about it and you hide it from yourself. You know, give

02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:03.540
[Amit Varma]: me a sense of your mother's interior life, in the sense that you would, I'm guessing

02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:10.080
[Amit Varma]: never have sensed it at the time. But subsequently, you could have gotten a sense of it just by

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:14.420
[Amit Varma]: sort of following in her tracks, but in a different time, like when it comes to having

02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:20.700
[Amit Varma]: three kids, like did your conversations change, especially after that phase where she says,

02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:24.180
[Amit Varma]: I never knew you could think so much. And then you're both mothers. And I guess you're

02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:28.700
[Amit Varma]: both talking to each other. How did it change? Did the conversations change? What glimpses

02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:32.900
[Guest]: did you get of her through that?

02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:37.580
[Guest]: It's a very interesting question. Do women do this consciously? Or do they just kind

02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:44.860
[Guest]: of, you know, do they think I have to do this to survive? Or do they just kind of do it?

02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:51.700
[Guest]: It's definitely both. You know, one of my, I have a very young friend, she's probably

02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:58.660
[Guest]: just touching 30, newly married. And the other day, in a conversation, I mean, even before

02:49:58.660 --> 02:50:04.260
[Guest]: a conversation could start, she broke down a little bit. And she said, no one asked me

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:12.340
[Guest]: to become small, but I did it myself. She said, no one asked me to serve him. No one

02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:20.300
[Guest]: asked me to put him first. I'm just doing it myself. And because she's truly a 21st

02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:28.980
[Guest]: century girl, she has the self awareness. She, you know, she's two generations ahead

02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:38.180
[Guest]: of me. And yet she is. So she's in a space where she's trying to figure out how much

02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:48.020
[Guest]: of it is her choice, because to reject, you know, a corporate job or a nine to five, is

02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:57.860
[Guest]: also in many ways, a choice of self care. But when you reject that, and what is the

02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:04.820
[Guest]: groove that you choose? And what is the groove that without choosing you kind of fall into?

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:13.700
[Guest]: And then what do you do? How do you stay in it and not stay in it? Because we are also

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:20.020
[Guest]: at the same time, in love, building a home, building a family, imagining what it will

02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:28.860
[Guest]: take to sustain our love relationships for life as we would like them to be. And yet,

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:36.020
[Guest]: you don't want, you know, all the unspoken hierarchies of patriarchy to land on your

02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:43.300
[Guest]: shoulder and, and force you into something that you didn't want to choose. So how come

02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:50.540
[Guest]: you're playing that role? So to some extent, it's a little, it's a combination of all these

02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:58.940
[Guest]: things, you do internalize a lot of pressure, you do also want the rewards of the happy

02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:04.460
[Guest]: married life, or the, you know, the couple who look like they're with it, you don't want

02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:09.980
[Guest]: to be in conflict with each other all the time. And a lot of these reasons play into

02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:17.940
[Guest]: some of the choices you make. What I find very liberating about having my mother, Sudha

02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:24.820
[Guest]: as my mother, is that once we came into our teen years, and then later, you know, when

02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:33.140
[Guest]: we were all in our 20s, and all independent as young adults, we began to see our mother

02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:43.500
[Guest]: spend more and more time outside the company of children and, and, and her husband, and,

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:50.180
[Guest]: you know, not so, she had far more time because she didn't have to make tiffins for us or

02:52:50.180 --> 02:52:57.660
[Guest]: iron our clothes or, you know, organize anything for us. And then we see the side of her as

02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:03.060
[Guest]: a friend, we see the side of her who spends more time with her siblings, we see the side

02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:09.340
[Guest]: of her who is supporting other people in the community that she lives in. And then I look

02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:16.940
[Guest]: at my mother and I say, how come I never met this woman before? Because she's a great friend.

02:53:16.940 --> 02:53:22.620
[Guest]: She's a very resourceful person. She laughs really loudly. She's a great conversationalist,

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:27.940
[Guest]: but none of that is something that I have witnessed within the family. And then you

02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:34.180
[Guest]: realize that, you know, she never really taught, you know, she didn't really allow it to sit

02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:41.460
[Guest]: on her. And Amit, because we're spending time on this, I'll just share this with you. One

02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:47.660
[Guest]: of the big conflicts I had growing up is my father, my father, you know, he's an he's

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:57.500
[Guest]: he's your regular Indian male and father. So he, there are episodes of rage, he expresses

02:53:57.500 --> 02:54:04.740
[Guest]: anger very easily. He's the only one who has the permission to express anger in the family.

02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:10.140
[Guest]: And Papa would, whether it was about marks or about being late for something or just

02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:17.460
[Guest]: not being absolutely perfect in front of guests, Papa would lose his temper every now and then.

02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:26.060
[Guest]: And as a as a as a teenager growing up, I would both be confrontational as well as be

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:33.820
[Guest]: deeply hurt. By this, I would internalize it, I would, you know, moan for days, not

02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:40.500
[Guest]: speak to anyone, not come to the dinner table, I would act out as the daughter, you know,

02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:46.740
[Guest]: a non submissive daughter of an angry father. And one of the things my mother used to say

02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:54.540
[Guest]: to me a lot was, why do you take him seriously? Why do you let his words get to you? He doesn't

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:59.660
[Guest]: mean it. Don't you get it? He doesn't mean it. And I'd be like, what do you mean? He's

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:07.780
[Guest]: my father. He's my father. How can I not take him seriously? How? And it has taken me two

02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:15.700
[Guest]: decades to finally understand what she meant. And I wish I could convince my children of

02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:21.540
[Guest]: the same thing. But I know that they will also learn in their own time. But I get it

02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:29.300
[Guest]: now. I get it that if somebody is in a rage, you separate yourself from his expression,

02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:35.780
[Guest]: you do not at that moment, stick yourself into what you think is your primary relationship

02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:44.740
[Guest]: with this person. You can change the situation by walking away. All she was able to say to

02:55:44.740 --> 02:55:51.060
[Guest]: me was, don't let it get to you. And I'd be like, maybe you can cope, but I'm too

02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:58.340
[Guest]: sensitive. I can't. And I would just kind of, you know, stand in it and frustrate her

02:55:58.340 --> 02:56:06.380
[Guest]: by stewing in the juices of my anger and my grief. But now I understand what a fantastic

02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:11.580
[Guest]: coping mechanism, what a, you know, psychologist would probably have a nice fancy name for

02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:19.060
[Guest]: it, a nice technique of, you know, separate yourself. You can't change his reaction, but

02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:21.940
[Guest]: you can change your own reaction. It would be, you know, one of the things the Buddha

02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:29.100
[Guest]: said or something, which is something that she was trying to tell me. And of course,

02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:35.980
[Guest]: you learn when you learn. But now I understand that the reason she's such a fabulous old

02:56:35.980 --> 02:56:43.260
[Guest]: woman with more energy than I have ever had in my life, that she's able to be available

02:56:43.260 --> 02:56:49.580
[Guest]: to each of her grandchildren, she is able to be available to her daughter-in-laws, to

02:56:49.580 --> 02:57:00.300
[Guest]: her daughter, to her friends and siblings, is because she was able to protect her core.

02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:06.740
[Guest]: And she had somehow the inherited wisdom, perhaps, or her own innate wisdom to bide

02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:15.060
[Amit Varma]: her time. You know, and there's something to learn from it. Yeah, I mean, I can imagine

02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:19.300
[Amit Varma]: young people today saying bide my time, I won't bide my time. But what choice did you

02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:24.460
[Amit Varma]: have back then, right? You have to, you're kind of imprisoned where you are, and you

02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:30.220
[Guest]: just kind of make the best of it. And, and, you know, in many other, in many other kind

02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:35.900
[Guest]: of contexts, we would see it as good strategy. You know, in a corporate context, we would

02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:42.020
[Guest]: understand it, in a two party system, we would get it. You know, you don't have the tools

02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:47.340
[Guest]: or the resources right now, if you attack, you will be destroyed. So you do bide your

02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:53.220
[Guest]: time. And that's a smart thing to do. You know, there will be a time when this when

02:57:53.220 --> 02:58:00.500
[Guest]: your adversary will be diminished by age by, you know, other loss of resources. And you

02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:07.540
[Guest]: must save yourself for that time. It's probably what nature also does. And, and, you know,

02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:11.500
[Guest]: it's not a weakness, it's, it's actually a strength.

02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:18.100
[Amit Varma]: And does another kind of strength come from the solidarity of women, that, you know, the

02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:22.660
[Amit Varma]: sisterhood of women, as it were, that you can speak to other women, and you even if

02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:28.180
[Amit Varma]: you don't talk about these things, overtly, there is that shared experience, and therefore,

02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:32.460
[Amit Varma]: this innate understanding of what you're going through. And you can stand by each other,

02:58:32.460 --> 02:58:36.460
[Amit Varma]: like I recently did an episode with Farah Bashir, I don't know if it'll release after

02:58:36.460 --> 02:58:41.460
[Amit Varma]: this or before this. But she spoke about her experience of growing up in Kashmir. And in

02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:45.260
[Amit Varma]: what was essentially when she was a kid, what was essentially a conflict zone, there was

02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:52.180
[Amit Varma]: constant curfew, there were bunkers outside houses, it was a mess. But what we kind of

02:58:52.180 --> 02:59:00.900
[Amit Varma]: speculated on was that there is a great scope for a very strong female solidarity between

02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:05.840
[Amit Varma]: different women, because all of you get each other. But a similar thing is not possible

02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:11.380
[Amit Varma]: for men, because men are never opening themselves up to other men in that way. You are never

02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:17.060
[Amit Varma]: expressing your vulnerability, you are never expressing how emasculated you might feel

02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:21.620
[Amit Varma]: where in a conflict zone, you know that you can't protect anyone, really, you are as much

02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:28.380
[Amit Varma]: victim as anyone else, and all of those things. And I guess that this sort of solidarity,

02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:34.100
[Amit Varma]: the sort of sisterhood, and the role of female friendships would be even more important in

02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:38.820
[Amit Varma]: your mother's time, of course, and perhaps can cut through generations, because you and

02:59:38.820 --> 02:59:45.380
[Amit Varma]: her can be friends now. But would also be important for you in your own life, that there

02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:50.620
[Amit Varma]: are people who just get you. And there are also male people who will never get you, right?

02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:54.980
[Amit Varma]: And you have to kind of work your way around that. So what are your thoughts on this?

02:59:54.980 --> 03:00:02.660
[Guest]: Yeah, definitely. There are female solidarities. And you know, even a lot of those know how

03:00:02.660 --> 03:00:13.860
[Guest]: to stay invisible. Because if they become visible, patriarchy will intervene. And you

03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:18.340
[Guest]: know, you'll be told, I don't like that friend of yours, she talks too loudly. Why do you

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:29.300
[Guest]: have to spend so much time with so and so? You know, what's it? Just casual, negative

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:40.540
[Guest]: comments like that. And all through my mother's years in Bhilai, in Ranchi, in Calcutta, in

03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:50.460
[Guest]: Delhi, through our various homes, there are two kinds of relationships that I have seen

03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:58.540
[Guest]: her create constantly, both of which mildly irritate my father, and both of which I have

03:00:58.540 --> 03:01:09.540
[Guest]: judged as well. One of them is always the friendship with the women in the neighborhood.

03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:17.200
[Guest]: And it takes her no time. And clearly, it takes the other women no time to very quickly

03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:21.980
[Guest]: exchange notes, see where the other person is, you know, where are your children? Where

03:01:21.980 --> 03:01:28.140
[Guest]: is your husband? How are the in-laws? How far are your parents and siblings? I guess,

03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:34.900
[Guest]: but I mean, like I said, she's a natural liberal. Her closest friends were South Indian women

03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:40.460
[Guest]: who didn't, in Ranchi, who didn't speak Hindi so well, but, you know, they were supporting

03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:47.500
[Guest]: each other with their little children and their kitchens to manage in this kind of amazing

03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:55.660
[Guest]: way that they continue to be in touch. She's had friends from across communities in India,

03:01:55.660 --> 03:02:02.460
[Guest]: wherever we have lived, she has instantly made friends. The other is with working class

03:02:02.460 --> 03:02:11.420
[Guest]: people. So the Sabziwala, the Andawala, the domestic worker, my mother has a natural affinity.

03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:17.820
[Guest]: I mean, it always surprises us, because of course, we are snobs. And, you know, we've

03:02:17.820 --> 03:02:24.780
[Guest]: been silly and self absorbed in our growing up years. But very quickly, she knows which

03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:31.180
[Guest]: village this person is from, you know, whether the family is here or there, how is he supporting

03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:36.900
[Guest]: him? What are the other jobs he or she is doing? So when the Sabziwala needs a loan,

03:02:36.900 --> 03:02:42.420
[Guest]: when my father's old scooter needs to be sold off, when the garage needs to be given off

03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:49.260
[Guest]: to a tailor who has no other means, when the maid's daughter needs an abortion, when somebody

03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:55.700
[Guest]: else is facing domestic violence, has a small child, needs an Aadhaar card, my mother is

03:02:55.700 --> 03:03:05.260
[Guest]: the hub. She's a little, you know, civil society office, where her doors are always open, her

03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:13.580
[Guest]: heart is always open and her whatever resources she has even monetarily, she will open to

03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:17.540
[Guest]: them. And sometimes she'll tell me in a low voice, your father doesn't even know how many

03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:24.260
[Guest]: loans I've given that will never come back. But that's my that's how I, you know, I manage.

03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:34.860
[Guest]: He will not approve, but she's managing out of the household. And that, then when I see

03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:45.340
[Guest]: the trajectory of my career and my choices and my repeated kind of interaction with NGOs

03:03:45.340 --> 03:03:52.620
[Guest]: or with, you know, civil society groups or with activist groups, then I realize whose

03:03:52.620 --> 03:04:01.460
[Guest]: daughter I am, you know, it kind of that that connection gets made, that it is, it is, we

03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:07.060
[Guest]: may not have seen it with our open eyes. But this is what we have witnessed through the

03:04:07.060 --> 03:04:13.220
[Guest]: years, that whatever, you know, whoever is interacting with the family is getting some

03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:20.700
[Guest]: kind of support from her, and therefore a kind of natural affinity for the week, despite

03:04:20.700 --> 03:04:30.300
[Guest]: whatever her own limitations might be. I don't know what it is about my mother that makes

03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:35.220
[Guest]: her such a heroine with my children. But it does surprise me. I don't know what they know

03:04:35.220 --> 03:04:41.420
[Guest]: about her. I don't know what they innately feel from her about her. I mean, they know

03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:47.940
[Guest]: her as a much older person, then then we have known her. And we feel like she doesn't make

03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:52.780
[Guest]: gulab jamun anymore. She doesn't bake anymore. She doesn't make butter chicken anymore. So

03:04:52.780 --> 03:05:00.220
[Guest]: my children have missed some of the best years of the great mother, the great mother. And

03:05:00.220 --> 03:05:10.780
[Guest]: yet they are so, you know, for them, she is the perfect, the perfect person, in a sense.

03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:18.580
[Guest]: And so was, so was their dadi, who was also kind of running this family empire in her

03:05:18.580 --> 03:05:24.100
[Guest]: quiet way, sitting in one place, and just making sure that all the children are fed

03:05:24.100 --> 03:05:33.100
[Guest]: and everybody's safe. And unlike their parents never having a meltdown. So I suppose, hopefully

03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:41.820
[Amit Varma]: we'll get there too. Maybe, maybe parents are just a means for grandparents to finally

03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:46.540
[Amit Varma]: enjoy children. In the sense, I guess, you know, when you're a parent, there's just too

03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:50.820
[Amit Varma]: much pressure, there's so much going on, you know, you are going to have meltdowns, you've

03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:55.060
[Amit Varma]: got a million thoughts in your head. But when you're a grandparent, you are like chill,

03:05:55.060 --> 03:05:59.340
[Amit Varma]: you know, so no wonder the grandkids would like you and for the grandkids also, you know,

03:05:59.340 --> 03:06:04.140
[Amit Varma]: you are the sort of cool elder figure, but someone who won't bark orders at them or tell

03:06:04.140 --> 03:06:06.500
[Guest]: them to go clean your room and all of that.

03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:14.500
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. And that kind of, you know, kind of loving nurturance, consistently loving

03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:23.300
[Guest]: nurturance. I guess parents are destined not to be able to do it. And what this reminds

03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:31.100
[Guest]: me of, of something that I used to feel a lot about raising our third child, I would

03:06:31.100 --> 03:06:40.540
[Guest]: often feel when she was very little that with her, I'm like a grandparent. I have given

03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:45.860
[Guest]: up my delusion of control. I am no longer trying to shape her into this perfect little

03:06:45.860 --> 03:06:51.180
[Guest]: human being. She and I can just lie on the floor, make jigsaw puzzles, walk through the

03:06:51.180 --> 03:06:59.980
[Guest]: park, feed the dogs. We really are much more chill because, you know, I've been there done

03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:02.860
[Guest]: that with the older kids.

03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:08.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so your first two kids were really practice, you really got there with the third kid.

03:07:08.740 --> 03:07:09.740
[Guest]: Hopefully.

03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:14.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So I, you know, I'll come back to your career and everything that we're doing. And

03:07:14.380 --> 03:07:18.860
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to, you know, stick too much with your family or birth as it were. But

03:07:18.860 --> 03:07:24.020
[Amit Varma]: I was intrigued by a couple of things that you wrote about your brothers, Bhai and Manu,

03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:28.020
[Amit Varma]: as you call them. And one of them is really interesting. And I want you to elaborate on

03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:33.020
[Amit Varma]: it where you say, quote, Bhai who is older is a novel I might write one day. Manu, our

03:07:33.020 --> 03:07:37.980
[Amit Varma]: funny serious kid brother, is my collection of short stories, stop quote. What do you

03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:42.380
[Amit Varma]: mean? It's so fascinating to me, one person being like a novel, the other person being

03:07:42.380 --> 03:07:44.060
[Guest]: like short stories.

03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:54.620
[Guest]: With Manu, who's my younger brother, it's been a very easy relationship. We've, I mean,

03:07:54.620 --> 03:08:00.620
[Guest]: if we fought, it's, you know, just fighting like children, like, tu merko kitna mar sakta

03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:07.060
[Guest]: hai, dikha, then we are beating each other up or some such thing. But it's been, it's

03:08:07.060 --> 03:08:15.020
[Guest]: been, it's, yeah, I mean, he really is, he's, he's, he's the sister I never had. You know,

03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:23.900
[Guest]: we are, we are very close, and we are very supportive of each other in a very quiet way.

03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:28.820
[Guest]: And every time my executive functioning fails, I don't know what SIP to buy, I don't know

03:08:28.820 --> 03:08:36.140
[Guest]: what to do with this money in my savings account, or I need to fill a form or I need to send

03:08:36.140 --> 03:08:41.620
[Guest]: a proposal, I'll just land up in his office or send him an email, I'll just hand over

03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:46.420
[Guest]: my work, he'll do it. If I have to buy a new phone, I just have to tell him and it will

03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:58.980
[Guest]: appear. Bhai and I had a very conflicted relationship for for some time. We are now very close.

03:08:58.980 --> 03:09:07.820
[Guest]: And it was very difficult to tell the story. And that's why I imagined that when I do discover

03:09:07.820 --> 03:09:14.500
[Guest]: what the story is, it will be a novel, because it will span over time, it will have so many

03:09:14.500 --> 03:09:22.020
[Guest]: characters, it will have so many, you know, meandering arcs, there will be so many other

03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:28.600
[Guest]: things that will happen. For years, we lived lives that were, that did not interact with

03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:37.180
[Guest]: each other. We've had many of these long interludes, where we haven't been in touch, you know,

03:09:37.180 --> 03:09:46.420
[Guest]: you know, in an everyday way. And yet, when I wrote this, Bhai and I had not got back

03:09:46.420 --> 03:09:52.460
[Guest]: in touch in the way that we now have. For the last five or six years, he's been going

03:09:52.460 --> 03:10:03.260
[Guest]: through a very difficult divorce, a very, very painful custody battle. And finally,

03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:10.980
[Guest]: because of, you know, the only person he was talking to in this time is me. It's like a

03:10:10.980 --> 03:10:23.220
[Guest]: homecoming, in a sense. And I guess looking back, because of the home, in which we were

03:10:23.220 --> 03:10:32.180
[Guest]: growing up, where Dadaji could have a meltdown anytime, where Papa could go into a rage at

03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:43.340
[Guest]: any point. Bhai and I were fighting for the same resources. And we were both too deprived,

03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:50.940
[Guest]: in a sense, perhaps for the same things. And the same mother was stretched over us. I needed

03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:58.980
[Guest]: protection, he needed protection. I think she chose rightly by choosing him over me

03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:09.460
[Guest]: for a very long time, because I can't imagine him not having even that. But so we were,

03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:13.580
[Guest]: I mean, I used to call him my other brother. Everyone knew I had a brother. Everyone knew

03:11:13.580 --> 03:11:18.660
[Guest]: Mannu, all my friends would know Mannu. And then they'd say, there's another one. And

03:11:18.660 --> 03:11:27.020
[Guest]: I'd say, he's my other brother. And we literally had othered each other from our lives. But,

03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:37.900
[Guest]: you know, but the connection is very strong. And in one of his therapy sessions, he won't

03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:44.620
[Guest]: mind me sharing this, when he was trying to figure out, you know, how to cope with his

03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:51.820
[Guest]: divorce and with having very young children. His therapist is talking to him about his

03:11:51.820 --> 03:12:04.180
[Guest]: childhood. And it comes out that his sister's suicide attempt is the one big trauma that

03:12:04.180 --> 03:12:10.220
[Guest]: he's stuck with, that he has never spoken about, he has never processed, but he's holding

03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:19.380
[Guest]: on to the fear of what might have happened. And that makes him, you know, that kind of,

03:12:19.380 --> 03:12:24.980
[Guest]: so his therapist kind of takes him back to the most vulnerable moment in his life and

03:12:24.980 --> 03:12:31.540
[Guest]: begins to work from there, which makes him call me. And, and, you know, then we have

03:12:31.540 --> 03:12:36.940
[Guest]: conversations. I mean, there's been a couple of years in between where we have spoken every

03:12:36.940 --> 03:12:42.900
[Guest]: day for hours. And it's quite convenient, because it's the end of his day in San Francisco,

03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:48.020
[Guest]: and it's the beginning of mine. And we can just do, you know, before my day starts, we

03:12:48.020 --> 03:12:55.500
[Guest]: can spend time with each other. And because we've spoken so much about childhood and parents,

03:12:55.500 --> 03:13:02.580
[Guest]: he'll often say to me, did we grow up in the same house? Because while I have coped by

03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:10.540
[Guest]: holding on to every memory so that I can process it when I am more capable, he has coped by

03:13:10.540 --> 03:13:18.060
[Guest]: forgetting everything, or most of it. And sometimes I have to remind him, or he'll read,

03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:22.100
[Guest]: he'll read, you know, he'll call me after reading a column, and he'll say, did we have

03:13:22.100 --> 03:13:26.220
[Guest]: the same mother? If she said this to you, why didn't she say this to me? It would have

03:13:26.220 --> 03:13:35.380
[Guest]: been very useful if she had said this to me. And so it's in our, you know, late 40s, we

03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:44.380
[Guest]: have been able to reconnect. And therein, perhaps is a very complex story that would

03:13:44.380 --> 03:13:47.460
[Amit Varma]: become a novel.

03:13:47.460 --> 03:13:51.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And what you said about remembering things differently, you also have a quote

03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:55.900
[Amit Varma]: in your book where you write about your brothers, we are oral historians of each other's lives.

03:13:55.900 --> 03:14:01.380
[Amit Varma]: Right. And when I read that, I thought, okay, but they're different oral histories, because

03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:05.500
[Amit Varma]: that's just the nature of memory. Like one of the fascinating things I've learned about

03:14:05.500 --> 03:14:09.500
[Amit Varma]: memory is the way it works in the brain is that the first time we remember something,

03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:14.020
[Amit Varma]: we're remembering the event, the next time we are remembering the remembering of it.

03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:18.380
[Amit Varma]: So to remember something for a long time is really like a game of Chinese whispers. And

03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:22.500
[Amit Varma]: for two separate people, you can have the same starting point. And even that same starting

03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:26.620
[Amit Varma]: point, of course, you're looking at it from different vantage points. But then it just

03:14:26.620 --> 03:14:31.060
[Amit Varma]: becomes something different, which goes back to that earlier think of how we can never

03:14:31.060 --> 03:14:35.660
[Amit Varma]: truly know anyone else, because it's really what you feel is shared may not be shared

03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:43.100
[Amit Varma]: after all. But leaving that random thought aside, let's go back to your career, where,

03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:46.660
[Amit Varma]: you know, what was through all of this, we've spoken about all these relationships, all

03:14:46.660 --> 03:14:53.460
[Amit Varma]: of these people, what was your conception of yourself developing out to be? Like, even

03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:59.460
[Amit Varma]: if you had decided that you're going to avoid the trap your mother fell into, for example,

03:14:59.460 --> 03:15:04.300
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, not have to make those kind of compromises, what do you see yourself doing

03:15:04.300 --> 03:15:11.020
[Amit Varma]: in future? How much of what you went on to do was a natural, intentional pathway? And

03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:16.740
[Amit Varma]: how much was just one thing happened after another and you got there?

03:15:16.740 --> 03:15:26.100
[Guest]: Some things have been very intentional in the in the initial moment. You know, so, when

03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:36.740
[Guest]: I had completed my MA in Mass Communication, and this is 1995, the golden year of private

03:15:36.740 --> 03:15:43.100
[Guest]: news in this country. Aaj Tak and the News Tonight are these two shows that have just

03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:49.260
[Guest]: started on Doordarshan, half an hour show a day. And there are no trained video journalists

03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:56.180
[Guest]: in the country because we, outside of Doordarshan, there was no news coverage, video coverage

03:15:56.180 --> 03:16:04.460
[Guest]: of the news. So, it was golden in the sense that we had jobs before we even completed

03:16:04.460 --> 03:16:15.220
[Guest]: our MA. Half my class had jobs. Barkha Dutt is my classmate from Jamia. And she went and

03:16:15.220 --> 03:16:23.060
[Guest]: joined NDTV. She went on a shoot. This is Feb 95 or Jan 95. She went on a shoot. She

03:16:23.060 --> 03:16:29.700
[Guest]: worked with a camera person. She felt like she was not being taken seriously. She came

03:16:29.700 --> 03:16:34.940
[Guest]: running to my house in the evening and she said, we have to make your CV. She writes

03:16:34.940 --> 03:16:41.700
[Guest]: it out. We go to the market, we get it typed because this is pre-printer and pre-computer.

03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:49.460
[Guest]: We get it typed on a typewriter. The next day she gives it in at work so that she has

03:16:49.460 --> 03:16:54.340
[Guest]: some but she has a friend on the news floor. And then, you know, because we had worked

03:16:54.340 --> 03:17:03.700
[Guest]: together quite closely as students. So, I was a somewhat oppositional kind of young

03:17:03.700 --> 03:17:14.700
[Guest]: person at that time. I looked at everything that I was not supposed to do and asked the

03:17:14.700 --> 03:17:24.340
[Guest]: question why. And I wouldn't take a no for an answer unless it could be proven that the

03:17:24.340 --> 03:17:32.660
[Guest]: no is what I had to live with. So, I enjoyed my two and a half years of mass communication

03:17:32.660 --> 03:17:38.380
[Guest]: a lot. And I, you know, when I first worked with cameras, the still cameras, as well as

03:17:38.380 --> 03:17:44.980
[Guest]: the film cameras, I never saw myself as a person who was interested in technology. But

03:17:44.980 --> 03:17:52.260
[Guest]: this was the first technology that I just felt like it was a part of me. I just took

03:17:52.260 --> 03:18:00.060
[Guest]: to it and it worked for me. It would obey what I wanted to say. I used to feel like

03:18:00.060 --> 03:18:07.060
[Guest]: I couldn't learn to drive. I was not a great cyclist, but this thing worked for me. So,

03:18:07.060 --> 03:18:13.660
[Guest]: I said to myself, I want to be a camera person. And everybody said, well, of course, you can't

03:18:13.660 --> 03:18:17.820
[Guest]: be women. Don't become. Why don't you become an editor? Why don't you become a reporter?

03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:23.260
[Guest]: You write so well, you can do this. And I said, no, I want to be a camera person. And

03:18:23.260 --> 03:18:29.300
[Guest]: either somebody will hire me as that or I will not join this industry. And my first

03:18:29.300 --> 03:18:35.940
[Guest]: interview with a wildlife filmmaker was a disaster. And my second one was with Pranay

03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:41.180
[Guest]: and Radhika. And when they asked me if I could do it, I said, I don't know, I've never done

03:18:41.180 --> 03:18:47.100
[Guest]: it. And they said, well, would you like to start? And I said, yes. So, it was a very

03:18:47.100 --> 03:18:53.580
[Guest]: intentional choice to become a camera person, to choose to become a camera person. Then

03:18:53.580 --> 03:19:01.060
[Guest]: I had to honor my choice and whatever hard work and dedication and struggle and the acquisition

03:19:01.060 --> 03:19:09.020
[Guest]: of a thick skin it took to last in the field to work in a department of only men, in a

03:19:09.020 --> 03:19:17.220
[Guest]: department of all male camera assistants, all male equipment in charges, and a large

03:19:17.220 --> 03:19:22.940
[Guest]: number of male reporters, whatever it took. I mean, it was a good time. There was a lot

03:19:22.940 --> 03:19:28.780
[Guest]: of support within the organization. One thing happened after the other in the sense that

03:19:28.780 --> 03:19:38.980
[Guest]: I thought I would work for a couple of years and then find more meaningful work. But I

03:19:38.980 --> 03:19:46.060
[Guest]: did and I worked in NDTV for 13 years, because it just always continued for those 13 years

03:19:46.060 --> 03:19:52.740
[Guest]: to be meaningful. Whatever we demanded in terms of meaning we were able to get within

03:19:52.740 --> 03:19:58.300
[Guest]: the workplace. If we said, I don't want to cover politicians, I want to do feature stories,

03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:01.620
[Guest]: you could do it. If you said, I want travel, you could do it. If you said, I want to do

03:20:01.620 --> 03:20:10.900
[Guest]: longer documentary, you did it. I had children. I became an editor for some time. So, yeah,

03:20:10.900 --> 03:20:16.540
[Guest]: it worked. And eventually, because I had done a little bit of everything over the years,

03:20:16.540 --> 03:20:27.980
[Guest]: I became the head of training in the organization. And so, it was both intentional as well as,

03:20:27.980 --> 03:20:36.980
[Guest]: you know, good luck fate, a good time to be a good professional, in a sense.

03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:47.700
[Guest]: I would say my second career run has been of becoming a columnist and then kind of becoming

03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:56.980
[Guest]: an author with my books. I didn't imagine this happening. And this time, I didn't have

03:20:56.980 --> 03:21:04.060
[Guest]: a friend writing a CV for me and sending it off to a newspaper. So, I was quite diffident

03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:14.180
[Guest]: about making any move by myself. But the internet was a wonderful and generous place. If you

03:21:14.180 --> 03:21:20.620
[Guest]: wrote consistently on it, sooner or later, you built a network. And of course, I got

03:21:20.620 --> 03:21:29.180
[Guest]: read by Roger Ebert, you know, which was an amazing twist of fate. And then when he began

03:21:29.180 --> 03:21:35.420
[Guest]: to kind of amplify what I was writing, when he began to praise it, it caught the notice

03:21:35.420 --> 03:21:41.400
[Guest]: of journalists in India. And that's how I began to write columns in the Indian Express

03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:52.140
[Guest]: and then the Mint Lounge. After that, it became very intentional. In that sense, I didn't

03:21:52.140 --> 03:21:58.100
[Guest]: know how long I could write. I didn't know how long I would be allowed to write what

03:21:58.100 --> 03:22:05.780
[Guest]: I had chosen to write. But by that time, because I had been through three pregnancies, my third

03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:13.540
[Guest]: pregnancy was another instance of a near-death experience of nearly losing both me and the

03:22:13.540 --> 03:22:22.020
[Guest]: baby and surviving that. So, I had in a sense had, I often, jokingly, I call it my third

03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:29.780
[Guest]: eye opened and then I couldn't close it. It was like you could just see things that you

03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:35.160
[Guest]: didn't see earlier. And now you just, you couldn't do anything about it. You could see

03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:43.140
[Guest]: through people, you could see patterns, you could make connections and there was no going

03:22:43.140 --> 03:22:55.180
[Guest]: back from there. But with the lounge column, Amit, it kind of became like, you know, what

03:22:55.180 --> 03:23:01.300
[Guest]: you said about the podcast when we were chatting a little bit earlier. It became a labor of

03:23:01.300 --> 03:23:10.620
[Guest]: love. It became something where I set the standard. I set the challenge level. I allowed

03:23:10.620 --> 03:23:22.460
[Guest]: my inner voice to guide me towards what would come out next without getting into what will

03:23:22.460 --> 03:23:28.940
[Guest]: be viral, what will not be, what's more acceptable, what's likely to sell more, without any of

03:23:28.940 --> 03:23:36.500
[Guest]: those things. And I think that just like your experience, the reason it worked, the reason

03:23:36.500 --> 03:23:47.620
[Guest]: it became resonant was because it stayed authentic to myself. And perhaps that's all you need

03:23:47.620 --> 03:23:53.940
[Guest]: to do. But it takes a longish journey before you can come to that point where you can identify

03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:59.700
[Guest]: or give voice to the authentic within you, in a sense.

03:23:59.700 --> 03:24:04.980
[Amit Varma]: I think it took us long journeys to get to just having the courage to be authentic. And

03:24:04.980 --> 03:24:11.620
[Amit Varma]: then after that, realizing that it actually works. And I try to save my writing students

03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:18.180
[Amit Varma]: that journey by just telling them that, look, this is the one thing that you possess, that

03:24:18.180 --> 03:24:22.180
[Amit Varma]: like, if you think about what is the one thing you possess that the other 7 billion people

03:24:22.180 --> 03:24:26.220
[Amit Varma]: in the on the planet don't possess, it's you. That's what you have. That's the only thing

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:30.900
[Amit Varma]: that makes you stand out. And part of it is that if you're authentic to yourself, only

03:24:30.900 --> 03:24:36.900
[Amit Varma]: you can be you and it comes out. And the other part of it, the other aspect of it is that

03:24:36.900 --> 03:24:41.740
[Amit Varma]: we are all on more or less the same kind of journey in different ways at different parts.

03:24:41.740 --> 03:24:47.500
[Amit Varma]: To write about that with honesty makes everybody relate to you. You know, I can relate to so

03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:51.020
[Amit Varma]: many of your columns about parenthood, even though I'm not a parent and have no interest

03:24:51.020 --> 03:24:57.740
[Amit Varma]: in becoming one and I hate kids, but I can still relate to so much of it because it's

03:24:57.740 --> 03:25:03.380
[Amit Varma]: turning the gaze inwards. In fact, this is, you know, I was reading a bunch of Roger Ebert's

03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:09.900
[Amit Varma]: film reviews recently. And of all film reviewers, he is closest to my heart because he would

03:25:09.900 --> 03:25:15.420
[Amit Varma]: cut through, you know, all the superfluous stuff and he would get to the heart of a film.

03:25:15.420 --> 03:25:21.140
[Amit Varma]: And the heart of a good film always is how it reaches the heart of the human experience.

03:25:21.140 --> 03:25:26.900
[Amit Varma]: Right. So films that I love, I sometimes discovered them through Ebert and sometimes I'd go back

03:25:26.900 --> 03:25:32.780
[Amit Varma]: and read what Ebert has written about Decalogue or Goodbye Solo or a lot of other great films.

03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:36.900
[Amit Varma]: And it is so moving, you know, even without watching, even if you haven't seen the film

03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:41.140
[Amit Varma]: in question, it is so moving. And I can guess how that would have attracted him to your

03:25:41.140 --> 03:25:47.020
[Amit Varma]: writing to begin with, because it is that same unflinching gaze where you are clearly

03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:54.860
[Amit Varma]: at that moment, not second guessing the audience. How can I impress people? How can I, you know,

03:25:54.860 --> 03:26:00.180
[Amit Varma]: you're just putting yourself out there in that act of honesty. And I'll come back to

03:26:00.180 --> 03:26:05.220
[Amit Varma]: the craft of writing in the column a bit later towards the end of the episode. But to kind

03:26:05.220 --> 03:26:09.940
[Amit Varma]: of go back to the chronological arc and to get back to the subject of relationships.

03:26:09.940 --> 03:26:15.780
[Amit Varma]: Tell me also about how you met your husband, as it were, because it seemed, because it's

03:26:15.780 --> 03:26:21.580
[Amit Varma]: a very interesting sort of unconventional story, not just in the backgrounds being different

03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:26.780
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, but that for the longest time, you didn't really you didn't, you know,

03:26:26.780 --> 03:26:29.860
[Amit Varma]: decide that you were going to get married. You know, it's one of those things that kind

03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:36.700
[Amit Varma]: of happened. You sort of you speak about how you, you know, broke up many times and got

03:26:36.700 --> 03:26:41.740
[Amit Varma]: together again. And at one point, you wrote, quote, neither of us knew how to be married,

03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:48.140
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And this whole process of kind of understanding each other, discovering how

03:26:48.140 --> 03:26:52.300
[Amit Varma]: to be married, and then figuring out that within that, you're almost like strangers

03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:57.380
[Amit Varma]: and then discovering each other again, and negotiating and renegotiating all of those

03:26:57.380 --> 03:27:03.780
[Amit Varma]: is sort of a fascinating kind of process. And it comes before parenthood, which is,

03:27:03.780 --> 03:27:08.700
[Amit Varma]: of course, a great adventure of your life from what, you know, from what I can see from

03:27:08.700 --> 03:27:14.380
[Amit Varma]: the outside. But tell me a little bit about how you met him and you know, all of that.

03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:21.340
[Guest]: Yeah, so we ran into each other in a friend's home. No, in his home, to be honest. Two of

03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:29.700
[Guest]: my colleagues in NDTV and Avsel were housemates. So these three young men had a flat in Noida.

03:27:29.700 --> 03:27:33.100
[Guest]: And what happens when you're young people and you have a whole flat to yourself, you

03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:38.940
[Guest]: are hosting a party after party, get together after get together. It's the place where people

03:27:38.940 --> 03:27:45.620
[Guest]: hang out, because no one else, you know, in that age group, not many people have an independent

03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:53.300
[Guest]: home. And we're all always looking for places to hang out. At least in the late 90s, there

03:27:53.300 --> 03:28:00.980
[Guest]: were not that many coffee shops and other public places. And of course, a home is always

03:28:00.980 --> 03:28:07.660
[Guest]: a home. So it was a place, their flat was a place where there are a lot of NDTV parties

03:28:07.660 --> 03:28:12.380
[Guest]: would take place, you know, this whole group of friends and colleagues who worked on a

03:28:12.380 --> 03:28:17.220
[Guest]: morning show called Good Morning India, who were part of the camera department, who were

03:28:17.220 --> 03:28:23.660
[Guest]: part of the news department, we were all the same age group, we had a lot of energy that

03:28:23.660 --> 03:28:30.820
[Guest]: news television hadn't entirely taken out of us. So we would party there. And in one

03:28:30.820 --> 03:28:38.960
[Guest]: of those places, one of those events, I walked into his house, I knew there was a third person

03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:49.140
[Guest]: in that house. I had heard of someone called Mirza. I had in my imagination, I saw a certain

03:28:49.140 --> 03:29:04.900
[Guest]: kind of man. And I met him. And I write a lot of what I call marriage columns. And so

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:09.340
[Guest]: I, in my head, I call it a marriage column, because it kind of comes every three or four

03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:15.980
[Guest]: months. And I'm, in a sense, answering the same question, what's a girl like me doing

03:29:15.980 --> 03:29:23.620
[Guest]: with a guy like him? What, you know, considering that there were going to be so many social

03:29:23.620 --> 03:29:33.700
[Guest]: and familial barriers? What was it that made us and there are such stark differences. He

03:29:33.700 --> 03:29:40.620
[Guest]: speaks a different language, he comes from a different family background. What, you know,

03:29:40.620 --> 03:29:46.940
[Guest]: why did we kind of just stick around for so long? And I'm forever trying to answer that

03:29:46.940 --> 03:29:54.220
[Guest]: question. And recently, I kind of, one day I wrote in my notes app, said my ADHD was

03:29:54.220 --> 03:30:04.540
[Guest]: attracted to his ADHD. Because also post pandemic, a lot of us are, you know, getting more in

03:30:04.540 --> 03:30:12.460
[Guest]: touch with our anxieties and with our own neurodiversity, we're beginning to recognize

03:30:12.460 --> 03:30:19.140
[Guest]: it, find a language for it. I think that post lockdown pandemic COVID, a lot of it has become

03:30:19.140 --> 03:30:30.300
[Guest]: exaggerated enough for it to be more visible to us. And yeah, so that was my latest theory

03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:37.580
[Guest]: that it that you know, that it's our neurodiversity that kind of complemented each other. I have

03:30:37.580 --> 03:30:46.740
[Guest]: no idea what you mean by neurodiversity. It, it, it refers to being on the, on the, you

03:30:46.740 --> 03:30:54.420
[Guest]: know, that that all of us are on a spectrum. On the one side is being neurotypical, and

03:30:54.420 --> 03:31:04.660
[Guest]: on the other side is being neurodivergent, and the conditions of having attention deficit,

03:31:04.660 --> 03:31:10.500
[Guest]: you know, being attention deficit of being hyperactive, of having autism, of having social

03:31:10.500 --> 03:31:19.660
[Guest]: anxiety, all of these, in some combination or the other position, a position on the spectrum.

03:31:19.660 --> 03:31:27.940
[Guest]: And so, that is what makes some of us more sensitive than other people. That is it what

03:31:27.940 --> 03:31:34.820
[Guest]: makes some of us find it so hard to fit in. That's what makes some of us party for some

03:31:34.820 --> 03:31:43.660
[Guest]: of us become, you know, find it difficult to do simple things, when we can do complex

03:31:43.660 --> 03:31:52.460
[Guest]: things very easily. And, and some of those connections. Recently, I've been kind of making

03:31:52.460 --> 03:32:00.340
[Guest]: for myself for my children, and for him, and now he's reading a book on ADHD himself. And

03:32:00.340 --> 03:32:08.460
[Guest]: saying, Hmm, this is me. So, our energy levels, I suppose, in some ways, and also, I guess,

03:32:08.460 --> 03:32:14.140
[Guest]: if you put it in very simple terms, he was on the margin, not really fitting in, I was

03:32:14.140 --> 03:32:20.540
[Guest]: on the margin, not really fitting in. And, and then you kind of gravitate towards each

03:32:20.540 --> 03:32:30.180
[Guest]: other, because you find that although you belong very strongly to a certain social group,

03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:37.660
[Guest]: you don't necessarily identify with the role playing that is required of you. And so, while

03:32:37.660 --> 03:32:45.980
[Guest]: he comes from a very traditional, patriarchal Muslim home, he's the only son of a very important

03:32:45.980 --> 03:32:54.700
[Guest]: father, he, he was rejecting all of the expectations that, you know, were placed on him as the

03:32:54.700 --> 03:33:00.060
[Guest]: heir of his father as the only son of his mother as somebody who would study in a certain

03:33:00.060 --> 03:33:07.700
[Guest]: way, go abroad in a certain way, you know, become upwardly mobile in a certain way. And

03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:14.940
[Guest]: he just wanted to be free. And he was kind of practicing that very free life. And in

03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:20.780
[Guest]: a sense, when I had chosen to be a camera person, when I had chosen to be part of this

03:33:20.780 --> 03:33:28.260
[Guest]: very cool NDTV gang, but I was the girl in the baseball cap, you know, and Levi's jeans

03:33:28.260 --> 03:33:33.940
[Guest]: and trekking shoes, because I had to carry heavy equipment every day, and I would end

03:33:33.940 --> 03:33:41.460
[Guest]: the day being exhausted and not at all attractive looking by that time. But that was a choice

03:33:41.460 --> 03:33:47.620
[Guest]: that spoke to me. And, you know, I was not doing the traditional role playing of a 23

03:33:47.620 --> 03:33:56.260
[Guest]: year old or 25, four year old, urban kid with urban person with, with my kind of background.

03:33:56.260 --> 03:34:03.660
[Guest]: And somewhere, I think, being unconventional in our own ways, wanting to live a little

03:34:03.660 --> 03:34:11.300
[Guest]: more authentically kind of attracted us to each other. One of the first plans we made

03:34:11.300 --> 03:34:19.740
[Guest]: together was to be part of a group that was going to drive from Delhi all the way to Spain.

03:34:19.740 --> 03:34:23.660
[Guest]: Because we knew someone in Pakistan, and we knew someone in Turkey, and then we knew someone

03:34:23.660 --> 03:34:28.740
[Guest]: in Spain. And therefore, we were going to, you know, and we would have these meetings,

03:34:28.740 --> 03:34:32.260
[Guest]: and we would make these plans. And I even told my mother, I was going to do that. She

03:34:32.260 --> 03:34:42.100
[Guest]: was like, okay. So yeah, you know, big dreams, crazy dreams, having being happy to think

03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:48.180
[Guest]: about unattainable things. These are the kind of things that, that attracted us to each

03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:53.660
[Guest]: other's company. We didn't know how to be married, because we didn't want to be married

03:34:53.660 --> 03:34:59.700
[Guest]: in the, you know, we didn't want to be, we didn't have that very conventional idea of

03:34:59.700 --> 03:35:07.940
[Guest]: ghar banayenge, savings hongi, you know, bachche honge, school jayenge. We didn't want to live

03:35:07.940 --> 03:35:15.700
[Guest]: in that kind of mold. And, and, and, and that was very freeing. And so we would, we would

03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:25.660
[Guest]: just do fun things together. And we didn't take the idea of marrying or being together

03:35:25.660 --> 03:35:32.100
[Guest]: for life seriously. He certainly didn't take it seriously, because he was quite convinced

03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:39.340
[Guest]: that he could not break his mother's heart. Of course, we discovered later on that his

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:48.340
[Guest]: mother was extremely happy to meet me. And her heart was, her heart was actually reassured,

03:35:48.340 --> 03:35:54.340
[Guest]: because she had worried about how her son, you know, she was actually very reassured

03:35:54.340 --> 03:36:00.380
[Guest]: to meet me, she said, Oh, you're another one of the same mold. And now, and now, you guys

03:36:00.380 --> 03:36:06.900
[Guest]: are fine. You'll be fine together. Because, you know, you're not the kind of wife who

03:36:06.900 --> 03:36:15.340
[Guest]: needs taking care of which my son might fail at and stuff like that. So, so yeah, it kind

03:36:15.340 --> 03:36:24.340
[Guest]: of worked for us. And, and continues to the same things that attract us to each other

03:36:24.340 --> 03:36:32.860
[Guest]: also become the reason for our conflicts, that the same high energy, the same constantly

03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:40.380
[Guest]: embracing new projects and running off in whatever direction our interests take us,

03:36:40.380 --> 03:36:49.540
[Guest]: you know, it can be quite chaotic. But it keeps us alive, and it keeps us happy. And,

03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:54.740
[Guest]: and I guess the one thing we discovered about each other early was that we could be quite

03:36:54.740 --> 03:37:02.940
[Guest]: supportive of the other person's eccentricity or unconventionality or, or dreams. I mean,

03:37:02.940 --> 03:37:08.060
[Guest]: you can. And, and that I think we've been able to honor.

03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:11.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm struck by what you said about, you know, one possible reason for the attraction being

03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:16.780
[Amit Varma]: both of you on the margins, I was telling a friend recently, that sometimes if you feel

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:22.100
[Amit Varma]: you don't belong somewhere, rather than try to fit in, just look for other misfits, which

03:37:22.100 --> 03:37:28.700
[Amit Varma]: is perhaps what you guys did. Another thing I'm struck by is is that, on the one hand,

03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:35.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, you seem really sort of a misfit, and someone who doesn't particularly care

03:37:35.780 --> 03:37:39.340
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, compromising too much to be part of this or that, or whatever, you're

03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:42.900
[Amit Varma]: living an independent life, you're wearing trekking shoes and carrying heavy cameras

03:37:42.900 --> 03:37:49.340
[Amit Varma]: around. But once you do get together with him, it's so important to you that you fit

03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:54.060
[Amit Varma]: into his family, that you make a good impression that his family is your family, and that his

03:37:54.060 --> 03:37:58.260
[Amit Varma]: village is your village. And you've, you know, written different essays about all of that

03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:02.660
[Amit Varma]: you speak about how you first, you know, met his parents in a South Indian restaurant in

03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:08.860
[Amit Varma]: a Delhi marketplace in, you know, your Christmas cotton suit and a bandhani dupatta, and all

03:38:08.860 --> 03:38:13.540
[Amit Varma]: of that, and you really want to make an impression. And though the initial impression is mixed

03:38:13.540 --> 03:38:18.460
[Amit Varma]: after that, you know, everything sort of works out. And there are these really intriguing

03:38:18.460 --> 03:38:23.740
[Amit Varma]: lines where you write, some episodes carry a haze that I label as cultural confusion.

03:38:23.740 --> 03:38:28.180
[Amit Varma]: The more we got to know each other's families, the more we discovered how different they

03:38:28.180 --> 03:38:34.380
[Amit Varma]: were from the version we had reported to each other, stop code. And this goes back to the

03:38:34.380 --> 03:38:38.660
[Amit Varma]: point you made earlier about memory, how we can remember different things differently.

03:38:38.660 --> 03:38:43.060
[Amit Varma]: But it also goes like, you've pointed out how you would tell him things about his mother,

03:38:43.060 --> 03:38:48.060
[Amit Varma]: and he was like, I didn't know that, right? And how he got along so well with your mom,

03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:52.260
[Amit Varma]: and you were like, like, what the fuck? Why are you leaving me out of this? Right? So

03:38:52.260 --> 03:38:57.820
[Amit Varma]: what was that urge? What was that urge? Which made you want to have a family? What was that

03:38:57.820 --> 03:39:05.060
[Amit Varma]: urge? This other family? What was that urge? Which made you adopt his village is basically

03:39:05.060 --> 03:39:09.500
[Amit Varma]: your village and your kid's village and all of that. So that's interesting, because, you

03:39:09.500 --> 03:39:14.660
[Amit Varma]: know, I mean, we all contain multitudes, of course, but tell me a bit about this. And

03:39:14.660 --> 03:39:20.380
[Amit Varma]: was this something you discovered in yourself over time? Or did it just come so organically

03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:24.940
[Amit Varma]: and naturally that, you know,

03:39:24.940 --> 03:39:31.060
[Guest]: that's, that's not a line I remembered, but it's a very interesting line, we discovered

03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:37.900
[Guest]: that the versions of that each other's families were different from the versions that we had

03:39:37.900 --> 03:39:48.060
[Guest]: reported to each other. Yeah, that truly was a fabulous honeymoon period. I had reported,

03:39:48.060 --> 03:39:55.660
[Guest]: I had told him many stories about my other brother, and what an evil person he was. And

03:39:55.660 --> 03:40:01.340
[Guest]: then he met my brother when he came and he was like, my God, he's such a wonderful guy.

03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:07.940
[Guest]: He's so funny, such a gentleman. And look at you, you know, how you I can't believe you spoke

03:40:07.940 --> 03:40:15.340
[Guest]: like this about him. So of course, it took him many years to get, he still, it's interesting

03:40:15.340 --> 03:40:22.940
[Guest]: how he defends my family when he feels that I am being too harsh. And the worst disagreements

03:40:22.940 --> 03:40:29.700
[Guest]: he and I have are when I feel that he's judging his family too harsh. And he's, you know,

03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:36.260
[Guest]: he's not letting up when when he really needs to. And sometimes I'll step back and say,

03:40:36.260 --> 03:40:43.660
[Guest]: why are we fighting with each other about this? That's your nephew, you figure it out.

03:40:43.660 --> 03:40:48.580
[Guest]: You know, why are we disagreeing so hard about whether he's okay or not, and I'll usually

03:40:48.580 --> 03:40:56.340
[Guest]: be defending him. So yeah, so there is, of course, where we are positioned. As young

03:40:56.340 --> 03:41:01.940
[Guest]: single people, we are freshly free of our families. And therefore, you know, our rants

03:41:01.940 --> 03:41:09.500
[Guest]: are at their kind of peak, in a sense, and we haven't faced any of the, what they say

03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:16.820
[Guest]: jab bade hoge toh pata chalega. So none of the conflicts of actually living a complex

03:41:16.820 --> 03:41:24.180
[Guest]: adult life have, you know, we have not really kind of lived that yet. But also, there is

03:41:24.180 --> 03:41:32.140
[Guest]: so much about how you tend to judge people who are close to you, and how much you tend

03:41:32.140 --> 03:41:41.060
[Guest]: to take them literally. And just like, I mean, when we did actually decide that we were going

03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:46.140
[Guest]: to get married, and we made very elaborate plans of how we would have to leave the city

03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:51.700
[Guest]: and maybe even the country and because nobody was going to agree and we would have to go

03:41:51.700 --> 03:42:02.700
[Guest]: very far away to survive. And what happened was absolutely the reverse. We were, our immediate

03:42:02.700 --> 03:42:07.780
[Guest]: parents were just waiting for the day that we would break the news to them. They were

03:42:07.780 --> 03:42:16.460
[Guest]: completely out of patience. They just wanted us to figure it out and get on with it, in

03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:27.620
[Guest]: a sense. So we were surprised to the point of shock to discover how keen his family was

03:42:27.620 --> 03:42:37.460
[Guest]: to have me as his wife and how keen my family was to have him formally as their son in law.

03:42:37.460 --> 03:42:45.980
[Guest]: And you know, and how much they were celebrating it. So they clearly knew more about us. And

03:42:45.980 --> 03:42:54.580
[Guest]: what would, you know, what was good for us, than we were giving them credit for in a sense.

03:42:54.580 --> 03:43:05.660
[Guest]: His mother was a very, very beautiful surprise for me. I made a lot of concessions to make

03:43:05.660 --> 03:43:13.020
[Guest]: it easier for me, because I was going by his version of how, you know, she's a certain

03:43:13.020 --> 03:43:20.100
[Guest]: generation, a certain age, has a certain set of expectations. So I'm tiptoeing around her

03:43:20.100 --> 03:43:26.260
[Guest]: and, you know, trying to be, I would speak to her in, this became a family joke, I would

03:43:26.260 --> 03:43:33.380
[Guest]: speak to her in Hindi. But, you know, she's an Urdu speaking woman. And when I said meri

03:43:33.380 --> 03:43:43.980
[Guest]: saheli aane wali hai, wo nikat pahuch gayi hai. And Afzal was like, please speak in English.

03:43:43.980 --> 03:43:50.660
[Guest]: This is ghastly. Can you say? Saheli and nikat being the problem word. Yeah, yeah. Can you,

03:43:50.660 --> 03:43:56.940
[Guest]: you know, he would say, inki dost aane wali hai, wo paas pahuch gayi hai. And I was just

03:43:56.940 --> 03:44:01.980
[Guest]: literally translating everything. And what was coming out of my mouth, when I tried to

03:44:01.980 --> 03:44:08.900
[Guest]: translate every word, after years of being comfortable with English was my textbook Hindi.

03:44:08.900 --> 03:44:19.700
[Guest]: And that just didn't, that sat so badly in this very accomplished Urdu speaking family.

03:44:19.700 --> 03:44:24.060
[Guest]: And he would be embarrassed and say, just speak in English. If you know, when you can't,

03:44:24.060 --> 03:44:30.660
[Guest]: when you can't find a word, please don't translate it. But also, you know, she came and stayed

03:44:30.660 --> 03:44:38.340
[Guest]: with us for a while. And I would dress differently to go to work, at the cost of being mocked

03:44:38.340 --> 03:44:44.860
[Guest]: by all my colleagues. You know, look at her, as soon as she got married, our girl in baseball

03:44:44.860 --> 03:44:51.700
[Guest]: cap and Levi's jeans is coming in salwar kameez every day. But I got tired of it. And I think

03:44:51.700 --> 03:44:57.100
[Guest]: in the second month, I came out of my room in trousers, and a blouse and my mother in

03:44:57.100 --> 03:45:08.700
[Guest]: law looks at me and she says you look so good like this. And I was like, okay. Point taken.

03:45:08.700 --> 03:45:12.780
[Guest]: She's just like, what, you know, all she was trying, she didn't know how to tell me that

03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:20.060
[Guest]: you don't have to change in any way. Just for me, just calm down and relax and be who

03:45:20.060 --> 03:45:24.980
[Guest]: you are. And the first time we had guests over suddenly, and I went into the kitchen

03:45:24.980 --> 03:45:33.100
[Guest]: and tried to clumsily put together some kebabs, she she walked into the kitchen and she was

03:45:33.100 --> 03:45:39.060
[Guest]: like my mother in law, she was so much older. I mean, my mother in law was like my grandmother

03:45:39.060 --> 03:45:45.660
[Guest]: in a sense, because she was always dressed in white muslins and kept her head covered

03:45:45.660 --> 03:45:50.980
[Guest]: like my nani used to. So she came into the kitchen and she was as clumsy as me with the

03:45:50.980 --> 03:45:56.260
[Guest]: kebabs. And she said, you know, I've never cooked in my life. And it's okay, you don't

03:45:56.260 --> 03:46:01.820
[Guest]: have to do it, do it either. And then we just giggled a bit, you know, this nearly 80 year

03:46:01.820 --> 03:46:13.220
[Guest]: old woman and, and me, adult, clumsy bahu. And, and calm down about it. So yeah, she

03:46:13.220 --> 03:46:24.940
[Guest]: she, she, she was, she was really amazing. I, I think that Afzal, actually, I had expected

03:46:24.940 --> 03:46:30.980
[Guest]: him to be very nervous. At one point, I told him, I won't marry you, because you won't

03:46:30.980 --> 03:46:35.860
[Guest]: talk to me when we go to the village. And he was like, what does that mean? And in my

03:46:35.860 --> 03:46:44.700
[Guest]: head, what I meant was that you will become, you know, because I know, I know the, the

03:46:44.700 --> 03:46:50.180
[Guest]: environment there is different. And, and then you will not be my friend, you will begin

03:46:50.180 --> 03:46:58.220
[Guest]: to play a role. And she's the one who, far more than him or me, actually, foresaw the

03:46:58.220 --> 03:47:09.100
[Guest]: pressures that we would feel and ease them for us. And, and when our first daughter was

03:47:09.100 --> 03:47:16.060
[Guest]: born, we had three daughters over the years, she's the one who she stood, you know, like

03:47:16.060 --> 03:47:22.540
[Guest]: in the front line. And she was like, anybody say anything rude about my granddaughters,

03:47:22.540 --> 03:47:31.180
[Guest]: you, you, you know, I, you talk to me first, no, nobody's going to hurt them or say anything

03:47:31.180 --> 03:47:39.900
[Guest]: bad about this whole gender drama. And it was immensely protective of me. And really,

03:47:39.900 --> 03:47:51.940
[Guest]: it was like an antidote to what my own village and my own kind of family background had prepared

03:47:51.940 --> 03:47:54.060
[Amit Varma]: me for, in a sense.

03:47:54.060 --> 03:47:59.940
[Amit Varma]: And what is also lovely here is that she's actually, you know, anticipating in advance

03:47:59.940 --> 03:48:03.700
[Amit Varma]: the way that you're feeling and reacting to that. And it's okay, you don't have to cook

03:48:03.700 --> 03:48:09.460
[Amit Varma]: or you look so great in those jeans, and so on and so forth. And I imagine the reason

03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:14.220
[Amit Varma]: you and Afzal might have seen her differently, is that in his memory, he would remember her

03:48:14.220 --> 03:48:18.900
[Amit Varma]: as she would have been as a younger person, a younger mother, perhaps stricter, less chilled

03:48:18.900 --> 03:48:24.380
[Amit Varma]: out, and I guess age kind of changes you like that. So that's sort of...

03:48:24.380 --> 03:48:30.700
[Guest]: And also, it's the same thing as Sudha, in a sense, you know, that innate wisdom of knowing

03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:35.860
[Guest]: what is good for this other person, never kind of spelling it out and saying, you can

03:48:35.860 --> 03:48:44.700
[Guest]: marry anyone you want. But, but knowing that, if my son is in love, then this is what will

03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:51.940
[Guest]: sustain him. And that's, you know, that's what I want as a mother for him.

03:48:51.940 --> 03:48:55.100
[Amit Varma]: You've written many columns about marriage, and they're very interesting, and I hope young

03:48:55.100 --> 03:49:00.860
[Amit Varma]: people read them. And I was struck especially by this para in this piece you've written

03:49:00.860 --> 03:49:05.580
[Amit Varma]: called a welcome note for new husbands and wives. And the para goes, quote, do not be

03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:10.660
[Amit Varma]: in a hurry to become one of these a husband or a wife. Take your time, change your mind

03:49:10.660 --> 03:49:16.540
[Amit Varma]: many times. Be suspicious of prefabricated labels and roles. Be prepared to be inventive.

03:49:16.540 --> 03:49:22.020
[Amit Varma]: Even when you do get married, do not go running towards a quicksand. Slow down, amble around,

03:49:22.020 --> 03:49:26.220
[Amit Varma]: check out the new terrain at your own pace. Participate in the costume drama that Indian

03:49:26.220 --> 03:49:31.500
[Amit Varma]: marriages are, but see yourself as an intern. Be a part timer in the beginning if you need

03:49:31.500 --> 03:49:36.340
[Amit Varma]: to hold on to all your other commitments and loves. Love more than just people, stop quote,

03:49:36.340 --> 03:49:41.420
[Amit Varma]: which is such a lovely para. And I hope many young people read that. And you also sort

03:49:41.420 --> 03:49:46.620
[Amit Varma]: of have another piece called good marriage is a terrible burden. You know, where you

03:49:46.620 --> 03:49:50.940
[Amit Varma]: talk about how it involves fighting, it involves letting go of fights, you don't have to keep

03:49:50.940 --> 03:49:55.420
[Amit Varma]: up an appearance that we are the ideal couple. Sometimes you just have to express yourself

03:49:55.420 --> 03:50:01.340
[Amit Varma]: and and it's okay to do so. And at one point, you quote this lovely phrase used by a therapist

03:50:01.340 --> 03:50:06.980
[Amit Varma]: to you, the housekeeping of your marriage. Right? So take me a little bit through all

03:50:06.980 --> 03:50:12.380
[Amit Varma]: of this, because somehow in Indian culture, in Indian society, you know, there are these

03:50:12.380 --> 03:50:16.980
[Amit Varma]: grooves that everyone goes down upon. I'm just using that phrase again and again today

03:50:16.980 --> 03:50:21.780
[Amit Varma]: for some reason, that, you know, it's kind of understood, you're going to get married

03:50:21.780 --> 03:50:26.820
[Amit Varma]: and you're going to have kids. And, you know, and this is what a marriage should be like.

03:50:26.820 --> 03:50:31.820
[Amit Varma]: And this is a husband's role. And this is a wife's role. And what you describe in great

03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:38.180
[Amit Varma]: detail is that no man is problematic. It's messy. But you have to take bring the same

03:50:38.180 --> 03:50:44.540
[Amit Varma]: intentionality towards it that you take towards anything else, like you could be intentional

03:50:44.540 --> 03:50:50.500
[Amit Varma]: about an aspect of your career about learning something about whatever. And a relationship

03:50:50.500 --> 03:50:55.980
[Amit Varma]: is not a thing that just is what it is, you have to work and shape it the way you want.

03:50:55.980 --> 03:51:00.300
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how you're thinking on this evolved and what your experiences

03:51:00.300 --> 03:51:02.700
[Guest]: were like.

03:51:02.700 --> 03:51:15.140
[Guest]: I think what helped was our variness, you know, towards the idea at all, not wanting

03:51:15.140 --> 03:51:24.060
[Guest]: to have to fall into the conventional roles. At one point, our therapist had to hold our

03:51:24.060 --> 03:51:34.300
[Guest]: hand and actually remind us that we had been so very, that we had become distant. And that,

03:51:34.300 --> 03:51:40.140
[Guest]: you know, when he says, Do you call him your husband? And I said, No. And he said, Maybe

03:51:40.140 --> 03:51:46.900
[Guest]: you should. You guys are not being able to support each other in the way that you need

03:51:46.900 --> 03:51:55.540
[Guest]: to now that you have children. So don't not ask him for help. Don't be so, you know, you're

03:51:55.540 --> 03:51:59.940
[Guest]: isolating yourself and then you're feeling disappointed in each other. So he was kind

03:51:59.940 --> 03:52:10.660
[Guest]: of helping us to get closer to each other. The variness, it's useful for us because it's

03:52:10.660 --> 03:52:18.660
[Guest]: so mutual. You know, neither he nor I want to change the other person, neither he nor

03:52:18.660 --> 03:52:31.580
[Guest]: I want to become a lesser version of ourselves. And yet, having children together and wielding,

03:52:31.580 --> 03:52:37.740
[Guest]: you know, the extended families as they have been has also taught us that you, you know,

03:52:37.740 --> 03:52:43.940
[Guest]: take it slow. You're not going to realize everything at the same time. There's a time

03:52:43.940 --> 03:52:51.340
[Guest]: for everything. And it's all right, if for this particular event, you need to be quieter

03:52:51.340 --> 03:52:57.740
[Guest]: or dressed in a certain way or, you know, or just play a little bit of a role. It's

03:52:57.740 --> 03:53:06.620
[Guest]: not that big a deal. But in the in the spaces in which you are together, remember to, that's

03:53:06.620 --> 03:53:11.780
[Guest]: where the housekeeping thing, she actually said to us, she said, come back every year

03:53:11.780 --> 03:53:17.020
[Guest]: for the housekeeping of your marriage, you know, meet each other as separate individuals

03:53:17.020 --> 03:53:24.940
[Guest]: again and and see what it is that you want to say to each other that everyday spaces

03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:32.380
[Guest]: don't often give us the space to do. And it was very useful because nothing in our culture

03:53:32.380 --> 03:53:41.420
[Guest]: ever says that to us. No, it's for keeps. Now there's no going back. There's no rethink.

03:53:41.420 --> 03:53:45.700
[Guest]: I mean, it's not like if you're having an open conversation about expectations, you

03:53:45.700 --> 03:53:49.900
[Guest]: are rethinking the marriage. It's not like you're letting go of the relationship, but

03:53:49.900 --> 03:53:57.300
[Guest]: it's just it's as if all those spaces close. And that's what does us in, in a sense, that's

03:53:57.300 --> 03:54:04.500
[Guest]: that's where, you know, it doesn't work or it only works for one of the two who is kind

03:54:04.500 --> 03:54:11.860
[Guest]: of getting away with all the goodies while he or the other one is left with almost, you

03:54:11.860 --> 03:54:23.460
[Guest]: know, is feeling depleted over the years. And so, yeah, I mean, having access to therapists,

03:54:23.460 --> 03:54:29.540
[Guest]: having met them independently, when we were not married, when we were wondering whether

03:54:29.540 --> 03:54:37.700
[Guest]: we should marry, when we were trying to figure out our own individual issues of growing up,

03:54:37.700 --> 03:54:44.700
[Guest]: and then being able to go back again and again in a safe way has been something that has

03:54:44.700 --> 03:54:48.660
[Guest]: that has been very, very supportive for us.

03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:53.540
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that a spouse is a moving target in the sense that we change

03:54:53.540 --> 03:54:57.900
[Amit Varma]: throughout our lives. Like I look back on who I was 20 years ago, and I was a completely

03:54:57.900 --> 03:55:02.620
[Amit Varma]: different person. And I think that's true of pretty much everybody to some degree or

03:55:02.620 --> 03:55:08.340
[Amit Varma]: the other. And the danger is that you can end up with the fixed image of someone in

03:55:08.340 --> 03:55:13.860
[Amit Varma]: your head, this is a person I married or whatever. And that fixed image will then come with fixed

03:55:13.860 --> 03:55:19.380
[Amit Varma]: expectations. And it's not always like that, like, I think, in the same way that, for example,

03:55:19.380 --> 03:55:23.860
[Amit Varma]: your husband had a particular image of his mother, which is not the person you met. And

03:55:23.860 --> 03:55:28.700
[Amit Varma]: similarly, you had a particular image of your brother, who was perhaps not the person that

03:55:28.700 --> 03:55:33.660
[Amit Varma]: Afzal met. And there's a danger that you can have an image of each other and that can get

03:55:33.660 --> 03:55:40.860
[Amit Varma]: ossified. And it strikes me that this whole act of intentionality of doing this housekeeping,

03:55:40.860 --> 03:55:46.820
[Amit Varma]: really kind of helps keep that fresh. So you know, there's a great column of yours, which

03:55:46.820 --> 03:55:51.740
[Amit Varma]: I won't quote from at length, I'll just, I'll sort of link to it where you speak about five

03:55:51.740 --> 03:55:56.380
[Amit Varma]: things to learn about marriage, and I'll quickly read them out. And if my if listeners are

03:55:56.380 --> 03:55:59.980
[Amit Varma]: intrigued, they can just go and read the full thing. But I found great wisdom in them, especially

03:55:59.980 --> 03:56:05.460
[Amit Varma]: number five. Number one is learn to fight, then learn to feel at home, then learn not

03:56:05.460 --> 03:56:11.980
[Amit Varma]: to be offended. Learn to be a gracious host. And finally, drink tea and do nothing. You

03:56:11.980 --> 03:56:20.540
[Guest]: want to elaborate on the last one? Yeah, yeah. I learned this from him entirely. And the

03:56:20.540 --> 03:56:27.580
[Guest]: columns called five things to learn from your spouse, right? So drink tea and do nothing

03:56:27.580 --> 03:56:35.260
[Guest]: was a great, great and very shocking kind of lesson to learn. It also became one of

03:56:35.260 --> 03:56:40.580
[Guest]: the many reasons that I'm going to kind of add it to why did we get together. So I come

03:56:40.580 --> 03:56:50.540
[Guest]: from this insecure, middle class workaholic family, where what my father tried to embed

03:56:50.540 --> 03:56:59.460
[Guest]: in us was kind of a, almost a slavish mentality, you know, that there will always be a boss,

03:56:59.460 --> 03:57:07.420
[Guest]: and you have to be the best worker possible. And that's how he has lived his, his his life.

03:57:07.420 --> 03:57:14.300
[Guest]: But that was, you know, that's the great thing about new generations, right? They completely

03:57:14.300 --> 03:57:21.860
[Guest]: reject the premise in the first place. And, and it's, it's because of the privileges that

03:57:21.860 --> 03:57:27.380
[Guest]: you have given them to your own children, that they are able to dream of a completely

03:57:27.380 --> 03:57:31.980
[Guest]: different world. So it can be a little bit of a shock for parents, that, you know, you

03:57:31.980 --> 03:57:37.820
[Guest]: use the education I wanted you to use in this way, to become a social activist, that was

03:57:37.820 --> 03:57:44.500
[Guest]: not what I wanted from you or a camera person that doesn't fit. But but that's what children

03:57:44.500 --> 03:57:49.420
[Guest]: do. And that's a great thing. That's a great thing that every new generation does. But

03:57:49.420 --> 03:57:57.900
[Guest]: so just to come back to the point, what, always being busy, always working hard, getting up

03:57:57.900 --> 03:58:04.620
[Guest]: in the morning and having a sense of purpose and just always being kind of focused on something

03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:12.620
[Guest]: to that has outcomes was something that I kind of come from that background. And for

03:58:12.620 --> 03:58:20.620
[Guest]: a for a man who's grown up in a landowning family in a, in a village, and, you know,

03:58:20.620 --> 03:58:27.820
[Guest]: from a certain privileged background, and yet a small town life and a village life,

03:58:27.820 --> 03:58:34.780
[Guest]: to have these moments where you honour each other, you honour each other's presence in

03:58:34.780 --> 03:58:42.600
[Guest]: your life by just being together and not necessarily having anything to do, but just being in each

03:58:42.600 --> 03:58:48.820
[Guest]: other's company. And that, you know, in the larger scheme of things is a way in which

03:58:48.820 --> 03:58:53.660
[Guest]: people stay connected. It's a way in which people are able to give support to each other.

03:58:53.660 --> 03:58:59.220
[Guest]: And sometimes when there's no language, in which we can celebrate or grieve or share,

03:58:59.220 --> 03:59:06.940
[Guest]: just that just those moments of quiet and that shared cup of tea is a, I would say even

03:59:06.940 --> 03:59:13.740
[Guest]: a healing space. I'd never had tea before I got married to him. Having tea was a waste

03:59:13.740 --> 03:59:24.940
[Guest]: of time. And so I really, I had not, I had no patience for anything of the sort. But

03:59:24.940 --> 03:59:30.700
[Guest]: living with him, I'd known him for years, but living with him meant that the morning

03:59:30.700 --> 03:59:36.820
[Guest]: started with a slow cup of tea, you came together in the evening with another cup of tea, sometimes

03:59:36.820 --> 03:59:43.260
[Guest]: after breakfast, you had, you know, you added tea, if somebody came over, there had to be

03:59:43.260 --> 03:59:49.300
[Guest]: tea. And you didn't have to achieve anything, you know. So now we've got these spaces where

03:59:49.300 --> 03:59:55.180
[Guest]: the phone is away, the computer is in the other room, you're not attending to anything

03:59:55.180 --> 04:00:05.020
[Guest]: in particular, but it's a moment to relish with each other. And I've learnt the gift

04:00:05.020 --> 04:00:12.900
[Guest]: of it in a sense. And our children have, we've been able, it's one of the things we've been

04:00:12.900 --> 04:00:20.060
[Guest]: able to do in the family that whatever happens, we are together at mealtime. Sometimes he's

04:00:20.060 --> 04:00:27.100
[Guest]: not at home, and I'll ask one of the children who's going to make me tea and make me tea.

04:00:27.100 --> 04:00:31.820
[Guest]: And it's just a place where wherever you are in your separate spaces, even if you're in

04:00:31.820 --> 04:00:36.540
[Guest]: the same home, you gather for a moment. So it's a little bit of what therapists would

04:00:36.540 --> 04:00:44.340
[Guest]: call circle time, or, you know, a listening circle or something like that, where you're

04:00:44.340 --> 04:00:49.460
[Guest]: not looking for an outcome, you're just looking for a connection. And some of these things

04:00:49.460 --> 04:00:51.860
[Guest]: are kind of worth nurturing.

04:00:51.860 --> 04:00:57.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm not much of a tea drinker. In fact, I don't like tea, but I'm more of a coffee

04:00:57.580 --> 04:01:02.020
[Amit Varma]: person. But as a metaphor, for a certain state of mind, a certain kind of terror, it really

04:01:02.020 --> 04:01:07.220
[Amit Varma]: works nicely for me to disconnect from the world and just, you know, do your thing, except

04:01:07.220 --> 04:01:11.980
[Amit Varma]: that I find that you can disconnect from the world in terms of actually doing something.

04:01:11.980 --> 04:01:16.460
[Amit Varma]: So I may not be writing something or, you know, working on an episode or working on

04:01:16.460 --> 04:01:22.380
[Amit Varma]: whatever, but the mind is, there are still crazy monkeys gambling around in the mind,

04:01:22.380 --> 04:01:30.940
[Amit Varma]: right? So how does one sort of deal with that? Because I think to do the kind of work that

04:01:30.940 --> 04:01:35.700
[Amit Varma]: you do when you write your essays or whatever, you know, I'm guessing that you need to have

04:01:35.700 --> 04:01:39.660
[Amit Varma]: that quiet space where you can sit down and do your work. That's far harder for a woman

04:01:39.660 --> 04:01:45.260
[Amit Varma]: than for a man, obviously. And, you know, I get a glimpse of that where at one point,

04:01:45.260 --> 04:01:49.420
[Amit Varma]: your husband says, I have to go to Amritsar, will you come with me? And you say, yeah,

04:01:49.420 --> 04:01:54.260
[Amit Varma]: let's go. And then suddenly you realize that he's including the children in the plan. And

04:01:54.260 --> 04:01:57.820
[Amit Varma]: you're like, why, why are you doing this? You know, it's a, you know, I'll have to look

04:01:57.820 --> 04:02:01.380
[Amit Varma]: after them, and there'll be so much work. And that work would have been more or less

04:02:01.380 --> 04:02:07.980
[Amit Varma]: done by you, no matter how progressive the man is, right? So for women to find that,

04:02:07.980 --> 04:02:12.540
[Amit Varma]: that kind of quiet space, those long periods of what Cal Newport calls deep work is much

04:02:12.540 --> 04:02:16.700
[Amit Varma]: harder. So what are the kind of mechanisms you deal with? And you've seen other women

04:02:16.700 --> 04:02:23.300
[Amit Varma]: deal with where you actually have that time to yourself and that luck, because you know,

04:02:23.300 --> 04:02:27.860
[Amit Varma]: there's a house, there's a husband, there are three kids, how have you sort of managed

04:02:27.860 --> 04:02:32.820
[Amit Varma]: to sort of figure that out?

04:02:32.820 --> 04:02:41.380
[Guest]: Multiple things. One, I really had to give up on perfectionism. And that was my, it was

04:02:41.380 --> 04:02:48.420
[Guest]: a much needed lesson. You know, especially when I began to work from home. It's much

04:02:48.420 --> 04:02:52.700
[Guest]: simpler in the office, because someone else has watered the plants and kept everything

04:02:52.700 --> 04:02:57.940
[Guest]: clean. And there's this quiet army that comes at night, and everything's in place, and you

04:02:57.940 --> 04:03:04.660
[Guest]: just do your work. But you start working from home, and you don't have that quiet army,

04:03:04.660 --> 04:03:11.340
[Guest]: or that quiet army looks at you and says instructions for the day and stuff, plus your growing children,

04:03:11.340 --> 04:03:17.740
[Guest]: plus an extended family from, but definitely his side where there's no boundaries, anybody

04:03:17.740 --> 04:03:28.180
[Guest]: can come turn up anytime, any kind of plans can happen. So it took me a while. And I have

04:03:28.180 --> 04:03:35.860
[Guest]: now I've kind of damaged a few psyches on the way. But to give up on the idea of everything

04:03:35.860 --> 04:03:45.220
[Guest]: being perfect, looking perfect, and that being a reflection of my efficiency and my aesthetic,

04:03:45.220 --> 04:03:50.580
[Guest]: you know, so now I've come a very long way. If I've got a quick Zoom meeting, I'll just

04:03:50.580 --> 04:03:55.460
[Guest]: look at the background, whatever is behind me, I will throw behind the computer, have

04:03:55.460 --> 04:04:01.820
[Guest]: a neat background, do my meeting later on, I'll put it in the other side. So giving up

04:04:01.820 --> 04:04:10.620
[Guest]: on this idea, which is also a, you know, a housemaker's burden. How is her house looking

04:04:10.620 --> 04:04:17.620
[Guest]: and I just, I mean, social, socialization teaches you, certainly your mother teaches

04:04:17.620 --> 04:04:24.940
[Guest]: you, sasural mein ye na bole ki maa ne sikhaya nahi, kind of line, and you internalize yourself

04:04:24.940 --> 04:04:30.820
[Guest]: also, I'm this person whose house is just so perfect all the time. That was an idea

04:04:30.820 --> 04:04:38.940
[Guest]: that I had to give up both to be able to have a compassionate relationship with my children,

04:04:38.940 --> 04:04:45.980
[Guest]: whose job it is literally definition of their existence is to keep things not in their place,

04:04:45.980 --> 04:04:54.260
[Guest]: but all over the floor, etc. And that's what it means to be a child in a home. So for that,

04:04:54.260 --> 04:05:01.300
[Guest]: for that sake, and for the sake of being able to have mind space and energy to be with my

04:05:01.300 --> 04:05:12.580
[Guest]: work, which is very, very important to me, as it is to everyone. Yeah, so that was one.

04:05:12.580 --> 04:05:22.300
[Guest]: Another is that, like, I've really been enabled by my family, naturally by my children. So

04:05:22.300 --> 04:05:28.300
[Guest]: if I say mama has to do this, and I need your help, and you know, so they'll, they'll,

04:05:28.300 --> 04:05:35.660
[Guest]: they'll do it. They're very, very sensitive to my needs. When I have, when I have learned

04:05:35.660 --> 04:05:40.380
[Guest]: to express them, I had to learn to express them, I had to learn to ask for help. And

04:05:40.380 --> 04:05:54.340
[Guest]: they are always there. And then by Afzal. And because we live these very different work

04:05:54.340 --> 04:06:01.180
[Guest]: lives, we do find we constantly find that both of us or either of us has started a new

04:06:01.180 --> 04:06:06.460
[Guest]: project that the other person has no idea about, because he's also traveling a lot.

04:06:06.460 --> 04:06:10.900
[Guest]: So suddenly, he'll be doing something and I'll be like, you forgot to tell me and he'll

04:06:10.900 --> 04:06:15.860
[Guest]: be like, didn't I tell you? And it's already too far gone. And now it's going to affect

04:06:15.860 --> 04:06:22.060
[Guest]: my life and we have to figure it out. And similarly with me. So when I started writing

04:06:22.060 --> 04:06:29.820
[Guest]: my column, he was not at home. When I, I mean, many, many of the things, I think we've remained

04:06:29.820 --> 04:06:38.580
[Guest]: loyal to the idea of enabling the other person to do what they need to do. And he more than

04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:46.900
[Guest]: me almost has a, I don't know what other term to use, because I'm not familiar with the

04:06:46.900 --> 04:06:52.660
[Guest]: any other idea paternalistic pride in what I do. I mean, I almost feel like it's my father

04:06:52.660 --> 04:07:00.060
[Guest]: beaming over me. You know, when he'll read something and he like it, or he want to celebrate

04:07:00.060 --> 04:07:09.060
[Guest]: something that I've done well, or I have completed or, you know, so, so certainly there is, there

04:07:09.060 --> 04:07:15.860
[Guest]: is that is a that's a huge thing. And, and I think it's also been helped by the nature

04:07:15.860 --> 04:07:21.500
[Guest]: of my writing. I mean, just in the same way that my mother was able to read it and say

04:07:21.500 --> 04:07:28.300
[Guest]: mujhe nahi pata tha tu itna sochti hai. And suddenly, she was able to understand years

04:07:28.300 --> 04:07:39.100
[Guest]: of her daughter's inexplicable anxieties or needs. When she understood that, oh, this

04:07:39.100 --> 04:07:46.500
[Guest]: is how she's processing things. Therefore, she had these needs. For him also, I think

04:07:46.500 --> 04:07:55.380
[Guest]: somehow we almost communicate with each other, via writing, in a sense, you know, there is

04:07:55.380 --> 04:08:04.900
[Guest]: a little bit of a homage to the relationship to the family, what's in all, you know, with

04:08:04.900 --> 04:08:16.940
[Guest]: our with full honesty, but a desire to make sense of how we can be so much in love and

04:08:16.940 --> 04:08:24.740
[Guest]: yet so much in conflict. And somehow writing it down kind of helps to communicate things

04:08:24.740 --> 04:08:30.620
[Amit Varma]: that are otherwise not so easy to bring up over tea.

04:08:30.620 --> 04:08:38.780
[Amit Varma]: One of the interesting things about, you know, your narrative, your story, is that you mentioned

04:08:38.780 --> 04:08:42.220
[Amit Varma]: that Afzal didn't really want kids, that he was chill, he was like, nah, I'm not gonna

04:08:42.220 --> 04:08:46.460
[Amit Varma]: have kids. And you on the other hand, like when I think of you and correct me if I'm

04:08:46.460 --> 04:08:51.820
[Amit Varma]: wrong in this characterization, but you seem someone driven by parenthood. It is not something

04:08:51.820 --> 04:08:56.060
[Amit Varma]: that happened along the way or that happened in the routine course of things. But you're

04:08:56.060 --> 04:09:01.420
[Amit Varma]: driven by it. It was your project. It was your labor of love before your columns, perhaps.

04:09:01.420 --> 04:09:07.180
[Amit Varma]: And you went into it with great determination and intentionality and enthusiasm and all

04:09:07.180 --> 04:09:15.700
[Amit Varma]: of that. So take me through sort of this process of discovering in yourself, someone who wanted

04:09:15.700 --> 04:09:22.380
[Amit Varma]: to be a mother and, you know, and persuading Afzal to cooperate in this project.

04:09:22.380 --> 04:09:36.900
[Guest]: Yeah, didn't take a lot of persuasion. Yeah, I can certainly say that this, it's almost,

04:09:36.900 --> 04:09:43.020
[Guest]: you know, in one of my workshops, we were making a list of creative desires and some

04:09:43.020 --> 04:09:51.540
[Guest]: people wrote raising a child. And I think it's a pretty accurate, you know, description.

04:09:51.540 --> 04:09:58.380
[Guest]: It is a, it's a talent that takes nurturing, but and it's also a desire. It's, you know,

04:09:58.380 --> 04:10:06.140
[Guest]: one of the things we can build, can create, can do, you know, just like we create other

04:10:06.140 --> 04:10:16.420
[Guest]: works of art is, you know, is another human being with all humility and mindfulness of

04:10:16.420 --> 04:10:25.580
[Guest]: one's limitations and their individuality. But it does, it is, there is a creativity

04:10:25.580 --> 04:10:35.660
[Guest]: to it. I just, I always had it. But I also remember that the first time I had a breakup,

04:10:35.660 --> 04:10:44.060
[Guest]: I must have been 19 or 20, serious heartbreak. And one of the first thoughts in my mind is,

04:10:44.060 --> 04:10:54.660
[Guest]: I'll have a child one day. And perhaps because of this lingering sense of not belonging,

04:10:54.660 --> 04:11:03.980
[Guest]: this sense of not fitting in, perhaps a hope that one, that's where one will find home.

04:11:03.980 --> 04:11:13.460
[Guest]: That is a relationship that will root me or give me the purpose that I seemed to not have

04:11:13.460 --> 04:11:22.380
[Guest]: in a natural way, otherwise. And even when Afzal and I broke up very seriously, one of

04:11:22.380 --> 04:11:28.980
[Guest]: the last times that we did, and we moved countries, and we were never going to meet again across

04:11:28.980 --> 04:11:35.860
[Guest]: continents, etc. You know, when I thought, okay, what next? And I, I thought, okay, I'll

04:11:35.860 --> 04:11:42.540
[Guest]: take a few years, and then I'll adopt a child. I, you know, that the child remained, that

04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:51.540
[Guest]: I will, and then I thought of Sudha. Sudha will help me. I know that I can't do this

04:11:51.540 --> 04:11:52.540
[Amit Varma]: without her.

04:11:52.540 --> 04:11:53.540
[Guest]: This time she'll get it right.

04:11:53.540 --> 04:12:01.420
[Guest]: With or without her husband, I can't do this without her, that I had figured out. And it's

04:12:01.420 --> 04:12:07.820
[Guest]: true that I, you know, she was there for me throughout. So it's, it's a recurring image

04:12:07.820 --> 04:12:17.660
[Guest]: and a recurring thought that I always kind of had. Did I have to convince him? We just,

04:12:17.660 --> 04:12:27.620
[Guest]: we just got pregnant with our first child, and there was no looking back. It was just,

04:12:27.620 --> 04:12:37.580
[Guest]: yeah, I mean, that's the way his, that's the way his, his decisions get taken. He's like,

04:12:37.580 --> 04:12:43.100
[Guest]: it's a hard no. And then suddenly, it's a yes. It's how we got pets. Never gonna get

04:12:43.100 --> 04:12:50.900
[Guest]: pets. Okay, let's get a dog and a cat together. We're never gonna move. Okay, let's move here.

04:12:50.900 --> 04:12:56.780
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, that's how we got married also. But, but once, once our first child

04:12:56.780 --> 04:13:05.540
[Guest]: was born, it just he, he, he was fascinated. He was holding her, I think, on the fifth

04:13:05.540 --> 04:13:10.580
[Guest]: or the sixth day, and he was like, I feel like I'm holding a little Natasha in my hand.

04:13:10.580 --> 04:13:18.620
[Guest]: And I thought what an amazing expression of love is that for both of you, that he's feeling

04:13:18.620 --> 04:13:25.260
[Guest]: love for her because he thinks he's holding me, a version of me and, but there's been

04:13:25.260 --> 04:13:31.380
[Guest]: no looking back. I was a little bit in shock when we were pregnant for the second time,

04:13:31.380 --> 04:13:38.900
[Guest]: I felt like I didn't have enough time. I just wanted to be with this child. But for him,

04:13:38.900 --> 04:13:46.420
[Guest]: it was like, well, and then yeah, we got pregnant the third time. And then we were mindful about

04:13:46.420 --> 04:13:55.340
[Guest]: not getting pregnant. But yeah, it was, it just kind of flowed.

04:13:55.340 --> 04:14:01.400
[Amit Varma]: One of the things you write in one of your early columns is about how it was so incredibly

04:14:01.400 --> 04:14:07.020
[Amit Varma]: far from what you expected that you know, you at one point where you know, she'd be

04:14:07.020 --> 04:14:12.180
[Amit Varma]: crying and all of that you point out how you know, your husband, your mother and you had

04:14:12.180 --> 04:14:16.760
[Amit Varma]: a handy checklist to figure out why the baby might be crying like a checklist manifesto.

04:14:16.760 --> 04:14:21.060
[Amit Varma]: And you write quote, it went like this one is she hungry, two needs to be burped, three

04:14:21.060 --> 04:14:25.900
[Amit Varma]: has a wet nappy, four wants to be rocked to sleep, five is a nose blocked, six back to

04:14:25.900 --> 04:14:31.100
[Amit Varma]: square one, stop quote, and it almost seems like, you know, it's that panic sets in at

04:14:31.100 --> 04:14:35.980
[Amit Varma]: that point. And then you write these beautiful lines where you write quote, I now know that

04:14:35.980 --> 04:14:41.860
[Amit Varma]: parenting is not just about creation, creation comes later. It is about destruction first,

04:14:41.860 --> 04:14:46.880
[Amit Varma]: the soundless collapse of your own ego, saying goodbye to the self that you were before the

04:14:46.880 --> 04:14:53.180
[Amit Varma]: first pregnancy, redefining an identity, stop quote. So tell me a bit about this soundless

04:14:53.180 --> 04:15:00.420
[Amit Varma]: collapse of the ego, like, does it panic you? Do you have, say, buyer's regret or mother's

04:15:00.420 --> 04:15:04.660
[Amit Varma]: regret at some points where you think that shit, I didn't know it would be like this,

04:15:04.660 --> 04:15:09.380
[Amit Varma]: what have I gotten myself into? So tell me a little bit about like that, because about

04:15:09.380 --> 04:15:14.700
[Amit Varma]: what it was like, because I'm imagining that once parenthood is upon you, and especially

04:15:14.700 --> 04:15:19.780
[Amit Varma]: for a mother, once motherhood is upon you, everything is changed forever. There's no,

04:15:19.780 --> 04:15:24.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's just changed forever. It's a fork in the road. And it's, it is what it

04:15:24.620 --> 04:15:25.620
[Guest]: is.

04:15:25.620 --> 04:15:34.100
[Guest]: To all new mothers, I want to say yes and no. It does change forever. And then it comes

04:15:34.100 --> 04:15:41.180
[Guest]: back. And that's, that's the amazing thing about, you know, the second life or the or

04:15:41.180 --> 04:15:47.820
[Guest]: the multiple lives that you kind of come back to. And, and I can say that with great confidence,

04:15:47.820 --> 04:15:54.100
[Guest]: because I'm living that now. You know, this, I feel like I have this huge creative energy,

04:15:54.100 --> 04:16:01.460
[Guest]: and I'm able to literally do so much more than I had ever done before. And I hadn't

04:16:01.460 --> 04:16:06.740
[Guest]: imagined that I would recreate myself. But to go back to the soundless collapse of one's

04:16:06.740 --> 04:16:17.500
[Guest]: ego, it would make me cry, you know, in despair, but not in remorse. And I know, I know from

04:16:17.500 --> 04:16:26.900
[Guest]: reading other women's testimonials, I know from my friend's experiences, that not everybody

04:16:26.900 --> 04:16:35.260
[Guest]: is ready for it. And a lot of women are not able to cope in, particularly in the in the

04:16:35.260 --> 04:16:43.020
[Guest]: early time. I did have a really difficult time, which is natural. It's called nani yaad

04:16:43.020 --> 04:16:44.020
[Amit Varma]: aajana. Literally.

04:16:44.020 --> 04:16:50.260
[Amit Varma]: And your nani used to come in your dreams, as you mentioned somewhere.

04:16:50.260 --> 04:16:56.420
[Guest]: You're thinking if one child has done me in like this, and you know, now imagine nani

04:16:56.420 --> 04:17:05.940
[Guest]: in her ninth pregnancy and all her children in, you know, under threat of life and she's

04:17:05.940 --> 04:17:16.300
[Guest]: carrying on. So, so yeah, take it slow. You can do this. This has been done before. But

04:17:16.300 --> 04:17:22.980
[Guest]: I am glad I wrote all this because it's very important to be realistic, because it is absolutely

04:17:22.980 --> 04:17:27.480
[Guest]: true that mothers forget everything. They literally, I mean, there's no way they would

04:17:27.480 --> 04:17:34.180
[Guest]: have the second or third child if they remembered how hard it was. They forget everything. And

04:17:34.180 --> 04:17:39.940
[Guest]: then that's very, that's not good to the women who are coming after you and saying, well,

04:17:39.940 --> 04:17:50.460
[Guest]: nobody told me and you're like, well, you know, I tried. But there was never, never,

04:17:50.460 --> 04:18:00.260
[Guest]: I mean, I just prepared myself really well for it. The ego thing was also, you know,

04:18:00.260 --> 04:18:09.940
[Guest]: you're so competent. My first child is born and I'm 32 years old. And I'm almost peaking

04:18:09.940 --> 04:18:16.900
[Guest]: in my broadcast television career. There's nothing I can't do. I can carry two cameras

04:18:16.900 --> 04:18:24.620
[Guest]: across the oceans and, you know, film, all kinds of things. I can set up equipment. And

04:18:24.620 --> 04:18:32.980
[Guest]: I am helpless in the face of this baby and these engorged breasts. And I, you know, I'm

04:18:32.980 --> 04:18:39.500
[Guest]: just my body's not cooperating. I don't have the skills. So, so that kind of going from

04:18:39.500 --> 04:18:50.780
[Guest]: hero to zero is, it's part of the process. And you really kind of need to accept it,

04:18:50.780 --> 04:18:58.740
[Guest]: but also surround yourself with as much support as you can, in a sense.

04:18:58.740 --> 04:19:04.420
[Amit Varma]: And over a period of time, like I imagine a kid comes out and it's a project. Like you

04:19:04.420 --> 04:19:10.620
[Amit Varma]: said it earlier, it's an act of creation. It's a creative activity. So it's out there.

04:19:10.620 --> 04:19:15.700
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, it's more than a project. It's a person. It's its own project. In certain

04:19:15.700 --> 04:19:20.260
[Amit Varma]: senses, you'll become its project at one point in time. You know, and through this time you're

04:19:20.260 --> 04:19:25.780
[Amit Varma]: writing about them repeatedly, but and that writing is useful to remembering like something

04:19:25.780 --> 04:19:31.140
[Amit Varma]: that you said in our last episode, which I remember is that, you know, what the act of

04:19:31.140 --> 04:19:36.580
[Amit Varma]: writing about your kids did is that if something happened to one of them, and she was a 13,

04:19:36.580 --> 04:19:40.220
[Amit Varma]: you would know from your notes that hey, she felt the same way when she was six or she

04:19:40.220 --> 04:19:44.320
[Amit Varma]: felt the same way when she was two when you might otherwise have forgotten and it helps

04:19:44.320 --> 04:19:50.180
[Amit Varma]: you kind of get a sense of that or get a narrative of that. So this sort of examination that

04:19:50.180 --> 04:19:57.900
[Amit Varma]: you're doing, how, what was that process like when you begin to understand that aspect of

04:19:57.900 --> 04:20:02.420
[Amit Varma]: their being persons and not projects that they have an interior life of their own. You

04:20:02.420 --> 04:20:07.220
[Amit Varma]: know, at one point, you wrote about one of your kids snapping back at you when you snapped

04:20:07.220 --> 04:20:10.660
[Amit Varma]: at her, right, which took you by surprise. You're like, what, you know, because that's

04:20:10.660 --> 04:20:18.180
[Amit Varma]: not what kids do. And, you know, at different points in time, you're sort of surprised by

04:20:18.180 --> 04:20:23.780
[Amit Varma]: how kids sort of, you know, react to the world like you write about Aliza at one point quote,

04:20:23.780 --> 04:20:30.260
[Amit Varma]: she would also celebrate the world as if it had just been invented, right, which is also

04:20:30.260 --> 04:20:36.220
[Amit Varma]: charming in the sense that it also can make us reflect on our own jadedness when we see

04:20:36.220 --> 04:20:42.060
[Amit Varma]: that look of magical recognition in someone's eyes or magical curiosity. So what has that

04:20:42.060 --> 04:20:47.420
[Amit Varma]: process been like through the years that these are not just your kids, they are people they've

04:20:47.420 --> 04:20:51.580
[Amit Varma]: got interior lives of their own, they look at the world differently than you would imagine.

04:20:51.580 --> 04:20:56.740
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes they open your eyes to yourself in a way that you would not have imagined.

04:20:56.740 --> 04:21:04.620
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you've put it so well. That realization that they have interior

04:21:04.620 --> 04:21:12.020
[Guest]: lives that really came to me with our second child. I was pretty happily delusional about

04:21:12.020 --> 04:21:21.020
[Guest]: the fact that with my first born, who was this absolutely perfect baby, we had conversations

04:21:21.020 --> 04:21:28.140
[Guest]: all the time, even before she could talk. We were just always with each other. And so

04:21:28.140 --> 04:21:34.940
[Guest]: it was easy for me to believe that she was an extension of me. And my second child didn't

04:21:34.940 --> 04:21:46.380
[Guest]: look like me, didn't eat like me, and really had a mind of her own, very distinct needs,

04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:53.980
[Guest]: desires, expression from the beginning. And sometimes I would look at her and wonder how

04:21:53.980 --> 04:22:01.660
[Guest]: what was going on. There was almost like sometimes not recognition in my eyes. But it was also

04:22:01.660 --> 04:22:10.540
[Guest]: an early initiation into, you're not raising her, she's raising herself as well. And you

04:22:10.540 --> 04:22:20.060
[Guest]: might need to rethink a lot of your ideas. And I found that to be a really, really wonderful

04:22:20.060 --> 04:22:30.620
[Guest]: journey of unlearning. And, and I'm glad I, you know, my that my children challenged me

04:22:30.620 --> 04:22:36.300
[Guest]: by being different, challenged me by having a meltdown if they couldn't explain to me

04:22:36.300 --> 04:22:46.860
[Guest]: what was not okay with them. And, and, and kind of, by the third time, I was, like I

04:22:46.860 --> 04:22:51.180
[Guest]: said before, quite mellowed, and I just followed her around, I just, you know, allowed her

04:22:51.180 --> 04:22:57.420
[Guest]: to lead. Because she was so good at being a child, she was so perfect, she would, you

04:22:57.420 --> 04:23:02.620
[Guest]: feed her, you dress her, and then she follows her path, and you just have to go down with

04:23:02.620 --> 04:23:07.180
[Guest]: and there's an album in which she's walking down the road. And I'm just literally photographing

04:23:07.180 --> 04:23:12.460
[Guest]: her as she goes like a feral cat. You know, she's sitting here, she's sitting there, she's

04:23:12.460 --> 04:23:20.380
[Guest]: got food on her face, but she's absolutely at peace. And, and I, and I reached that place

04:23:20.380 --> 04:23:27.020
[Guest]: with her. The wonderful thing, Amit, is that you're going to relive it again and again

04:23:27.020 --> 04:23:39.900
[Guest]: and again. You know, the same child at 14 is writing in an essay, even those closest

04:23:39.900 --> 04:23:49.500
[Guest]: to me don't realize that I am not the same person that I was earlier. You know, so, so

04:23:49.500 --> 04:23:57.180
[Guest]: you got to catch up. It's just constantly there will be a new person. And just like

04:23:57.180 --> 04:24:03.740
[Guest]: my mother is always trying to catch up with me. And she'll often tell me, mujhe toh Instagram

04:24:03.740 --> 04:24:10.620
[Guest]: se pata chalta hai ki ab tu kya kar rahi hai. Or so and so told me that you are now doing

04:24:10.620 --> 04:24:17.900
[Guest]: this project. And, and similarly, I mean, I'm not going to have any other privilege.

04:24:17.900 --> 04:24:27.500
[Guest]: I'm also going to be following our children. And they make you realize that again and again.

04:24:27.500 --> 04:24:34.780
[Guest]: I am, because I am overconfident. So every now and then I feel like I've caught up. Now

04:24:34.780 --> 04:24:40.940
[Guest]: I'm we're on the same page, and then they're on their own meandering route. So their teenage

04:24:40.940 --> 04:24:48.940
[Guest]: years are have been very interesting, and I'm sure they'll continue to be for a while.

04:24:48.940 --> 04:24:58.940
[Guest]: And, and then in that sense, I'll just add that the unschooling life works for us. Because

04:24:58.940 --> 04:25:08.220
[Guest]: whichever way our interior life is going, we're still close by and able to find, you

04:25:08.220 --> 04:25:13.020
[Guest]: know, however much we may drift away from each other, we are able to connect again and

04:25:13.020 --> 04:25:17.740
[Guest]: again, because we're there.

04:25:17.740 --> 04:25:23.260
[Amit Varma]: This act of sort of, like, whenever we discover something new, and I guess, being a parent

04:25:23.260 --> 04:25:28.340
[Amit Varma]: is you always, once you figure out your kids aren't playthings, you're, you know, discovering

04:25:28.340 --> 04:25:33.420
[Amit Varma]: them a new at different points in time, like you said, and the typical way of trying to

04:25:33.420 --> 04:25:39.700
[Amit Varma]: understand something new is with reference to the old. And one thing that that might crop

04:25:39.700 --> 04:25:43.900
[Amit Varma]: up there, one danger of that is that you become the center of everything, like one of your

04:25:43.900 --> 04:25:47.700
[Amit Varma]: daughters warned you that it's not about you, you know, and that's a natural way of trying

04:25:47.700 --> 04:25:51.900
[Amit Varma]: to understand that somebody is melancholy at 12. And you obviously your mind will go

04:25:51.900 --> 04:25:56.460
[Amit Varma]: back to when you were melancholy at 12. You know, you'll try to figure it out that way.

04:25:56.460 --> 04:26:01.540
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes you can't, sometimes it, you know, they are individuals, they are different

04:26:01.540 --> 04:26:06.820
[Amit Varma]: from you in certain ways. They are, you know, different things are happening to them. And

04:26:06.820 --> 04:26:12.100
[Amit Varma]: sometimes you just have to kind of let it go like an absence of the ego, as it were

04:26:12.100 --> 04:26:18.180
[Amit Varma]: that you crush your ego and you let it go. And is it the case that the sort of easiness

04:26:18.180 --> 04:26:22.900
[Amit Varma]: in the parenting of your third child Naseem was because you were able to let that go?

04:26:22.900 --> 04:26:27.420
[Amit Varma]: Because when she is ambling down the road going here going this, you don't have the

04:26:27.420 --> 04:26:32.780
[Amit Varma]: instinct of saying, hey, don't go there or come in, you know, you're just watching it.

04:26:32.780 --> 04:26:37.580
[Amit Varma]: And there's a kind of love there that is, that is something pure and detached, you know,

04:26:37.580 --> 04:26:45.380
[Amit Varma]: not that the love before for the other two is any less, but this has that sort of detachment,

04:26:45.380 --> 04:26:49.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's a lovely love song by Warren's even in his last album where he speaks of

04:26:49.300 --> 04:26:52.820
[Amit Varma]: a breakup. And he's talking about this person who's left him and he's saying, I'm happy

04:26:52.820 --> 04:26:57.700
[Amit Varma]: for your happiness, you know, that situation where your ego is not kind of there.

04:26:57.700 --> 04:27:04.580
[Guest]: There's an almost, I would use the word surrender, you know, that it's really not about me, I'm

04:27:04.580 --> 04:27:11.860
[Guest]: just reveling in your presence. And that I was able to do a lot with Naseem. Also, I

04:27:11.860 --> 04:27:18.260
[Guest]: was, she's the only child after whose birth I am at home. I don't have to go back to work.

04:27:18.260 --> 04:27:24.780
[Guest]: You know, so I am, I have figured out a way to, I gave myself a year's maternity leave.

04:27:24.780 --> 04:27:32.460
[Guest]: I said, I'm your boss. Then I said, I give you another six months. Because with the other

04:27:32.460 --> 04:27:38.860
[Guest]: two, I'd been in a job and I'd got six months each. And it was great. But yeah, I was able

04:27:38.860 --> 04:27:50.020
[Guest]: to do that. And it's this whole journey is actually this conversation is kind of revealing

04:27:50.020 --> 04:27:58.020
[Guest]: so many things to me, as we talk, and especially as you comment on some of the things. So with

04:27:58.020 --> 04:28:06.620
[Guest]: the same Naseem, for example, she grows up and she does have a much more complex, you

04:28:06.620 --> 04:28:16.420
[Guest]: know, kind of interior self. And the experiences that she has in the world are not something

04:28:16.420 --> 04:28:23.180
[Guest]: that we can anticipate or imagine. And however much I try to control them, by choosing this

04:28:23.180 --> 04:28:29.460
[Guest]: school, that school, volunteering this, that, staying in touch, I am not able to. And, you

04:28:29.460 --> 04:28:34.380
[Guest]: know, it takes sometimes a year or two years before she opens up about something that hurt

04:28:34.380 --> 04:28:45.660
[Guest]: her. And it's, and I find that now. So while that will continue to happen, one will not

04:28:45.660 --> 04:28:51.780
[Guest]: always be able to, you can be there, but they will go on their own journey, they will experience

04:28:51.780 --> 04:28:57.020
[Guest]: things absolutely differently. They are living in a different world. And they have different

04:28:57.020 --> 04:29:03.300
[Guest]: sensitivities that because we may have either dulled hours, or we may not have them at all,

04:29:03.300 --> 04:29:08.460
[Guest]: we are not able to imagine. And therefore, we are not able to imagine their hurts or

04:29:08.460 --> 04:29:16.620
[Guest]: their pleasures or their joys. An aspect of this, an additional aspect of this is that

04:29:16.620 --> 04:29:26.620
[Guest]: we are almost like a team of caregivers for each other. So I get a lot of clues about

04:29:26.620 --> 04:29:35.540
[Guest]: how to respond to the youngest from the oldest. You know, I'm also watching how, with fascination

04:29:35.540 --> 04:29:41.820
[Guest]: actually, how the sisters are sometimes compensating for each other, sometimes protecting each

04:29:41.820 --> 04:29:51.300
[Guest]: other sometimes expressing to me about the other, you know, and it was in the in the

04:29:51.300 --> 04:29:59.860
[Guest]: early, early years, Naseem, she was the youngest and there were there were times when she would

04:29:59.860 --> 04:30:06.540
[Guest]: get frustrated and pick up something and attack her sisters. And it must have happened a couple

04:30:06.540 --> 04:30:10.660
[Guest]: of times when they came to me and said, well, she's misbehaving. And I would say, well,

04:30:10.660 --> 04:30:16.060
[Guest]: she's small, let it be etc. So they complained to me, they said, you never say you never

04:30:16.060 --> 04:30:21.420
[Guest]: tick her off. So I said, Oh, my God, did I make a mistake? So I take this feedback seriously.

04:30:21.420 --> 04:30:26.340
[Guest]: And the next time it happens, I tick off the little one and the little one shrivels. And

04:30:26.340 --> 04:30:32.940
[Guest]: then these two are like, how dare you do this to her? That's not what we asked you to do.

04:30:32.940 --> 04:30:41.740
[Guest]: And I'm like, okay. And in a way, that's also very reassuring. Because while I'm the irrelevant

04:30:41.740 --> 04:30:49.540
[Guest]: judge and empire, who, who should be there, but should not overdo her role. They're also

04:30:49.540 --> 04:30:57.500
[Guest]: kind of very clued into each other. And unable to support each other, you know, in the absence

04:30:57.500 --> 04:31:05.820
[Guest]: of what parents and fill fill the gaps that parents can't reach.

04:31:05.820 --> 04:31:12.100
[Amit Varma]: Also beautiful. Tell me about how you know, you're writing about them. You know, your

04:31:12.100 --> 04:31:18.380
[Amit Varma]: sort of live blogging your motherhood as it were, how that how that changes the way that

04:31:18.380 --> 04:31:23.220
[Amit Varma]: you relate to each other, like at one level, I can imagine that it's actually positive,

04:31:23.220 --> 04:31:28.580
[Amit Varma]: because you're examining yourself much more and you're being self critical and all that.

04:31:28.580 --> 04:31:33.860
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, what's, you know, another positive is that perhaps they pick that up

04:31:33.860 --> 04:31:39.220
[Amit Varma]: from you, that act of not don't just go through life like an automaton, but question everything,

04:31:39.220 --> 04:31:42.940
[Amit Varma]: think of everything, think about other people and what they are feeling and all that. So

04:31:42.940 --> 04:31:47.940
[Amit Varma]: those are great. But at the same time, then there can be this sense that or whatever we

04:31:47.940 --> 04:31:51.980
[Amit Varma]: do could be written about mama will write about this, or she'll write about that, or,

04:31:51.980 --> 04:31:57.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, they might even be sort of a performative sense to it, where they want to be recorded

04:31:57.780 --> 04:32:02.260
[Amit Varma]: in a particular way. At one point, you quote Nassim saying, quote, take a photo of me eating

04:32:02.260 --> 04:32:07.820
[Amit Varma]: butter. Right. And perhaps she was just trolling you or just being sarcastic or whatever. So

04:32:07.820 --> 04:32:12.980
[Amit Varma]: at one level, there is this heightened self awareness and empathy. But at another level

04:32:12.980 --> 04:32:20.820
[Amit Varma]: to them, you know, there might be this weariness also. So how has all of that played out?

04:32:20.820 --> 04:32:33.860
[Guest]: I have been I have, you know, I have kind of kept all of this in mind of constantly.

04:32:33.860 --> 04:32:45.220
[Guest]: And one of the one of the things that I've done is try to be as accurate as possible

04:32:45.220 --> 04:32:56.020
[Guest]: in the writing and and not try to solve problems, not not look not right to not necessarily

04:32:56.020 --> 04:33:06.100
[Guest]: close an essay, you know, not not necessarily find a closure to end an essay. And a lot

04:33:06.100 --> 04:33:11.660
[Guest]: of them just so it's it is a feedback that I get a lot like, but you just finished you

04:33:11.660 --> 04:33:21.660
[Guest]: stopped in the middle or what happened next or, you know, I want more. And I'm I'm kind

04:33:21.660 --> 04:33:26.740
[Guest]: of staying with the moment. And if there is no lesson to be drawn from it at that time,

04:33:26.740 --> 04:33:38.340
[Guest]: I won't draw it. They have always read everything that I've written. They are finicky about

04:33:38.340 --> 04:33:46.740
[Guest]: accuracy. And if I say blue, when I should have said pink, then they will, you know,

04:33:46.740 --> 04:33:52.340
[Guest]: they'll remind me and particularly if I if I've got an age wrong, if I've written 12,

04:33:52.340 --> 04:34:00.900
[Guest]: and I should have written 12.8 or I mean, any of those small details. So now, I make

04:34:00.900 --> 04:34:08.540
[Guest]: sure that I kind of ask them to proofread and to check. But there was a time when they

04:34:08.540 --> 04:34:17.540
[Guest]: were too young to do that. And so some of the ways in which I'm doing this is talking

04:34:17.540 --> 04:34:27.060
[Guest]: only about my experience or talking, you know, from a perspective of how I felt of trying

04:34:27.060 --> 04:34:33.860
[Guest]: to understand what the other may be going through without passing judgment or without

04:34:33.860 --> 04:34:46.220
[Guest]: being over sure of whatever they may be doing. And it seems to have worked in that sense.

04:34:46.220 --> 04:34:54.420
[Guest]: But there's no substitute to knowing that this is my responsibility and carrying it

04:34:54.420 --> 04:35:01.220
[Guest]: to as much of an extreme as one does. And in a sense, Amit, you know, this is about

04:35:01.220 --> 04:35:07.060
[Guest]: family, but we often write profiles of other people, you know, as writers, as journalists,

04:35:07.060 --> 04:35:12.860
[Guest]: we represent people who are, do not have access to the same platform and could not cannot

04:35:12.860 --> 04:35:21.660
[Guest]: write their own story. But their story must be told. And we and one is mindful in the

04:35:21.660 --> 04:35:27.900
[Guest]: same way that you don't want to. Your writing must not in any way be condescending. It must

04:35:27.900 --> 04:35:34.340
[Guest]: not take away the agency of the person. It must not make assumptions for them. And we

04:35:34.340 --> 04:35:39.940
[Guest]: do that simply. I mean, one of the very simple ways in which we can do that is just extreme

04:35:39.940 --> 04:35:49.940
[Guest]: accuracy, extreme accuracy to facts, to dialogues, you know, to what one felt in the moment.

04:35:49.940 --> 04:35:54.380
[Guest]: Not guessing what they may be feeling, but what I felt when I heard this or when I saw

04:35:54.380 --> 04:36:03.820
[Guest]: this. And I guess those are ways in which one has gone forward and literally never writing

04:36:03.820 --> 04:36:11.780
[Guest]: about anybody who is an adult without, you know, sending it to them, getting them to

04:36:11.780 --> 04:36:18.700
[Guest]: read it, talking to them about it, asking them about each thing and making sure that

04:36:18.700 --> 04:36:22.460
[Guest]: that is all, that is all done.

04:36:22.460 --> 04:36:28.260
[Amit Varma]: At one point you write, and this really struck me, where you say, quote, In all this, though,

04:36:28.260 --> 04:36:32.620
[Amit Varma]: there has been a most unexpected gift, the wisdom of children. Kids remind us what we

04:36:32.620 --> 04:36:37.460
[Amit Varma]: were like when we started out, what we can be like and what can be reclaimed. As Aliza

04:36:37.460 --> 04:36:41.900
[Amit Varma]: once put it gently, quote, I know everything already, but you have forgotten some things,

04:36:41.900 --> 04:36:48.300
[Amit Varma]: mama, stop quote. So tell me what you learned from your children. What did they teach you?

04:36:48.300 --> 04:37:01.580
[Guest]: Um, you know, you use the word jaded, no, the ideas of hope, justice, of just being

04:37:01.580 --> 04:37:08.060
[Guest]: nice, of being happy in the moment, all of that just kind of, you don't have to do anything,

04:37:08.060 --> 04:37:17.540
[Guest]: it just kind of begins to fall back, you know, fall by the way, in many ways, and especially

04:37:17.540 --> 04:37:24.260
[Guest]: being so much out in the world as journalists or as activists, justice is an idea that is

04:37:24.260 --> 04:37:32.020
[Guest]: very difficult to hold on to. And you almost begin to believe that, that there is no right

04:37:32.020 --> 04:37:38.340
[Guest]: that, you know, that nothing is going to go right, and I can do nothing about it. And

04:37:38.340 --> 04:37:44.020
[Guest]: really, conversations with children always remind me that there is something I can do

04:37:44.020 --> 04:37:52.300
[Guest]: about it. That there is, you know, that this is the right thing to do, and this is not.

04:37:52.300 --> 04:38:00.460
[Guest]: And I'll often kind of unravel my own doubt or dilemma with one of my daughters, especially

04:38:00.460 --> 04:38:09.380
[Guest]: the youngest, who's very good at saying, no, I think you let this be, but you do this.

04:38:09.380 --> 04:38:12.420
[Guest]: You can do this and that they will like it.

04:38:12.420 --> 04:38:14.580
[Amit Varma]: Is there an example of that you can think of?

04:38:14.580 --> 04:38:25.060
[Guest]: So I'm, you know, let's say visited a home in which, after the violence in Delhi in 2020

04:38:25.060 --> 04:38:31.300
[Guest]: in Mustafaabad, because we were also based in Delhi as a group, very quickly, we were

04:38:31.300 --> 04:38:39.420
[Guest]: able to visit some of the victims. And some of them are in shock, some of them are saying

04:38:39.420 --> 04:38:47.860
[Guest]: things that may, you know, make them look bad, or they may not want those things. It

04:38:47.860 --> 04:38:53.300
[Guest]: might be inconvenient for those things to go on record for them at a later time, because

04:38:53.300 --> 04:38:58.340
[Guest]: they need to claim compensation, or they, adults have many reasons why they may want

04:38:58.340 --> 04:39:04.500
[Guest]: to change their version of what has happened to them. And yet we need to tell the story

04:39:04.500 --> 04:39:10.740
[Guest]: because we need to tell the world that this is happening. And I'm wondering how to do

04:39:10.740 --> 04:39:16.780
[Guest]: this. And she says to me, were there any children there? And I say, yes, there were. And she

04:39:16.780 --> 04:39:23.860
[Guest]: said, what were they doing? Why can you write about that? And just like that, I'm like,

04:39:23.860 --> 04:39:33.900
[Guest]: if I just describe five children I saw in a refugee camp, I can tell this story without,

04:39:33.900 --> 04:39:39.900
[Guest]: you know, compromising anybody else. And, and it's just, just this image, because she's

04:39:39.900 --> 04:39:46.220
[Guest]: a child, she's thinking, what about the children? You know, where are they? And, and she also

04:39:46.220 --> 04:39:55.100
[Guest]: asked me what happened to their animals. And one of the women was wailing about her goat.

04:39:55.100 --> 04:40:03.860
[Guest]: She said, I went back and because I had left my goat behind, and she didn't find the goat.

04:40:03.860 --> 04:40:12.580
[Guest]: The goat was burnt to death. So, to be able to then, you know, she made me realize that

04:40:12.580 --> 04:40:21.380
[Guest]: that animal's life mattered. Because I was overwhelmed by the scale of what we had witnessed,

04:40:21.380 --> 04:40:26.460
[Guest]: and I didn't know where to start. And I didn't understand, you know, I was feeling like,

04:40:26.460 --> 04:40:33.900
[Guest]: I don't have the tools to do this. And she just kind of took me, a little bit held my

04:40:33.900 --> 04:40:37.540
[Guest]: hand and took me there.

04:40:37.540 --> 04:40:42.300
[Amit Varma]: So there's a lovely post where you speak about the lessons you learned from parenthood. And

04:40:42.300 --> 04:40:45.980
[Amit Varma]: again, I won't read it all out. Because if I wanted to quote the memorable bits, I'd

04:40:45.980 --> 04:40:51.740
[Amit Varma]: have to read the whole damn thing out. But so it'll be in the show notes. But these are

04:40:51.740 --> 04:40:56.620
[Amit Varma]: sort of the bullet points. And there are like five of them. And the first is trust children.

04:40:56.620 --> 04:41:03.740
[Amit Varma]: Two, let your children protect you. Three, accept kids gratitude. Four, ask children

04:41:03.740 --> 04:41:10.620
[Amit Varma]: for help. And five, love yourself like you love your child. And actually, I think these

04:41:10.620 --> 04:41:15.020
[Amit Varma]: are all worth elaborating upon because they're all so interesting. So let's start with trust

04:41:15.020 --> 04:41:17.020
[Amit Varma]: children.

04:41:17.020 --> 04:41:32.180
[Guest]: Yeah. I wish that when my parents felt lost as, you know, now I look back at them when

04:41:32.180 --> 04:41:37.980
[Guest]: they were raising us and we were eight, nine or 10. And they were like in their early 30s.

04:41:37.980 --> 04:41:44.340
[Guest]: And you know, a person in their early 30s at this, you know, in this generation has

04:41:44.340 --> 04:41:52.060
[Guest]: no particular responsibilities. Most of the time, we remember how much support we had

04:41:52.060 --> 04:42:00.260
[Guest]: and how little they did. But I, you know, I wish that when they were in that kind of

04:42:00.260 --> 04:42:08.460
[Guest]: lost vulnerable time, that they were, that they could turn to us and, and allow us to

04:42:08.460 --> 04:42:16.020
[Guest]: help them or, or be, you know, be able to know that we would be fine with that, that

04:42:16.020 --> 04:42:22.540
[Guest]: they that they that we had some tools that the children actually have a lot to contribute

04:42:22.540 --> 04:42:29.700
[Guest]: to the family, particularly and to their parents well being also that it's not a one way street.

04:42:29.700 --> 04:42:41.020
[Guest]: And from with my children, I was able to learn that. And, you know, this, this calling out

04:42:41.020 --> 04:42:48.740
[Guest]: is something that my children do a fair bit. And I and I know that they are able to do

04:42:48.740 --> 04:42:55.940
[Guest]: it because we don't quash their voices, you know, we do not react with how dare you speak

04:42:55.940 --> 04:43:04.460
[Guest]: to me like that. We, whatever we do at that moment, if I'm able to then write about it,

04:43:04.460 --> 04:43:13.940
[Guest]: you know, they know that I've taken it seriously. And I've, so yeah, to trust that they have

04:43:13.940 --> 04:43:22.940
[Guest]: mechanisms by which they can cope. And that they, you know, if you're just there, they

04:43:22.940 --> 04:43:31.780
[Guest]: will know when to ask for help. And that they can help you when you need help. That all

04:43:31.780 --> 04:43:34.060
[Amit Varma]: three of those.

04:43:34.060 --> 04:43:36.100
[Amit Varma]: Let your children protect you.

04:43:36.100 --> 04:43:38.540
[Guest]: Yeah, pretty, pretty much.

04:43:38.540 --> 04:43:43.340
[Amit Varma]: Pretty much. Yeah. Except kids gratitude.

04:43:43.340 --> 04:43:50.820
[Guest]: Yeah. I find that that is something that we make, we really make this mistake a lot. You

04:43:50.820 --> 04:43:58.420
[Guest]: know, we repeat these platitudes that we have inherited that are part of popular culture.

04:43:58.420 --> 04:44:04.700
[Guest]: Kitna, kitna shatir hai, she's so clever, she's always trying to get something out of

04:44:04.700 --> 04:44:16.060
[Guest]: me. To see children as manipulative is the popular narrative. And that is so rude and

04:44:16.060 --> 04:44:24.780
[Guest]: inaccurate, both towards them, and towards the family itself. And we totally confuse

04:44:24.780 --> 04:44:30.740
[Guest]: our children. You know, so when they do express gratitude, we'll be like, oh, he wants something

04:44:30.740 --> 04:44:37.740
[Guest]: more from me. That's why he's being kind to me. And I've watched that constantly, particularly

04:44:37.740 --> 04:44:43.860
[Guest]: when you're part of a large family, and you know, you have extended family get togethers.

04:44:43.860 --> 04:44:52.860
[Guest]: And you'll be, it's so hurtful and so sad to see how moments of gratitude are just destroyed

04:44:52.860 --> 04:45:00.540
[Guest]: to the point that that person is confused about themselves. They can only see themselves

04:45:00.540 --> 04:45:06.780
[Guest]: after a point. They do have a very strong sense of self, but it gets overwhelmed by

04:45:06.780 --> 04:45:15.140
[Guest]: what their adults tell them they are. It, you know, it just sits on top of it. And there

04:45:15.140 --> 04:45:22.980
[Guest]: are fights I remember in which I have started with saying to my father, holding my ground

04:45:22.980 --> 04:45:29.820
[Guest]: and saying, I want this. But if, you know, if an adult is constantly telling you that

04:45:29.820 --> 04:45:36.260
[Guest]: you're selfish, you'll say, that may be selfish, but I'll still do it. And what have you done?

04:45:36.260 --> 04:45:41.980
[Guest]: You may do what you want, but you've internalized that you're a bad person. And why would we

04:45:41.980 --> 04:45:49.100
[Guest]: do that to our children? And you know, and then they're just going to play that role.

04:45:49.100 --> 04:45:53.700
[Amit Varma]: Your fourth point is ask children for help, which you've already sort of elaborated upon.

04:45:53.700 --> 04:45:59.540
[Amit Varma]: Fifth one is interesting. And I think one that can be sort of forgotten or not considered,

04:45:59.540 --> 04:46:04.740
[Amit Varma]: which is love yourself like you love your child. Right. And, you know, you've spoken

04:46:04.740 --> 04:46:12.140
[Amit Varma]: elsewhere about how, you know, in a different generation in a different context, you know,

04:46:12.140 --> 04:46:16.060
[Amit Varma]: self sacrifice can be celebrated. You have a line somewhere in a different context where

04:46:16.060 --> 04:46:20.620
[Amit Varma]: you say that, quote, there are those who will celebrate the sacrifice of women. I insist

04:46:20.620 --> 04:46:24.620
[Amit Varma]: on calling out abuse, top quote, which is, I mean, it's a different context, nothing

04:46:24.620 --> 04:46:30.740
[Amit Varma]: to do with motherhood there. But I think something that a lot of people don't, and I'm sure especially

04:46:30.740 --> 04:46:35.180
[Amit Varma]: women don't do, is be kind to themselves, that they get into that role of motherhood

04:46:35.180 --> 04:46:38.580
[Amit Varma]: and you're sacrificing everything and you're, you know, you're making the food for your

04:46:38.580 --> 04:46:43.620
[Amit Varma]: husband and you're doing all the unpaid labor and then you're looking after the kids and

04:46:43.620 --> 04:46:50.260
[Amit Varma]: it's, you know, and there's a lament there that a lifetime can go by, that having a kid

04:46:50.260 --> 04:46:55.220
[Amit Varma]: is like the end of your life. Everything is over. You know, 25 years later, when the kids

04:46:55.220 --> 04:47:01.980
[Amit Varma]: have grown up, you're too tired, there's nothing left. It's too bitter. Yeah. How do you reclaim

04:47:01.980 --> 04:47:08.620
[Guest]: yourself if that self, you know, you have not preserved that self in some corner, even

04:47:08.620 --> 04:47:17.900
[Guest]: when you were not able to care for yourself openly, if that's, you know, that, that energy

04:47:17.900 --> 04:47:26.820
[Guest]: is destroyed or written over by bitterness and anger and, you know, all of these unexpressed

04:47:26.820 --> 04:47:34.140
[Guest]: and negativities, then when the time comes when you can reclaim your creative energy,

04:47:34.140 --> 04:47:48.340
[Guest]: it's, it's not there anymore. And my worry for Sudha, my mother, was that she didn't

04:47:48.340 --> 04:47:58.420
[Guest]: have time for herself. And when she was neglecting herself, I was neglecting myself as her daughter.

04:47:58.420 --> 04:48:06.740
[Guest]: And, and you really can't love your child unless you're loving yourself. And now, and

04:48:06.740 --> 04:48:13.580
[Guest]: I think that she's able to be such a wonderful grandmother and such a support to me as an

04:48:13.580 --> 04:48:19.860
[Guest]: adult daughter is because she preserved that part of her and now we're just seeing her

04:48:19.860 --> 04:48:27.700
[Guest]: blossom. You know, when she has time and resources and she's not depleted by having to care for

04:48:27.700 --> 04:48:29.020
[Amit Varma]: others.

04:48:29.020 --> 04:48:33.020
[Amit Varma]: I think a great metaphor for this just thinking aloud is what they say on aeroplanes right

04:48:33.020 --> 04:48:37.340
[Amit Varma]: if there's a pressure problem and the oxygen mask, they come down first put your own mask

04:48:37.340 --> 04:48:42.220
[Amit Varma]: before the other person. Yeah, because otherwise you may be able to do neither. Yeah, it really

04:48:42.220 --> 04:48:50.380
[Amit Varma]: is. Yeah. So tell me about now the whole decision of unschooling in the sense where you've already

04:48:50.380 --> 04:48:54.180
[Amit Varma]: spoken near the start of the episode about why you decided to do that the problems with

04:48:54.180 --> 04:48:58.980
[Amit Varma]: school and so on and so forth. But you know, how did the girls adapt to it? What does it

04:48:58.980 --> 04:49:02.540
[Amit Varma]: really involve? Because a lot of people listening to this must be like, you know, they would

04:49:02.540 --> 04:49:08.340
[Amit Varma]: have heard of homeschooling as some something that, you know, eccentric Americans do over

04:49:08.340 --> 04:49:14.020
[Amit Varma]: there and individual freedom and blah, blah, blah. But over here in India, tell me a little

04:49:14.020 --> 04:49:18.900
[Amit Varma]: bit about the community of homeschoolers or unschoolers, as you put it out here. And,

04:49:18.900 --> 04:49:23.060
[Amit Varma]: you know, how long did it take you to come to that decision? And what has the experience

04:49:23.060 --> 04:49:30.340
[Guest]: been like? How are your girls taken to it? So I'd always been curious about homeschooling.

04:49:30.340 --> 04:49:40.700
[Guest]: But we kind of seriously began to reread about it when our middle child was very distressed

04:49:40.700 --> 04:49:47.020
[Guest]: about being able to go to school. And it had nothing to do with academics. She continued

04:49:47.020 --> 04:49:52.460
[Guest]: to be involved with academics and be very excited about learning. It had much more to

04:49:52.460 --> 04:50:01.620
[Guest]: do with not being able to cope with the socialization and the social aspect of school. And much

04:50:01.620 --> 04:50:06.540
[Guest]: later, two years later, when our younger child also opted out of school, it was the same

04:50:06.540 --> 04:50:14.460
[Guest]: thing. She loved the structure of school. She loved, you know, what she was learning

04:50:14.460 --> 04:50:21.220
[Guest]: over there. But what was happening when the teacher was not in class or how the teacher

04:50:21.220 --> 04:50:29.860
[Guest]: was reacting when she was not at her best moment, and those became very difficult for

04:50:29.860 --> 04:50:41.820
[Guest]: her. And that's when we went and attended a Learning Societies Unconference in 2017

04:50:41.820 --> 04:50:51.100
[Guest]: in Bangalore at the end of the year in Bangalore. And we found, you know, a large network of

04:50:51.100 --> 04:50:56.420
[Guest]: families and people, not necessarily all of them were families. There were lots of young

04:50:56.420 --> 04:51:03.180
[Guest]: people, a lot of single people, a lot of elderly people, people whose children were in school

04:51:03.180 --> 04:51:12.980
[Guest]: or had opted out completely. And also people who had chosen farming or forest life, you

04:51:12.980 --> 04:51:20.340
[Guest]: know, living away from the urban grid, in a sense. So they come together and through

04:51:20.340 --> 04:51:27.700
[Guest]: over five days through various activities and various kind of loose ways of meeting

04:51:27.700 --> 04:51:34.180
[Guest]: each other and exchanging information and sharing things with each other, you kind of

04:51:34.180 --> 04:51:40.660
[Guest]: discover that there are so many other ways in which people are living their lives. There

04:51:40.660 --> 04:51:47.100
[Guest]: are so many other ways in which people are learning whatever they want to do, how they're

04:51:47.100 --> 04:51:54.100
[Guest]: combining their passions with something that is also financially viable for their family.

04:51:54.100 --> 04:52:04.980
[Guest]: And so it was for the first time we were able to see that it can be done. And that these

04:52:04.980 --> 04:52:12.460
[Guest]: are not, you know, people on the margins of society or like highly unconventional people.

04:52:12.460 --> 04:52:20.780
[Guest]: They were just like us. Many of them had, you know, very conventional jobs themselves.

04:52:20.780 --> 04:52:27.260
[Guest]: But for various reasons, they were responding to their children's need to learn in a certain

04:52:27.260 --> 04:52:33.420
[Guest]: way. And it's both kinds of children. Some children are learning beyond their years or

04:52:33.420 --> 04:52:40.140
[Guest]: they have special interests that school is not covering. Or some children are, you know,

04:52:40.140 --> 04:52:48.020
[Guest]: learning at a very different pace. And how can we make space for the individual needs

04:52:48.020 --> 04:52:56.860
[Guest]: of children? And by that time, our daughters were 12, 9 and 14. So we had to some extent

04:52:56.860 --> 04:53:04.380
[Guest]: matured as parents. We recognized that each one has a very different energy level, has

04:53:04.380 --> 04:53:16.660
[Guest]: a very different need for physical, analytical activities, and also socializes in a very

04:53:16.660 --> 04:53:24.500
[Guest]: particular way, and is getting overwhelmed or traumatized by certain set patterns. So

04:53:24.500 --> 04:53:30.620
[Guest]: how can we figure this out? And I also then began when I came back from there, I read

04:53:30.620 --> 04:53:39.740
[Guest]: a lot of blogs by families. And some of the ones that I found very resonant were South

04:53:39.740 --> 04:53:47.380
[Guest]: African, you know, women in South Africa, who had written about their families. And

04:53:47.380 --> 04:53:56.180
[Guest]: then I began to kind of pick up words like unschooling, like digital natives, you know,

04:53:56.180 --> 04:54:01.740
[Guest]: these children who are born in the internet age, parents who have been through schooling

04:54:01.740 --> 04:54:08.620
[Guest]: and need to go through a de-schooling process to be able to understand because we may say,

04:54:08.620 --> 04:54:14.460
[Guest]: okay, you don't have to go to school, but we can end up, you know, recreating the same

04:54:14.460 --> 04:54:20.300
[Guest]: oppressive expectations in the home, just because you're not going to school, you still

04:54:20.300 --> 04:54:25.460
[Guest]: have to wake up, you still have to do your assignments at a certain pace, and stuff like

04:54:25.460 --> 04:54:36.500
[Guest]: that. And I read a lot of, a lot of parents, I saw a few videos, and I kind of came back

04:54:36.500 --> 04:54:41.780
[Guest]: and whoever I had heard about, I read what, you know, what they had created. And I guess

04:54:41.780 --> 04:54:46.220
[Guest]: that's, that's my self learning, I'll just kind of go into a topic and then read everything

04:54:46.220 --> 04:54:55.580
[Guest]: that I can find on it. And, and then I realized that all our confusions, all our inabilities,

04:54:55.580 --> 04:55:03.420
[Guest]: all our doubts about what is the next best step is, is really literally part of the process.

04:55:03.420 --> 04:55:10.140
[Guest]: It's letting go, it's going to be a time of unlearning, a time for all of us to let go

04:55:10.140 --> 04:55:16.900
[Guest]: of many of the expectations, primarily that you have to make children go through a certain

04:55:16.900 --> 04:55:23.260
[Guest]: grind for them to become functional adults. And you know, that the fallacy of that, that

04:55:23.260 --> 04:55:29.340
[Guest]: you can let them, you can, you can let them be who they are, let them claim their agency,

04:55:29.340 --> 04:55:34.500
[Guest]: and that they will figure out a way. And also, then you kind of look back at your own life,

04:55:34.500 --> 04:55:41.020
[Guest]: you look back at your own choices. Why did I quit full time work? How did I become a,

04:55:41.020 --> 04:55:48.460
[Guest]: you know, a self taught entrepreneur or a writer? And how many projects did I start

04:55:48.460 --> 04:55:55.980
[Guest]: and stop? What, where are my own life's learnings coming from? And you discover that many of

04:55:55.980 --> 04:56:02.660
[Guest]: us are unschoolers by nature, you know, that many of us, we've gone through what we had

04:56:02.660 --> 04:56:13.700
[Guest]: to go through, and then try to reinvent, rediscover, recreate ourself. And there's a lot of, there's

04:56:13.700 --> 04:56:19.780
[Guest]: a lot of reclaiming of self esteem. There's a lot of reparenting of yourself that that,

04:56:19.780 --> 04:56:25.100
[Guest]: you know, we do through our middle years, sometimes with therapy, sometimes with other

04:56:25.100 --> 04:56:32.420
[Guest]: forms of self help, through our own communities. And why do we have to follow the same pattern

04:56:32.420 --> 04:56:41.020
[Guest]: with children? Why, you know, why can we not let them kind of walk into the same claiming

04:56:41.020 --> 04:56:48.260
[Guest]: of their agency at an earlier age? And it seems like a radical idea. It's a very, but

04:56:48.260 --> 04:56:54.300
[Guest]: it's not, I don't think it is. It's not easy to live with. Because suddenly you're like,

04:56:54.300 --> 04:57:04.020
[Guest]: do I wake them up or not? Do we still eat together or not? How much fixation on a particular

04:57:04.020 --> 04:57:12.220
[Guest]: interest is too much? You know, if they are not exercising at all, then, you know, when

04:57:12.220 --> 04:57:17.460
[Guest]: do you intervene? When do you not intervene? And, and it, it really does then became a

04:57:17.460 --> 04:57:24.420
[Guest]: time of looking at your own life, your own choices, your own exercise routine, you know,

04:57:24.420 --> 04:57:35.020
[Guest]: you're, and, and learning to be far more accepting of the ways in which we are unique. And, and,

04:57:35.020 --> 04:57:40.420
[Guest]: and I think the one of the finest part of, of this whole unschooling journey has been

04:57:40.420 --> 04:57:47.300
[Guest]: reclaiming my own uniqueness. You know, it's not just something I'm doing for my children.

04:57:47.300 --> 04:57:56.540
[Guest]: It's, it's something that I'm also doing for myself. I'm, I am being able to see why I'm

04:57:56.540 --> 04:58:02.780
[Guest]: good at, you know, a certain kind of interaction. Why I'm not so good at a certain kind of meeting?

04:58:02.780 --> 04:58:07.220
[Guest]: What kind of choices do I need to make? What kind of ideas about myself can I now just

04:58:07.220 --> 04:58:15.780
[Guest]: let go of? You know, it's, it's not necessary for me to prove to anybody, or to myself,

04:58:15.780 --> 04:58:22.860
[Guest]: that I, you know, have certain efficiencies, I don't have so many. And, and when I accept

04:58:22.860 --> 04:58:30.740
[Guest]: that in myself, I will let my children explore it in themselves. And so in that sense, it's,

04:58:30.740 --> 04:58:38.740
[Guest]: it's an ongoing journey. And it's, it can be chaotic, but it's also very liberating.

04:58:38.740 --> 04:58:43.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's so fascinating. And, you know, just thinking aloud, it seems to me that this

04:58:43.940 --> 04:58:49.540
[Amit Varma]: is both not, this is both radical and not radical, as you said, at the same time, and

04:58:49.540 --> 04:58:55.060
[Amit Varma]: radical, perhaps in the sense that it seems to go against the, the conventional structure

04:58:55.060 --> 04:58:59.860
[Amit Varma]: of how you do schooling and all of that, but not radical, because if I think back on myself,

04:58:59.860 --> 04:59:04.980
[Amit Varma]: to, you know, to use that phrase of yours, which I will presumably use all the time now,

04:59:04.980 --> 04:59:08.820
[Amit Varma]: I'm also an unschooler by nature. Therefore, you know, I learned absolutely nothing in

04:59:08.820 --> 04:59:14.020
[Amit Varma]: school and college. I almost made it a point not to out of rebellion. But everything that

04:59:14.020 --> 04:59:19.300
[Amit Varma]: I learned, and like, I still take great joy in learning, I try to systematize what I'm

04:59:19.300 --> 04:59:25.380
[Amit Varma]: learning, get to first principles and figure stuff out. And I think that that's a beautiful

04:59:25.380 --> 04:59:31.700
[Amit Varma]: way to learn. And I think where parents can perhaps come in is that if I look at my own

04:59:31.700 --> 04:59:38.020
[Amit Varma]: weakness, as a middle aged unschooler, my weaknesses, or where I fall short, I fall

04:59:38.020 --> 04:59:43.300
[Amit Varma]: short in things like a mainly in terms of discipline, but I can imagine other areas

04:59:43.300 --> 04:59:48.260
[Amit Varma]: where other people fall short. And I guess if you're working with, you know, teenagers,

04:59:48.260 --> 04:59:54.100
[Amit Varma]: then what parents can do is just be, just help them with those weaknesses, which they'll

04:59:54.100 --> 04:59:59.540
[Amit Varma]: also recognize and want to change as I do, but not push them along paths that may not

04:59:59.540 --> 05:00:04.180
[Amit Varma]: be meant for them, which, you know, takes up so much time and psychic energy away. So,

05:00:04.180 --> 05:00:09.460
[Amit Varma]: you know, perhaps they don't have to suffer as we did. Yeah. And I mean, there's so many

05:00:09.460 --> 05:00:16.340
[Guest]: things that we become ready to learn at very different times in our life. You know, so

05:00:16.340 --> 05:00:23.460
[Guest]: as a camera person, in a news organization, I was extremely disciplined, I was always

05:00:23.460 --> 05:00:31.540
[Guest]: on time, I could work for hours on end, I, I, you know, I could, I, I won't say I was

05:00:31.540 --> 05:00:38.900
[Guest]: not hungry, but I was able to work on an empty stomach for, for, for hours on end, it took

05:00:38.900 --> 05:00:44.580
[Guest]: a toll on my body, eventually, it was something that I loved to do for eight years, and then

05:00:44.580 --> 05:00:50.580
[Guest]: I didn't want to do for another day of my life. And that was fine. You know, and then

05:00:51.300 --> 05:00:59.060
[Guest]: I did something else. And I'm glad that, you know, and we grew up in a time when you had

05:00:59.060 --> 05:01:06.100
[Guest]: to, you had to choose one thing. And that was perhaps okay, for my father's generation,

05:01:06.100 --> 05:01:10.900
[Guest]: where you were an engineer, and then you remained an engineer for life, or I don't think that

05:01:10.900 --> 05:01:15.620
[Guest]: it's true for anyone. I mean, he's a very keen gardener, I have an uncle who's an engineer

05:01:15.620 --> 05:01:21.300
[Guest]: who builds the furniture in his house. You know, there are so many of these talents that

05:01:21.300 --> 05:01:27.220
[Guest]: we claim at different times in our life. So many people start painting in their middle

05:01:27.220 --> 05:01:34.900
[Guest]: years or learn a musical instrument. And it's not like they wasted early years or this whole

05:01:34.900 --> 05:01:41.300
[Guest]: idea, you know, you you made that analogy very early you you spoke about schooling being

05:01:41.300 --> 05:01:47.140
[Guest]: something that was relevant at a time when you wanted to create workers for industries.

05:01:48.020 --> 05:01:53.540
[Guest]: And look how far we have come from there. We are you know, we are in a time of the gig

05:01:53.540 --> 05:02:00.100
[Guest]: economy, we are at a time when you can make a living out of being an artist, you can make

05:02:00.100 --> 05:02:06.420
[Guest]: a living out of exploring your own talents at different times in your life. I know young people

05:02:07.300 --> 05:02:15.060
[Guest]: who, you know, come out of college and love trekking, and within two or three years,

05:02:15.060 --> 05:02:22.580
[Guest]: they are earning enough from their passion to be able to fuel some other passion of theirs.

05:02:22.580 --> 05:02:26.980
[Guest]: And all of these things in conventional terms are called, you know,

05:02:28.500 --> 05:02:32.420
[Guest]: are, we have very perjurative terms for them, when will you settle down?

05:02:32.980 --> 05:02:38.500
[Guest]: Aise kap tak chalega? What will you do in your old age? Stuff like that. But we know,

05:02:38.500 --> 05:02:45.380
[Guest]: we I mean, you, you came into podcasting, you know, so late, and you've stuck it out.

05:02:45.380 --> 05:02:51.540
[Guest]: And who's to say you don't have discipline? I mean, imagine the kind of discipline with which

05:02:51.540 --> 05:02:58.500
[Guest]: you've completed that. So a lot of times when I'm having a conversation with other adults about

05:02:58.500 --> 05:03:04.900
[Guest]: unschooling, and you know, it's it's a shocking idea, and they'll try to make me understand what

05:03:04.900 --> 05:03:10.900
[Guest]: perhaps I'm losing out by making a choice like that. But we always go to, okay, let's look at

05:03:10.900 --> 05:03:17.460
[Guest]: our choices. Let's look at when you changed your subject or what you did with what you studied in

05:03:17.460 --> 05:03:22.260
[Guest]: school? Or when did you switch careers? Or what is it that you've discovered you're good at?

05:03:23.220 --> 05:03:33.140
[Guest]: And what a flexible time we are living in, you know, where, where you can really do

05:03:33.860 --> 05:03:38.740
[Guest]: multiple things at the same time. I mean, yeah, we should be a little careful about

05:03:38.740 --> 05:03:46.020
[Guest]: doing too many once in a while. But it is, we are kind of in a time where we can realise

05:03:46.020 --> 05:03:53.140
[Guest]: we can realise so many of our dreams, and still be able to put food on the table.

05:03:54.020 --> 05:03:59.620
[Guest]: And the new generation is going to invent so many newer ways of living.

05:04:00.740 --> 05:04:04.900
[Amit Varma]: As Tolkien said, all those who wander are not lost. And in fact, if you don't wonder,

05:04:04.900 --> 05:04:10.660
[Amit Varma]: you're probably lost in this day and age. I want to talk about writing now. And I absolutely

05:04:10.660 --> 05:04:14.420
[Amit Varma]: loved the epigraph at the start of your first book, where you write quote,

05:04:14.420 --> 05:04:19.860
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to be all of myself at the same time. So I wrote wrote wrote myself into fullness.

05:04:19.860 --> 05:04:24.660
[Amit Varma]: Stop good, beautiful. And it just so ties into that the theme of journaling,

05:04:24.660 --> 05:04:28.340
[Amit Varma]: which we mentioned earlier as a way of discovering and shaping yourself.

05:04:28.340 --> 05:04:33.700
[Amit Varma]: And elsewhere, you have written quote, I write to see myself through the tunnel of darkness.

05:04:33.700 --> 05:04:38.980
[Amit Varma]: I write myself out of the bottomless well, I sort out my position and my feelings by writing about

05:04:38.980 --> 05:04:45.460
[Amit Varma]: them. I write also to make place for love. This is important, stop good. And these are reasons for

05:04:45.460 --> 05:04:50.980
[Amit Varma]: writing and perhaps some of them might even be kind of post facto. And you've written eloquently

05:04:50.980 --> 05:04:57.460
[Amit Varma]: about all of this about, you know, the importance of sharing writing for a very personal reason to

05:04:57.460 --> 05:05:02.260
[Amit Varma]: connect yourself to your mother and understand that better. What I'm interested in particularly

05:05:02.820 --> 05:05:08.900
[Amit Varma]: is how you sort of taught yourself the craft of writing. Because when I'm reading something by

05:05:08.900 --> 05:05:12.980
[Amit Varma]: you as a reader, I never noticed the writing, which is, you know, the best compliment I can

05:05:12.980 --> 05:05:20.740
[Amit Varma]: give, obviously, as you know, and how did you arrive at, you know, being able to write in that

05:05:20.740 --> 05:05:28.260
[Amit Varma]: easy, straightforward, lucid way? You know, what was that process like of finding that voice?

05:05:28.260 --> 05:05:39.780
[Guest]: I did, I did blog for, for some time, I, I've learned actually to see that as part of the process

05:05:41.780 --> 05:05:50.340
[Guest]: in especially because my blog continues to stand where it, where I first created it. And it's as

05:05:50.340 --> 05:05:59.220
[Guest]: raw and unprocessed as it was always in the, you know, as I had created it. And I can't say that I

05:05:59.220 --> 05:06:08.820
[Guest]: did anything conscious to learn craft. I did gravitate towards certain writers in this

05:06:08.820 --> 05:06:16.980
[Guest]: horrendous school of mine, this amazing school of mine that I went to the best part of the school

05:06:16.980 --> 05:06:26.820
[Guest]: was a library. It had there was a huge basement library, and a very kind librarian who did not

05:06:26.820 --> 05:06:32.660
[Guest]: call you out if she found that you were spending a period in the library when you were supposed to

05:06:32.660 --> 05:06:42.180
[Guest]: be in some other class, she allowed you to do that. And this school library of mine gave me

05:06:42.180 --> 05:06:52.740
[Guest]: gave me access to many writers that, that I would not have been able that that would neither part

05:06:52.740 --> 05:06:59.380
[Guest]: of the syllabus and certainly in my home, where we didn't have a lot of books, we only had Reader's

05:06:59.380 --> 05:07:08.980
[Guest]: Digest. We, we, you know, I would not have been able to get access to. And what I began to read

05:07:08.980 --> 05:07:14.100
[Guest]: from the library, some of some significant things I read, this is the age of 15 and 16,

05:07:15.060 --> 05:07:23.860
[Guest]: black American poets. So who are writing, you know, almost in a haiku style in these very,

05:07:23.860 --> 05:07:32.900
[Guest]: very short sentences, like who were the memorable ones? Richard Wright is one Langston Hughes is

05:07:32.900 --> 05:07:40.260
[Guest]: Langston Hughes is another one. And then there was there was a copy of Cyrano de Bergerac.

05:07:41.140 --> 05:07:48.340
[Guest]: And I was just fascinated by this character. And I think I've borrowed it week after week after

05:07:48.340 --> 05:07:54.820
[Guest]: week and then found a copy of it in a bookshop and just managed to buy it with some birthday

05:07:54.820 --> 05:08:02.100
[Guest]: money so that I always had a copy of Cyrano de Bergerac. We we had access to Time and Newsweek

05:08:02.100 --> 05:08:06.980
[Guest]: then I became as soon as I went to college, I became a member of the British Library as well

05:08:06.980 --> 05:08:14.660
[Guest]: as the American Center Library, as well as the IP College Library, and continued to read. And

05:08:15.380 --> 05:08:23.860
[Guest]: I would I would say John Steinbeck and J.D. Salinger would be two very strong

05:08:23.860 --> 05:08:32.180
[Guest]: influences. And Sweet Thursday is one of Steinbeck's books, lesser known books that I have

05:08:32.180 --> 05:08:39.460
[Guest]: read many times over. And if you if you look at it, it's so unconventionally written. There are

05:08:39.460 --> 05:08:45.620
[Guest]: different chapters written in different voices, some of which I could not understand because

05:08:45.620 --> 05:08:53.860
[Guest]: he was using a southern accent of a homeless black person. And I just couldn't make any head

05:08:53.860 --> 05:09:00.820
[Guest]: or tail of it. But I would. But I knew I could kind of hold on to that book and over the years

05:09:00.820 --> 05:09:10.820
[Guest]: understand it. The extraordinary authenticity of the voice of Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the

05:09:10.820 --> 05:09:18.500
[Guest]: in Catcher in the Rye. I mean, here's sure you're using a young narrator's voice,

05:09:18.500 --> 05:09:25.700
[Guest]: the writer's doing that. But he's also breaking all the rules of writing, you know, the kind of

05:09:25.700 --> 05:09:32.420
[Guest]: abuse words that are being used, the kind of expression that he's using, the kind of repetitive

05:09:32.420 --> 05:09:38.820
[Guest]: way or the meandering way in which he's writing. And because that worked for me, I think what I

05:09:38.820 --> 05:09:44.900
[Guest]: did with some of these and they were they were they were great writers. Right. So what I may

05:09:44.900 --> 05:09:51.860
[Guest]: have done for myself subconsciously is give myself the permission to write similarly. And in a sense,

05:09:51.860 --> 05:09:59.700
[Guest]: what you are then giving up is the fear of, you know, not writing in the way that is supposed to

05:09:59.700 --> 05:10:06.340
[Guest]: be good writing, because certainly Holden Caulfield's voice will not fall in that category.

05:10:06.340 --> 05:10:15.300
[Guest]: To Kill a Mockingbird was this was a book that I also read again and again. So not just for the

05:10:15.300 --> 05:10:22.100
[Guest]: story or the plot, which, of course, spoke to me. On the first page of Kill a Mockingbird,

05:10:22.100 --> 05:10:28.660
[Guest]: Jem is 12 years old and he breaks his arm. And I was 12 years old and I, you know, was going

05:10:28.660 --> 05:10:37.300
[Guest]: through all of these injuries, similar to Jem. And so it's just crazy how some books will speak to

05:10:37.300 --> 05:10:46.100
[Guest]: you. Alice Walker, I picked up The Color Purple recently, and I was so shocked to find out that

05:10:46.100 --> 05:10:53.620
[Guest]: I had read this book when I was 16. And, you know, when I read it, my first instinct was put this

05:10:53.620 --> 05:10:59.300
[Guest]: away so your daughters don't pick it up. And I said, well, I read it in class 11. And, you know,

05:10:59.300 --> 05:11:07.220
[Guest]: there's rape, there's incest, there's, there's abuse. There's so much trauma in that. And but

05:11:07.220 --> 05:11:12.980
[Guest]: look at the voice that Alice Walker is using. She's, she's, it's not a, you know, the narrator.

05:11:13.940 --> 05:11:21.140
[Guest]: She's not even able to put two perfect sentences together. And I guess what you get from there

05:11:21.140 --> 05:11:31.700
[Guest]: is then the confidence to tell your story in your voice and not worry about, you know, whether it's

05:11:31.700 --> 05:11:40.340
[Guest]: well crafted or not well crafted, so long as it's, it speaks, you know, it expresses what you want

05:11:40.340 --> 05:11:48.180
[Guest]: to say. And it, it moves you in some way to put it out there. And this blog of mine that I

05:11:48.180 --> 05:11:54.820
[Guest]: mentioned, so it was, you know, I started it when my middle daughter is two years old, one year old.

05:11:55.460 --> 05:12:01.620
[Guest]: This is before I've quit my job. And in the first entry is, I have two amazing children and a

05:12:01.620 --> 05:12:09.860
[Guest]: wonderful marriage. I mean, I have a job that I love. These two loves are clashing with each other,

05:12:09.860 --> 05:12:16.820
[Guest]: what am I going to do about it, we'll find out. And then entry after entry, I'm trying to solve

05:12:16.820 --> 05:12:23.300
[Guest]: that problem. At some point, I quit. And then I carry on with the deconstruction of myself and

05:12:24.020 --> 05:12:30.740
[Guest]: picking myself off the floor, you know, in my second life post that job.

05:12:32.340 --> 05:12:37.460
[Guest]: But I think that it's like a practice ground, because I didn't open that to anyone to read.

05:12:38.740 --> 05:12:44.900
[Guest]: Again, what I was doing was perhaps just cultivating, you know, keeping giving myself

05:12:44.900 --> 05:12:52.100
[Guest]: a safe space to be fearless. So as you know, because no one is going to read it, so I'm

05:12:52.100 --> 05:13:00.580
[Guest]: literally writing as if no one will ever read it. And therefore, I can let it let all the ugliness

05:13:00.580 --> 05:13:05.700
[Guest]: also come out, I don't have to be afraid of either being judged or offending someone.

05:13:05.700 --> 05:13:16.100
[Guest]: And, and just continuing to do that, to the point where I start to get read, and I learn from the

05:13:16.100 --> 05:13:23.300
[Guest]: readers that it seems to resonate. And then I just kind of build on that with time. And I was just

05:13:23.300 --> 05:13:29.700
[Guest]: sharing with somebody recently with one of the writers in my memoir that I to this day, I don't

05:13:29.700 --> 05:13:36.740
[Guest]: know, when I write and I send a column, what the, you know, whether it's going to work or not, I

05:13:36.740 --> 05:13:45.460
[Guest]: don't know. And, but I, but the only thing I know is from experience, that if that, you know, you

05:13:45.460 --> 05:13:51.940
[Guest]: do your job, and, and the rest will just happen, and it's fine, you're not going to crash, you're

05:13:51.940 --> 05:13:59.620
[Guest]: not going to be fired, it's not going to be the last thing you ever write. Just, just, you know,

05:13:59.620 --> 05:14:04.980
[Amit Varma]: kind of trust your voice, in a sense, I just feel in that question, whether it will work or not the

05:14:04.980 --> 05:14:10.100
[Amit Varma]: term work is wrong, in the sense that it has already worked, if you have written it, it's

05:14:10.100 --> 05:14:14.740
[Amit Varma]: worked for yourself, right? What the world makes of it is we can't control that, like, this is great

05:14:14.740 --> 05:14:19.220
[Amit Varma]: quote by Joan Didion of I don't know what I think until I write it down, right? So in the act of

05:14:19.220 --> 05:14:25.540
[Amit Varma]: writing something down, it's done what it had to do for you. And, and then your voice is so

05:14:25.540 --> 05:14:30.020
[Amit Varma]: consistent over the years. And perhaps, like you said, you shaped it in your private blog. So

05:14:30.020 --> 05:14:36.180
[Amit Varma]: perhaps there is more sort of visible development there. But otherwise, it's just so consistent that

05:14:36.180 --> 05:14:40.260
[Amit Varma]: worries like will readers be able to understand or relate would never just strike me.

05:14:41.140 --> 05:14:45.300
[Amit Varma]: Going back to the theme of shaping yourself with your writing, and you know what Didion said,

05:14:45.300 --> 05:14:49.220
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what I think until I write it down. How did your writing change you? Like,

05:14:49.220 --> 05:14:54.100
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that if you had continued just parenting and not writing about it,

05:14:54.100 --> 05:14:57.860
[Amit Varma]: and if you maybe continued down that job or done something else or whatever,

05:14:59.460 --> 05:15:03.860
[Amit Varma]: I'd imagine you'd be a different person today. Writing changes everyone. I see that with myself

05:15:03.860 --> 05:15:08.500
[Amit Varma]: that everything I do changes me in some way or the other, even if it's podcasting or whatever,

05:15:08.500 --> 05:15:14.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, our actions shape us. And we shape our actions back, but more actions might even

05:15:14.580 --> 05:15:21.060
[Amit Varma]: shape us more. So how has right how did writing change you as a person, as a mother, as a wife,

05:15:21.060 --> 05:15:25.860
[Guest]: just in every sense? Yeah, I'm absolutely sure that I would be a different person.

05:15:27.060 --> 05:15:34.980
[Guest]: And in fact, every time I every time I begin to find that I'm becoming bitter and angry,

05:15:35.700 --> 05:15:44.980
[Guest]: I know that I must write in a that I must allow myself to write it out of my system.

05:15:44.980 --> 05:15:52.900
[Guest]: To answer your question, you know, the second column I wrote for Mint Lounge talks about,

05:15:53.940 --> 05:16:02.180
[Guest]: it's just in that moment where the editor calls me and asks me to write the column. And I say,

05:16:02.180 --> 05:16:10.260
[Guest]: yeah, sure. And I put the phone down and I have a meltdown. And in that in that meltdown, I'm saying

05:16:10.260 --> 05:16:19.700
[Guest]: I will want, I will want to be seen as a certain person to be seen as that person, I will have to

05:16:19.700 --> 05:16:28.180
[Guest]: become that person. You know, I will want to be seen to be doing a good job. And for that to work

05:16:28.180 --> 05:16:32.820
[Guest]: on paper, I will have to do a good job. So I'm kind of lamenting that I will have to be a better

05:16:32.820 --> 05:16:38.660
[Guest]: person to be a better to be a good writer to be the kind of writer I want to be. I'll have to be

05:16:38.660 --> 05:16:45.940
[Guest]: I'll have to be a better person. And why couldn't I have lived the unexamined life? I'm kind of

05:16:46.500 --> 05:16:55.940
[Guest]: laughing at myself in that moment. And I don't think I mean, I just wrote that out it came and

05:16:55.940 --> 05:17:02.420
[Guest]: I wrote it and I thought it would work and I sent it. And, and I over the years I you know,

05:17:02.420 --> 05:17:07.380
[Guest]: sometimes when I come go back to that passage, I'm like, oh my god, I had to do it. I literally

05:17:07.380 --> 05:17:15.540
[Guest]: did it. You know, I have that there is, you know, if you want it to ring true, then then it has to

05:17:15.540 --> 05:17:21.380
[Guest]: be the truth and then then you have to live it. Otherwise, it's not true. So you can't,

05:17:22.420 --> 05:17:30.340
[Guest]: you can't be seen as a gentle mother or if you're not being one. And in that sense,

05:17:30.340 --> 05:17:37.380
[Guest]: the fact that you're going to tell this story, it defines how you play the character

05:17:38.500 --> 05:17:46.260
[Guest]: in the in the story to some extent. There have been times, Amit, when I'm in a situation that is

05:17:47.620 --> 05:17:56.420
[Guest]: kind of, you know, emotionally, in which I'm kind of very emotional. And I'm back of my mind is

05:17:56.420 --> 05:18:02.500
[Guest]: thinking, I'm going to write about this. And also is thinking, how are you going to end this? Because

05:18:02.500 --> 05:18:13.620
[Guest]: if you don't act now, you don't have a story to tell. So if, if I'm very angry, then I have to

05:18:13.620 --> 05:18:19.300
[Guest]: do something about that there. Because I, I am not allowed, I have not given myself the permission

05:18:19.300 --> 05:18:27.380
[Guest]: to rant. I am not allowed to go and write a story in which he said this to me and I felt so bad,

05:18:27.380 --> 05:18:35.700
[Guest]: end of story. What did you do about it? That's the story. What you know, what is what is your

05:18:35.700 --> 05:18:42.020
[Guest]: reaction? What is your agency in this story? That is the story. So if I want to talk about it,

05:18:42.020 --> 05:18:50.500
[Guest]: then I have to, I have to do something about it. And I find that I, and in many times,

05:18:51.380 --> 05:18:57.460
[Guest]: if something's happened in school, I have to go through the whole thing of going to school,

05:18:57.460 --> 05:19:05.220
[Guest]: talking to them, giving them a chance, listening to them. And then I can tell the story and say,

05:19:05.220 --> 05:19:12.900
[Guest]: I didn't like the way this happened. And this is what I did about it. I can't, so,

05:19:14.980 --> 05:19:20.820
[Guest]: yeah, I mean, that I've not given myself the permission to, to just tell stories in which

05:19:20.820 --> 05:19:27.060
[Guest]: I'm this little victim and I can blame other people about it. I have to exercise my agency.

05:19:27.060 --> 05:19:35.220
[Guest]: And, and therefore I do. If something's happened between my husband and me, and I want to figure

05:19:35.220 --> 05:19:44.020
[Guest]: that out, then I have to act. I have to, I mean, whatever the situation may be, even if it's with

05:19:44.020 --> 05:19:49.940
[Guest]: the child, I have to have the conversation that I am not being able to have to be able to,

05:19:51.460 --> 05:19:56.340
[Guest]: to be able to tell that. This is such a fascinating paradigm shift in the sense

05:19:56.340 --> 05:20:01.620
[Amit Varma]: that you're not writing about your life, you're writing your life. That to write, you have to

05:20:01.620 --> 05:20:08.340
[Amit Varma]: live it. And, and, you know, everything is kind of, these are sort of feeding into one another.

05:20:08.340 --> 05:20:13.140
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about your course. What made you think of sort of teaching this? Because obviously,

05:20:13.140 --> 05:20:18.020
[Amit Varma]: over a period of time, there's intentionality behind the writing and the craft, you've thought

05:20:18.020 --> 05:20:23.140
[Amit Varma]: about it, you've developed to a certain stage, all that is there. But teaching a course then means

05:20:23.140 --> 05:20:28.820
[Amit Varma]: that you are explicitly taking all of these things that you might have implicitly learned,

05:20:28.820 --> 05:20:34.020
[Amit Varma]: and you're, you know, drawing a code of writing conduct, as it were, and sharing those lessons

05:20:34.020 --> 05:20:39.220
[Amit Varma]: and giving it form and structure and then teaching it. And like, what I have found is

05:20:39.220 --> 05:20:44.900
[Amit Varma]: that the act of teaching, I think, is even more intense than the act of writing in terms of how

05:20:44.900 --> 05:20:50.100
[Amit Varma]: deeply you have to think about something. Because if you're teaching something, you bloody well

05:20:50.100 --> 05:20:56.260
[Amit Varma]: you bloody well better know every little aspect of it, you know, in the sense that you have to

05:20:56.260 --> 05:21:00.180
[Amit Varma]: know it really well, you have to think about it very deeply. Tell me about that process.

05:21:02.020 --> 05:21:11.540
[Guest]: Yeah, so one of the things that I had kind of internalized over time, when I,

05:21:13.380 --> 05:21:18.340
[Guest]: you know, when I came out of school and decided not to study English, but to study psychology,

05:21:18.340 --> 05:21:24.340
[Guest]: and then I came out of mass communication course, and I decided not to be a reporter,

05:21:25.540 --> 05:21:31.460
[Guest]: or a writer, but to be a camera person. And over the years, I began to feel

05:21:32.980 --> 05:21:39.620
[Guest]: that maybe I didn't know how to write. And maybe I, you know, clearly, I didn't know,

05:21:39.620 --> 05:21:49.060
[Guest]: that's why I didn't do it. And I kind of internalized that stupidly. But, and then when,

05:21:50.260 --> 05:21:59.380
[Guest]: when I began to write the column, in a kind of hypersensitive way, I remained a little aware of

05:21:59.380 --> 05:22:07.540
[Guest]: the fact that nobody else wrote memoir in weekend columns, that personal writing is often judged in

05:22:07.540 --> 05:22:15.540
[Guest]: a certain way. And, and, and then, but, but, but I had enough time, I had enough time of writing

05:22:15.540 --> 05:22:21.540
[Guest]: that column for 10 years, to be able to shift from that position. Also, when the books came out,

05:22:21.540 --> 05:22:27.700
[Guest]: and they were highly successful, and I met my readers in literary festivals, and there was time

05:22:27.700 --> 05:22:37.620
[Guest]: for all of this, you know, garbage to go out, and, and a kind of a comfort level to settle in

05:22:37.620 --> 05:22:48.660
[Guest]: with why I was writing how I was writing and what it, why it mattered. But in 2020, mid 2020,

05:22:48.660 --> 05:22:59.300
[Guest]: for various reasons, my column was discontinued in Lounge. And to be fair, it was immediately

05:22:59.300 --> 05:23:05.700
[Guest]: started in the Tribune. So there was even not even a week's gap, the minute one paper didn't

05:23:05.700 --> 05:23:13.060
[Guest]: take it, another paper took it. But times have changed. And my audiences were changing, my

05:23:13.060 --> 05:23:21.140
[Guest]: editors concerns were changing. And, and more and more, I felt that I was writing in a space that

05:23:21.140 --> 05:23:29.780
[Guest]: was constricting, where, you know, don't write this, because this can get us into trouble,

05:23:29.780 --> 05:23:36.420
[Guest]: don't write that, because that's too intense, don't. And it was just from a very, very, you

05:23:36.420 --> 05:23:43.380
[Guest]: know, like a river in spate kind of space of what I want, what I could choose to write about,

05:23:43.380 --> 05:23:52.580
[Guest]: it was just kind of narrowing into a canal. And that began to get to me, and I guess in a,

05:23:53.460 --> 05:24:00.100
[Guest]: not consciously again, but I get I'm, I suppose in a subconscious way, I felt that I need to heal,

05:24:00.100 --> 05:24:07.700
[Guest]: I need to heal this in myself. And because I was feeling frustrated.

05:24:09.860 --> 05:24:17.860
[Guest]: So this is again, I'm analysing it in retrospect. I started, I announced, I called up a friend,

05:24:17.860 --> 05:24:23.300
[Guest]: and I said, you organise writing workshops. And I think I can do a workshop with you. This is

05:24:23.300 --> 05:24:31.540
[Guest]: Yoda Press and Arpita Das. And she immediately said yes. And then one of her colleagues

05:24:33.460 --> 05:24:39.940
[Guest]: literally sat me down, pursued me, followed me through my imposter syndrome over the next

05:24:40.740 --> 05:24:46.100
[Guest]: two months, and put the course together, put it out on social media. And the first lot of people

05:24:46.100 --> 05:24:51.940
[Guest]: joined. And when they began to join, and I looked at their profiles, and they were senior to me,

05:24:51.940 --> 05:24:58.260
[Guest]: they were writers who had written more than me, very prolific, working journalists,

05:24:59.140 --> 05:25:04.660
[Guest]: all kinds of profiles, people who did their own magazine. And I was like, why are they coming?

05:25:05.220 --> 05:25:12.020
[Guest]: And you know, so clearly, in my moment of doubt, I had forgotten the body of, you know, I had

05:25:12.020 --> 05:25:17.620
[Amit Varma]: forgotten the body of my work. And I haven't met a single woman who doesn't have the imposter

05:25:17.620 --> 05:25:24.980
[Guest]: syndrome in some way or the other. Yeah, so sometimes you can completely wipe out

05:25:24.980 --> 05:25:34.660
[Guest]: like decades of your work in a moment of panic. But at the same time, looking at these profiles,

05:25:34.660 --> 05:25:43.540
[Guest]: I was like, if they are paying to do this, then you, you know, if they're taking this seriously,

05:25:43.540 --> 05:25:48.580
[Guest]: then you're going to take this seriously. And, and of course, I was going to take it seriously

05:25:48.580 --> 05:25:58.020
[Guest]: anyway, it's just that I expected new learners, I didn't expect, you know, writers with so much

05:25:59.220 --> 05:26:06.660
[Guest]: talent, as well as experience, to come to me and say, you know, we want to write in a certain space

05:26:06.660 --> 05:26:14.580
[Guest]: and, and we need help with that. But, but that's how it happened. So I kind of went into the first

05:26:15.460 --> 05:26:22.900
[Guest]: memoir workshop, especially the first session, blinded by fear. But knowing that, I mean,

05:26:22.900 --> 05:26:28.900
[Guest]: it's, it's a little bit like my public speaking experience, you know, just before going on stage,

05:26:28.900 --> 05:26:35.460
[Guest]: I'm like, I don't remember any, I don't remember anything. And, and then you go and you begin to

05:26:35.460 --> 05:26:41.220
[Guest]: speak. And later, you don't remember what all you've said, but, you know, people are appreciating

05:26:41.220 --> 05:26:49.300
[Guest]: it. So it must have worked. So I, so I did the first memoir workshop. And that really kind of

05:26:49.300 --> 05:27:02.260
[Guest]: gave me a sense of what I, what I was, what I had in me to offer. And so we had announced four

05:27:02.260 --> 05:27:09.540
[Guest]: sessions. And immediately, I was kind of being able to see what the specific needs of each writer

05:27:09.540 --> 05:27:15.380
[Guest]: was. And I set up an individual session with each one of them outside of the group sessions.

05:27:16.420 --> 05:27:21.460
[Guest]: And that was very, very, it was a little bit like your podcast, it was, you know,

05:27:21.460 --> 05:27:28.820
[Guest]: very rewarding on both sides to, to, to explore what is it that our barriers are,

05:27:28.820 --> 05:27:33.700
[Guest]: what our strengths are, you know, what, what our histories are, and what do we want to do

05:27:33.700 --> 05:27:41.460
[Guest]: with all of this? How do we break through? And it was just such an intimate and engaging experience

05:27:41.460 --> 05:27:49.620
[Guest]: that it convinced me that I, that I was ready to go independent, that I was ready to kind of just

05:27:49.620 --> 05:27:57.700
[Guest]: put myself out there and announce it, announce more workshops. And the minute I announced the

05:27:57.700 --> 05:28:04.660
[Guest]: second one, it got oversubscribed, to the extent that I, you know, simultaneously ran a third one

05:28:04.660 --> 05:28:11.860
[Guest]: on another day of the week. And, and we've, we've done these seven workshops. So seven cohorts.

05:28:13.700 --> 05:28:17.780
[Guest]: One of my friends used to say, you know, there was a time when,

05:28:19.780 --> 05:28:25.460
[Guest]: before my column was stopped, for a while, there was a conflict over it. And every few weeks,

05:28:25.460 --> 05:28:31.300
[Guest]: every few weeks, it would seem like, now we're like, really at loggerheads. And this is the end,

05:28:31.300 --> 05:28:39.300
[Guest]: this, my call. And it would make me feel, it would make me feel really bad, it would make me kind of

05:28:39.300 --> 05:28:45.700
[Guest]: begin to collapse, which also made me realize that what I was doing was writing much more than

05:28:45.700 --> 05:28:51.860
[Guest]: a column, you know, that something much bigger than just 1300 words is what was coming out,

05:28:51.860 --> 05:28:57.300
[Guest]: because my whole body was reacting to the idea of not doing it. So I needed a substitute.

05:28:58.260 --> 05:29:06.100
[Guest]: But in that time, you know, one, I must have said to one of my friends, who's a writer, I said,

05:29:06.660 --> 05:29:12.980
[Guest]: will I still be a writer if I don't have a column? And she said, Natasha, you will become a writer

05:29:12.980 --> 05:29:16.980
[Guest]: when you stop writing this column. And I was like, what does that mean?

05:29:16.980 --> 05:29:19.460
[Amit Varma]: I agree with that. That's what I was about to say just now. Yeah.

05:29:19.460 --> 05:29:25.940
[Guest]: And I and for me, it was like, what does that mean? But from it's when I started doing the

05:29:25.940 --> 05:29:33.220
[Guest]: workshops, that's when I really kind of began to get a sense of what it means to be a writer.

05:29:34.980 --> 05:29:39.620
[Guest]: You know, to be able to read in that way to be able to distill

05:29:41.300 --> 05:29:45.380
[Guest]: your learnings in the way that you described, just before I was talking,

05:29:45.380 --> 05:29:55.860
[Guest]: to become much more aware of things. And I really strongly feel that it has

05:29:56.740 --> 05:30:04.340
[Guest]: it has given more body and form to my own writing. You know, ever since I've been doing,

05:30:04.340 --> 05:30:11.860
[Guest]: I have taken more ownership of what I do. I make sure that when my writers in the cohort are

05:30:11.860 --> 05:30:18.660
[Guest]: writing, I'm also writing. I make sure that I go to them when they show me their writing,

05:30:18.660 --> 05:30:24.020
[Guest]: I show them mine. And then I have to deal with shame. I have to deal with doubt. I have to deal

05:30:24.020 --> 05:30:29.460
[Guest]: with, will they still take me seriously as a mentor if they see that this is what I've written

05:30:29.460 --> 05:30:37.460
[Guest]: this week? And I have to stand by what I've written. And that's a different level of confidence

05:30:37.460 --> 05:30:45.220
[Guest]: level of confidence from, you know, it's being published because an editor needed to fill up

05:30:45.220 --> 05:30:52.660
[Guest]: some space or whatever. It's a different level of really literally standing next to

05:30:53.780 --> 05:30:58.740
[Guest]: what you've written. It's a little bit like what the books make us do, is when we have to stand

05:30:58.740 --> 05:31:05.380
[Guest]: with them. It's an identity then you have to take quite seriously when you.

05:31:05.380 --> 05:31:12.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think it's interesting how, and I've also obviously taught writing,

05:31:12.340 --> 05:31:19.140
[Amit Varma]: and it's interesting how the act of teaching writing can make you a better writer. And that

05:31:19.140 --> 05:31:23.940
[Amit Varma]: in turn can make you a different person. I won't say better, but different, that all of this kind

05:31:23.940 --> 05:31:28.340
[Amit Varma]: of feeds into each other. So it's so rewarding. So it's not only that you're teaching and the

05:31:28.340 --> 05:31:33.620
[Guest]: students are benefiting, but you're also learning. It's very rewarding. It's really,

05:31:33.620 --> 05:31:38.580
[Guest]: I mean, one of the things is that despite the fact that the books came out and, you know,

05:31:38.580 --> 05:31:45.460
[Guest]: there was all the literary festival circuit thing to do. And I met readers in person and people

05:31:45.460 --> 05:31:52.100
[Guest]: wrote to me and they continue to write to me. But a lot of these people who are coming to the,

05:31:52.100 --> 05:31:55.700
[Guest]: you know, these cohorts are made of people who have been reading me for years.

05:31:55.700 --> 05:32:02.500
[Guest]: And now I am privy to stories of how other people's lives are influenced or changed, or,

05:32:03.380 --> 05:32:09.860
[Guest]: you know, they're so hungry to tell me the story. And these are people who have never written to me

05:32:09.860 --> 05:32:17.780
[Guest]: over the years. You know, they're not the fan people who will kind of come out and meet you

05:32:17.780 --> 05:32:25.620
[Guest]: or come out and meet you somewhere. But they've kind of signed up immediately as soon as this thing

05:32:25.620 --> 05:32:32.260
[Guest]: is happening. And sometimes it's so overwhelming that I really have to kind of put on a mask

05:32:32.260 --> 05:32:35.940
[Guest]: because, you know, in front of me, there are these 12 windows and everybody's saying,

05:32:37.620 --> 05:32:41.860
[Guest]: you know, talking about you as if you're a little guru or something.

05:32:41.860 --> 05:32:50.740
[Guest]: And so, temporarily, you kind of have to protect yourself from kind of exploding. But it does,

05:32:52.900 --> 05:33:02.580
[Guest]: in a moment of quiet, it does give you a sense of the importance, the relevance of honest writing,

05:33:02.580 --> 05:33:12.660
[Guest]: of telling your story, of, you know, demonstrating courage, in a sense. I mean,

05:33:12.660 --> 05:33:18.100
[Guest]: a lot of people say how brave you are to write like that. And I don't get it because I have,

05:33:18.100 --> 05:33:24.660
[Guest]: you know, I feel so fearful. The process is kind of, I'm conquering so many fears.

05:33:24.660 --> 05:33:30.900
[Guest]: And you don't realize that the act of conquering fears is bravery. You know, you're so much like

05:33:30.900 --> 05:33:37.620
[Guest]: looking at yourself and saying, I'm so scared. But the fact that you're acting despite your fear

05:33:37.620 --> 05:33:47.860
[Guest]: is what it is. And then, yeah, so it really teaches you, it teaches you about yourself,

05:33:47.860 --> 05:33:55.860
[Amit Varma]: about your work. I'm guessing that many writers would be plagued with self-doubt when they start,

05:33:55.860 --> 05:34:01.220
[Amit Varma]: like I certainly was, where you think that, hey, is it an act of self-indulgence, where you might

05:34:01.220 --> 05:34:06.740
[Amit Varma]: wonder if you're being incredibly arrogant, that why would someone want to read me? Right? And

05:34:06.740 --> 05:34:11.300
[Amit Varma]: then that moment comes like the one that you've described, where you realize that, hey,

05:34:11.300 --> 05:34:16.820
[Amit Varma]: the writing is meaningful to so many people. You know, it's the opposite of self-indulgent,

05:34:16.820 --> 05:34:24.020
[Guest]: you're actually doing a service to the world. Yeah. And while I wouldn't put it like that,

05:34:24.020 --> 05:34:30.100
[Guest]: but I do, you know, just the last column that I went last week in the Tribune about,

05:34:30.100 --> 05:34:36.420
[Guest]: it's being called Hai Bechari, because I'm talking about this concept of people expressing

05:34:36.420 --> 05:34:45.700
[Guest]: love by calling you Bechari. I had very little time, I was in the middle of hospital visits,

05:34:45.700 --> 05:34:51.780
[Guest]: there was some crisis in the family. And I took some time off into a cafe and wrote it,

05:34:51.780 --> 05:34:58.260
[Guest]: and wrote it because some parts of it, I had recorded in my notes. So I had some dialogues,

05:34:58.260 --> 05:35:05.460
[Guest]: and then I built the piece from it. And I had no time at that point for fear, doubt, anything.

05:35:05.460 --> 05:35:12.740
[Guest]: I had no time for any rewriting, I just had to, you know, clear the copy, I had to write it,

05:35:12.740 --> 05:35:19.300
[Guest]: clean it, send it. And at that time, what I was able to do was separate myself

05:35:19.300 --> 05:35:27.220
[Guest]: from the act of writing, it's not about you. This needed to come, it has come, it will go,

05:35:27.780 --> 05:35:33.780
[Guest]: it will find its destiny. And you just learn so many times over and over again,

05:35:34.820 --> 05:35:40.420
[Guest]: that this act of surrender is actually so empowering and so necessary.

05:35:40.420 --> 05:35:45.300
[Amit Varma]: That's a beautiful way of putting in this act of surrender. So we are almost out of time,

05:35:45.300 --> 05:35:50.820
[Amit Varma]: I think we have a few minutes left. So a couple of final questions. And one is that,

05:35:51.380 --> 05:35:57.140
[Amit Varma]: tell me about what else you're doing these days. You're writing, you are doing the course.

05:35:57.140 --> 05:36:02.660
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you're, you know, parenting and wifing and all of those things. What else

05:36:02.660 --> 05:36:07.940
[Amit Varma]: sort of involves you? You said you were involved during the CAA protests. You're clearly someone

05:36:07.940 --> 05:36:13.140
[Amit Varma]: who's, you know, socially conscious out there trying to make a difference, especially in these

05:36:13.140 --> 05:36:22.100
[Guest]: times. So tell me a little bit about what you've been up to. So two things. One is something that

05:36:22.100 --> 05:36:28.020
[Guest]: I've been involved in since 2017, which is this people's campaign called the Karwan-e-Mohabbat,

05:36:28.020 --> 05:36:36.580
[Guest]: the caravan of love, that was announced by Harsh Mandar. It was a call to people from

05:36:36.580 --> 05:36:44.340
[Guest]: civil society to come together in solidarity with victims of violence who are not receiving

05:36:44.340 --> 05:36:52.660
[Guest]: the support that they should be receiving from the state, from the media, from their social groups.

05:36:53.540 --> 05:37:04.180
[Guest]: And that's, it's been an amazing learning journey. It's had its moments of pain and trauma

05:37:04.180 --> 05:37:16.580
[Guest]: and even burnout, emotional burnout in many ways. It's been hard on the family. Although it nearly

05:37:16.580 --> 05:37:21.460
[Guest]: started as a family project, it was the first thing that Afzal and I were doing together that

05:37:21.460 --> 05:37:29.700
[Guest]: both of us were equally involved in. And I was just out there publicly because as a writer,

05:37:29.700 --> 05:37:39.540
[Guest]: I had a role to play. So that then got us involved in the, when the NRC was announced in Assam,

05:37:40.100 --> 05:37:45.140
[Guest]: we were working with communities there. Quite naturally, it became part of the anti-CA

05:37:45.860 --> 05:37:53.220
[Guest]: protests, then the rehabilitation of victims of the Delhi violence. And then immediately when

05:37:53.220 --> 05:38:02.100
[Guest]: lockdown happened, you know, this huge civil society role that needed to be played when we

05:38:02.100 --> 05:38:14.740
[Guest]: had migrants, hungry and homeless migrant labor on the streets of India. And so that's kind of

05:38:14.740 --> 05:38:25.300
[Guest]: been very intense in many ways. I've revived the filmmaker in me to kind of lead the media team

05:38:25.300 --> 05:38:33.140
[Guest]: of the Karwane Mohabbat. We've been not only documenting stories of victimization, but also

05:38:33.700 --> 05:38:42.580
[Guest]: stories of solidarity of India's very living, throbbing, syncretic culture, the vestiges of

05:38:42.580 --> 05:38:50.020
[Guest]: of it in some places, but also the very aliveness of it in other places. Documenting stories of

05:38:50.020 --> 05:39:01.700
[Guest]: people, it's been quite amazing. What I'm starting to do next month is kind of also revive the

05:39:01.700 --> 05:39:14.740
[Guest]: teacher in me. Teaching, it's been my calling. And at various times, it's either been a very

05:39:14.740 --> 05:39:23.700
[Guest]: conventional teacher type role, or it's been more of a trainer role in media. But after a long gap

05:39:23.700 --> 05:39:29.700
[Guest]: of teaching in Delhi University and the Express Institute of Media Studies, where I was teaching

05:39:29.700 --> 05:39:37.380
[Guest]: regularly, after a longish gap of about five or six years, I'm going back to work, teach

05:39:38.900 --> 05:39:47.540
[Guest]: undergrad students, undergrad and postgrad students. And I'm really excited about it because

05:39:47.540 --> 05:39:51.940
[Guest]: I have not spent time recently with this age group.

05:39:51.940 --> 05:39:53.300
[Amit Varma]: And this is at Ashoka.

05:39:53.300 --> 05:40:02.580
[Guest]: And this is at Ashoka University. So, I mean, I'm a little more excited than a professor should be.

05:40:03.940 --> 05:40:10.340
[Guest]: At Ashoka, they just, you know, all the teachers are called professors. So, I'm already Professor

05:40:10.340 --> 05:40:15.300
[Guest]: Badwar. I'm already being addressed as such. And I'm suddenly having a little bit of a wow,

05:40:15.300 --> 05:40:24.820
[Guest]: this sounds good moment. But I think that it's really fantastic to have the opportunity

05:40:25.940 --> 05:40:33.300
[Guest]: to work with young Indians, to be able to share, you know, your experiences and your

05:40:34.500 --> 05:40:42.180
[Guest]: hopes and dreams with them and to be able to participate in, you know, to get to be witness

05:40:42.180 --> 05:40:49.300
[Guest]: to what it is that they are thinking, doing, and help them channel it in some way.

05:40:50.820 --> 05:40:57.220
[Guest]: Yeah, so these things are coming back. I'm also taking on freelance filmmaking projects. So,

05:40:58.980 --> 05:41:07.780
[Guest]: for the first time, I'm kind of independently working with a group of younger filmmakers,

05:41:07.780 --> 05:41:12.020
[Guest]: filmmakers, so that all of these things can happen at the same time.

05:41:13.220 --> 05:41:20.420
[Guest]: And I'm very tempted to employ my children soon, but I should be careful.

05:41:20.420 --> 05:41:24.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I was just thinking that they must be so terrified that you'll combine two of these things

05:41:24.660 --> 05:41:29.860
[Amit Varma]: and start a vlog featuring them and you'll have a camera all the time at home and all that.

05:41:29.860 --> 05:41:37.380
[Guest]: No, they're very sagacious in how they advise me. And they'll be like,

05:41:37.380 --> 05:41:42.100
[Guest]: No, mama, I don't think you should do that. And of course, I'm very obedient. So.

05:41:43.460 --> 05:41:50.100
[Amit Varma]: So, okay, final question, which I asked many of my guests on the show, recommend for me and my

05:41:50.100 --> 05:41:54.420
[Amit Varma]: listeners, some books, films, music, which you absolutely love. And a little while earlier,

05:41:54.420 --> 05:41:58.580
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about a lot of the books which influenced you. But, you know, apart from

05:41:58.580 --> 05:42:03.380
[Amit Varma]: those which you've already named, you know, books, films, music, which means so much to you,

05:42:03.380 --> 05:42:05.380
[Amit Varma]: you love them, you'd want to share them with everyone.

05:42:07.220 --> 05:42:18.100
[Guest]: Let me start with music. Last week, Naira Noor passed away. And I certainly would want to mention

05:42:18.100 --> 05:42:28.180
[Guest]: her to a new generation, to many generations of people who are listening. She sang ghazals,

05:42:28.180 --> 05:42:38.420
[Guest]: she sang fairs. She had the sweetest voice. And I'll send you a link, Amit. She sang a very

05:42:38.420 --> 05:42:47.700
[Guest]: beautiful song that stayed with me so much that it was the lullaby that I would sing to my children.

05:42:48.260 --> 05:42:55.460
[Guest]: It's very poetic. And it's not fairs. It's not a ghazal. But it's a very dreamlike song about

05:42:55.460 --> 05:42:58.420
[Guest]: butterflies and fireflies. What's it called?

05:42:58.420 --> 05:43:09.140
[Guest]: Hume Titliyon Ke Jugnoon Ke Desh Jaana Hain. It's almost like a child and a mother are kind of

05:43:10.340 --> 05:43:19.860
[Guest]: in a dreamscape. I love the metaphors in it. So I would very much like to recommend Naira Noor

05:43:19.860 --> 05:43:33.940
[Guest]: as a writer, as a singer. Books. Yeah, I mentioned some. I'd say read everything, really.

05:43:35.220 --> 05:43:42.980
[Guest]: It was one of the little learnings on the way of has been because I grew up in a home without books.

05:43:42.980 --> 05:43:50.980
[Guest]: It was my ambition to raise my children in a home full of books. And I did then fill up bookshelves

05:43:50.980 --> 05:43:57.300
[Guest]: with my books and expected my children to read them. And my children don't want to read any of

05:43:57.300 --> 05:44:06.500
[Guest]: the books necessarily that I have brought in. They discovered a whole new set of writers.

05:44:06.500 --> 05:44:12.260
[Guest]: They read entirely different genres. Sometimes they come back and read Pride and Prejudice and

05:44:12.260 --> 05:44:19.140
[Guest]: you know, they're fond of Little Women and some of the classics. But they have brought in a whole

05:44:19.140 --> 05:44:28.580
[Guest]: new library into my home. And that's really taught me to let readers go. You know, they just

05:44:28.580 --> 05:44:33.460
[Guest]: just totally really let them go and read everything, read whatever you like. Fiction,

05:44:33.460 --> 05:44:43.060
[Guest]: non-fiction. I think there is something, many of us have a little bit of a magical ability to just

05:44:43.860 --> 05:44:50.740
[Guest]: find what we need, you know, left alone in a bookshop or in a secondhand bookshop. We'll just,

05:44:50.740 --> 05:44:55.540
[Guest]: we tend to gravitate towards certain kind of readers and we should give ourselves the permission

05:44:55.540 --> 05:45:04.500
[Guest]: to do that. Not worry about whether it's famous or economical or on sale or not. What's the third

05:45:04.500 --> 05:45:12.980
[Guest]: thing? Films. Oh, watch a lot of animation. Watch Miyazaki. Watch Miyazaki with your family. It's

05:45:12.980 --> 05:45:18.260
[Guest]: something we do a lot. And one of our favorite dialogues, my husband's favorite dialogues is

05:45:18.260 --> 05:45:27.620
[Guest]: Respect Your Father. It's from a film called Ponyo. And we always answer him with Suspect

05:45:27.620 --> 05:45:35.540
[Guest]: Your Father. But you didn't hear it right. That's what the real dialogue was. And it's got this

05:45:36.660 --> 05:45:42.100
[Guest]: eccentric looking father trying to protect his daughter who's on her own happy journey.

05:45:42.100 --> 05:45:51.540
[Guest]: Yeah, so watch a lot of animation. Watch films from Southeast Asia. My daughters are discovering

05:45:52.980 --> 05:46:02.900
[Guest]: this, the rage in my home these days is Bad Buddy. So shows, I would say, watch a lot of

05:46:02.900 --> 05:46:10.180
[Guest]: Southeast Asian shows. I think they're very sensitively made. And there's a whole new

05:46:10.180 --> 05:46:14.580
[Guest]: language of emotions that they're expressing. Like which are the ones which have struck you?

05:46:17.300 --> 05:46:22.900
[Guest]: As far as names go, I can only name Bad Buddy. But you send me the links and I'll put them up soon.

05:46:22.900 --> 05:46:29.540
[Guest]: I'll definitely send them to you. But yeah, watch a lot of animation. Watch films from

05:46:29.540 --> 05:46:39.060
[Guest]: Southeast Asia. I'll definitely send them to you. I watch very few films. But Masaan has stayed with

05:46:39.060 --> 05:46:48.260
[Guest]: me. Mirch Masala is a classic that I often tell my children the story of Mirch Masala. And they

05:46:48.260 --> 05:46:53.940
[Guest]: insist that they cannot watch the film because they can't take this kind of intensity. But they

05:46:53.940 --> 05:47:01.940
[Guest]: like to hear the story. And yeah, I just go for popular culture. Great, you know, it's been an

05:47:01.940 --> 05:47:06.820
[Amit Varma]: incredible however many hours we sat here. And, you know, during this time, also that phenomenon

05:47:06.820 --> 05:47:12.180
[Amit Varma]: I described to you, that was happening with you. Whereas three, four times, you've looked like

05:47:12.180 --> 05:47:16.420
[Amit Varma]: different people I know, and I won't name them. And it's very interesting. But one thing that I

05:47:16.420 --> 05:47:20.420
[Amit Varma]: found is when you were talking about your daughters, you know, at one moment, I just

05:47:20.420 --> 05:47:24.180
[Amit Varma]: saw that you look like you were dancing, there was so much rapture on your face,

05:47:24.180 --> 05:47:28.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, and it was perhaps is because of the way the light was falling particularly luminous. So

05:47:29.300 --> 05:47:33.220
[Amit Varma]: I wish I could have taken a picture and you know, saved it for your kids. But

05:47:33.220 --> 05:47:35.460
[Amit Varma]: Natasha, thank you so much for your time today.
