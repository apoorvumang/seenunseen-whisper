00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.840
[Amit Varma]: So, let's look at history as a linear series of events, one thing following another, with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.300
[Amit Varma]: everything seemingly inevitable.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600
[Amit Varma]: But that's the hindsight bias at play.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.520
[Amit Varma]: When historical events are happening in the present tense, all possibilities seem open,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.560
[Amit Varma]: everything seems chaotic, anything can happen.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.720
[Amit Varma]: Also, there are far more factors at play that determine the course of history, and most

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.880
[Amit Varma]: of those don't make it to the narrative that we later tell about it.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Also, historians come along who look further, who look deeper, and expand that narrative

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.200
[Amit Varma]: and our knowledge of the world.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Srinath Raghavan is one such historian, and Bangladesh is one such subject.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.040
[Amit Varma]: My topic today is the Bangladesh War of 1971, but not the events of the war itself, but

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.080
[Amit Varma]: the global forces that shaped those circumstances.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
[Amit Varma]: People often think of the breakup of Pakistan as if it was inevitable, and people often

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.960
[Amit Varma]: see it as a bilateral conflict between India and Pakistan.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840
[Amit Varma]: None of those are quite true.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.080
[Amit Varma]: Srinath Raghavan's book, 1971, A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh, takes

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.180
[Amit Varma]: a deep look at the international events that led to the creation of Bangladesh, and the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.600
[Amit Varma]: actions of not just India and Pakistan, but also the USA, the Soviet Union, and China.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.520
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to my conversation with Srinath, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.720
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Scene and the Unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.880
[Amit Varma]: Now I actually use Storytel myself regularly, so as long as they sponsor this show, I'm

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.560
[Amit Varma]: going to recommend one book a week that I love.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.120
[Amit Varma]: My first recommendation is actually a Hindi audiobook of one of the greatest novels ever

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
[Amit Varma]: written, Raag Darbari by Srilal Shukla.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.160
[Amit Varma]: Raag Darbari was written in 1968 and is a powerful satire that nails the nature of government

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.880
[Amit Varma]: and bureaucracy and life in India, every libertarian will love it, and is still as relevant and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.200
[Amit Varma]: biting and trenchant as it was then.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.280
[Amit Varma]: I first read it in its English translation, was blown away, and had always intended to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.360
[Amit Varma]: read it also in Hindi.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Because if the English translation is so good, how good will the Hindi be?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.920
[Amit Varma]: Well, now I've heard it and it's mind-blowing.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Listen to Raag Darbari on Storytel and remember, you get a 30-day free trial only at Storytel.com

[Amit Varma]: slash IVM.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Srinath, welcome again to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Great to be here.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.400
[Amit Varma]: So Srinath, I'm going to begin by exploring an angle I sort of explored with, you know,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.360
[Amit Varma]: when I did a couple of episodes on Gandhi with Ramchandra Buha, and where I asked him

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.480
[Amit Varma]: about the difficulty of being a historian, given that we are wired for what is called

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.680
[Amit Varma]: the hindsight bias, that when you look back at history, everything seems inevitable.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.280
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me when I was reading your book on Bangladesh, 1971, that that's one of your

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.360
[Amit Varma]: starting premises for the book is that the that sense of inevitability plays out especially

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.800
[Amit Varma]: strongly with Bangladesh.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And it wasn't at all as inevitable and you examine the various reasons why.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.980
[Amit Varma]: But just as a general question, if I may pose the same question to you that I posed to Ram,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.120
[Amit Varma]: how do you sort of mentally take that step back from that sense of inevitability?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: Well, so historians have a saying that, you know, life is lived forwards, but understood

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
[Guest]: backwards, right?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.420
[Guest]: So in a sense, the challenge for the historian is how do you sort of try and find some kind

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.760
[Guest]: of a point, which does not exclusively privilege hindsight, but hindsight is absolutely important,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.640
[Guest]: because that's the only way you can make sense of things together.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.840
[Guest]: And to have that sense of contingency, but also causality in play, is I think a bit of

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.840
[Guest]: a balance that you strike as you go along.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.240
[Guest]: In a sense, there is no formula for it.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.360
[Guest]: It's more of a craft and how you sort of approach things, right?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.200
[Guest]: So this is great historian of the French Revolution, who is to say that, you know, before it happens,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.080
[Guest]: every revolution seems impossible.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.120
[Guest]: But after it happens, it seems inevitable, right?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.080
[Guest]: And that that's true of most great things like the Bangladesh emergence of an independent

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.280
[Guest]: country and so on.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.000
[Guest]: So the challenge for me in writing this book was precisely to come to terms with that kind

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.400
[Guest]: of a meta question of saying, how are we going to tell the story without making it all seem

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.280
[Guest]: as if it was so predetermined, which in some ways also takes away agency from people at

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.880
[Guest]: the end of the day, history is made by people themselves.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And specifically, how did you arrive at Bangladesh?

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.760
[Guest]: Well, I was actually working on a PhD thesis focusing on Indian foreign policy in the sort

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.120
[Guest]: of early years, primarily focusing on the Nehru period.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120
[Guest]: And I was working in the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.720
[Guest]: This was in the early 2000s.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.460
[Guest]: And at that point of time, the papers of P. N. Huxer, who was Indira Gandhi's principal

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.140
[Guest]: secretary during that period, were actually sort of deposited and made available to scholars.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.320
[Guest]: So I was one of the first people to sort of go through them, you know, it's a very large

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320
[Guest]: collection.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.240
[Guest]: Lately, we've had Jairam Ramesh writing a biography of P. N. Huxer, which makes very

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.840
[Guest]: good thorough use of all those sources.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.760
[Guest]: But I think I was one of the first people to actually see that.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.760
[Guest]: And it very quickly struck me that there was very interesting material on the Bangladesh

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.680
[Guest]: crisis, which suggested very different points of view, even ab initio.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.400
[Guest]: And then I decided to sort of make that a project.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.360
[Guest]: But it also struck me that it would be useful to widen out the perspective and not just

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.320
[Guest]: do an India-centered account of how the Indians approached the crisis, but to look at the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.920
[Guest]: crisis as a whole, to understand this very important historical event in post-colonial

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.000
[Guest]: South Asia, which is the emergence of Bangladesh, and to sort of do it on a much wider canvas.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.040
[Guest]: So that's how the project really began.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.480
[Guest]: And then I started working in a range of other archives, you know, I've sort of worked in

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.120
[Guest]: Britain, America, Canada, Australia, the Soviet Union, Germany.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.040
[Guest]: So all of these archives then kind of opened up a much more sort of multifaceted sort of

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.480
[Guest]: portrait of the period and of that particular event itself.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.080
[Amit Varma]: And just as an aside, your book is full of these illuminations and insights from the

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.520
[Amit Varma]: so to say bit players like Huxer, D.P.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.520
[Amit Varma]: Dhar, P.N.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Dhar, who all sound like, you know, fairly evolved intellects, you know, not what you

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.560
[Amit Varma]: would expect the typical, what the stereotype of the Babu or the bureaucrat is.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.760
[Amit Varma]: And that that was also fascinating to me to see those sort of influences upon our Prime

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.760
[Guest]: Minister.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.160
[Guest]: And one of the sort of key strengths, which Indira Gandhi had, particularly in her early

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.480
[Guest]: period of her sort of prime ministerial career, was to be able to accumulate this kind of

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.920
[Guest]: very high quality talent of civil servants, people with, you know, sort of, you know,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.720
[Guest]: foreign policy experience with intelligence background, to be able to sort of assist her.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.440
[Guest]: And at least in the case of the Bangladesh crisis, I think these people were not just

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.120
[Guest]: bit players, they were very important, you know, and someone like P.N.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.760
[Guest]: Huxer was literally sort of the person holding various strands of crisis management together

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.720
[Guest]: on behalf of the Prime Minister, of course, and looking through those notes and, you know,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.200
[Guest]: the letters that they wrote to each other about what Mrs. Gandhi told them in certain

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.000
[Guest]: meetings and so on was absolutely fascinating.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, much more erudite and crisp and better articulated than many op-eds of the day, which

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560
[Amit Varma]: you might find.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'm intrigued by, you know, an early sentence in your book, which I found in the introduction

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.400
[Amit Varma]: to your book, which is, quote, professional historians of South Asia remain reluctant

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.720
[Amit Varma]: to venture beyond the boundary of 1947, stop quote.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.720
[Guest]: What do you mean by this?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.720
[Guest]: Can you elaborate?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.360
[Guest]: What I meant to say was that the study of South Asian history, as it happens in universities,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.760
[Guest]: as done by historians who sort of teach and research in sort of universities and so on,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.240
[Guest]: is still very much focused either on the colonial period or the pre-colonial past.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.120
[Guest]: The immediate sort of post-independence period and or the post-colonial period in South Asia

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.560
[Guest]: as a whole still remains something that historians are reluctant to touch, partly because they

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.800
[Guest]: see it as too close to their time, partly because the archives for the older period

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.160
[Guest]: are much better organized, more easily, you know, if you want to work on some topic to

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.440
[Guest]: do with British India, you can go to the British Library in London, you can look at the National

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.280
[Guest]: Archives in India, you'd get a reasonable, whereas for the post-colonial period, especially

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.080
[Guest]: when I was working on the book, things have changed a little bit since then.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.600
[Guest]: The official archives were almost, you know, had close to zero holdings.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.840
[Guest]: So you had to sort of go through private papers, which is what I was doing, you know, Luxor

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.440
[Guest]: and others, and then use various other kinds of official archives from other countries.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.320
[Guest]: So you, in a sense, that remains a challenge.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.280
[Guest]: The second thing is that, you know, there is some kind of a sort of a tacit intellectual

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.440
[Guest]: or whatever academic division of labor, which has happened, which is to say that historians

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.320
[Guest]: typically look at everything before independence, whereas, you know, it's the political scientists

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.080
[Guest]: or international relations scholars who look at the more immediate past.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.640
[Guest]: But I think, you know, that then leaves out a very large arena of our contemporary existence,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.920
[Guest]: which I think needs to be bought under the, you know, the domain of history proper and

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.080
[Guest]: of historical investigation and writing.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.760
[Guest]: I'm happy to say that since I wrote those words, I mean, things do seem to be moving,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.120
[Guest]: though not as quickly as we'd like it to.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.800
[Guest]: But I think we definitely have a range of books now coming out, which also try and treat

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.160
[Guest]: the sort of post-independence, post-colonial period in the same historical fashion as you

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.360
[Guest]: would do with anything in the distant past.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'd imagine without the bedrock of history, even political science then has a problem

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.800
[Guest]: just dealing with the material, right?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.520
[Guest]: Well, I mean, I think a big part of the problem with a lot of Indian political science writing

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.120
[Guest]: is precisely that it's very ahistorical and, you know, tends to treat the present as if

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.680
[Guest]: it does not have a past.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.480
[Guest]: And that, you know, the way that institutions, structures, and processes have evolved historically

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.760
[Guest]: is somehow not of any moment or concern, that the only thing which matters is what is the

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760
[Guest]: dynamic today.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.160
[Guest]: And I think that that ahistorical quality is, I think, been one of the significant drawbacks

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.960
[Guest]: of Indian political science writing.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.040
[Guest]: But at the same time, I think the best Indian political scientists are people who have sort

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.040
[Guest]: of, you know, used historical knowledge and historical materials, really, to throw light

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.520
[Guest]: on political processes in more closer periods of time.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.800
[Amit Varma]: And could the converse also be true?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Like as a historian, do you sometimes feel that you're wearing the hat of a political

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.320
[Amit Varma]: scientist also when writing parts of your text?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.560
[Guest]: Well, the way I sort of tend to approach all of these things is to say that, you know,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.640
[Guest]: not just political science, but social sciences more broadly are very important for me because

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.000
[Guest]: that gives me heuristic devices with which I approach the archives.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.160
[Guest]: You know, archives and sources don't tell you any stories, you have to ask questions

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.160
[Guest]: of them, you know.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.440
[Guest]: And for that, you need to have some questions which come out of broader conceptual theoretical

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440
[Guest]: sort of basis.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.840
[Guest]: Now, you know, I don't go out with a view of trying to prove or disprove this or that

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840
[Guest]: theory.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.440
[Guest]: But as a heuristic device, I think social sciences are very important for the historian's

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440
[Guest]: craft.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.120
[Guest]: But of course, you know, in terms of my own choice, I still prefer the narrative, which

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.480
[Guest]: I think is the domain in which history is best explored and written and presented.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.560
[Guest]: And so I choose the narrative as the main device through which to tell the story.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.520
[Amit Varma]: So is there sort of a fine balance there that a historian needs to maintain between the

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.720
[Amit Varma]: narrative that they're presenting and the perspectives that they might wish to bear

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720
[Guest]: upon that narrative?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.880
[Guest]: So, you know, historical narratives, contrary to sort of what, you know, other social sciences

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.600
[Guest]: typically tend to think are not just about telling a story, right?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.120
[Guest]: I mean, you're trying to make a causal argument.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.440
[Guest]: I think the central difference between, say, most other social sciences and histories,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.920
[Guest]: and I say most because there are exceptions, is that historians are interested in change,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.200
[Guest]: whereas other social sciences are typically interested in trying to find longer term continuities,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200
[Guest]: right?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.280
[Guest]: So they may use historical materials, but with a view to saying so and so process or

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.520
[Guest]: so and so pattern is recurrent, if these are the initial conditions, these are likely to

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520
[Guest]: be the outcomes, right?

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.680
[Guest]: So, so that is the kind of exercise that they are engaged in.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.480
[Guest]: Whereas for historians, the challenge is not that we're not interested in generalization,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480
[Guest]: we are.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.080
[Guest]: But the bigger problem that you're interested in isn't change.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.120
[Guest]: How does change happen?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.660
[Guest]: How does a country like Pakistan break up into two parts is exactly the kind of questions

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.160
[Amit Varma]: that historians are drawn to.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And getting back to the breakup of Pakistan, again, early in your book, you say that the

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.520
[Amit Varma]: typical prisms through when one looks at Bangladesh are insularity and determinism, we've already

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.840
[Amit Varma]: spoken about determinism and by insularity, I guess you mean that, you know, people tend

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.880
[Amit Varma]: to think of it as either something that concerns Bangladesh alone, or it's an India Pakistan

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.280
[Amit Varma]: dynamic and what your book tries to bring out is that there are sort of these geopolitical

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.960
[Amit Varma]: waves of events and, you know, all with their unintended consequences, which are sweeping

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:38.120
[Amit Varma]: through at the time and Bangladesh is really a result of those, I mean, as you said later,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.160
[Amit Varma]: it's far from being predestined, it's a product of conjuncture and contingency, choice and

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160
[Guest]: chance.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160
[Guest]: Yeah, that's true.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.040
[Guest]: I mean, in a sense that much of the writing on the creation of Bangladesh, it tends to

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.360
[Guest]: be either from the perspective of trying to tell the story of how Bangladeshi or Bengali

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.800
[Guest]: nationalism sort of rose and, you know, attained its destiny as an independent nation, or it

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.880
[Guest]: is about saying why Pakistan, as it was in 1947, kind of was an unworkable project and

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880
[Guest]: so on.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.560
[Guest]: So there is an implicit sort of teleology and determinism, which is built into most

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.680
[Guest]: of our storylines to greater and lesser extents, but that's the standard way in which we think.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.560
[Guest]: And of course, in India, we have our own story of, you know, this being the most important

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.920
[Guest]: sort of moment of India sort of, you know, falsifying the two nation theory and so on.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.400
[Guest]: Now, I don't for a minute say that any of these narratives are strong.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.120
[Guest]: What I want to say is that they are incomplete, and that if you really want a more satisfactory

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.560
[Guest]: explanation of why this particular momentous event occurred, then you have to place it

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.320
[Guest]: not just within a national or a regional frame, but actually in something of a global, it's

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.000
[Guest]: an international and transnational frame.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's what really the book tends to do.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.240
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, all of this, all of what happened in Bangladesh in 71 has its roots, obviously,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.280
[Amit Varma]: in the 60s under Ayub Khan, and specifically in the context of, say, 1968, when the student

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.400
[Amit Varma]: rebellion start and all of that, you talk about the three historical processes that

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.840
[Amit Varma]: shaped the global context of those years, the first being decolonization.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.560
[Guest]: Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.920
[Guest]: Well, decolonization, you know, obviously, is a breakup of the old sort of European empires

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.560
[Guest]: in the post Second World War period, India was in the first wave of decolonization.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.200
[Guest]: But by the late 1960s, you had several other countries across Asia and Africa, which have

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.160
[Guest]: gone through, you know, process of decolonization, but which are also in their postcolonial existence

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.760
[Guest]: coming up with various forms of other kinds of issues, borders, ethnicities, various kinds

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.200
[Guest]: of rivalries left behind by older forms of colonial control, and so on.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.860
[Guest]: So in a sense, what is happening in Bangladesh is therefore best understood as a continuation

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.280
[Guest]: of this larger process of decolonization, even though it is happening within the context

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.100
[Guest]: of a country which is already, you know, out of colonial control, which is Pakistan.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.080
[Guest]: But nevertheless, the imperatives and the processes seem to me to be very similar to

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.280
[Guest]: what was happening with a number of other countries, particularly in Africa at that

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
[Guest]: point of time.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.880
[Guest]: So it is very important, therefore, to sort of put it into that frame.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.200
[Amit Varma]: And the second process you mentioned, the frame of the Cold War.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.960
[Guest]: Yeah, the Cold War is again, you know, something which depending on when you want to date it

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.180
[Guest]: starts somewhere after the Second World War and before the late 1940s.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.240
[Guest]: And the Cold War is typically understood as a sort of a geopolitical and ideological rivalry

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.080
[Guest]: between the United States and its allies, the so-called free world, and the Soviet Union

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.520
[Guest]: and its allies, the so-called communist bloc.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.760
[Guest]: But what is interesting is that by the late 1960s, you know, the Cold War no longer looks

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.800
[Guest]: like this contest between two rigidly organized blocs.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.600
[Guest]: There is a lot of sort of, you know, moving and, you know, turning around of pieces within

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.680
[Guest]: each of these blocs.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.040
[Guest]: And one of the big important things, of course, was the split between the Chinese and the

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.480
[Guest]: Soviet Union, which was already coming to the fore by that time, and which plays an

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.280
[Guest]: important role in the story of Bangladesh as well.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.400
[Guest]: So in a sense, it was important, therefore, to suggest that, you know, this was an important

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.320
[Guest]: moment in the Cold War, the realignment of the sort of important pieces of the Cold War

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.560
[Guest]: geopolitics, the waning of some of the ideological competition in the context of the Cold War,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: and how that impacts on an event which is not anywhere in the center of things where

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.800
[Guest]: the Cold War was playing out, which is in South Asia.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Oh, and as you go on to sort of talk about in the book, and we'll discuss in the second

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.480
[Amit Varma]: half of this podcast, right, you know, that that simplistic notion that many people have

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.320
[Amit Varma]: and that indeed I had before I read this book that, oh, the US was siding with Pakistan

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.640
[Amit Varma]: and the Soviet Union was with India and blah, blah, blah is actually not true at all.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.200
[Amit Varma]: There were there was a lot of sort of negotiations and to's and fro's happening in this period

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.400
[Amit Varma]: with China playing a major part, but I will come to that later in the podcast.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.600
[Amit Varma]: The next process you mentioned, globalization.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.840
[Guest]: Yeah, so, you know, decolonization and Cold War, I think are, you know, you can reasonably

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.760
[Guest]: sort of have a sense of what they are.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.560
[Guest]: But globalization is something that we, at least in our current context, tend to think

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.320
[Guest]: of as something which is very much a post Cold War kind of a moment, right?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.240
[Guest]: I mean, you want to think about Francis Fukuyama sometime in 1989 announcing the end of history,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.560
[Guest]: saying that all kinds of, you know, ideological rivalries are coming out.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.520
[Guest]: That is the moment when Americans sort of attempt to, you know, to create an integrated

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.840
[Guest]: capitalist global economy really takes off and so on.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.240
[Guest]: But one of the things which historians have been pointing to us, and I sort of picked

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.600
[Guest]: up on that literature and built it up, was to say that, you know, what we think of as

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.640
[Guest]: the current wave of globalization, you know, actually is something which begins in the

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.120
[Guest]: early 70s and late 1960s, early 70s is when the first, you know, real wave of sort of

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.640
[Guest]: globalization begins.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.240
[Guest]: By which I mean that there are a number of, you know, events and processes which are coming

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.600
[Guest]: together, which are bringing disparate parts of the world in some sort of communication

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.880
[Guest]: with one another, right?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.620
[Guest]: So you have the huge explosion of air travel during that period, so people are traveling

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.960
[Guest]: to one place another, the whole story of containerization and so on, you know, already sort of starting

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960
[Guest]: to take off.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.360
[Guest]: There's a huge standardization of various kinds of, you know, economic processes, but

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.040
[Guest]: also other kinds of things.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.640
[Guest]: There is a much greater spread of non-governmental organizations which are trying to bring standardization

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640
[Guest]: even in terms of values, right?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.360
[Guest]: I mean, the rise of something like human rights, for instance, happens in a much more global

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.360
[Guest]: context in the same period.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.680
[Guest]: So in that sense, not just as a process of economic globalization and integration, but

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.040
[Guest]: as one where events and processes which happen in one part of the world are quite tightly

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.760
[Guest]: linked to what is happening elsewhere.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.680
[Guest]: And it seemed to me that this phenomenon is very well established already by the late

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680
[Guest]: 1960s.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.940
[Guest]: Of course, contemporary forms of globalization evolved historically from there on.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.220
[Guest]: But that was a very important moment when this began.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.560
[Guest]: And again, as I point out in the book, this had important implications for the way the

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.240
[Amit Varma]: Bangladesh crisis plays out.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.560
[Amit Varma]: And elsewhere, you point out about how there was sort of a technological explosion during

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560
[Amit Varma]: this time.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.720
[Amit Varma]: One of the first televisions came to Pakistan in 1968.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it was a sort of an inflection point for this kind of cultural globalization,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.360
[Amit Varma]: which seemed to me, you know, when I was reading it, that is very analogous to the current

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.920
[Amit Varma]: day, when social media has, you know, sort of led to a similar sort of deepening of that

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.440
[Amit Varma]: whole process of cultural globalization.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Give me a little bit of context into what Pakistan was like in 68.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Ayub Khan had already been in charge for many years.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.760
[Amit Varma]: People often said that, you know, under him, there was sort of a new Pakistan, which was

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760
[Amit Varma]: emerging.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Ayub himself stood for stability and growth.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.560
[Amit Varma]: He got a fair amount of support from the US, which is, you know, a process that started

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.560
[Amit Varma]: a decade earlier.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Just lay the context for me coming to 1968, you know, when it might seem, say, in the

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.440
[Amit Varma]: mid to late 60s, that this guy's going to be here for a long time.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.440
[Guest]: And then, like you said, overnight, he's gone.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.440
[Guest]: Well, 1960s are a very important and interesting decade in the history of Pakistan, which is

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.600
[Guest]: to say that, you know, that was a decade when Pakistan registered, at least in terms of

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.200
[Guest]: GDP growth and quite an extraordinary accomplishment of almost averaging about 6% annual GDP growth

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.560
[Guest]: over that decade.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.880
[Guest]: That was possible because, you know, Ayub Khan was sort of following a set of, you know,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.440
[Guest]: planned economic policies, which were actually a lot of it was crafted by American economists,

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.080
[Guest]: the Harvard Advisory Group and others who were helping him, you know, do it.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.160
[Guest]: And Pakistan also got onto the bandwagon of the Green Revolution even before India did.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.760
[Guest]: They started in the early 60s itself.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.720
[Guest]: So, in that sense, this was a decade when Pakistan actually witnessed considerable levels

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.320
[Guest]: of economic growth.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.080
[Guest]: But that economic growth as by the end of the decade was, it was becoming was, was very,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.080
[Guest]: very lopsided.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.240
[Guest]: And some of the Harvard economists who are advising the Pakistanis themselves conceded

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.360
[Guest]: that, in a sense, their policies were aimed towards fostering capital accumulation and

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.600
[Guest]: investment.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.960
[Guest]: But the groups which are capable of doing it were very small.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.960
[Guest]: In fact, at one point of time, the head of the Pakistani Planning Commission said that

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.520
[Guest]: there were just 22 families in Pakistan, which accounted for something like 85 to 90% of

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520
[Guest]: the country's wealth.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: So there was an extraordinary concentration of wealth by conscious government policy,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.400
[Guest]: you know, giving tax breaks, you know, basically all the things that you want to do to enable

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.240
[Guest]: capitalist accumulation and investment was the game.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.160
[Guest]: And that, in the Pakistani context, got exacerbated because of the sort of geographical disparities

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.660
[Guest]: between West Pakistan and East Pakistan.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.000
[Guest]: So if you can just take a step back, right, so in 1947, when Pakistan is created, you

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.520
[Guest]: have this kind of completely geographically anomalous entity coming out, which is West

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.920
[Guest]: Pakistan, which is today's Pakistan and, you know, East Pakistan, which is today's Bangladesh,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.480
[Guest]: being under sort of one particular sort of, you know, being the same country and in a

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480
[Guest]: similar regime.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.040
[Guest]: In fact, in this novel, Shame, Salman Rushdie has this fantastic line where he says that

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.840
[Guest]: United Pakistan was a strange bird.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.880
[Guest]: It was two wings without a body, right?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.600
[Guest]: Because that body was effectively, you were separated by India.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.040
[Guest]: So there was this tendency to assume, therefore, that, you know, divide between these two parts

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.760
[Guest]: is not just geographic, but, you know, there was sort of economic disparities.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.840
[Guest]: East Pakistan was the more sort of, you know, commodity producing area.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.360
[Guest]: Things like jute used to grow there, exports of those in, you know, earned dollars for

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.280
[Guest]: the Pakistani government, but a lot of the investment and industrial development was

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.080
[Guest]: actually happening in the West.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.480
[Guest]: So there was this regional disparity of economic growth as well, not just in terms of class

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.480
[Guest]: sort of differentiation.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.520
[Guest]: And there were, of course, language issues, like Urdu being the official language.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.520
[Guest]: And that sort of language issue was in some ways the first major trigger, right?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.200
[Guest]: The first sort of major movement in East Pakistan actually happens over the fact that Bengali

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.600
[Guest]: is not initially accepted as an important language of the state, which is not just a

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.960
[Guest]: cultural issue, but it's one to do with employment and stuff.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.560
[Guest]: So if you want to become a Pakistani civil servant, you will have to write exams in Urdu,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.560
[Guest]: right?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, so in a sense, you know, your knowledge of Bengali doesn't count for very much.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.640
[Amit Varma]: So all this time, it's interesting to me that, you know, that the eastern wing of Pakistan

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640
[Guest]: is actually more populous.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.520
[Guest]: Yeah, it is in terms of just number of people, eastern wing of Pakistan was always more populous.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.480
[Guest]: And, you know, a united Pakistan did not have an election till 1970.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.480
[Guest]: But if you had by that point of time, majority of the electorate was also in East Pakistan,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.480
[Guest]: right?

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.640
[Guest]: So, so in a sense, the fact that normal democratic pressures were not bought to bear in this

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.320
[Guest]: period allowed this kind of, you know, disparate economic growth to happen.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.360
[Guest]: And the diversity between the two regions was there.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.880
[Guest]: So, you know, it's, it's again, what is ironic and fascinating about this period is that,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.400
[Guest]: you know, the period of Pakistan's sort of immense, you know, an impressive sort of economic

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.440
[Guest]: growth in the 1960s.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.440
[Guest]: The economists who are there in the Pakistani Planning Commission are primarily of Bengali

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440
[Guest]: origin.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440
[Guest]: Oh, yeah.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.000
[Guest]: And by the end of the decade, it is those economists who are coming up with this critique

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.680
[Guest]: of the economic system of Pakistan as effectively a neo-colonial one.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.400
[Guest]: They say that East Pakistan has become a commodity producing area, like all old colonies used

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400
[Guest]: to be.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.640
[Guest]: And all the sort of, you know, stuff in terms of, you know, new industries, investment,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.040
[Guest]: etc. is primarily happening in the West.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.360
[Guest]: So and then East then becomes a importer of the commodities of the West.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.720
[Guest]: And it's in that context that a lot of these arguments came to be crystallized and the

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.520
[Guest]: relationship came to be seen as fundamentally a neo-colonial one.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a little later, there's a quote from Mujib, which I kind of mark down, which is

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.500
[Amit Varma]: quote, the basic truth that every Bengali has felt in his bones, that we have been treated

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.600
[Amit Varma]: for so long as a colony and a market.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote, which is, you know, so therefore, in a sense, you could say that the Bangladeshi

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.440
[Amit Varma]: fight for independence as it became due to circumstances was analogous to the Indian

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440
[Amit Varma]: fight for independence.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.240
[Guest]: Yeah, it was analogous to the Indian fight for independence.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.600
[Guest]: I think the other analogy, of course, is the similar sorts of arguments which are being

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.840
[Guest]: made around the same time in Latin America about dependency theories and so on.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.760
[Guest]: So you can see that, you know, here, this argument is being extended to a one single

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.520
[Guest]: economy, which, of course, has got these two sort of geographic.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Just can you elaborate on the Latin American argument?

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.680
[Guest]: I mean, the Latin American argument was primarily to say that, you know, many of these countries,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.440
[Guest]: Latin America, of course, you know, became formally decolonized much before Asia and

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.640
[Guest]: Africa did.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.680
[Guest]: But the point was to say that, you know, in the post Second World War period, the patterns

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.400
[Guest]: of capitalist development in the Western world was such that areas like Latin America were

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.240
[Guest]: effectively seen as commodity producing in a similar sort of a relation, right?

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.980
[Guest]: So that's not where this thing.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.320
[Guest]: So there is a sort of a tendency to think that we need to have our own sort of, you

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.480
[Guest]: know, model of economic development, which is kind of independent of this kind of thing.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.000
[Guest]: However, of course, many economies attempted these import substitution policies during

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[Guest]: that period.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.840
[Guest]: But what is interesting, of course, is that all of this happening within the context of

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840
[Guest]: Pakistan, right?

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.120
[Guest]: So the whole argument of a neo-colonial sort of feeling, which Malib's quote captures,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.760
[Guest]: was one which was being felt by people who belong to the same state.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.920
[Guest]: So in that sense, it was a much more, I mean, you could have had similar policies in India,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.640
[Guest]: for instance, but the Indian government of the time, the Nehru government, you know,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.800
[Guest]: took a conscious decision to enable investment in various parts of India to precisely prevent

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.440
[Guest]: this kind of very lopsided economic growth and development and so on, which the Pakistanis

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440
[Guest]: never took seriously.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: And a lot of that investment did happen in the context of West Pakistan.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.080
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about 1968 then, you know, there was youthful revolt in Pakistan.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just in Pakistan, it was almost sort of a global thing that, you know, the

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.160
[Amit Varma]: youth was rising up everywhere in America, you had the anti-Vietnam feeling, there was

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.920
[Amit Varma]: this anti-establishment feeling everywhere.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.960
[Amit Varma]: What's going on here, what are the kind of factors that go into something like this?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.880
[Guest]: Yeah, so 1968 is actually, I think, a good example of how the processes of incipient

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.440
[Guest]: globalization came to sort of impact what is happening in the context of Pakistan.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.400
[Guest]: Because you know, the student revolts of 1968, as you said, was a global phenomenon.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.120
[Guest]: Of course, everywhere they had local particular sort of issues which were in play.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.000
[Guest]: But nevertheless, student groups across the world took the cues from one another, right.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: And it's important to remember just how widespread this was.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.520
[Guest]: And television came to Pakistan in 1968, so they can see everything.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.640
[Guest]: So you had, of course, student revolts happening in the United States, which was also triggered

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.680
[Guest]: by the civil rights, Vietnam War, and that involvement.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.280
[Guest]: But you had similar things happening in France, in Italy, in Germany.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.520
[Guest]: You also had it in the Soviet bloc, right.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.600
[Guest]: In the post 1968, the Czechoslovakia incident, there was, you know, all of that story.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.760
[Guest]: There was a student movement happening in Japan at the point of time, there was a cultural

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.080
[Guest]: revolution in China, which was again a student sort of led thing.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.520
[Guest]: So what is happening across the world in some ways was, you know, ricocheting from one place

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520
[Guest]: to another.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.440
[Guest]: People were seeing that this kind of mobilization is happening.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.880
[Guest]: The forms of the mobilization, the vocabularies with local inflections, of course, were still

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.620
[Guest]: quite strikingly reminiscent of one another.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.600
[Guest]: And what is interesting is that in Pakistan, the student revolts kind of come towards the

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.280
[Guest]: tail end of 1968.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.600
[Guest]: And as you said, you know, television in Pakistan, people are seeing all of this stuff.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: And of course, there are sort of individuals who also sort of bring the story like, you

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.200
[Guest]: know, the sort of famous student revolutionary of the Oxford sit-ins in the British context

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.480
[Guest]: was Tariq Ali, who was from a very well to do Pakistani family.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.480
[Guest]: And as many student revolutionaries tend to be, yeah.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.920
[Guest]: And Tariq Ali actually comes back to Pakistan and, you know, and sees that there is this

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.800
[Guest]: whole sort of movement against Ayub Khan's sort of authoritarian regime.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.040
[Guest]: And what is interesting about the student movement in Pakistan in late 1968, early 1969,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.720
[Guest]: is that it actually is in both wings of Pakistan.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.400
[Guest]: It is not as if it's only in the eastern wing of Pakistan, as much in the western wing as

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.400
[Amit Varma]: well.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.400
[Guest]: But are they coordinating?

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400
[Guest]: Or they're kind of continuous?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400
[Guest]: No, no.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.040
[Guest]: In a sense, they do sort of learn from each other, they sort of express solidarity for

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040
[Guest]: one another.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040
[Amit Varma]: Are they fighting for the same thing?

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.720
[Guest]: Yeah, they all believe that the first step towards thing is true for democratization

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720
[Guest]: of Pakistan, right?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.880
[Guest]: So, the authoritarian military government has to go.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.440
[Guest]: And you know, they see that the first step is to sort of give expression to democracy.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.000
[Guest]: And of course, you know, they do succeed, Ayub Khan is forced to step down, which I

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.120
[Guest]: think is an important accomplishment for student revolutionaries.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.800
[Guest]: I think they were more successful than almost students anywhere else, possibly with the

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.520
[Amit Varma]: exception of France, where they managed to get de Gaulle.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.880
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes one feels like a dog chasing a car is finally caught the car, what do you do

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880
[Guest]: now?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880
[Guest]: Right.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.640
[Guest]: So, it is a, it was one of those, you know, situations where they sort of got there.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.440
[Guest]: And then of course, that sets the stage for not an immediate transfer of power to the

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.440
[Guest]: people.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.880
[Guest]: But, you know, power, you know, there's a military coup, actually, which deposes Ayub

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880
[Guest]: Khan.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.240
[Guest]: So, of course, Yaya Khan comes to power, but very clearly with an agenda of announcing

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.240
[Guest]: elections, and managing some kind of a transition to democracy, which would nevertheless leave

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: the military in a controlling sort of position within the polity.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when Yaya announces, Masha Allah, you quote him and saying that the army, quote,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.880
[Amit Varma]: must be prepared to rule this unfortunate country for the next 14 years or so.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.080
[Amit Varma]: I simply can't throw this country to the wolves, stop quote.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.880
[Amit Varma]: And already in his mind, he's, I mean, even though Ayub Khan's resignation and his taking

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.200
[Amit Varma]: over is prompted by the student revolts, he's not taking the students or their demands really

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200
[Amit Varma]: that seriously.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.640
[Amit Varma]: He's assumed that this is a period of unrest and the army has to see the country through

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.040
[Amit Varma]: and stabilize it.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost like this sense of both entitlement and denial.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.880
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.360
[Guest]: I mean, I think Ayub Khan was, you know, for so long seen as such an unimpeachable force

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:12.840
[Guest]: in Pakistani politics, that, you know, he just couldn't bear to sort of, you know, accept

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.240
[Guest]: what the reality was as it was unfolding.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.600
[Guest]: But the scale of the revolts, student uprisings, you know, movements by peasants, by various

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.600
[Guest]: kinds of labor unions and so on, was of such a scale that ultimately the Pakistan army

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.440
[Guest]: felt that they had to sort of intervene and persuade Ayub to move out so that, you know,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.600
[Guest]: they could then restore a modicum of stability.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.800
[Amit Varma]: So I think it was a very powerful moment at that point of time.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And there's another telling quote in your book about how the old guard, quote, failed

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.680
[Amit Varma]: to feel the pulse of an electorate over half of whom had been born after the hairy days

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.640
[Amit Varma]: of 1947, stop quote.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And it almost seemed analogous to me as of today, where in India, almost half, more than

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.840
[Amit Varma]: half the people are born after liberalization.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And yet our politicians on average are like these 60-70 year old fogies who simply don't

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960
[Amit Varma]: get it.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And whatever the pulse of the nation is, I'm not saying there is one that would be a simplistic

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.120
[Amit Varma]: narrative.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.920
[Amit Varma]: But if there was a pulse, those guys who are running the country aren't really equipped

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.240
[Amit Varma]: to get what's going on, right?

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.520
[Guest]: And the generational gap was kind of one of the major factors for the driver of this thing.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.600
[Guest]: In a way that actually was in many of the other 1968 revolts.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: But in the context of Pakistan, particularly, I think that was definitely a very important

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.200
[Guest]: part of the story, which was to say that, you know, the military and Ayub Khan in particular,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.720
[Guest]: but even Yahya Khan later, underestimated the extent to which they would be able to

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.400
[Guest]: sort of control these developments or call upon, you know, sort of abstract calls for

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.080
[Guest]: national unity, discipline, etc. as a way of mobilizing and harnessing these energies,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.700
[Amit Varma]: which proved to be wrong.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And it seemed to me, correct me if I'm reading it wrong, but it seemed to me that even with

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Mujibur Rahman, who actually eventually got an independent Bangladesh and came to power

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.920
[Amit Varma]: because of all of these forces and these ferments, was himself not in control of it at all.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, he was a conventional politician within the framework of Pakistan, he'd been

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.840
[Amit Varma]: a minister and all that, you know, in March 1966, he comes out with a six point program

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.600
[Amit Varma]: for autonomy, where he wants more autonomy, and I suppose more of a federalist structure

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.760
[Amit Varma]: for where Bangladesh has more power within the thing.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And instead of becoming, you know, the starting tool with which you begin negotiations, that

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.520
[Amit Varma]: becomes a minimum acceptable thing once the movement for Bangladeshi independence gets

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:28.480
[Amit Varma]: going because he is suddenly captive to the wishes of the student revolution and the extremists

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.480
[Amit Varma]: in his party.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And he is forced into all of those strands he might not otherwise take.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.320
[Guest]: That's I think quite true.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.320
[Guest]: And I think that transformation is again something that is peculiar to the late 1960s, which

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.200
[Guest]: is why I don't buy into this argument that, you know, Bangladesh was predestined to break

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.040
[Guest]: up because, you know, you had this Bengali majority, which was never given its due and

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040
[Guest]: so on.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.840
[Guest]: Actually speaking, for politicians of Mujibur Rahman generation, the real dream was to sort

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.760
[Guest]: of not get an independent state, but to take control of all of Pakistan, which a democratic

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.600
[Guest]: majority could have put them in power, right.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.680
[Guest]: And as we'll see, you know, even the Indians thought that that actually would not be such

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.320
[Guest]: a bad outcome for their own sort of…

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320
[Guest]: That'd be a great outcome.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.320
[Guest]: Do you think they'd be fighting with us so much if that was the case?

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.160
[Guest]: Well, so that was the argument at that point in time, right.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.600
[Guest]: So the assumption was that, listen, the Bengalis are not interested in Kashmir, they are not

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.600
[Guest]: interested in… they want better relations with us.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.160
[Guest]: All of it might have been reasonable assumptions.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.480
[Guest]: But that's the framework within which people saw, which is why I think it's anachronistic

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.080
[Guest]: to think that that framework was already doomed to sort of, you know, extinction by the time

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080
[Guest]: that these things were playing out.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080
[Guest]: Not at all.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.080
[Guest]: So in the minds of contemporaries, these were important structures, which you could not

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.280
[Guest]: break away so easily from, you know, it's never an easy thing to be able to do.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.720
[Guest]: It's a bit, actually, I think the best analogy is with, you know, what Jinnah wanted with

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.760
[Guest]: in terms of his Pakistan in, you know, pre-independence India, right?

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.760
[Guest]: I mean, it's not very clear that even he believed that at all points that that outcome

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760
[Guest]: was likely.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.920
[Guest]: So, Mujibur Rahman, yes, was very much someone who was there.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.880
[Guest]: The six-point agenda was very much a federal plan.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.960
[Guest]: But in a sense, because of the radicalization of the students who then sort of energized

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.800
[Guest]: the Awami League, took it to a very different level and Mujib was a remarkable leader in

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800
[Guest]: his own right.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.840
[Guest]: I mean, in a sense, he was, you know, he was able to harness those energies, he was able

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.400
[Guest]: to give them voice and expression in a way that I think was quite remarkable at that

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.400
[Guest]: point of time.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.760
[Guest]: But yes, he was also hamstrung by the fact that much of the energy behind his sort of

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.080
[Guest]: political party and the six-point demand was now being channeled through younger people

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.440
[Guest]: who wanted more.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And an interesting analog that comes to mind, I did a recent episode with the historian

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Gyan Prakash in The Emergency.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.240
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I sort of learned reading his book was that, I mean, obviously, there

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.920
[Amit Varma]: was similar student sort of unrest in India as well.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:42.440
[Amit Varma]: And there, again, when there was a student unrest in 74-75, it starts as a student unrest

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.560
[Amit Varma]: in Bihar with the likes of Lalu and Nitesh, who are the student leaders.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.380
[Amit Varma]: But it only really gathers momentum when an older leader like Jayaprakash Narayan comes

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.760
[Amit Varma]: and kind of takes it over.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.680
[Amit Varma]: And it, I mean, again, a similar thing in Bangladesh, where it's a student revolt proper

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.600
[Amit Varma]: and Mujib sort of becomes a figurehead of the thing.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Is that something common to kind of student movements where they have to, you know?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.920
[Guest]: So, you know, the great historian Eric Hobsbawm used to say that, you know, the problem with

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.920
[Guest]: student politics is that, you know, each student generation is only about two or three years

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920
[Unknown]: in its time.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920
[Unknown]: Right?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.200
[Guest]: It's a transient politics.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.280
[Guest]: It is difficult to give it kind of institutional structure and framework, which will allow

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.880
[Guest]: it to be played over a reasonable period of time to bring about student change.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.240
[Guest]: Of course, one way of solving the problem is the way that Indian political parties do,

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240
[Guest]: right?

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.760
[Guest]: You have these youth wings, which are led by people who are in their 40s, as if any

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.200
[Guest]: of that counts as student politics.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.640
[Guest]: But the real energy of student politics really is people who believe that, whose idealism

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.720
[Guest]: leads them to believe that, you know, all the structures of possibility can be done

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.480
[Guest]: away with and you can actually aim at something a lot more.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.400
[Guest]: But that needs to be channelized through formal politics of a certain kind.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.920
[Guest]: And Mujibur Rahman was, I think, the right man at the right time.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.160
[Guest]: And, you know, that's partly the reason he's so venerated in Bangladesh.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.280
[Guest]: I mean, you know, he was named Bongo Bandhu at that point of time.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.400
[Guest]: And partly because, you know, he was a phenomenal orator, a very charismatic leader, someone

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.960
[Guest]: who understood what the needs of the time were, but was still trying to see if there

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.160
[Guest]: could be some way out, which did not involve excessive sort of violence and bloodshed and

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest]: so on.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, another interesting sort of learning that came up on me from your book

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.360
[Amit Varma]: was that contrary to popular hindsight perception, it's not like Mujib wanted independence from

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360
[Amit Varma]: the start.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.360
[Amit Varma]: And, and even later, as we find, it's not like Indira was this great warrior who wanted

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.120
[Amit Varma]: to bring Bangladesh to independence, they were both almost very reluctant for a long

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.240
[Amit Varma]: part of that journey till events force themselves upon these two people.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.560
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that's certainly true of Mujibur Rahman, see, because the elections of 1970,

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.840
[Guest]: by the time the election results come out in December 1970, it is very clear that the

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.800
[Guest]: Awami League is the single largest party.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.960
[Guest]: But there is a structural problem in as much as the Awami League has won pretty much every

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.320
[Guest]: seat in East Pakistan, barring two, but has won no seat in West Pakistan.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.980
[Guest]: And the biggest West Pakistani party was Pakistan's People's Party, PPP, which still exists.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:01.320
[Guest]: Then a new party recently founded by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, which had did a reasonably good

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.520
[Guest]: showing in West Pakistan, but managed to sort of do almost nothing in the East.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.400
[Guest]: So there was this kind of cleavage between these two sides, in a sense that there was

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.220
[Guest]: no political force, which was able to bridge this kind of East West barrier, so to speak.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.720
[Guest]: But if you were talking about a normal parliamentary system of democracy, the natural thing would

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.600
[Guest]: have been to invite the leader of the largest party to form government, and that is precisely

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.840
[Guest]: what Mujib and the Awami League were hoping would happen.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.120
[Guest]: But the army and, you know, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had different plans, and so things took a

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.120
[Guest]: very different turn.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So Yahya was almost blindsided by the results, he didn't expect it.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.040
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, because he, you know, gave his prognosis to the Americans who trusted him

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.000
[Amit Varma]: so much, even they were blindsided by it.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.120
[Guest]: Well, I think everyone was taken to a greater or lesser extent by the, you know, by surprise

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.240
[Guest]: of the outcome, particularly of the Awami League's sort of extraordinary performance

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240
[Guest]: in the East.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: You know, I think that was something that the Pakistan army did not foresee.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.360
[Guest]: And of course, the Pakistan military and its intelligence agencies had, you know, had done

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.040
[Guest]: their homework before the elections to make sure that, you know, the outcome would not

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.440
[Guest]: be very unfavorable to what they wanted.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.640
[Guest]: But that turned out to be entirely wrong and, you know, they were caught in a situation

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.680
[Guest]: which they quite did not anticipate would come out.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about Bhutto here, who's the other major player in this, you know,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:20.040
[Amit Varma]: seems to me almost as this sort of immoral genius who is ultimately, as we know in history

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.400
[Amit Varma]: by hindsight, foiled by his own petard.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.160
[Amit Varma]: But what kind of person is he and what's the role that he's playing here?

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.480
[Amit Varma]: What does he want out of all this?

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Because he's also been a conventional politician long before this.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.360
[Amit Varma]: He's been with Ayub Khan, he's been a minister and so on.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.160
[Guest]: Yeah, so Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto is, you know, is at least in sheer terms of his political

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.960
[Guest]: skill a human, you know, something bordering on genius in terms of the way that he was

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.800
[Guest]: able to rise through the Pakistani system.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.280
[Guest]: You know, here was someone who sort of began working in the Ayub Khan administration as

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.480
[Guest]: a junior minister, then became very important, became, you know, effectively sort of, you

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.120
[Guest]: know, in charge of foreign affairs in that context, egged Ayub Khan to sort of attack

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.960
[Guest]: India in 1965.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.920
[Guest]: And then when the war went pear shaped, actually turned around against his old patron, saying

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.120
[Guest]: that, you know, Pakistan had been let down and so on, and then went on to find the Pakistan

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.240
[Guest]: People's Party, you know, came up with a political style and platform, which was an interesting

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.200
[Guest]: amalgam of the left and the sort of right and so on, nationalist, but also very leftist,

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.280
[Guest]: you know, because of his role in Pakistan's outreach to China post 1962, the war between

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.320
[Guest]: India and China, you know, the leftists were always sort of very wary of taking him on

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.880
[Guest]: because he was seen as someone who had, you know, those links with China and so on.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.440
[Guest]: So and it was an extraordinary demagogue, someone who was a very charismatic figure,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.560
[Guest]: who was able to sort of tap into both older forms of politics, you know, he himself came

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.760
[Guest]: from Sindh, you know, so he was sort of a very important landlord in the Sindh context,

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.200
[Guest]: had all those other, you know, sort of, you know, the religious leadership and the landed

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.080
[Guest]: leadership there has sort of very close ties.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.320
[Guest]: So he was able to draw on those kinds of tropes of conducting himself, but at the same time

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.480
[Guest]: could also mouth all this sort of radical slogan of roti kapda or makaan, which, you

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.480
[Amit Varma]: know, he said,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Which I was amazed to, I saw it, I said, no, no, either Indira said it or is from Bollywood,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.240
[Guest]: it cannot possibly be, but it is very much his and he was able to craft a political movement,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.520
[Guest]: which in a very short span of time, was able to sort of, you know, create a position for

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.200
[Guest]: itself, which is quite remarkable.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.240
[Guest]: It is all the more remarkable because, you know, he had to do it, obviously, under the

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.320
[Guest]: constraints of operating under a military rule of various kinds and someone whom he

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.520
[Guest]: had himself alienated, which is Ayub Khan.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.480
[Guest]: So I think, you know, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was quite a remarkable figure in his time,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.360
[Guest]: both during the war, but also subsequently.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.760
[Guest]: And I think, you know, Pakistani history is yet to give him his due in not in a sense

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.920
[Guest]: of appreciating his achievements.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.520
[Guest]: I think he was a very mercurial figure with some, you know, really sort of, you know,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.320
[Guest]: nasty things to his credit as well.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.080
[Guest]: But just acknowledging his importance as a historical figure in the history of Pakistan,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.840
[Guest]: I think that that angle of it needs to be, you know, dealt with further by historians.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, moral genius went a long way.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And as you mentioned, who could as a politician be all things to all people, which, you know,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.320
[Amit Varma]: is a skill Narendra Modi himself kind of demonstrated in 2014.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.880
[Amit Varma]: We don't know how much of it will sort of carry over.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, so the elections are over at the end of 70.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.040
[Amit Varma]: And Yahya is kind of blindsided by the whole result.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And even Bhutto isn't extremely happy because you know, what the hell, I mean, the Awami

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.920
[Amit Varma]: League has just got many more seats than him and he's going to have to deal with them at

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920
[Amit Varma]: some point.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And he had assumed that it will be like, he'll be the politician who will rule Pakistan with

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.400
[Amit Varma]: the army at his wings.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So I think you quote somewhere in the book where he tells Yahya that I'll be the politician,

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.080
[Amit Varma]: you'll be the general, and they'll kind of rule together.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.440
[Amit Varma]: And all that's gone.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.840
[Amit Varma]: And both Yahya and Bhutto now sort of collude to stop Mujib from taking over.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about, you know, those months when that collusion is active.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.400
[Guest]: Yeah, so that effectively happens between January and late March 1971 is the period

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.520
[Guest]: of post election sort of wrangling and negotiations.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.280
[Guest]: In a sense, stuff which would never have happened, I mean, in any parliamentary democracy, the

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.320
[Guest]: only job for Yahya Khan would have been to sort of convene the sort of National Assembly

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.960
[Guest]: and they also wanted to have a Constituent Assembly and so on, you know, whatever it

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.960
[Guest]: was Mujibur Rahman should have been invited to form the government.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: But instead of that, they sort of tried to get Mujibur Rahman to accept what the outlines

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.240
[Guest]: of a future constitutional settlement would be primarily with a view to securing the army's

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.480
[Guest]: own role and getting assurances from him before anything else could be done.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.640
[Guest]: And those negotiations then sort of went nowhere.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.480
[Guest]: And in that time, Bhutto very quickly insinuated himself into the picture by saying that, you

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.760
[Guest]: know, he was not the army's favorite when this whole story began.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.680
[Guest]: But by the time the sort of negotiations are kind of in the middle, Bhutto is able to play

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.080
[Guest]: spoiler by telling the army on the one hand that, listen, if you're going to do this kind

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.240
[Guest]: of a deal and allow them to come without assurances for the West Pakistanis and so on, it's going

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240
[Guest]: to be a non-starter.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.040
[Guest]: So he's on the one hand, raising the stakes constantly.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.760
[Guest]: But on the other hand, he's also giving them indications saying that, listen, we cannot

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.800
[Guest]: adopt what he calls a Turkish model at that point of time, right, I mean, Turkey's a sort

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.920
[Guest]: of example of the Islamic country that, you know, they sort of wanted to be, which is

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.320
[Guest]: that to say that, you know, you have the military, but you also have civilians and, you know,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.680
[Guest]: you have some kind of a modesty when I working out at that point of time.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:17.000
[Guest]: And so, in a sense, effectively, Yahya and the military regime and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.600
[Guest]: converge towards this point where they finally come to a decision that, you know, Mujibur

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.840
[Guest]: Rahman has to be stopped in his tracks, and that this moment for the creation of, you

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.120
[Guest]: know, a new polity where Mujib and the Awami League would play such an important role,

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.560
[Guest]: and the Punjabis and the West Pakistan military, etc, is going to be downgraded in its importance,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.560
[Guest]: should not be allowed to pass.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.960
[Guest]: And it's at that moment that, you know, things really start going downhill.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, there's a funky quote a little when the crisis is a little later on, probably

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.760
[Amit Varma]: from March, where a senior general tells Yahya Khan, quote, don't worry, we won't allow these

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.960
[Amit Varma]: black bastards to rule over us, stop quote.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's very clear even at that point that Yahya doesn't want to sort of respect the

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.440
[Amit Varma]: democratic expression and, you know, he's trying to control the process.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.360
[Amit Varma]: What is the outcome he's actually aiming for?

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.400
[Guest]: I mean, I think, I mean, it's again difficult to say, because, you know, nowhere is it very

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.400
[Guest]: clearly laid down.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.240
[Guest]: These were all things which were done under the guise of coming up with some kind of a

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.160
[Guest]: constitutional arrangement and so on.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.280
[Guest]: But I think what Yahya would have been sort of quite satisfied with was a, if you know,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.800
[Guest]: you came up with some structure where he remained president, where the army's budgets and its

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.280
[Guest]: control over sort of, you know, various kinds of important policy issues remained outside

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.560
[Guest]: the purview of democratic politics.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.240
[Guest]: And then basically, you know, as long as Sayyed Mujib was willing to, you know, take on board

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.400
[Guest]: some, you know, West Pakistani sort of representation in his government and so on.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.280
[Guest]: So, in a sense, those were the kinds of things that he wanted to do.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.400
[Guest]: But in effect, all of that would have meant, from Mujib's standpoint, a significant dilution

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.760
[Guest]: of the issues on which the election were fought and won by the Awami League.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.960
[Amit Varma]: Especially because, you know, now because of the radicalism of a lot of his support,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.640
[Amit Varma]: the student movement and all of that, he's kind of forced into a corner where he has

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:10.840
[Amit Varma]: to insist on the six point charter that he laid out for Bangladeshi autonomy as a minimum

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.880
[Amit Varma]: condition that without that he cannot proceed.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.020
[Amit Varma]: And he's kind of forced into this corner.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.080
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the army cannot accept that either, because Yaya, self-interest, he's

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.520
[Amit Varma]: trying to, you know, consolidate his own position.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And on the side, you have Bhutto playing Yaya.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:31.760
[Amit Varma]: And I presume there's a fair degree of sort of West Pakistani, Urdu speaking, condescension

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.000
[Amit Varma]: towards these, you know, these Bangladeshi, Bengali, East Pakistanis.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: That's right.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: I mean, I think that cultural angle of it comes out quite clearly in the quote that

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: you mentioned.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.880
[Guest]: You know, that there is a strong condescension of Bengalis as somehow being culturally, physically,

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.880
[Guest]: and in every way inferior to the sort of, you know, the West Pakistanis and so on, particularly

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.880
[Guest]: the Punjabis.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.440
[Guest]: So, there was very much that angle to it.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.640
[Guest]: And in fact, that was part of the reason why once the military crackdown began, you know,

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.760
[Guest]: some of it is really hard, because that kind of ethnic angle to, you know, that story becomes

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.440
[Guest]: much more important once the crackdown begins.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And how do those events play out like around March 71?

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.120
[Amit Varma]: How do events take Mujib from a position of still trying to negotiate with Yaya Khan to

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.560
[Amit Varma]: actually going ahead and declaring independence?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:26.000
[Guest]: Well, the reality is that, you know, the convening of the National Assembly is postponed, adjourned,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.080
[Guest]: sine die, you know, for, you know, without a sort of any date that then leads to a sort

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.640
[Guest]: of upsurge on the streets in Bangladesh.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.680
[Guest]: And from that point on, Mujib has to play a careful role, right?

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.760
[Guest]: So, on the one hand, he has to keep the momentum and the upsurge going, because it allows him

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.400
[Guest]: to put pressure on the West Pakistanis.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.520
[Guest]: But at the same time, he doesn't want to be in a position where the Pakistan army believes

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.400
[Guest]: that the situation is getting so out of control, that the only option is to use force to sort

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400
[Guest]: of put them down.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.560
[Guest]: So, he's trying to sort of balance both of these.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.560
[Guest]: There are other problems as well, in a sense that there are non-Bengalis in East Pakistan

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.240
[Guest]: who are being targeted by the Bengalis, as partly because they were seen as Tujus.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.640
[Guest]: So there's another one more layer of ethnic complexity to this.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.560
[Guest]: Many of these are Urdu speaking migrants from Eastern India, like Bihar and other parts

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.760
[Guest]: of Eastern India and so on.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.520
[Guest]: So, he has to keep those kinds of, you know, violence and that kind of tendencies under

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.520
[Guest]: check.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.200
[Guest]: So, it's a very difficult time for him.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.120
[Guest]: And this is also the time when he's tentatively sending feelers to India saying, listen, you

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.480
[Guest]: know, if the Indians were to sort of, you know, make some noises and tell the Pakistanis

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.440
[Guest]: that, you know, we will disapprove of any use of force, etc., then, you know, maybe

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440
[Guest]: the Pakistanis will back off.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.800
[Guest]: So, and then he's trying to tell similar things to the Americans.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.280
[Guest]: So, Mujib is trying pretty much everything, trick in the book to make sure that he can

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.520
[Guest]: come out of the situation, either, you know, with a sort of mandate to form government

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.600
[Guest]: or at least some kind of a power sharing arrangement without tipping over into violence.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.960
[Guest]: And that is what is his thing.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.840
[Guest]: But the Pakistanis are very clear that, at least from about the first week of March onwards,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.320
[Guest]: that talks are simply a fig leaf behind which, a smoke screen behind which they will carry

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.320
[Guest]: on the military buildup.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.560
[Guest]: There was not that much of Pakistani military presence in what later became Bangladesh.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.280
[Guest]: They had to sort of do a buildup.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.080
[Guest]: That buildup was also kind of a little difficult for them to do because India and Pakistan,

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.560
[Guest]: because their own sort of problems, Indians had shut off their airspace to Pakistani.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.840
[Guest]: So the Pakistanis had to do that buildup by going through Sri Lanka, you know, so Colombo

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.120
[Guest]: was a transit point between the two wings.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.280
[Guest]: So, all of that took a little bit of time.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.200
[Guest]: And of course, they wanted to keep the element of surprise and they decided that when they

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.040
[Amit Varma]: would crack down, they would hit really hard.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And Jaya was kind of pretending that he's still interested in talks with Mujib while

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.360
[Amit Varma]: on the one hand, the military buildup is proceeding and he knows he's going to crack down.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.180
[Amit Varma]: So you know, Operation Searchlight, as it's called, starts on March 25th.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.720
[Amit Varma]: At what point does it become an inevitability that it is going to happen?

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720
[Guest]: There's no telling.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.400
[Guest]: Well, I think already, you know, a few days before that it is becoming, you know, in fact,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.220
[Guest]: in those few days, if you just look at the records of the negotiations which are happening,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.960
[Guest]: it seems as if great progress is being made, you know, and in fact, you know, there's a

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960
[Guest]: lot of sense.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.160
[Guest]: And in fact, Mujib's own sort of trusted lieutenants within the Awami League are very conflicted

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.320
[Guest]: about how this is going to play.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.080
[Guest]: Because on the one hand, it suddenly seems like, you know, progress is happening.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.520
[Guest]: So you know, you don't want to sort of, you know, unnecessarily sort of burn that bridge.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.140
[Guest]: You want to try and see if things can sort of move on.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.680
[Guest]: But at the same time, you know, they have their own doubts and concerns.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.360
[Guest]: And in fact, just around the time when the operation begins, you know, people tell Mujib

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.880
[Guest]: and Rahman that, listen, you have to sort of basically leave the country.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:32.280
[Guest]: And Mujib takes a call saying that, you know, if he sort of flees, then the Pakistanis are

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.900
[Guest]: going to really get after his people.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.600
[Guest]: And he says that, no, you know, it's just not possible for me to sort of take that kind

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600
[Guest]: of a move.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600
[Amit Varma]: And then he's captured by the Pakistanis.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Is that a principle stand or is he sort of just or he underestimates the inevitability

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.400
[Amit Varma]: of the military crackdown?

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.360
[Guest]: Well, I mean, at that point, by that point of time, you know, by the time this kind of

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.320
[Guest]: discussion is happening, the military crackdown is already underway.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So he just chooses to.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.640
[Guest]: So he just chooses to say that, listen, instead of making it, you know, his own survival and

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.800
[Guest]: issue on which the Pakistanis will crack down very hard on the rest of the Bengali people,

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.200
[Guest]: it is better that, you know, he sort of takes a stand and decides what he wants to do and

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200
[Guest]: so on.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.440
[Amit Varma]: So we'll take a quick break at this point and we'll come back to talk about India and

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:24.200
[Unknown]: the rest of the world.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:45.200
[Unknown]: But

[Unknown]: On The Sponge Podcast, Ambi Parmeshwaran talks about the time when he was invited to present

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.760
[Unknown]: tax collection and communication strategies.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.160
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue on with your show.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the Scene and Nuancy and I'm chatting with Srinath Raghavan about his brilliant

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.500
[Amit Varma]: book 1971, which examines the Bangladesh war and all the multiple factors which led to

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.600
[Amit Varma]: it happening, which wasn't at all inevitable.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And so far, we've kind of been speaking about the domestic situation in Pakistan, as it

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.280
[Amit Varma]: then was because it was West Pakistan and East Pakistan and Bangladesh didn't exist

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280
[Amit Varma]: at the time.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.200
[Amit Varma]: And now let's talk a little bit about India, Srinath.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.560
[Amit Varma]: So Mujib decides that, okay, he's going to let himself be arrested and so on.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.720
[Amit Varma]: But many of his lieutenants escaped to India.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.920
[Amit Varma]: And all through this crisis, as it's been building up, what's been sort of India's attitude

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.880
[Guest]: towards the Bangladesh question?

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.240
[Guest]: So the Indian government is obviously tracking the situation very closely, particularly after

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.680
[Guest]: the election results come out, because they know that the outcome of the elections is

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.360
[Guest]: something that the Pakistani West Pakistani political establishment and the Pakistan army

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.400
[Guest]: certainly are going to be extremely unhappy with.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.040
[Guest]: And they know that there is a possibility of some kind of a sort of, you know, a breakdown

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.040
[Guest]: of talks entirely.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.560
[Guest]: So that that is very much in the realm of possibility.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.120
[Guest]: But at least broadly speaking, within the government of India, there are kind of differing

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.120
[Guest]: views, right?

00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.600
[Guest]: So on the one hand, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Pakistan High Commissioner,

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:05.400
[Guest]: their view is that in some ways, actually speaking, Mujib and the Pakistan army will

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.840
[Guest]: make a deal.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.280
[Guest]: And that's not such a bad thing for us at all, because it's better for us to have a

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:15.240
[Guest]: Bengali Awami-like sort of prime minister in position than having military rule in Pakistan.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.120
[Guest]: Their stances on a range of issues, which sort of were of most concern to India, like

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.000
[Guest]: Kashmir, etc, were seen as much more sort of moderate and acceptable.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.800
[Guest]: But then, you know, the Indian intelligence agencies, particularly the newly created research

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.720
[Guest]: and analysis wing, the R&DW, which was headed by a man called Arun Kaur, who was a sort

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:39.080
[Guest]: of first, you know, person, you know, and the intelligence agencies, however, felt that

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:45.440
[Guest]: the possibility of a total breakdown and some kind of a resort to armed struggle by the

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.620
[Guest]: Bengali people and the Awami League's base was not something to be discounted.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.160
[Guest]: So there were these kind of two contending views.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.720
[Guest]: The other thing the Indians are concerned is that, you know, maybe in order to divert

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.280
[Guest]: attention from what is happening in East Pakistan, Yahya Khan might take some kind of military

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.800
[Guest]: action in the West, just as a sort of a diversionary thing, and so on, right?

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.600
[Guest]: I mean, so there are all these kinds of things happening.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.000
[Guest]: Now, around the 2nd of March or so, just when the talks are kind of, it's looking like these

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.720
[Guest]: things are not going anywhere, the Indians get a couple of feelers from Mujibur Rahman

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.720
[Guest]: asking them to, you know, make some sort of military mobilization, etc, in order to put

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.000
[Guest]: the fear into the Pakistani minds and then prevent them from sort of deploying troops

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.920
[Guest]: into Pakistan and so on.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.360
[Guest]: And Mujib even meets the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Dhaka to convey the point.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.600
[Guest]: But the Indians are still very unsure about what exactly Mujibur Rahman's sort of thinking

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.280
[Guest]: on these issues is.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.500
[Guest]: Now, again, it's important to remind ourselves that from the perspective of Indian decision

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.680
[Guest]: makers at that time, Mujibur Rahman was a Pakistani politician.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.640
[Guest]: You know, in a sense, obviously, they knew him and had some contacts with him.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.480
[Guest]: But ever since Mujib had sort of gotten embroiled in this thing called the Agartala conspiracy

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:56.440
[Guest]: case, you know, where he was alleged to have sort of, you know, waged a conspiracy to sort

00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.040
[Guest]: of, you know, break up Pakistan, etc, the Indians have been quite wary of being openly

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.280
[Guest]: sort of in contact with him and so on.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.040
[Guest]: So there is a period when Mujibur Rahman actually attempts to reach out, but the Indian political

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.720
[Guest]: reaction is a little confused.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.160
[Guest]: And again, the Indians are reading this development towards the last week before the crackdown

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.400
[Guest]: as the situation is actually improving, right?

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.840
[Guest]: That's everyone, including the army leaders thought things were kind of getting better.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.000
[Guest]: So as with any such situation, you know, you have sort of conflicting assessments of what

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.440
[Guest]: is likely to happen.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.080
[Guest]: So in a sense, the Indians were also a little sort of surprised when the crackdown actually

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.080
[Guest]: took place.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.480
[Guest]: So it was not something that they were absolutely sure was what the next step was going to be.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of complicated by the fact that they would like Mujib to be Prime Minister

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.960
[Amit Varma]: of Pakistan for the reasons you discussed, but they're not so sure about Bangladesh.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.360
[Amit Varma]: So it's a sort of, you know, they haven't yet reached the stage where the, you know,

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.560
[Amit Varma]: an independent Bangladesh is not necessarily in Indian wishes.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.880
[Amit Varma]: Why invite chaos in the neighborhood?

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.880
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, I think you mentioned there was a bit of a fear that an independent

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Bangladesh, the leftist elements might get closer to the Chinese than to the Soviets.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.520
[Amit Varma]: And then that just complicates the geopolitics of the whole thing.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.120
[Guest]: Not just geopolitics, but also India's own domestic politics.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.120
[Guest]: The Indian government at that time was cracking down very heavily on the Naxalite movement,

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.960
[Guest]: which was of course, in West Bengal was one of the main areas where that was happening.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.520
[Guest]: So there was this concern that, you know, student and Naxal radicals in Indian part

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.260
[Guest]: of Bengal might team up with those on the other side and so on.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.520
[Guest]: But I think more fundamentally, you know, at that point of time, it is still too premature

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.120
[Guest]: to think of an independent Bangladesh.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.600
[Guest]: And again, that's where, you know, we have to allow for the distancing from the hindsight.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.720
[Guest]: You know, what looks like obviously the right solution to us was not at all something which

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.880
[Guest]: was easily conceivable.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.320
[Guest]: You're talking of breaking up another country and, you know, and that meant that, you know,

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.240
[Guest]: the movement on the ground had to have the force.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.560
[Guest]: I mean, the Indians always, you know, they had to assess first whether the Awami League

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560
[Guest]: was serious.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.640
[Guest]: What was its leadership in the absence of Mujibur Rahman?

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.480
[Guest]: How much could you sort of trust the others to sort of carry on the struggle?

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.320
[Guest]: Did they have the moral and physical sort of, you know, reserves to be able to go on

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.520
[Guest]: even if India provided material support, right?

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.880
[Guest]: So all of these issues were still to be debated, thought.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.720
[Guest]: So you know, assuming that the choices only between either acquiescing in a Pakistani

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.960
[Guest]: crackdown or plumping for independence of Bangladesh, I think is a very dichotomous

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.480
[Guest]: choice which just was not in people's minds at that point of time.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And was also partly complicated by sort of India taking the high moral ground when it

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.440
[Amit Varma]: came to Kashmir and saying, hey, this is only our internal matter and no one else must interfere.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And having taken this stance, it would now be very awkward for them to interfere in Pakistan's

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.160
[Guest]: internal matter, as it were.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.160
[Guest]: Right.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.600
[Guest]: So when the first Bangladeshi politicians from the Awami League started coming into

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.560
[Guest]: India, established contact with the Indian security forces, the BSF, you know, and the

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.640
[Guest]: R&DW and others, the Indians were still unsure whether they should be sort of seen as actively

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.640
[Guest]: intervening in this.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.320
[Guest]: For one, this whole principle of non-interference, which is a kind of an established position

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.680
[Guest]: of India in this whole story.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.120
[Guest]: The second reason why the Indians were not so sure that they should be able to, they

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.760
[Guest]: should actually sort of intervene in this issue in any serious way was because they

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.200
[Guest]: were just unsure of what the sort of movement would look like in the absence of a leader

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200
[Guest]: like Mujibur Rahman.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.160
[Guest]: You know, you had to sort of make some assessment about whether this would be a movement which

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.280
[Guest]: was capable of actually sort of pushing towards independence in a serious way.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.280
[Guest]: And the third thing, of course, was that already by that time, there was a big hue and cry

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.440
[Guest]: in the Indian parliament and so on, saying that, you know, India has to sort of act and

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440
[Guest]: such like things.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that, you know, this Indira Gandhi in the aftermath of the Bangladesh

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:30.920
[Amit Varma]: war was, of course, praised hyperbolically by one opposition person as Madhurga.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:36.160
[Guest]: It's difficult to figure out where exactly he said that, but it's now part of the common

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.160
[Amit Varma]: lore.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.160
[Amit Varma]: It's part of the common folklore.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.480
[Amit Varma]: So it doesn't matter if it happened or not, it happened.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing in your book is that she's actually also very reluctant to

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.800
[Amit Varma]: kind of get involved, like exactly as you're saying, she's very wary.

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, she remarks to someone that there must be, you know, most of parliament

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:57.280
[Amit Varma]: wants her to act against Bangladesh and only it'll be hard to find a couple of people who

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.920
[Amit Varma]: will actually support her stance on it.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And she's playing this very careful role.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:07.880
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, while India isn't actively thinking of an independent Bangladesh or moving

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:13.800
[Amit Varma]: in to make that happen, the army is still providing support to sort of the rebels and

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.120
[Amit Varma]: the militants outside.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.520
[Amit Varma]: What is the sort of thinking behind that?

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.440
[Amit Varma]: Like first saying, we don't want to get involved, it's your internal matter, God knows what

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440
[Amit Varma]: will happen.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.440
[Amit Varma]: And but then actually still helping the rebellion.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.800
[Guest]: Well, in fact, the help on the ground happens even before these political decisions started

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.800
[Unknown]: to be made.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.360
[Guest]: The reality is that these are people who are fleeing military sort of attacks and coming

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.360
[Guest]: across the border.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:38.640
[Guest]: They're not just ordinary citizens, but also let's remember, you know, there are units

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.520
[Guest]: of the Bangladesh Pakistan army, which is the Bengali regiments, which also sort of

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.760
[Guest]: come onto the Indian side, right?

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.400
[Guest]: So that's that then becomes the nucleus of what would later become the main fighting

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.000
[Guest]: force that you would use.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.800
[Guest]: So and then, you know, many of them wanted sort of various kinds of assistance in order

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800
[Guest]: to come together.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.080
[Guest]: There are senior army leaders, apart from Ujjain Bur Rahman, were trickling into India

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.520
[Guest]: from various parts.

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.640
[Guest]: So in a sense, not responding to any of that was also not an option.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, I think the initial Indian feeling was very much that, you know,

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.080
[Guest]: you just, yes, you sort of bring them in, you sort of create some kind of structures

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.560
[Guest]: to, you know, accommodate them in camps and various kinds of things.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.360
[Guest]: But that will also then allow you to keep a lid on what is happening, right?

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.040
[Guest]: It's not necessarily the case that you're already thinking of them as being, in fact,

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.600
[Guest]: you know, the decision to sort of really scale up support to the, you know, the army and

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.320
[Guest]: the Bengali fighters doesn't happen until later in the summer of 1971.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.960
[Guest]: In fact, some of the notes which are made by the R&DW, because they were the ones who

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.080
[Guest]: were directly dealing with many of these people, suggest a great degree of unhappiness with

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:39.400
[Guest]: India in the early months, you know, especially in May, June, July, saying Indians are not

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.680
[Guest]: giving us enough ammunition, they have rationed us to five rounds a day and so on.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.680
[Guest]: All of that was, you know, partly because of material constraints on the part of India,

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:51.840
[Guest]: but also partly because you did not really think that, you know, you wanted to sort of

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.280
[Guest]: scale up support in that way.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.720
[Guest]: It's only in those months that the idea really begins that, yes, we have to sort of systematically

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.040
[Guest]: start doing these, you establish training camps.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.800
[Guest]: So everything happens somewhat gradually.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.240
[Guest]: And Mrs. Gandhi and PN Huxar and others are genuinely quite cautious about what should

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240
[Guest]: be done, right?

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.840
[Guest]: In fact, there is another sort of folklore around this is this claim by General Maniksha,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.160
[Guest]: you know, well after Mrs. Gandhi's death, you know, he's said in public quite a few

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.360
[Guest]: times that Mrs. Gandhi actually called him to a cabinet meeting and said that, listen,

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.320
[Guest]: why can't the army go into Bangladesh now?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.880
[Guest]: He says it's in May 1971.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.520
[Guest]: And then he said that, no, no, no, we have to wait, the army has to be prepared, the

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.080
[Guest]: monsoons have to get over, then we will sort of go in.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.320
[Guest]: So, you know, and then she agreed, but, you know, that's a piece of myth making, which

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.120
[Guest]: I think does very little credit to any of the people involved.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:45.320
[Amit Varma]: And for all the myth making of both Mrs. Gandhi and Maniksha as sort of hawks and these brave

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.680
[Amit Varma]: figures, even Maniksha was fairly reluctant in the sense that, you know, just before the

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.880
[Amit Varma]: war starts, it's like he doesn't want to go all the way to Dhaka and he's one of them,

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.240
[Amit Varma]: he's one of the people who's kind of arguing for restraint, just taking enough territory

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.240
[Amit Varma]: to send the migrants back and its junior officers, like a gentleman named Jacob, who sort of

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240
[Amit Varma]: say that, no, no, it's very much within the realm of possibility.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240
[Guest]: So, yeah.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.560
[Guest]: So, you know, we'll talk about that aspect of it in a little bit.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.200
[Guest]: But at this point of time, I think, you know, this point is worth making because this is

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.920
[Guest]: the most commonly held notion in India that Indira Gandhi actually sort of wanted to,

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.400
[Guest]: you know, or would have asked Maniksha to sort of do this, but actually it's untrue.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.840
[Guest]: In fact, right from the very beginning, from the day the crackdown begins, the thinking

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.640
[Guest]: of Mrs. Gandhi is shaped quite decisively by P. N. Aksar, who's our closest advisor

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.440
[Guest]: on these matters, and who's a very experienced diplomat, and who makes it quite clear to

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.040
[Guest]: her that, you know, we should not be seen as overtly sort of intervening in the affairs

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.600
[Guest]: of Pakistan, and that if anything, we have to create the ground for the movement to become

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.400
[Guest]: stronger and for India to then act decisively if necessary.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.560
[Guest]: And the position that we should take is that the influx of all of these refugees into India,

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.160
[Guest]: the number becomes something like close to 10 million by the end of the summer, is an

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.560
[Guest]: unacceptable situation for a country like ours, and conditions have to be created in

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.640
[Guest]: Bangladesh where those people go back.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.440
[Guest]: And in fact, what is also clear from the documents that are now available is that Mrs. Gandhi,

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.680
[Guest]: even before that putative meeting with the army chief, actually calls her, you know,

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.320
[Guest]: the leaders of the opposition and briefs them saying that, please do not make this an issue.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.260
[Guest]: This is something that is best sort of, you know, you should trust us, we will keep you

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.680
[Guest]: informed and, you know, leaders like Adil B. Haribachpai sort of actually go along at

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.960
[Guest]: that point of time.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.800
[Guest]: But it is also true that there were sections within the Congress party, including her own

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.680
[Guest]: cabinet, people who believe that the, you know, the anger amongst Indian people on this

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.000
[Guest]: was such that, you know, you had to do something and, you know, this is a moment to act and

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
[Guest]: so on.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.600
[Guest]: And it's in that context that Mrs. Gandhi actually calls in Maniksha for the meeting,

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.640
[Guest]: primarily to let her colleagues hear from the army chief what is it that he thinks is

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.080
[Guest]: the military assessment.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.440
[Guest]: So I don't think it's at all true that Mrs. Gandhi wanted a precipitated invasion and

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.560
[Guest]: that she was persuaded otherwise by Maniksha.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.400
[Amit Varma]: And part of what seems to force her hand and change her mind, and again, it shows how contingency

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: plays a role is not just the amount of migration into India from Bangladesh, but the composition

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.080
[Amit Varma]: of it, like you point out how early on when migrants first came, when refugees started

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:07.040
[Amit Varma]: coming in, they were majority Muslim, basically the same demographic as Bangladesh itself.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:12.560
[Amit Varma]: But gradually, as the numbers grew to 5 million, and then to alarmingly to 8 million, and beyond,

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.960
[Amit Varma]: as you point out, where the sheer number of refugees, number one became a logistical impossibility

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.960
[Amit Varma]: and a huge fiscal burden on India.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: But also it was now 80% Hindu 20% Muslim, which therefore indicated that those Hindus

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.920
[Amit Varma]: were fleeing in large numbers, because there was a genocide underway, and that the human

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.720
[Amit Varma]: rights violations, which people sort of had a sense of were far graver than people had

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720
[Amit Varma]: suspected.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, the combination of the fiscal burden of taking care of all these refugees

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.760
[Amit Varma]: forced Indira Gandhi into a stand where she had to insist that number one, the refugees

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.760
[Amit Varma]: have to go back, but number two, because there's a genocide underway till you find a political

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.000
[Amit Varma]: solution within Pakistan, you can't possibly go back, send them back.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.760
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of the other nations of the world, which we will come to, but in the foreign,

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.680
[Amit Varma]: in the international arena, refused to accept that these two could be tied together.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.560
[Amit Varma]: They were like, sort of saying that, yeah, you have a migration problem will help you

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.680
[Amit Varma]: with that in a humanitarian sense.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.520
[Amit Varma]: But this is not tied to the political problem where Indira Gandhi clearly saw that it was.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.960
[Guest]: Well, it and it was in practical terms, because you are talking about a number like 10 million

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.720
[Guest]: refugees coming on to a country like India, which was already a pretty poor country at

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.720
[Guest]: that point of time.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.520
[Guest]: I mean, we only have to look at the scale of say Syrian refugee influx into Europe today,

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.320
[Guest]: and the kind of unrest that it has done in European politics, right?

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.040
[Guest]: I mean, what do you expect a poor country like India to be able to do?

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.360
[Guest]: A place like Tripura, suddenly had three times the number of migrants as the total number

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360
[Guest]: of population in that state.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.360
[Guest]: Right.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.920
[Guest]: I mean, so it was a demographic sort of…

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.640
[Unknown]: But they will go back, I mean…

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.120
[Guest]: So, yes, I mean, so that's again part of the sort of afterlife of 1971 crisis.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.600
[Guest]: And, you know, even in the context of Assam, we are still facing all of those things, right?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.040
[Guest]: Saying how many people went, what is the right date and so on.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.680
[Guest]: So, some of that is there.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.960
[Guest]: But for the Indians, the key thing was to try and keep these people under reasonably

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.960
[Guest]: sort of controlled conditions, so that you would ensure their eventual repatriation back

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.960
[Guest]: to Bangladesh.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.600
[Guest]: So, that angle of it, the line that, you know, conditions have to be created such that people

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.920
[Guest]: can go back was a very carefully chosen one, because the only imperative way that people

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.920
[Guest]: have to go back.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.240
[Guest]: What those conditions would be was left for Pakistan and the international community and

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.620
[Guest]: everyone else to sort of help arrive at, right?

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:22.040
[Guest]: If Pakistanis sort of chose to come to some kind of a modest way and die with Mujib and,

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.600
[Guest]: you know, came with some solution, and the refugees could go back, maybe the Indians

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600
[Guest]: would have been fine.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
[Guest]: If not, they would go back to an independent country, right?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.320
[Guest]: I mean, but that transition had to happen over a period of time.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.240
[Guest]: So, that was one major consideration, right, which is that just the sheer number of sort

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240
[Guest]: of people.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.360
[Guest]: The second thing is about this, you know, the number of sort of Hindu refugees which

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.040
[Guest]: came in, which again is a number which the Indian government never ever during that crisis

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.760
[Guest]: revealed that there were so many Hindus, partly because they believed that if this was revealed,

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.720
[Guest]: it would lead to a backlash against Muslims in India.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.600
[Guest]: And again, we had seen that dynamic in older migrations, you know, 1950, there was a crisis

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.720
[Guest]: between East Pakistan and West Bengal, you know, and then so on.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.160
[Guest]: So, she was very keen not to allow those kinds of things to happen.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:06.280
[Guest]: But at the same time, the other danger was that, you know, Hindu-Bengalis, you know,

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.680
[Guest]: could sort of, you know, if they sort of melted into local populations would then be even

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.040
[Guest]: more difficult to sort of identify than Muslim-Bengalis, right?

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.800
[Guest]: I mean, so, in that sense, you know, you were concerned about what would be the aftermath

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.960
[Guest]: of this kind of refugee flows and so on.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.360
[Guest]: So, there was this range of considerations for which, you know, by the summer of 1971,

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.560
[Guest]: the Indian government comes to this conclusion that the best way is to mount a big international

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:36.400
[Guest]: diplomatic campaign to get the big powers to put pressure on Pakistan to create conditions

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.400
[Guest]: under which this would happen.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.800
[Guest]: And the Indians were very careful never to specify what is it that they wanted.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.680
[Guest]: Because again, you know, you didn't want to be seen as interfering in Pakistan's internal

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.680
[Guest]: affairs.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.320
[Guest]: But gradually by that summer, the opinion is shifting to saying that in the face of

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.360
[Guest]: continued Pakistani reluctance and intransigence and refusal to either stop military operations

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.520
[Guest]: or to move towards a political settlement, the possibility of a united Pakistan sticking

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.600
[Amit Varma]: together is getting increasingly remote.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting how this is driven partly by Indira Gandhi just being very principled

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.800
[Amit Varma]: against the human rights violation and the genocide and so on.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And also the very admirable stance she takes to not reveal the numbers of Hindus because

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.600
[Amit Varma]: she wants to, you know, I'm a huge critic of Indira Gandhi, especially because of her

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.160
[Amit Varma]: disastrous economic policies, many of which I consider a crime on humanity.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.680
[Amit Varma]: But I have to say she comes out looking very good in this book for some of the decisions

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680
[Amit Varma]: she's taken.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.720
[Amit Varma]: But equally, a lot of her imperatives are just practical imperatives, there are too

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.720
[Amit Varma]: many refugees, India doesn't have the money, it needs to get something done.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.920
[Amit Varma]: And she talks of this political solution again in vague terms and very correctly not specifying

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.720
[Amit Varma]: anything because it's not her prerogative to do so.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.700
[Amit Varma]: So Pakistan to sort out its internal affairs.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:48.640
[Amit Varma]: At this point in time, you know, as the summer proceeds, is there any possibility of such

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.400
[Amit Varma]: a political solution or has that ship sailed?

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.480
[Guest]: Well, that ship has sailed partly because the crackdown continues until quite late,

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:00.000
[Guest]: which is why the numbers are increasing as you go along through the summer.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.220
[Guest]: But the possibility is also receding because the main power, external power, which could

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:10.720
[Guest]: have done something in this context, the United States of America under Richard Nixon, which

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.440
[Guest]: had significant sort of stakes in their relations with Pakistan was totally unwilling to do

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440
[Guest]: anything to do with Pakistan.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440
[Guest]: Right.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.840
[Guest]: And hence, Nixon, you know, in a famous instruction to his sort of, you know, White House staff

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.360
[Guest]: and the, you know, the State Department, etc. says, do not squeeze Yaya, right?

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.520
[Guest]: This is what he writes on the margins of a note.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.920
[Guest]: And the reason he does not want to squeeze Yaya is because Yaya is very important to

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.920
[Guest]: him at this point of time, because the United States wants to reach out to Maoist China,

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.920
[Guest]: right?

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.720
[Guest]: And they don't have, those countries don't have a relationship.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.720
[Guest]: And China is kind of, you know, Pakistan is acting as a conduit through which messages

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.960
[Guest]: are being sent by the Nixon White House.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.880
[Guest]: And I must say it's the White House, because, you know, Nixon is, all of this is clandestine

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.520
[Amit Varma]: and hidden even from other parts of the US government at that time, the State Department.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.280
[Amit Varma]: It's really funny how Nixon and Kissinger are sort of one party here and the State Department

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280
[Amit Varma]: is another party.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.720
[Guest]: It's like completely, they're antagonists.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.480
[Guest]: No, no, because they believe that if, if the news of such an attempt leaked out, there

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.160
[Guest]: would be such a political backlash that they would not be able to go through with it.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.840
[Guest]: So they wanted to keep it totally secret.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.560
[Guest]: And of course, Nixon and Kissinger were, you know, legendary sort of secretive, furtive

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.160
[Guest]: sort of characters.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.160
[Guest]: And you know, the modus operandi was basically that Henry Kissinger would call in the Pakistani

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.760
[Guest]: ambassador in Washington and hand him a note.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.480
[Guest]: The ambassador would then relate over secret cables to Islamabad.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.000
[Guest]: In Islamabad, the foreign office would call the sort of Chinese ambassador and relate

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
[Guest]: to him.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.840
[Guest]: And he would in turn then relate to Beijing.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.240
[Guest]: And then vice versa, the messages used to come down the truth.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.060
[Guest]: So this was a sort of complicated arrangement.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:44.760
[Guest]: And it was in, you know, the summer of 1971 that Henry Kissinger was to make his sort

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.480
[Guest]: of secret pathbreaking visit to meet the Chinese leadership.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.480
[Guest]: So at least till that happened, the Americans were absolutely clear that they would not

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.240
[Guest]: want to put any pressure on the Pakistanis, which meant that there was hardly any serious

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.880
[Guest]: pressure going on the Yahya Khan regime at that point of time.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.960
[Amit Varma]: We're really glad you finally got the US into this, because after talking about how your

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.520
[Amit Varma]: book is a strike against the insularity of the way we look at the Bangladesh affair,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.880
[Amit Varma]: all we've done for more than an hour is speak about India and Pakistan and Bangladesh entirely

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880
[Amit Varma]: my fault.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to the US now.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.000
[Amit Varma]: I've already had a very illuminating episode with you on the US and South Asia and how

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.680
[Amit Varma]: those relations evolved over the period of time that will be linked in the episode page.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.600
[Amit Varma]: So listeners can listen to that to get a broader sense of how the US viewed South Asia.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.000
[Amit Varma]: But just to sort of give me a quick recap post independence, like the US's attitude

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.120
[Amit Varma]: in 1947 in dealing with South Asia very much was to just follow the British lead because

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.240
[Amit Varma]: there are allies, you know, they've been there, they know the ground situation, we'll do whatever

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240
[Amit Varma]: they say.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.060
[Guest]: How does it evolve from there?

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:52.160
[Guest]: So effectively, that's the American policy from about 1947 till 1950 when the Korean

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.160
[Guest]: War begins, right?

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.000
[Guest]: So once the Korean War begins, the Americans are very concerned that the Soviet Union and

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.600
[Guest]: the communist bloc will sort of potentially carry out a similar kind of a strike in the

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:07.000
[Guest]: Persian Gulf, and, you know, in order to prevent that they needed allies who would sort of

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.480
[Guest]: line up against the Soviet Union and so on.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.880
[Guest]: That then leads to the search for various kinds of allies and Pakistan is identified

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.080
[Guest]: as a significant other country alongside Turkey and Iran, which would form the sort of northern

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.640
[Guest]: tier against the Soviet Union.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.600
[Guest]: And then the US Pakistan alliance is consummated in 1954.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.720
[Guest]: But of course, the Americans very quickly start having second thoughts because they

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.360
[Guest]: realize that the Pakistanis are not in a position really to deliver on much of the story.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.160
[Guest]: And so there is a tilt towards sort of, you know, redressing the balance vis-a-vis India

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.420
[Guest]: and Pakistan under John F. Kennedy initially.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.760
[Guest]: And by the time the sort of Lyndon Johnson comes to power and you have around 1965 when

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.780
[Guest]: India and Pakistan are at war.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.620
[Guest]: So Johnson is kind of fed up of, you know, United States having to mediate between India

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.300
[Guest]: and Pakistan over Kashmir and this and that.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:57.920
[Guest]: And he basically takes a sort of a plague on both the houses kind of attitude and in

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.860
[Guest]: the 1965 war, the United States imposes an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.000
[Guest]: And of course, Pakistanis because they have more American kit are, you know, feel the

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.500
[Guest]: pinch stronger.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.680
[Guest]: But after that, the United States kind of, you know, is more deeply involved in Vietnam.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.580
[Guest]: There are these growing domestic sort of protests, you know, Johnson is kind of bogged down.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.280
[Guest]: But when Richard Nixon comes to power, he is very keen to revive and resuscitate the

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.880
[Guest]: relationship with Pakistan.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.640
[Guest]: Now let's remember, recall that Nixon was vice president under, you know, President

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.600
[Guest]: Eisenhower when the US Pakistan military alliance was signed.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.200
[Guest]: So he was one of the original votaries of the relationship with Pakistan.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.640
[Guest]: And he always believed, like many Americans share this common prejudice that Indians are

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.440
[Guest]: this weak effect, you know, useless, unreliable kind of people.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.340
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I'm going to interrupt you and quote Nixon on India, where he describes Indians

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:52.720
[Amit Varma]: as quote, a slippery, treacherous people, devious and ruthlessly self-interested.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.680
[Amit Varma]: And at various times, of course, he referred to Indira Gandhi as a bitch and a witch.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.760
[Guest]: So, so there is, there is cultural condescension for the Indians, which as we spoke in the

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.720
[Guest]: last sort of podcast has a long history going back to sort of, you know, American impressions

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.240
[Guest]: of India in the 19th century.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.740
[Guest]: And there is this extraordinary sort of gendered kind of approach towards dealing with someone

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:15.280
[Guest]: like Indira Gandhi, who they believe is, you know, can sort of be taken care of and such

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280
[Guest]: like things.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.280
[Guest]: So the Americans, when they come, when Nixon and Kissinger, you know, start formulating

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.120
[Guest]: this policy, so they want to sort of, first of all, rebalance towards Pakistan again.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.720
[Guest]: Then they want to reach out to the Chinese and they decide that Pakistan can be one of

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.520
[Guest]: the two main conduits through which that will done.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.160
[Guest]: And eventually that Pakistan channel becomes more important one.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.840
[Guest]: And in that context, you know, they decide pretty much not to do.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.080
[Guest]: And Nixon and Kissinger have this kind of totally insouciant attitude towards the whole

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080
[Guest]: human rights question.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.280
[Guest]: You know, both of them see themselves as very tough minded, realist kind of people that,

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.760
[Guest]: you know, at one point they say, listen, the British ruled this country of 300 million

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.200
[Guest]: people with, you know, just about 100,000 sort of white people out there.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.920
[Guest]: You know, the Pakistanis can sort out the Bengalis and so on.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.160
[Guest]: So there is a clear underestimation of the forces of nationalism and what the sort of

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.800
[Guest]: political sort of situation there was.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:09.120
[Guest]: And of course, you know, despite being alerted to the scale of the genocidal violence, which

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.960
[Guest]: was taking place in Bangladesh, particularly by the sort of American deputy sort of, you

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.360
[Guest]: know, head of mission in Dhaka, a man called Archer Blood, who sends these telegrams, you

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.680
[Guest]: know, which have been covered very extensively in another very fine book by Gary Bass, which

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.280
[Guest]: I'd again recommend to all our sort of listeners to definitely read because it covers the American

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.120
[Guest]: sort of thing in very great detail, you know, but those telegrams don't even sort of make

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.880
[Guest]: a dent in terms of American policy.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.080
[Guest]: In fact, you know, blood is kind of censured and pulled out of Dhaka and then cast into

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.600
[Guest]: sort of oblivion.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.200
[Guest]: So that is the sort of line that the Americans take.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.160
[Guest]: Political imperatives of reaching out to China trump the realities of this India-Pakistan

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160
[Guest]: dynamic.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.520
[Guest]: But, and of course, the human rights and, you know, the extraordinary sort of gross

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.440
[Guest]: violations of that in terms of murder of people, which is happening in Bangladesh.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.080
[Guest]: And the only thing Americans are keen, however, from the very beginning is to make sure that

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.560
[Guest]: India does not attack Pakistan, because obviously they don't want their ally to be in trouble.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:13.480
[Guest]: But at the same time, particularly after the sort of Kissinger comes to India in July 1971,

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.080
[Guest]: you know, has discussions with Indians and goes to Pakistan and famously feigns a Delhi

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.160
[Guest]: belly and, you know, takes the secret plane out to China.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.560
[Guest]: And once he comes back, he basically tells the sort of Indians that, listen, you know,

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:32.080
[Guest]: we have this kind of, you know, informal sort of understanding going back to the 1962 war

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.080
[Guest]: that if there is something, you know, serious by China, you know, in terms of an attack

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.960
[Guest]: on India, the United States would sort of stand by India.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.240
[Guest]: But if the Chinese intervene in an India-Pakistan war, then you cannot count on us to sort of

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.520
[Guest]: going through with that understanding.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.440
[Guest]: And the Indians naturally see that as an attempt to tighten the screws on them, which is part

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.240
[Guest]: of Kissinger's sort of objective, very much so.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.220
[Guest]: But the other thing which Kissinger is trying to do and the Nixon administration trying

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.820
[Guest]: to do is that they are trying to signal to the Chinese that, listen, we will stand by

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.760
[Guest]: our allies come what may, because at the end of the day, they are trying to establish a

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.080
[Guest]: new relationship with China, and they want to establish their sort of credibility as

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.320
[Guest]: a dependable sort of partner, or let alone an ally.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.840
[Guest]: And then they feel that if they sort of let down Yaya Khan at the moment of this crisis,

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.720
[Guest]: the Chinese will say that, listen, who the hell is going to antagonize the Soviet Union,

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.720
[Guest]: depending on the Americans, right?

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.680
[Guest]: I mean, we might as well look after our own.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.240
[Guest]: So that whole thing will come through.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.240
[Guest]: So for a series of geopolitical imperatives, the Nixon administration effectively turns

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.080
[Amit Varma]: a blind eye to what's happening in the subcontinent.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.560
[Amit Varma]: And China's very central to this, isn't it?

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, is this again, part of the sort of the Cold War shifting shape that China is

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.520
[Amit Varma]: now fighting with the Soviet Union?

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And is that why the US sort of wants to draw closer to China?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.160
[Amit Varma]: Because it's obviously in their interest, therefore, to have friendly relations with

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160
[Guest]: China.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.600
[Guest]: So the Sino-Soviet sort of relationship starts fraying from already the late 1950s, right,

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.640
[Guest]: from around the time of the Great Leap Forward.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.240
[Guest]: So there are a range of factors which historians have studied, you know, there is ideology,

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.360
[Guest]: there's various kinds of, you know, conflicts of interest, and so on.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.200
[Guest]: There's a sort of personality clash between Mao Zedong and the Chinese leadership, and

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.960
[Guest]: the Russian leadership, and so on.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.100
[Guest]: But by 1969, that relationship and that hostility is actually militarized.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:23.040
[Guest]: They have a disputed border along the Ussuri River, in which Chinese forces actually launch

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.280
[Guest]: an unprovoked attack on the Soviets, and then that leads to a clash.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.400
[Guest]: And thereafter, Mao Zedong sort of panics and says that, you know, we've got to sort

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.000
[Guest]: of go into national mobilization mode, because there's going to be a surprise attack by

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.600
[Guest]: the Soviets, and so on.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.960
[Guest]: So in fact, after the 1969 sort of clash, Sino-Soviet clash, it is the Chinese also

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.760
[Guest]: who look to the sort of, you know, finding some kind of relationship with the United

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.720
[Guest]: States, which will allow them to balance.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.580
[Guest]: As far as the United States is concerned, and Nixon and Kissinger are concerned, their

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.640
[Guest]: primary consideration, of course, is one to sort of have a triangular relationship between

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.640
[Guest]: China, United States, and the Soviet Union.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.360
[Guest]: So you bring the Soviet Union to balance.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.320
[Guest]: But the larger sort of objective is to make sure that both these sets of somewhat independent

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.920
[Guest]: relationships will allow them to extricate without loss of face from Vietnam.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.760
[Guest]: Because both the Soviets and the Chinese are on their own steam supporting the North Vietnamese.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.640
[Guest]: So they believe that if the Soviets and the Chinese put pressure on the North Vietnamese,

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.000
[Guest]: that will allow for some kind of a face saving negotiated solution to come up and the Americans

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.120
[Guest]: can pull out.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.960
[Guest]: So that really is the geopolitical imperative in play.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.520
[Amit Varma]: So because of this sort of Nixon and Kissinger decide to go all in on Yaya Khan, but the

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.520
[Amit Varma]: State Department is of an entirely different view during this whole situation.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.640
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And what is kind of the genesis of the State Department's being relatively friendlier towards

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
[Guest]: India?

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.120
[Guest]: Well, as I said, Nixon and Kissinger were driven primarily by the high geopolitics of

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.080
[Amit Varma]: the Cold War and what they wanted to achieve.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.720
[Amit Varma]: And they didn't tell the State Department they were reaching out to China secretly and

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720
[Guest]: all that?

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720
[Guest]: No, it was a secret.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.760
[Guest]: It was all only known after Kissinger sort of goes there.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.360
[Guest]: And even State Department officials were working within the Nixon White House and were in on

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.160
[Guest]: this very small circle of things, were told in no uncertain terms that, you know, the

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.320
[Guest]: Secretary of State or others should not be informed.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:07.680
[Guest]: So it was a pretty extraordinary sort of bureaucratic, you know, arrangement in there.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.120
[Guest]: But the State Department itself had regional experts, people who had been in the region

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.720
[Guest]: who understood something about what was happening.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.040
[Guest]: They had people like Archibald who were sort of sending in telegrams.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.360
[Guest]: They had a much better sort of sense of realities on the ground.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.640
[Guest]: And they kept insisting that, you know, the Pakistani Army's attempt to impose a solution

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.280
[Guest]: by force was almost destined to fail because there were just too many Bengalis and not

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.360
[Guest]: enough force that you could use against all of them.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.160
[Guest]: And, you know, in the context of third world nationalism, you know, this is not a game

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.400
[Guest]: which can be played to anybody's profit very easily.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.680
[Guest]: And they kind of understood that basic truth.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.240
[Guest]: But the reality was that even senior officials like Assistant Secretaries of State were basically

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.720
[Guest]: shot down by Kissinger in interdepartmental sort of meetings and convenings and so on.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.640
[Guest]: And we're constantly reminded that, listen, the President is very keen that we should

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.720
[Guest]: not, you know, do down Yahya and so on and saying that, you know, I just don't understand

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.720
[Guest]: what kind of an administration this is that, you know, the President wants something and

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.240
[Guest]: you hear you are so-called experts who are sort of holding forth on a totally different

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.240
[Guest]: policy line.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.600
[Guest]: So Kissinger was really cracking the whip on them, you know, in a very serious way.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.840
[Guest]: So the State Department officials who knew better in some ways were marginalized, again,

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.760
[Guest]: partly because, you know, it just didn't serve the larger geopolitical ambitions, which the

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Nixon administration had at that point of time.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.920
[Amit Varma]: So now, was the US during this point, moving closer to actively intervening to make sure

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.160
[Amit Varma]: India stays out?

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.520
[Amit Varma]: Because they obviously want to be seen by China for the sake of their credibility as

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.040
[Amit Varma]: helping Pakistan out.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.520
[Amit Varma]: They also want a united Pakistan through all of this and they're expecting Yahya to get

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.980
[Amit Varma]: things back together.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And they're worried and they know that India is sort of helping the insurgents on the border

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's that's kind of open knowledge.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.880
[Guest]: No, in fact, there is a very interesting, you know, CIA document, which I came across

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.160
[Guest]: while researching the book, where in April 1971, the CIA tells the, you know, they report

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.840
[Guest]: up the channel saying that Indians have actually approached them saying that, you know, they

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.760
[Guest]: want some weapons which they can pass on to the Indian rebels.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.480
[Guest]: So this was, as you can imagine, the intelligence community.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.240
[Amit Varma]: How did you come across CIA documents?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240
[Amit Varma]: Like were these like declassified?

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so the good thing about the American system is that, you know, for all the crimes

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.080
[Guest]: committed by Richard Nixon in that period, a lot of material is very much out there.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.160
[Guest]: In fact, you know, it's quite remarkable.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.160
[Guest]: Is it on the internet?

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Can I see it?

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160
[Guest]: Oh, yeah.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.720
[Guest]: In fact, there's a, you know, I'm not sure if that there is an organization called nixontapes.org,

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.080
[Guest]: which was dedicated towards transcribing a lot of tapes, because, you know, one of the

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.240
[Guest]: things which Richard Nixon did, which nobody actually expected him to do, was to tape pretty

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.960
[Guest]: much every conversation which was happening in the White House and so on, which came out

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.920
[Guest]: later on in the Watergate kind of things.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.600
[Guest]: But those tapes are also very revealing, because a lot of the actual discussions were happening

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.840
[Guest]: on telephones, you know, between him and Kissinger and so on.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.640
[Guest]: So you can actually go and listen to some of that.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.360
[Guest]: There's a lot of ranting going on as well.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.360
[Guest]: So be prepared for some.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.360
[Amit Varma]: That will also be linked from the episode page.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.400
[Amit Varma]: I think hours of my life will now go down this particular rabbit hole.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And sounds like Nixon would have been a big selfie guy and an Instagram guy if he's like

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.120
[Guest]: taping himself back in the day, right?

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.120
[Guest]: You know, actually not.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.000
[Guest]: Richard Nixon is, you know, for a person who became the President of the United States

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.600
[Guest]: of America and obviously such a successful politician, you know, the highest office in

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.600
[Guest]: the land, he was a notoriously sort of reticent and uncomfortable people.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:25.120
[Guest]: So Richard Nixon was happiest when he could be cocooned inside the White House, when his,

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.120
[Guest]: you know, advisors and staff would make sure that nobody disturbed him.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:32.560
[Guest]: And he would just sit on his yellow legal pad, making notes on various things and sending

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.560
[Guest]: things out.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.480
[Guest]: You know, meeting people was something that he loathed.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.160
[Guest]: I mean, he was much happier, and he's one of the most intellectual American presidents.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.040
[Guest]: You know, Alan Greenspan in his memoirs says that, you know, of all the American presidents

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.160
[Guest]: that he has seen, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton are the two most intelligent people.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.240
[Guest]: And I can say from everything that I've seen that Richard Nixon was, at least in terms

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.120
[Guest]: of geopolitical thinking and so on, genuinely an original mind.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.080
[Amit Varma]: If any cartoonist is listening to this, I urge you to instantly draw the image that

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.280
[Amit Varma]: came to my mind when you were saying this, which is Nixon sitting on his yellow legal

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.200
[Amit Varma]: pad while taking notes on it simultaneously.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Do the needful.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.120
[Amit Varma]: Moving on now from sort of from the US to the Soviet role in it.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:17.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, how did Soviet attitude towards South Asia, you know, India, Pakistan evolve

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.120
[Amit Varma]: since 1947?

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.040
[Guest]: So, one of the sort of, you know, very strongly held beliefs in India is that the Soviet Union

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:28.520
[Guest]: kind of was stood by India throughout this crisis and, you know, the Indo-Soviet Treaty

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.600
[Guest]: of Friendship was signed in August 1971.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.240
[Guest]: All of that is seen as a very important thing, which it undoubtedly was, you know, the Soviet

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240
[Guest]: Union did stand by.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.760
[Guest]: But again, what that standing by meant is something that I think we need to unpack a

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760
[Guest]: little bit.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.560
[Guest]: And again, you know, it's worth going back a little bit in history to understand how

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:49.120
[Guest]: Soviet relationship with India and Pakistan evolves during this period of time, right?

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.480
[Guest]: In the early years, neither India nor Pakistan has any particular relationship with the Soviet

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.480
[Guest]: Union.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.320
[Guest]: You know, in fact, the first Indian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mithila Lakshmi Pandit,

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:01.640
[Guest]: who was Arlal Nehru's own sister, couldn't even secure a meeting with Joseph Stalin.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.440
[Guest]: In fact, in the first Indian ambassador to have an audience with Stalin was Sarvapalli

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.520
[Guest]: Radhakrishnan, who was our second ambassador.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.520
[Guest]: And it's only after Stalin's death and the advent of Nikita Khrushchev and the change

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.560
[Guest]: in policy towards non-socialist third world countries that India-Soviet relations starts

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.560
[Guest]: evolving.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560
[Guest]: This would be around 1953.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.360
[Guest]: 1954-55 is when Khrushchev consolidates at home.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.960
[Guest]: Then he sort of has this policy of, you know, rejigging, moving away from a hard line kind

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.600
[Guest]: of saying we'll only support communist countries to look at other non-aligned countries like

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.600
[Guest]: India and so on.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.560
[Guest]: So, Pakistan, because of its alliance with the Soviet Union at that point of time is

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.480
[Guest]: seen as very much in the US camp.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.200
[Guest]: So, the Pakistanis, interestingly enough, always try to sort of also maintain a link

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200
[Guest]: with the Soviet Union.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.640
[Guest]: In fact, Ayub Khan, you know, in the post sort of 1962 phase, when US-India relations

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.640
[Guest]: actually start improving because of the China factor, also makes an attempt to sort of improve

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.120
[Guest]: relations with the Soviet Union.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:57.240
[Guest]: And that actually has some payoffs because in 1965, when India and Pakistan are at war

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.640
[Guest]: and the Johnson administration decides that the hell with these guys, you know, we are

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.640
[Guest]: not sort of going to get into it.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.280
[Guest]: It is actually the Soviet Union which steps into the position of the mediator between

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.720
[Guest]: the two sides.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.400
[Guest]: The post-war conference is held in Tashkent.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.160
[Guest]: It is sort of done and it's a Soviet Union which actually prevails upon Prime Minister

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.400
[Guest]: Lal Bahadur Shastri to return those parts of Pakistani territory, which were Azad Kashmir

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.000
[Guest]: territory, which were captured by the Indian Army at that point of time, including places

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.160
[Guest]: like the Hajibir Pass, about which there is endless sort of, you know, lamenting going

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.200
[Guest]: on even nowadays on social media saying, if only we had Hajibir Pass, we could have sort

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.960
[Guest]: of given a bloody nose to the terrorists and so on.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, so…

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960
[Guest]: Is there some logic to that?

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.600
[Guest]: Well, I mean, the Soviet Union basically believed from 1965 onwards that they were now positioned

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.280
[Guest]: as the main external player in the subcontinent, that they had supplanted the Americans, they

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.960
[Guest]: had taken up the American role, the traditional role, which the United States had as the most

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.580
[Guest]: important power.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.580
[Guest]: And in order to play that role, they actually believed and, you know, that they had to maintain

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:57.160
[Guest]: some kind of balance between India and Pakistan, far from sort of, you know, tilting very heavily

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.340
[Guest]: towards India.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.080
[Guest]: In the aftermath of Tashkent, the Soviet Union actually starts trying to build a relationship

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080
[Amit Varma]: with Pakistan.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080
[Guest]: So, like a benevolent and stern big brother.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:11.620
[Guest]: In 1967, the Soviet Union actually announces arms sales to Pakistan.

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.960
[Guest]: And you know, the Indian government, you know, throws a fit.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.560
[Guest]: Domestic opinion in India throws a fit, you know, the questions in Parliament saying Soviet

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.720
[Guest]: Union here is this thing and there's a, you know, excellent sort of record of conversation

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.740
[Guest]: between Indira Gandhi and Alexei Kasygin, who is the Soviet Premier.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:30.160
[Guest]: And Mrs. Gandhi tells him in no uncertain terms that, you know, the India-Soviet relationship

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.680
[Guest]: has to have an exclusivity to it.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.840
[Guest]: And you know, if the Soviet Union sort of wants to build this kind of relationship with

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.560
[Guest]: Pakistan, it's going to be very difficult for her to justify the relationship, friendship

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.560
[Guest]: with Soviet Union, right.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.320
[Guest]: So, there is that kind of phase through which the Soviet Union goes.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.640
[Guest]: But come 1969, when the Sino-Soviet relationship gets militarized, the Soviet Union is now

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.320
[Guest]: very keen to sort of make sure that India and the Soviet Union come together much more

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.240
[Guest]: strongly primarily to send out a signal to the Chinese.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.920
[Guest]: It is in that context that the Soviets first propose a draft of a treaty of friendship,

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.920
[Guest]: you know, which is there.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.280
[Guest]: And actually, some negotiations happened in 1969.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.200
[Guest]: But Mrs. Gandhi decides against signing it primarily for domestic political reasons,

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.600
[Guest]: because she believes that, you know, signaling a move towards Soviet Union by signing a treaty

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.800
[Guest]: like that will not go down well.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.500
[Guest]: And you know, she has elections coming up.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:20.720
[Guest]: She knows her party's kind of, you know, sort of on the rocks after the 1967 general elections

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.720
[Guest]: and so on.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.280
[Guest]: So, that is put off.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:30.640
[Guest]: And in the summer of 1971, once the Bangladesh crisis really erupts, the Indians bring up

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.880
[Guest]: the idea of this treaty once again with the Soviet Union and say that, listen, this is

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.380
[Guest]: what you had proposed then.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.440
[Guest]: Why don't we think of concluding something like this?

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.440
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, I noticed in your book that it is pushed very hard by D.P.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440
[Amit Varma]: Dhar.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440
[Amit Varma]: Ambassador in Soviet Union.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.080
[Amit Varma]: D.P. Dhar, the ambassador there who's almost like a one man force trying to make the treaty

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.840
[Guest]: happen not just convincing the Russians, but also convincing Indira Gandhi and the cabinet.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.600
[Guest]: He was very keen because, partly because he believed that this treaty would align Soviet

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.120
[Guest]: position with India very closely in the crisis.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.040
[Guest]: Because again, that is very important to understand, right?

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.640
[Guest]: I mean, when Indian sort of foreign minister meets his Soviet counterpart, Swaran Singh

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.720
[Guest]: meets his Soviet counterpart, you know, the Soviets say that, listen, we know what you

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.600
[Guest]: guys are doing with the army league and so on, right?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.920
[Guest]: I mean, that is fine.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.040
[Guest]: But just make sure that this doesn't really sort of get out of control and so on, because

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.120
[Guest]: there's not going to be that much support and stuff like that.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.320
[Guest]: So, the Soviets are kind of reluctant.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.000
[Guest]: And they also have a certain kind of reading of how these various kinds of nationalist

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.520
[Guest]: revolutions and all happen.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.880
[Guest]: And they are not particularly convinced that the army league was a particularly, you know,

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.440
[Guest]: a revolutionary force in the context.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.440
[Guest]: Bourgeois.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.400
[Guest]: And then saying, you know, very sort of, you know, compromised mainstream politics.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.240
[Guest]: And then they are also concerned that there are a number of Maoist parties who might just

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.960
[Guest]: get the upper hand in an independent Bangladesh, right, which they don't want to because of

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.480
[Guest]: their relations with China.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.000
[Guest]: So, the Soviets actually are playing a very interesting and D.P.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.760
[Guest]: Dhar and the Indian government finally use the treaty as a way of trying to align Soviet

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.120
[Guest]: position with India.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.600
[Amit Varma]: That is really the background to the way the treaty.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And do the Soviets sort of come closer to agreeing to sign the treaty with India because

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.600
[Guest]: relations with China are getting worse?

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600
[Guest]: That's right.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.920
[Guest]: I mean, the Soviets, I mean, they wanted to sign it two years ago, right?

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.600
[Guest]: But now the time was coming and they said, fine, we'll sign, we have no problem.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.320
[Guest]: But what is interesting is that, you know, when the Soviet foreign minister Gromyko comes

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.480
[Guest]: to India to sort of sign the agreement, after the signing of the agreement, he actually

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.680
[Guest]: has a meeting with Indira Gandhi, you know, of which we have a record.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.360
[Guest]: And he tells Mrs. Gandhi in that meeting that, you know, we understand your position, but

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.000
[Guest]: we have a saying in a proverb in Russian that, you know, the heart should be warm, but the

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
[Guest]: head should be cool.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.880
[Guest]: Now, that only means that he is counseling India against any kind of precipitated action,

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.280
[Guest]: particularly by way of military action against this thing.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.300
[Guest]: And the Indians exactly get the point.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.300
[Guest]: And they are not very happy.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's something that they probably, to an extent, the Indians already agree with

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.000
[Amit Varma]: because they've been fairly cool through all of this, right?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.600
[Amit Varma]: They haven't rushed into Pakistan yet.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600
[Guest]: Yes, they don't want to.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.640
[Guest]: But at the same time, having the Soviet support is very important because that brings the

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.200
[Guest]: veto in the Security Council, because they know that the Americans and the Chinese and

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.080
[Guest]: every, you know, the Chinese, of course, are not in the Security Council at that point

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.200
[Guest]: of time, but the Brits and others are unlikely to sort of really come out in support.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.560
[Guest]: And the Soviet veto is critical.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.720
[Guest]: So you needed the Soviet Union to at least politically support your move.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.340
[Guest]: So you're trying to create, I mean, again, I agree that the Indians had by this time

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:13.040
[Guest]: not made up their mind saying that this is what is going to happen.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.640
[Guest]: But the probability of an armed intervention or some kind of assistance to enable the emergence

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.600
[Guest]: of India and Bangladesh is rapidly increasing by the time you're talking to August 1971.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.080
[Amit Varma]: So the treaty is a very big deal.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.260
[Amit Varma]: India can go ahead with confidence now.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:29.240
[Guest]: Not yet, because though the Soviets have signed the treaty, they have not actually sort of

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.760
[Guest]: said that that's going to happen.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.120
[Guest]: And there is an interesting sort of, you know, coda to this because it is actually only in

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.560
[Guest]: October 1971, just about two months before the war happens, or not even in actual date

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.880
[Guest]: terms, it's only about six weeks, that the Soviet Union finally aligns itself with the

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.880
[Guest]: Indian position, because that's when Mrs. Gandhi goes to Moscow for a meeting.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.460
[Guest]: Now, it is very interesting when Indira Gandhi goes to Moscow, you know, the Soviet General

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:59.000
[Guest]: Secretary who's sort of, you know, there's a troika, there is General Secretary Brezhnev,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.620
[Guest]: there is Podgorny, and there is Alexei Kasygin, who's the premier.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:05.480
[Guest]: So at that point of time, Brezhnev, who's the sort of, by all accounts, the most important

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.560
[Guest]: figure of the troika, is actually not in Moscow.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.920
[Guest]: And she is surprised and went to learn that she will not be able to meet Gromyko.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.680
[Guest]: And she takes a decision that she will not leave Moscow without having met Brezhnev.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.720
[Guest]: And so finally, she actually decides to spend that evening hosting a reception by the Indian

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:27.040
[Guest]: sort of embassy in Moscow, meeting friends and so on, and waits for another day, postpones

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.080
[Guest]: her trip in order to meet Brezhnev.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.840
[Guest]: And in that meeting with Brezhnev, which goes on for almost five hours, is when, you know,

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.400
[Guest]: they lay the full background of the Bangladesh movement, convince the Russians that there

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.600
[Guest]: is enough political steam behind this, and that, you know, the emergence of this independent

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.120
[Guest]: country is now a foregone conclusion in some ways, and that, you know, the right policy

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.620
[Guest]: for India is only to sort of assist its emergence.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:54.120
[Guest]: And it's at that point of time that the Soviets actually come around to accepting and supporting

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.120
[Guest]: India.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, it takes a lot of work to get to that point.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And quite a diplomatic go by her.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.180
[Amit Varma]: And so at this point, what's happening internationally, just kind of, because already there is sort

01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:06.960
[Amit Varma]: of outrage in the sense you describe about how Pakistan sent a bunch of journalists as

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.720
[Amit Varma]: observers to East Pakistan, as it was then to report on the surroundings there, and one

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.480
[Amit Varma]: of those journalists then goes to England, and he decides that he simply has to report

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.840
[Amit Varma]: on the horrific atrocities that he's witnessed.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And after getting his family out of Pakistan, he actually publishes the sensational piece

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.640
[Amit Varma]: and suddenly the West is aware of what is happening in Pakistan.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And there's a lot of outrage in favor of the East Pakistani rebels.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.120
[Guest]: That's right.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.480
[Guest]: Antony Mascarenas is the sort of Pakistani journalist who breaks the big story and the

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.120
[Guest]: Sunday Times in London breaks this story with a headline genocide.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.000
[Guest]: And there is a lot of sort of public reaction to it.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.960
[Guest]: As I said, this is also a period when the notion of human rights and, you know, various

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.680
[Guest]: kinds of humanitarian NGOs like the Amnesty and others are sort of getting very active

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.680
[Guest]: in international politics.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.480
[Guest]: There are new forms of mobilization around this kind of politics, which we see, you know,

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.640
[Guest]: very interestingly coming together, you know, people using advertisements, you know, for

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:06.960
[Guest]: instance, NGOs placing sort of, you know, ads in newspapers saying, here is a petition

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.680
[Guest]: to your local MP in the UK, saying that we do not want, you know, whatever, that we want

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.300
[Guest]: the government to sort of tell the Pakistanis in no uncertain terms that this is not possible.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:19.680
[Guest]: And all you need to do is to clip this and post it to your local MP and sign it, right?

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.480
[Amit Varma]: And local MPs were inundated with that.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.240
[Guest]: So there are those kinds of new technologies of mobilizing public opinion around these

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.160
[Guest]: new ideas, because these are not ideas which have been around forever.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.880
[Guest]: Nobody, you know, really believed that, you know, you know, because the idea of state

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.040
[Guest]: sovereignty always was the more established principle in the post war period, you know,

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.640
[Guest]: the idea that, you know, human rights or humanitarian sort of, you know, sort of atrocities like

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.160
[Guest]: these needed to be actively condemned was a relatively new thing.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.080
[Guest]: There was also a Bengali diaspora from Bangladesh, which was quite strong in Britain, of course,

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.440
[Guest]: partly because many of them were from Silet province of East Pakistan.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.720
[Amit Varma]: It's very interesting, you point out most of the Pakistani immigrants in Britain were

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.960
[Amit Varma]: actually Bangladeshis from Silet.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.520
[Guest]: So that, you know, they're mobilizing opinions.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.880
[Guest]: Some of them actually sort of predate even the creation of Pakistan, I mean, you know,

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.160
[Guest]: the older generations of them were sort of seamen who sort of settled in England and

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.160
[Guest]: so on.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:11.900
[Guest]: So there is that diaspora, there is a similar diaspora of smaller size in the United States.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.080
[Guest]: So all of these people do mobilize.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.320
[Guest]: And then, you know, they do get quite a degree of sort of important public support from various

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.640
[Guest]: iconic cultural figures of the time.

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.600
[Guest]: You know, people like Joan Baez, you have Ravi Shankar, and, you know,

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600
[Amit Varma]: Who do the concert for Bangladesh.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.040
[Guest]: Right, and then, you know, who's who of the rock music world turn up for that concert.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.720
[Guest]: And again, you know, that ties in with the sort of countercultural moment of the 1968

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:41.780
[Guest]: generation, right, for which a lot of this kind of politics was mediated through music.

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.660
[Amit Varma]: And rock music was kind of, you know, was a pretty important.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:50.120
[Amit Varma]: Is this sort of a cultural aside or was it more central to what actually happened?

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Because one would imagine the geopolitical currents really shaped the emergence of Bangladesh's

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.520
[Amit Varma]: an independent nation.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.520
[Amit Varma]: Did all of this sort of also matter what was happening in the West?

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.240
[Guest]: Well, I mean, it mattered because it was a way of influencing public opinion, which was

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.240
[Guest]: quite important, right?

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.960
[Guest]: I mean, again, you know, at the end of the day, the states, United States government

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.960
[Guest]: and other governments did what they did in pursuit of whatever national interest as they

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.080
[Guest]: defined it in various ways.

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:23.720
[Guest]: But in as much as, you know, the war sort of came at a moment when public opinion was

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.960
[Guest]: already quite mobilized around issues like Vietnam.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:26.960
[Guest]: These things were not negligible.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:31.160
[Guest]: I mean, you know, something like the concert for Bangladesh was kind of, was an important

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.360
[Guest]: moment of creating awareness amongst us.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.400
[Guest]: I mean, you know, when you have someone like the great beat poet Allen Ginsberg, writing

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.880
[Guest]: a poem about on the road to Jaisalmer in the New York Times, and the poem being produced

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.380
[Guest]: in its entirety, it has a certain kind of a cultural impact, which I think is important

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.960
[Guest]: for us to recover.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.840
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day, yes, you know, maybe Richard Nixon was not reading Ginsberg

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.680
[Guest]: and, you know, getting influenced by anything.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.320
[Guest]: But the reality was that public opinion in the United States was shaped, I mean, you

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.240
[Guest]: know, sort of, you know, politicians in the US Senate kind of voted against what the,

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.080
[Guest]: you know, sort of supply of weapons to Pakistan was and various kinds of things happened.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.640
[Guest]: So I think it's kind of important to both underline the extent of that and also its

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.480
[Guest]: limitations and, you know, so in a sense, Bangladesh becomes a foster child.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.340
[Guest]: But in geopolitical terms, it's still treated as something of pariah, right?

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.560
[Guest]: Because you still see it as an internal problem.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.200
[Guest]: You only need to contrast what is happening on the one hand, you have Madison Square Gardens

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.520
[Guest]: and the sort of concept of Bangladesh and, you know, a few streets down in the UN sort

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520
[Guest]: of discussions.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.200
[Guest]: You know, Bangladesh is treated as an issue of state sovereignty and saying the only thing

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.760
[Guest]: which matters is Pakistan state sovereignty.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.440
[Guest]: If India has a problem, the UN sort of, you know, whatever Commission on Human Rights

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.560
[Guest]: or somebody can come in, give assistance for certain kinds of camps, but we really cannot

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.520
[Guest]: do much more than that.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.360
[Guest]: And the UN sort of, you know, Secretary General U Thant, who is actually a Burmese at that

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.960
[Guest]: point of time, frames this, you know, in pretty conventionally as an issue of the real danger

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.320
[Guest]: is a war between India and Pakistan, breakdown of international peace and security.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320
[Guest]: That is his charter.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.800
[Guest]: His charter is not to sort of ensure human rights, even though the UN Charter also mentions

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.280
[Guest]: human rights right up front, right?

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.520
[Guest]: So, but the ideational framework within which people were, that's the world in which they

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.520
[Amit Varma]: lived.

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.520
[Guest]: You have sovereign states dealing with each other.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.520
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.560
[Guest]: And that, you know, these kinds of things are not really issues on which others should get

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560
[Guest]: right.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.280
[Guest]: Well, I mean, it has definitely changed, right?

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:21.480
[Guest]: I mean, you only need to think about the kinds of so-called humanitarian interventions which

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.240
[Guest]: happened in the 1990s onwards.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.240
[Guest]: But Bangladesh is at the cusp of the beginning of that politics, of the breaking over from

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.360
[Guest]: a world which is seen as where sovereignty rules the roost at all times under all conditions

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:37.900
[Guest]: to one where it then becomes a more qualified objective.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:42.160
[Guest]: And Bangladesh is an important historical sort of moment, precisely because it shows

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.520
[Guest]: how difficult the birth of this kind of politics was.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.440
[Guest]: The fact that 10 million refugees, you know, larger than any other sort of, you know, population

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.280
[Guest]: movement in the post Second World War period could not lead to a more significant level

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.560
[Guest]: of international involvement should also tell us that international politics has changed.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560
[Guest]: It has evolved.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.560
[Guest]: Things have moved on, right?

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And as I said, as a historian, I'm only interested in understanding that change.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.800
[Amit Varma]: To go back to that moment, then, you know, as public opinion in the West is changing,

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.320
[Amit Varma]: India's diplomatic efforts to convince people of the rightness of the cause is not really

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.360
[Amit Varma]: working out because while people are essentially while the US and England and all seem to be

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.360
[Amit Varma]: saying that, yeah, we recognize that you have a refugee problem, but we are not going to

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.080
[Amit Varma]: tie that with the political solution in Bangladesh and that's Pakistan's internal matter, don't

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.520
[Amit Varma]: leave them alone and hey, don't go to war.

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.320
[Guest]: That's kind of the message that's coming from there.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.320
[Guest]: That's right.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.040
[Guest]: And I think the Americans were, of course, the most important player, they were the strongest

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.640
[Guest]: in taking that line.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.800
[Guest]: The countries of Europe, however, had a slightly different kind of a thing, right?

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.520
[Guest]: I mean, Britain at that point of time had a conservative government under Ted Heath

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.960
[Guest]: and the conservative government actually sort of ended up supporting India a lot more.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.360
[Guest]: They understood Mrs. Gandhi's meetings with Heath were actually very successful.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.400
[Guest]: They understood the point of view that this situation now kind of completely spiraled

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.600
[Guest]: out of hand and so on.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.380
[Guest]: The West Germany at that point of time under Willy Brandt again took quite a sort of line

01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:09.160
[Guest]: which was sympathetic to India's predicament and of course to the issue at hand, which

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.080
[Guest]: was the sort of plight of the people.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.400
[Guest]: So I think, you know, they were, but at the end of the day, the United States still had

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.120
[Guest]: the dominant hand in terms of how these issues played out.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.680
[Guest]: So to that extent, you know, Mrs. Gandhi's last sort of stop was to go to the United

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.120
[Guest]: States and her meetings with Nixon in November 1971 really go nowhere.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.280
[Guest]: They only sort of show up the gulf between the two sides.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.280
[Guest]: Is there a tape of that?

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.680
[Guest]: Well, I don't think there's a tape of that, but you can listen to a lot of things that

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.680
[Guest]: Nixon had to say, not just about Mrs. Gandhi, but about the Indians subsequently.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.040
[Guest]: His motivation at that point of time is to tell India and Mrs. Gandhi in no uncertain

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:49.720
[Guest]: terms that an attack on Pakistan would be the worst thing that they could do.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:55.400
[Guest]: And once of course India sort of decides to pull the trigger, then Nixon is mad and he

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:58.440
[Guest]: then goes on to sort of terminate economic aid to India, which is India was the largest

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:02.240
[Guest]: recipient of economic aid until that point of time, pulls off military assistance to

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.760
[Guest]: India of various kinds and, you know, then begins, you know, all the other things which

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.360
[Guest]: happened thereafter.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.040
[Amit Varma]: So take me to the pulling of the trigger, you know, we've reached a September, October

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:17.360
[Amit Varma]: of the crisis and we are reaching a point where India simply cannot take any more refugees.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.000
[Amit Varma]: What is the point at which they decide that we must do something and what is it that they

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.680
[Guest]: then end up doing?

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.640
[Guest]: So the Indians are training the sort of the Bengalis in the Mukti Bahini and others in

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.480
[Guest]: a series of training camps.

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:36.240
[Guest]: By October 1971, the Indians decide that, you know, it is important now to sort of take

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.400
[Guest]: this crisis to its culmination.

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:41.400
[Guest]: Because the longer this goes on, the more difficult it is going to be for India to hold

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.240
[Guest]: together this kind of somewhat disparate coalition of people who have come together under this

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Mukti Bahini.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.240
[Amit Varma]: And they're already fighting with each other.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.240
[Guest]: They had internal tensions.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.720
[Guest]: The Indians also were supporting, you know, the R&DW had raised another militia called

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.600
[Guest]: the Mujib Bahini, which was some of, you know, Mujibur Rahman's nephews and some of the radical

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.940
[Guest]: students and then their followers and so on.

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:02.020
[Guest]: So there were all these kinds of games going on and the Indians just believed that it was

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:06.480
[Guest]: important to now take the crisis to its logical conclusion.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.320
[Guest]: So their entire approach was to sort of keep assisting the Mukti Bahini militarily to sort

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.640
[Guest]: of make deeper forays into Pakistan, East Pakistan.

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.200
[Guest]: And by 1971, the Indians were operating, the Indian army used to give artillery support

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.200
[Guest]: and other kinds of things.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.920
[Guest]: And, you know, Indian soldiers along with this thing, you know, used to go in, they

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.320
[Guest]: were, you know, attacking Pakistani positions, capturing territory, fighting deep inside

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.320
[Guest]: Pakistan.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.880
[Guest]: And the Pakistanis, of course, know all of this stuff, you know, and they are getting

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:39.180
[Guest]: quite sort of unnerved by this kind of escalation in the East.

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:42.000
[Guest]: And the Indian position is that, you know, we will just continue to do this till the

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
[Guest]: Pakistanis themselves pull the trigger.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.320
[Guest]: And you know, which in effect is what happens, you know, P. N. Dhar, who was Mrs. Gandhi's

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.400
[Guest]: secretary at that point of time, has this important quote, right?

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.560
[Guest]: He tells Yadav Dhar, D. P. Dhar, that, you know, he quotes Napoleon's maxim that you

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.000
[Guest]: never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.320
[Guest]: And he says that, you know, Yaya Khan is sort of going to make this mistake.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.440
[Guest]: So let's just wait and do this.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's exactly what happens.

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Which is kind of brilliant and which is the kind of thing you read in storybooks because

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.200
[Amit Varma]: in real life, it's so messy, it doesn't always work out like that.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.960
[Amit Varma]: The enemy doesn't always do what you want him to.

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.640
[Amit Varma]: But in this case, the enemy did exactly what you wanted him to.

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.720
[Guest]: In fact, you know, when the Pakistanis sort of bomb or attempt to bomb the Indian airfields

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.960
[Guest]: on 3rd of December, Mrs. Gandhi is on a plane back from Calcutta to Delhi.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.040
[Guest]: And when they get the message saying that, you know, the Pakistanis have attacked, you

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.280
[Guest]: know, D. P. Dhar is on the flight with her and he comes back and tells a very young diplomat

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.680
[Guest]: who later became very prominent called J. N. Dixit, he says, this fool has done exactly

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.680
[Guest]: what we wanted him to do.

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:36.680
[Guest]: Right?

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:37.680
[Guest]: I mean, so this was something they were expecting.

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:40.800
[Guest]: And they were hoping that the Pakistanis would actually begin this war.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.040
[Guest]: And till date, you know, the Indian position is that the war was begun by the Pakistanis

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:49.360
[Guest]: on 3rd of December 1971, which is true in a sense that the formal declaration of war

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.920
[Guest]: actually happened on that day.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.360
[Guest]: But the reality was that the Indians were already escalating and putting the squeeze

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.600
[Guest]: on the Pakistanis throughout November.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.600
[Amit Varma]: This is brilliant maneuvering.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.160
[Amit Varma]: If someone from Bollywood is listening to this episode of the scene in the unseen, and

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.760
[Amit Varma]: they must be because everybody listens to the scene in the unseen, kindly make a film

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.000
[Amit Varma]: on this brilliant book.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.960
[Amit Varma]: So moving on from there, at the time, then 3rd December, Pakistan is attacked and India

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.560
[Amit Varma]: is like, yeah, we are going in now, they've started the war, we can do what we want.

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:14.560
[Guest]: What is the Indian plan?

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.420
[Guest]: Well, the Indian military planning has been sort of evolving, you know, as these plans

01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:20.720
[Guest]: tend to evolve in various iterations.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.560
[Guest]: And the broad plan, even by the time the war begins, is that the Indian army should sort

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.440
[Guest]: of enter East Pakistan from 3 different directions, because we have landlocked in that way.

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.840
[Guest]: And you would capture enough territory in which to sort of put the provisional government

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.120
[Guest]: of Bangladesh and then declare war, just to sort of go back a little bit, you know.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:44.120
[Guest]: So in April 1971, when the Awami League politicians come to India and a significant number of

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.200
[Guest]: them are there, they come up with this idea of establishing a provisional independent

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.460
[Guest]: government of Bangladesh and seek India's recognition of it.

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:56.960
[Guest]: And the Indian government actually sort of is reluctant to give that recognition, because

01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.580
[Guest]: under international law, a government can be recognized as sovereign only if it controls

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.580
[Guest]: significant amounts of territory.

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.000
[Guest]: And at that point of time, they don't have any territory.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.460
[Guest]: They are effectively operating out of the R&DW's office in Calcutta, though the headquarters

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:13.020
[Guest]: is supposed to be in this place called Mujib Nagar inside East Pakistan.

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:17.060
[Guest]: And in fact, those of your listeners who are sort of interested can go on YouTube and check

01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:22.420
[Guest]: out this very nice video of the formation of the provisional government of Bangladesh.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:27.740
[Guest]: You know, there's a ceremony which happens actually inside East Pakistan.

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:30.140
[Guest]: But you know, that ceremony is entirely facilitated by the Indians.

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.980
[Guest]: It's the BSF which clears the road to allow everyone to have.

01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:33.980
[Guest]: Send me the link.

01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:34.980
[Guest]: I'll put it in the episode page.

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:37.660
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a very interesting sort of episode.

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.060
[Guest]: And so the provisional government therefore exists, but Indians have not formally recognized

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:43.060
[Guest]: it.

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:47.740
[Guest]: So the plan is that you sort of capture enough territory so that you can recognize the provisional

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:53.860
[Guest]: government and then sort of create conditions where the people can eventually go back and

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:54.860
[Guest]: so on.

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:55.860
[Guest]: Right.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.860
[Guest]: And that's really the hope.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:01.460
[Guest]: The provisional government is recognized on the 6th of December 1971 once the war gets

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:02.460
[Guest]: underway.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.460
[Guest]: Because they've taken some territory.

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:06.060
[Guest]: They've captured territory and they're sort of moving with the Indian troops and so on.

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.460
[Guest]: So all of that has happened.

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:12.940
[Guest]: But nowhere does the Indian sort of military plan mention the capture of Dhaka as a particular

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.420
[Guest]: objective of the plans.

01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:17.340
[Guest]: The plans are still about saying that you want to do it.

01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:21.260
[Guest]: And this is partly because of the experience of the 1965 war and other things.

01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.500
[Guest]: Indians know that the international community will intervene.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:29.080
[Guest]: There is likely to be some kind of a UN Security Council push to sort of calling for a ceasefire.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:32.880
[Guest]: So the important thing is to have enough territory quickly to sort of recognize this.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.220
[Guest]: Once that is done, that's a fait accompli.

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.860
[Guest]: Then you know, other things will fall into place and so on.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:42.020
[Guest]: So there is no really no plan to capture Dhaka per se.

01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:46.900
[Guest]: And that was something of a fortuitous occurrence during the war itself.

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:47.900
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.620
[Amit Varma]: And internationally, what's happening?

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.820
[Amit Varma]: War has broken out in India, Pakistan, what everybody feared has happened because none

01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.660
[Amit Varma]: of the other players really want this to happen.

01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.020
[Guest]: What are the maneuverings in the UN and behind the scenes?

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.020
[Guest]: So again, I mean, you know, there are a couple of sort of resolutions which are tabled.

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:04.260
[Guest]: The Soviet Union sort of vetoes them and so on.

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:06.540
[Guest]: And that's what is happening in the UN stage.

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:09.820
[Guest]: It's sort of a predictable kind of a game, at least till the very end, which is kind

01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.660
[Guest]: of being played out.

01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:15.020
[Guest]: What is more important is the moves which are made by the Nixon administration at that

01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.020
[Guest]: point of time.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:19.260
[Guest]: So the Nixon administration starts putting a lot of pressure on the Soviet Union, saying

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:23.460
[Guest]: that India is effectively your client state and you guys have egged on the Indians.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:27.820
[Guest]: And if this crisis becomes more important, we have an alliance with Pakistan, so we are

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:29.180
[Guest]: going to get involved.

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:32.260
[Guest]: And we then you just don't know what's going to happen between you and us.

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.380
[Guest]: You have this treaty with them.

01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.220
[Guest]: We have this treaty with Pakistan.

01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:38.400
[Guest]: So you know, this is going to be a major bust up and you know, we are supposed to be having

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:41.580
[Guest]: better relations as part of detente and other kinds of things.

01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:44.220
[Guest]: Now, is this what the Soviet Union wants?

01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:48.020
[Guest]: And the Soviet Union is actually under a bit of pressure, you know, not to say that they

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.860
[Guest]: cave in before the Americans, but they also then start telling the Indians that listen,

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:57.700
[Guest]: this has to sort of kind of be finished, you know, finish it fast and move quickly and

01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.180
[Guest]: do what you can kind of story.

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.900
[Guest]: So there is that dynamic to it which is playing.

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:05.060
[Guest]: The second thing the Americans do is that they reach out to the Chinese and tell them

01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:09.780
[Guest]: saying, you know, if China diverts a few divisions of its troops to the border, then the Indians

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:11.220
[Guest]: are going to get scared.

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.620
[Guest]: They will then be forced to divert their attention from the operations in East Pakistan.

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:18.880
[Guest]: And that will then enable the Pakistanis to sort of hold their own.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.140
[Guest]: And the Chinese hear out this proposal, which is related to by Kissinger to their representative

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:25.140
[Guest]: in the UN.

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.460
[Guest]: And about two days later, around 10th of December, they come back and say, yes, thank you, but

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.460
[Guest]: no thanks.

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:33.340
[Guest]: So we do not think that is what we are interested in, partly because the Chinese have, you know,

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.180
[Guest]: they are realist, whatever else, you know, their ideal.

01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:38.900
[Amit Varma]: But it is very interesting that they are not asking China to intervene.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.820
[Amit Varma]: They are just saying take some troops to the border and distract.

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, this reminds me of an old chess anecdote.

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:44.980
[Amit Varma]: I forget.

01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.620
[Amit Varma]: I think it involves Botvinnik, I am not very sure.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:54.100
[Amit Varma]: So there is a world championship match where someone is supposed to be playing Botvinnik

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.100
[Amit Varma]: or there is a match of some sort.

01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.740
[Amit Varma]: I hope it is Botvinnik and I am not messing it up.

01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:01.980
[Amit Varma]: Well, let us just say the Soviet grandmaster who smokes a lot and the rules are that he

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:02.980
[Amit Varma]: cannot smoke.

01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:07.140
[Amit Varma]: But this gentleman just sits with a cigarette in his mouth and he does not light it.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.380
[Amit Varma]: And the other guy is completely perturbed and eventually loses the game.

01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.300
[Amit Varma]: And finally, he says, why did you sit like that?

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:13.300
[Amit Varma]: You were not going to light the cigarette.

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:16.260
[Amit Varma]: And he said, the threat is greater than the execution.

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:19.140
[Guest]: It seems to me quite what, sorry for the digression.

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.140
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.240
[Guest]: No, I think that that is kind of what the Americans had in mind.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.240
[Guest]: But it is interesting.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.940
[Guest]: The Americans actually thought the Chinese would go forward.

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.500
[Amit Varma]: Why did the Chinese go forward?

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:31.020
[Guest]: So Nixon and Kissinger's expectation very much was that the Chinese will intervene in

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:32.020
[Guest]: some fashion.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.860
[Guest]: In fact, there is this fantastic sort of, you know, it is generally like fantastic in

01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:39.020
[Guest]: a sense of a fantasy, right, of a conversation between Nixon and Kissinger, where they sort

01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:43.820
[Guest]: of are, you know, literally carrying on in this sort of, you know, almost sort of delusionary

01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:47.540
[Guest]: way of saying, oh, so the Chinese come in and if the Chinese come in, then the Soviets

01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:48.540
[Guest]: are going to get into it.

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.260
[Guest]: And if the Soviets are going to get into it, then what is going to happen?

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:52.260
[Guest]: And you know, then are we going to get into it?

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:53.260
[Guest]: Is there going to be a nuclear war?

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:57.540
[Guest]: I mean, it is just a, you know, a sequence of sort of imaginations and all of that is

01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:58.540
[Guest]: deflated.

01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.420
[Guest]: When the Chinese come and say that, listen, we are not going to.

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.980
[Guest]: And the Chinese do not want to do it because the Chinese have been telling Yaya Khan from

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:07.980
[Guest]: the time the crisis broke out that you have to have some kind of a political solution.

01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:11.620
[Guest]: The Chinese also have some of their Maoist allies in the East Pakistani parties, the

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.620
[Guest]: Bengali parties.

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:16.220
[Guest]: And they say that, listen, this kind of a military solution is not going to work.

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.220
[Guest]: So by the time the war breaks out, the Chinese are quite clear that, you know, the situation

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.980
[Guest]: on the ground is such that the Pakistanis cannot hold their own, you know.

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.540
[Guest]: So they say that, you know, better to sort of take a realistic view.

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:27.540
[Amit Varma]: It's a losing cause.

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:28.540
[Guest]: Just stay away.

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.180
[Guest]: You know, and ultimately you can have better influence with the independent state of Bangladesh

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.300
[Guest]: whenever it comes up, right, rather than trying to sort of, you know, put all the chips into

01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:36.300
[Amit Varma]: the Pakistan.

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.300
[Guest]: But they don't actually want Bangladesh.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:42.500
[Guest]: Well, I mean, again, you know, I don't think they sort of wanted the breakup of Pakistan.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:45.740
[Guest]: Pakistan was a very important sort of state and a friend of theirs.

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:49.180
[Guest]: But when things kind of reached the point where the war began, I think they sort of

01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:52.580
[Guest]: reconciled themselves to what would be the inevitable realities.

01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.540
[Guest]: Of course, they were unhappy with the fact that India would sort of emerge in such a

01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.820
[Guest]: strong position and so on.

01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.460
[Guest]: But they managed to sort of, you know, keep their own.

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:03.220
[Guest]: So this is the sort of broader geopolitics and the American maneuvering.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:07.700
[Guest]: And then, of course, the United States decides as a last measure to send the sort of, you

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:12.700
[Guest]: know, the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal, which, you know, is a sort of a straightforward

01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.660
[Guest]: threat at Indian sort of forces.

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.900
[Guest]: And the Indians also kind of panic and, you know, their assessments suggest that the Americans

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:24.780
[Guest]: might actually be landing of Adalino Marines somewhere in East Pakistan to evacuate, you

01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:28.460
[Guest]: know, senior Pakistani officials or American citizens and so on.

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:31.980
[Guest]: So there is a concern that the American intervention is going to be much more direct.

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.340
[Guest]: The Soviets send a submarine to tail the Americans of the Seventh Fleet.

01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:38.040
[Guest]: So you know, there is this entire story going on.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:43.660
[Guest]: But the paradoxical outcome of all of this is that India, which until that point of time

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.180
[Guest]: is kind of broadly still thinking in terms of, you know, maximum capture of territory,

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:53.900
[Guest]: consolidating position and so on, then feels that now there is a need to really sort of

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:58.260
[Guest]: reach this to a sort of a finality, which they had not envisioned before.

01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:01.700
[Guest]: And the Pakistan and because the Indian forces had sort of made significant gains by bypassing

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:05.980
[Guest]: Pakistani positions and sort of converging in the interior of the country, they now decide

01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:10.820
[Guest]: to make a quick dash for Dhaka and to force the surrender of Dhaka.

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:16.460
[Guest]: And that then, you know, was an outcome which was not foreseen at that point of time.

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:20.180
[Guest]: And as you mentioned up front, you know, as late as 12th of December, General Maneksha

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:23.860
[Guest]: actually was giving orders that, listen, maybe we should go back to some of the towns we

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:27.360
[Guest]: bypassed and hold them because there's going to be a UN Security Council resolution calling

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.820
[Guest]: for an immediate ceasefire at some point.

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:31.820
[Guest]: So we need to sort of have the territory.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:35.500
[Guest]: But you know, there are others in the army headquarters and people like General Jacob,

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.680
[Guest]: who was the chief of staff of the Eastern Command, which was the operational command

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:42.380
[Guest]: dealing with this, who believed that actually, no, this was a moment when they could actually

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:47.900
[Guest]: force not just a quick move into Dhaka, but also a surrender by the Pakistanis at Dhaka.

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:50.380
[Amit Varma]: So what's the significance of taking over Dhaka in particular?

01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.660
[Amit Varma]: Is it that basically you've conquered East Pakistan?

01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:57.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, Pakistan has to surrender and Bangladesh is de facto independent.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:02.200
[Guest]: So not only was it about sort of capturing Dhaka as a city, which was a capital city

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:06.140
[Guest]: and the symbolic meaning of it, but the fact that the Pakistanis gave an unconditional

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:09.580
[Guest]: surrender with 93,000 troops being there.

01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:14.800
[Guest]: That was an extraordinary sort of an outcome, which I don't think was what was envisioned

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.900
[Guest]: at the beginning of the war at all.

01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.300
[Guest]: It's beyond even Indira Gandhi's wildest dreams, I guess.

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:23.620
[Guest]: Well, I mean, in a sense, once it came to it, I think, you know, obviously the scale

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:25.340
[Guest]: of the victory then is changed, right?

01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:29.500
[Guest]: I mean, that's when, you know, outcomes also then, you know, seem inevitable.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:32.420
[Guest]: Yeah, then you see that, listen, I mean, this is just the most extraordinary thing which

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:33.420
[Guest]: happened.

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:37.380
[Guest]: And in fact, even there, there was one last sort of, you know, slip between the cup and

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:42.260
[Guest]: the lip, so to speak, you know, probably, which was that as the Indians were making

01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:46.940
[Guest]: this drive towards Dhaka in the last 48 hours of the war, there is a resolution introduced

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:51.340
[Guest]: in the UN Security Council calling for an immediate halt to hostilities and a withdrawal

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:54.300
[Guest]: of all armed forces from Bangladesh.

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:59.780
[Guest]: Now, that would have effectively meant, if that resolution had passed, that the fighting

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:01.900
[Guest]: forces would have had to stop wherever they were.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.980
[Guest]: Some kind of a ceasefire, you know, would have been imposed between the two sides, policed

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.220
[Guest]: by some UN personnel.

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.700
[Guest]: And both Indian and Pakistani troops would have had to withdraw, right?

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.140
[Guest]: And this was still a possibility at this moment.

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.140
[Guest]: And why was it a possibility?

01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:17.580
[Guest]: It was because this resolution was actually introduced by Poland.

01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:18.580
[Guest]: Okay.

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:22.060
[Guest]: Now, you know, nobody in their right mind, particularly Indian diplomats, believed that

01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.620
[Guest]: it was a resolution which was introduced by Poland.

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:26.660
[Guest]: It was actually a resolution supported by the Soviet Union, right?

01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:30.060
[Guest]: Which again tells you that, you know, at this point of time, the Soviets had, were in no

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:32.140
[Guest]: mood to veto a third resolution.

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:35.420
[Guest]: They actually felt that, listen, if India cannot finish the job, you know, we've got

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:36.420
[Guest]: to table some kind of a resolution.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:39.420
[Amit Varma]: What if the resolution actually happened and India just went ahead anyway?

01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:42.700
[Guest]: Well, yeah, you could have sort of done that kind of a fait accompli.

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:48.600
[Guest]: But if that resolution actually passed, then you might have been in a diplomatic pickle

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.340
[Guest]: of some kind, because then you would have had to antagonize the Soviets in order to

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.820
[Guest]: sort of get to that particular outcome.

01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:56.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's very interesting that one of the people who didn't want that resolution to

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:59.420
[Amit Varma]: pass and in fact stood in its way is Bhutto.

01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.420
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:04.980
[Guest]: So Bhutto had just come to Pakistan to join the delegation at the UN.

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:10.020
[Guest]: And Bhutto, when he sort of, you know, sees the text of this resolution, he makes a very

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.020
[Guest]: impassioned speech, once again, which you can listen to it on YouTube, you know, basically

01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:17.580
[Guest]: saying that, you know, Poland is a country which has been partitioned so many times in

01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:18.580
[Guest]: its history.

01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:21.700
[Guest]: And of all countries, I'm most disappointed that Poland, you know, and there are very

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.860
[Guest]: few South Asian historians of his generation, politicians who would have known about the

01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.420
[Guest]: partition of Poland in the 18th century and so on, tells you something about Bhutto, makes

01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:33.060
[Guest]: this fantastic speech and theatrically sort of tears up that resolution.

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.300
[Guest]: This will also be linked, by the way, walks away, right.

01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.820
[Guest]: And the, it is interesting to speculate because there's no other way of sort of dealing with

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:41.820
[Guest]: this.

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:42.820
[Guest]: There's no evidence.

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:48.140
[Guest]: Why Bhutto sort of decided to sort of, you know, more or less walk away from the UN and

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:52.900
[Guest]: not allow the resolution to sort of be passed or even be debated in a serious way.

01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:57.420
[Guest]: And the best answer it seems to me is that Bhutto knew that the Pakistan army was at

01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:00.220
[Guest]: the brink of an extraordinary defeat.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:05.140
[Guest]: And he knew that power would then pass to him in West Pakistan and it would pass to

01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:08.420
[Guest]: him under conditions of when the army was totally humiliated, which was in some ways

01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:12.740
[Guest]: the best political outcome for him on which to begin constructing a new.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:13.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.900
[Amit Varma]: So he actually, in a sense, supported the partition of Pakistan to advance his personal

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:17.900
[Amit Varma]: career.

01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:22.100
[Amit Varma]: And I can see where the incentives make sense for him because in a democratic, united Pakistan,

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.220
[Amit Varma]: in any case, the majority of the people are in Bangladesh, you're always going to have

01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:29.740
[Amit Varma]: a Mujib like figure who will get more votes than you and, you know, you will never get

01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.980
[Amit Varma]: that kind of political power.

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.740
[Amit Varma]: And here you have East Pakistan cut off.

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.300
[Amit Varma]: You are the dominant political figure in West Pakistan.

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.980
[Amit Varma]: And the army is suddenly much weaker.

01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:39.140
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that's exactly what happened.

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.100
[Amit Varma]: Yahya had to quit at the end of the war.

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.100
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.100
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:45.060
[Guest]: And so, in a sense, I mean, yeah, I mean, whether it was his personal agenda or whether

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.420
[Guest]: you say that success in politics is about riding the waves of history.

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:51.620
[Guest]: You just had a hilarious phone call here, kindly, kindly tell us about it.

01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:55.700
[Guest]: Well, I mean, basically, Yahya Khan is trying to sort of tell Bhutto that, listen, this

01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:57.820
[Guest]: resolution works in our interest in some way.

01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:58.820
[Guest]: Overtrunk call.

01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:02.460
[Guest]: And Bhutto pretends as if the line is bad and says, sorry, I can't hear you and just

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.460
[Guest]: hangs up.

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.860
[Guest]: And the operator says, no, I can hear him pretty clearly.

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.740
[Guest]: What the hell with you, right?

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.260
[Guest]: Because he's quite determined not to sort of go down this route.

01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:14.900
[Guest]: Of course, you know, you can interpret it in other ways of saying that Bhutto did not

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:18.540
[Guest]: want to sort of be seen as presiding over the humiliation of the, you know, various

01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.540
[Guest]: kinds of things.

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:24.300
[Guest]: But the reality was that he understood that this outcome now was going to happen in this

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.300
[Guest]: particular way.

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:29.680
[Guest]: And that if it happened, you know, here was an opportunity to sort of, you know, come

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.060
[Guest]: back to power in Pakistan and do something different, which is exactly what he managed

01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:35.060
[Guest]: to do subsequently.

01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:39.500
[Amit Varma]: So at this crucial moment, in a manner of speaking, Bhutto was India's friend.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.340
[Amit Varma]: So what happens when the dust settles?

01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:43.180
[Amit Varma]: Like, this is all very fascinating.

01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:48.780
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of clear from reading your account of everything that the whole thing is so multifactorial

01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:53.820
[Amit Varma]: and so contingent upon events just happening to work out the way they did and, you know,

01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.300
[Amit Varma]: but after all the dust has settled, what happens?

01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:58.060
[Amit Varma]: How are India-Bangladesh relations?

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.620
[Amit Varma]: How do those kind of go over the years?

01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:03.700
[Amit Varma]: And you know, how does the rest of the Cold War play out for the time that the Cold War

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:04.700
[Amit Varma]: is still running?

01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:05.940
[Amit Varma]: Where do the Soviets go?

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.300
[Amit Varma]: Where does the US go?

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:08.300
[Guest]: What happens?

01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.700
[Guest]: So yeah, so in terms of India-Bangladesh relations, what happens is that basically Mudibur Rahman

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:17.460
[Guest]: comes back in January 1972 to independent Bangladesh, you know, becomes the leader.

01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:22.780
[Guest]: There's a new constitution of Bangladesh, which is written in the year 1972, drafted

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.000
[Guest]: by a group of young lawyers, including a man called Kamal Hussain, who has been news lately

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.260
[Guest]: in Bangladesh for having been the figurehead of the opposition against Sheikh Hasina in

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.940
[Guest]: the last elections which happened.

01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:38.340
[Guest]: So Kamal Hussain was a, I think, a 35-year-old lawyer at that point of time and wrote this,

01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:41.420
[Guest]: what was for its time a pretty extraordinarily progressive constitution.

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:45.700
[Guest]: You know, it is actually even the Indian constitution did not have the word secular in its preamble

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:46.700
[Guest]: at that point of time.

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:50.820
[Guest]: The Bangladeshi constitution had it and they were determined to create a progressive state,

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.540
[Guest]: you know, within the parameters of that time.

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:57.460
[Guest]: So it was a constitution of some vision and some ambition for a new state.

01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:00.660
[Guest]: But of course the reality was that, you know, Bangladesh had a series of problems.

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:05.080
[Guest]: First of all, it was not getting international recognition till 1974.

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:09.980
[Guest]: Basically the Pakistanis got the Chinese to veto Bangladesh's entry twice into the UN.

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:13.620
[Guest]: Without having that kind of recognition, Bangladesh could not access international aid in any

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.620
[Guest]: significant way.

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.340
[Guest]: The only countries which were giving aid to it were India and the Soviet Union.

01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.100
[Guest]: And then eventually that led the Bangladeshis to sort of given, you know, Mujibur Rahman

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:29.460
[Guest]: gave an olive branch to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, attended a meeting of the OIC, the Organization

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:32.700
[Guest]: of Islamic Countries in Pakistan in 1974.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:36.540
[Guest]: That was seen as a moment of post-war rapprochement between the two of them.

01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:40.180
[Guest]: And you know, then of course the following year Mujibur himself was overthrown in a military

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:44.020
[Guest]: coup and assassinated in Bangladesh.

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:49.380
[Guest]: And then of course, you know, that history of that country takes a very different turn

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.380
[Guest]: from that point onwards.

01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:54.380
[Guest]: So, in a sense, all the sort of pro-India forces are kind of marginalized for a long

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:58.140
[Guest]: period of time and that has its own dynamic within Bangladesh.

01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:01.020
[Guest]: The India-Pakistan relationship, of course, is kind of interesting because that's when

01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:05.420
[Guest]: you have the post-war conference, which results in something called the Simla Agreement, which

01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:10.500
[Guest]: is again in popular Indian consciousness and other, you know, area of almost incessant

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:15.740
[Guest]: heartburn about why we did not impose a solution on Kashmir at the time when we had the upper

01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:16.740
[Guest]: hand and so on.

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:23.640
[Guest]: And I think the answer to that is what the record suggests is actually quite straightforward.

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:27.980
[Guest]: The assumption is that we had these 93,000 prisoners of war and that we could have used

01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:32.300
[Guest]: that to get the Pakistanis to sign on to whatever it is that we wanted them to sign on to.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:36.620
[Guest]: But the reality was that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was very clear that even if India took all

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:41.180
[Guest]: of those 93,000 prisoners of war and kept them in India forever, he would not sort of

01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:44.780
[Guest]: survive the signing of an agreement on Kashmir in that sense.

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:45.780
[Guest]: Politically.

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.780
[Guest]: Politically.

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:50.100
[Guest]: And I think the Indians understood that dynamic and they felt that, you know, it was better

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:53.620
[Guest]: to invest in a politician like Bhutto and not to impose a solution.

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:54.620
[Guest]: You know, P.N.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:58.180
[Guest]: Haqsir used to say that, he used to constantly say, and even in his written notes, talk about

01:59:58.180 --> 01:59:59.180
[Guest]: the treaty of Assay.

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:03.940
[Guest]: He used to say that we can impose a punitive treaty on Pakistan today, but a democratic

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:08.260
[Guest]: politician will not survive it, and whenever you have another group of revanchists coming

02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:11.180
[Guest]: into power, this treaty will be overthrown by the force of events.

02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:13.500
[Guest]: Much like Germany between World War I and II.

02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.860
[Guest]: So his whole entire framework was to say that this is not going to be a workable solution,

02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.220
[Guest]: which I think was the right judgment at that point.

02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:23.460
[Amit Varma]: And very enlightened, though, obviously, eventually Zia-ul-Haq comes to power.

02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:24.460
[Guest]: Yeah, everyone.

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:27.420
[Guest]: And, you know, in retrospect, in India, we can keep sort of, you know, beating our breasts

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:29.620
[Guest]: about why this happened or not happened.

02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:34.260
[Guest]: The second dynamic of it, which I think in India, we still do not understand, is the

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.500
[Guest]: role played by Soviet Union in the post-war position.

02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:41.780
[Guest]: The first country that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto visits in January 1972 is the Soviet Union,

02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:44.700
[Guest]: because he knows that that's a country which holds the key to the peace solution.

02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:47.860
[Guest]: And it's the Soviets who tell the Indians that India has to give up territory, which

02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:51.740
[Guest]: is sort of done that, and will have to sort of repatriate prisoners of war.

02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:56.260
[Guest]: Let's also remember, under international law, holding on to prisoners of war after this

02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:57.260
[Guest]: thing is illegal.

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.060
[Guest]: In a sense, it was an embarrassment for us to be holding on to them.

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:04.140
[Guest]: The only reason we held on to them, actually speaking, was because we were technically

02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:07.780
[Guest]: not the people who are holding the prisoners of war, even though they were physically in

02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:08.780
[Guest]: our custody.

02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:11.740
[Guest]: We were holding them on behalf of the government of Bangladesh.

02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:15.220
[Guest]: And Mujibur Rahman was very keen that India should not repatriate these prisoners.

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:20.860
[Guest]: Till such time, the Pakistanis agreed to try about 180 Pakistani officers whom they had

02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:22.340
[Guest]: identified as war criminals.

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.220
[Guest]: So he wanted to have a war crimes trial.

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:27.740
[Guest]: There was a legislation which was passed in Bangladesh at that point of time to do that.

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:32.380
[Guest]: But ultimately, in order to strike this deal with Pakistan and get international recognition,

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:38.380
[Guest]: UN admission, etc., Mujib reluctantly allowed to let go of that war crimes trial.

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:41.020
[Guest]: And subsequently, that paved the way for repatriation of prisoners of war.

02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:42.660
[Guest]: So it was a complex situation.

02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:47.660
[Guest]: I think the scale of India's victory once again blinds us to what the political realities

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:52.180
[Guest]: of the time, which was that, you know, the Indians strongly felt and quite rightly that

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:56.300
[Guest]: Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto would not survive a day in office if he managed to sort of, you know,

02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:01.140
[Guest]: sign some agreement which legitimized either the status quo in Kashmir or something else.

02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:06.060
[Guest]: Or that the Soviet Union, which was your only key partner at that point of time, would acquiesce

02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:07.640
[Guest]: in some such arrangement.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.880
[Guest]: Nobody was willing to do it.

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:14.900
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think the similar agreement basically worked on the premise that you would,

02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:18.700
[Guest]: you know, have the border between India and Pakistan will become the line of control,

02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:20.060
[Guest]: the ceasefire line.

02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:23.840
[Guest]: And that over a period of time, the ceasefire line would come to acquire the characteristics

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.420
[Guest]: of an international border.

02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:30.220
[Guest]: In a sense, it would kind of become a de facto border, which in effect is what is the situation

02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:31.220
[Guest]: even today.

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:36.420
[Amit Varma]: So you described the 1971 war, quote, as the most significant geopolitical event in the

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:38.860
[Amit Varma]: subcontinent since partition in 1947.

02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:44.100
[Amit Varma]: Few contemporary conflicts have been so brief and localized, but had such protracted and

02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:45.900
[Amit Varma]: global ramifications, stop quote.

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.540
[Guest]: Elaborate on that a bit.

02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:52.620
[Guest]: Well, I think, you know, the ramifications of the war, as I said, were quite extraordinary.

02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:56.820
[Guest]: You had a country like Bangladesh, which is a very large populous country coming into

02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:59.980
[Guest]: independence on its own steam.

02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:04.300
[Guest]: As I said, I think, you know, it changed, the Bangladesh war changes the sort of geopolitics

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:05.900
[Guest]: of the subcontinent in significant ways.

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:11.700
[Guest]: I mean, just to give you one example, it's in the period after the 1971 war that Pakistan,

02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:15.780
[Guest]: first under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, subsequent to Zia ul Haq, actually starts identifying

02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:22.060
[Guest]: itself a lot more with the sort of, you know, the, the, you know, Islamic autocracies of

02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:23.060
[Guest]: the Middle East.

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:25.820
[Guest]: In fact, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto says very clearly that, you know, we do not want to be seen

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:27.220
[Guest]: as a South Asian country anymore.

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:30.300
[Guest]: Our natural inclination is towards our friends in West Asia.

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.020
[Guest]: That's when the relationship between Saudi and Pakistan and, you know, we've had Mohammed

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:36.300
[Guest]: bin Salman coming recently and saying all those things.

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.140
[Guest]: The starting point for that, in many ways, was the post-1971 war.

02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:43.460
[Amit Varma]: Stressing the Islam argument rather than the geographical argument.

02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:49.180
[Amit Varma]: But doesn't it kind of go further back because since the 19th century, there's sort of been

02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:56.820
[Amit Varma]: this tension within the Indian subcontinent of Muslims feeling, you know, dual loyalties,

02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:02.460
[Amit Varma]: one to Qom, which is a larger Muslim global nation, so to say, and another to whatever

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:05.460
[Amit Varma]: the local loyalties might have been to the nation of India itself.

02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:10.540
[Amit Varma]: Not that the two are necessarily incompatible, I'm not saying that, but these stresses of

02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.540
[Guest]: identity have…

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:16.820
[Guest]: Yeah, but I mean, see, the identification with the wider Islamic Ummah is one part of

02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:20.780
[Guest]: the identity of many Indians as, you know, people have these kinds of identities.

02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.660
[Guest]: But here you are talking about a relationship between Pakistan as a sovereign state and

02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:29.540
[Guest]: a set of countries in the Middle East, which becomes very strong, you know, or at least

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:30.820
[Guest]: that's a building of that.

02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:36.140
[Guest]: The second, I think, important and in some ways very long lasting consequence of the

02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.860
[Guest]: sort of 1971 war is a nuclearization of the Indian subcontinent, right?

02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:44.740
[Guest]: I mean, the Indian decision to sort of ultimately, you know, proceed its nuclear program to the

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:50.540
[Guest]: point where it can start being tested happens in the aftermath of 1971 against the backdrop

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:55.420
[Guest]: of the Americans having sent a nuclear armed aircraft carrier into the Bay of Bengal.

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:59.060
[Guest]: So Indians want to be sure that we cannot be sort of, you know, put into that position

02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:01.140
[Guest]: of blackmail ever again.

02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:06.740
[Guest]: And even before the Indians do it, and already in early 1972, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto gets together

02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:11.380
[Guest]: with the few nuclear scientists that Pakistan has and says that, come what may, Pakistan

02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:12.380
[Guest]: has to build nuclear weapons.

02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:15.140
[Guest]: You know, it's in that context that, you know, he says the famous thing about eating grass

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:16.620
[Guest]: and all that stuff.

02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:21.300
[Guest]: So there is that dimension, which is again a reality of the subcontinent as we live with.

02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:25.500
[Guest]: And the third thing, I think, you know, in a way that is kind of, you know, significant

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.580
[Guest]: and, you know, really sort of, you know, has had a long lasting impact on the subcontinent

02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:35.220
[Guest]: is Pakistan's desire to get even with India for 1971, you know, which is still given a

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:40.420
[Guest]: sort of as an ideological justification for its support of terrorism in the subcontinent,

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:45.340
[Guest]: you know, every sort of loss of innocent life is justified as a sort of some kind of a payback

02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.340
[Guest]: for 1971.

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:51.340
[Guest]: But the reality is that for a lot of people, you know, that was a formative moment, you

02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:55.460
[Guest]: know, particularly for officers in the Pakistan army, you know, I remember, you know, I think

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:58.620
[Guest]: it's in Parvez Musharraf's autobiography, he says that he was a young officer when he

02:05:58.620 --> 02:05:59.820
[Guest]: heard of the Pakistan army surrender.

02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.980
[Guest]: And he said, I just burst into tears, you know, because it's such a humiliating moment

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:07.940
[Guest]: for us to be defeated by our, you know, single largest adversary in this way.

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:11.700
[Amit Varma]: And quite honestly, any Indian officer would react in the same way if India had to surrender.

02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:12.700
[Guest]: I'd imagine.

02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:16.620
[Guest]: And just like the 1962 war has left scars in our collective sort of consciousness.

02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.300
[Guest]: But I think the scale of what happened in Bangladesh was remarkably different, right?

02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.900
[Guest]: I mean, the country was broken up into two.

02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.620
[Guest]: One of the two wings of the bodiless bird.

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:25.620
[Guest]: Exactly right.

02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:31.520
[Guest]: And then you had to sort of begin rebuilding in totally different ways.

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.660
[Guest]: So I think, you know, it's in that context that I believe that, you know, many of the

02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:39.540
[Guest]: sort of current challenges that we face in the subcontinent in terms of India-Pakistan

02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:43.620
[Guest]: relations, the way the subcontinent relates to the wider world, all of which were decisively

02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:46.860
[Guest]: shaped by this crisis of 1971.

02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:51.220
[Amit Varma]: So you know, this episode has already taken more than two hours, you know, the Bangladesh

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:53.860
[Amit Varma]: war could have been over in this time.

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:59.220
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask for your last comments as, you know, people often say history doesn't exactly

02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:01.420
[Amit Varma]: repeat itself, but it rhymes.

02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:07.020
[Amit Varma]: So looking back on all the flow of events that led to the Bangladesh war and everything

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:12.940
[Amit Varma]: that happened, are there any lessons of history that you can extrapolate to the current day

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:18.020
[Amit Varma]: that you wish that politicians in South Asia were more aware of?

02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:22.940
[Guest]: Well, you know, in a sense, history doesn't offer any lessons, right?

02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:23.940
[Amit Varma]: Historians only do.

02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.260
[Amit Varma]: Well, you're a historian.

02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:30.500
[Guest]: So yeah, and I'm one of those historians who actually has a bit of a suspicion of any straightforward

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:33.780
[Guest]: lessons to be learned from history, so to speak.

02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:40.940
[Guest]: But I think what the Bangladesh crisis does tell us, and it's kind of worth remembering,

02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:44.100
[Guest]: you know, even as we are sort of talking about this episode, India and Pakistan are in the

02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:50.700
[Guest]: middle of another kind of a crisis and so on, is that no subcontinental crisis is ever

02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:52.660
[Guest]: a subcontinental affair.

02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:57.780
[Guest]: There will invariably be wider geopolitical forces, which will impinge upon the way that

02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:59.260
[Guest]: we act, right?

02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:03.020
[Guest]: And much as we would like to believe that, you know, we are a strong power, we are capable

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.300
[Guest]: of sort of acting on our own and so on.

02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:10.620
[Guest]: These wider geopolitical factors and the way that they shape outcomes and events in subcontinent

02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:13.060
[Guest]: are always worth bearing in mind.

02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:18.660
[Guest]: And what is also more important than it was even in the context of 1971 is that the subcontinent,

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:21.540
[Guest]: particularly India today is sort of, you know, connected to the rest of the world in a much

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:22.860
[Guest]: more deeper way, right?

02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:27.780
[Guest]: And those kinds of issues will also bring their own sort of considerations and pressures

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.660
[Guest]: to bear on anything.

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:32.460
[Guest]: So the only thing I will say is that, you know, perhaps the most important thing is

02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:36.420
[Guest]: to understand that, you know, the subcontinent is not some kind of island unto itself, right?

02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:42.400
[Guest]: I mean, you know, what happens here, the politics, the dynamics of India, Pakistan, or even other

02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.500
[Guest]: kinds of regional crises are invariably going to shape by sort of the wider global context.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.660
[Guest]: So I think even as we are trying to make sense of some of our current things, it is always

02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:56.260
[Guest]: useful to bring that frame into mind while we are sort of trying to figure out, you know,

02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.260
[Amit Varma]: where things are going today.

02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.900
