00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.360
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other night.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.160
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed that I died and went to heaven.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.480
[Amit Varma]: At least that's what the entry gate said.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240
[Amit Varma]: There was a sign that told me, welcome to heaven.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.040
[Amit Varma]: So I went in and there was some sweet music at the start.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.440
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, ah, this is going to be wonderful.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Maybe there will be unlimited seafood platters here.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.800
[Amit Varma]: Maybe there will be slaves in silk harem pants who will hold up grapes above my face

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.960
[Amit Varma]: as I reclined languorously on a couch.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.920
[Amit Varma]: All day long, I will get massages from voluptuous women who keep telling me how slim I am,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.560
[Amit Varma]: who giggle at all my bad jokes and flirt with me so endlessly

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.560
[Amit Varma]: that an accidental non-flirtatious statement seems like downright rudeness.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: The music will be mellow.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.840
[Amit Varma]: The saffron will be yellow.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
[Amit Varma]: This will be heaven.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Instead, imagine my shock and horror when I find that it's really a dark and dingy dungeon.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.040
[Amit Varma]: There are cockroaches all over.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.240
[Amit Varma]: It smells like the underperformer in the Sulabh Shauchala family.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: There is ice cold water dripping from the ceiling.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.920
[Amit Varma]: There are mosquitoes as big as frogs.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.160
[Amit Varma]: There are frogs as big as cats with slimy skin that gives off mild electric shocks when they bump into you.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.080
[Amit Varma]: The chairs have spikes on them.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And worst of all, the music is Justin Bieber.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.680
[Amit Varma]: I am in shock when I see all this.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.240
[Amit Varma]: Am I really in heaven?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I turn around towards the entrance and I see a babu in a safari suit

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.560
[Amit Varma]: wearing a badge that says,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Undersecretary, Department of Salvation.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.560
[Amit Varma]: What's going on? I ask him.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Am I really in heaven?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Yes, he says.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160
[Amit Varma]: You are.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760
[Amit Varma]: What happened to it?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I ask.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160
[Amit Varma]: He replies,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.160
[Amit Varma]: We nationalized it.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Nationalized it.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.160
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.760
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160
[Amit Varma]: My topic for today is public sector banks.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.160
[Amit Varma]: In 1969, Indira Gandhi carried out a big wave of bank nationalizations

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.360
[Amit Varma]: with immensely noble stated intentions.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.960
[Amit Varma]: Were those bank nationalizations good for us?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.960
[Amit Varma]: What were their unintended effects?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.560
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, are public sector banks structurally flawed in such a way

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.960
[Amit Varma]: that the very concept makes no sense?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.960
[Amit Varma]: To discuss all this and more, I have as my guest on the show,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.360
[Amit Varma]: my very good friend, Kumar Anand, an economist based in Mumbai.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the show, Kumar.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
[Guest]: Thank you for having me.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Kumar, tell me, in 1969,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.360
[Amit Varma]: when Indira Gandhi carried out her wave of bank nationalizations,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960
[Amit Varma]: what were the stated intentions behind the move?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.960
[Guest]: The stated reasons could broadly be categorized into two of them.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360
[Guest]: One was financial inclusion.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960
[Guest]: So, not many people had access to the institutional form of credit.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.760
[Guest]: So, the government wanted to make those forms of credit available to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.160
[Guest]: people who were otherwise unbanked.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.360
[Guest]: And second was directing credit into areas which government thought was necessary,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
[Guest]: in which areas the credit should go.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.160
[Amit Varma]: So, it was a laudable thinking that, hey, people in rural areas

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
[Amit Varma]: don't have access to bank credit and private banks won't open up there.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.160
[Amit Varma]: So, let's nationalize and then we can open up branches anywhere

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160
[Amit Varma]: and give credit to people who otherwise wouldn't get it.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.160
[Guest]: Exactly. So, in hindsight, when academics have studied this phenomenon,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.160
[Guest]: they have said that financial inclusion and directed credit were the two main reasons.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.160
[Guest]: But the government's stated objective at that time itself,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.160
[Guest]: if you read the ordinance,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.160
[Guest]: when these ordinances were promulgated,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.760
[Guest]: when these ordinances were promulgated and banks were nationalized,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.760
[Guest]: the instrument through which it happened,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.760
[Guest]: they have said that we are basically taking these resources

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.760
[Guest]: so that we can better plan the development of the country.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.760
[Guest]: As you know, after independence, what we had done was

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.760
[Guest]: we adopted a central planning model of development

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.760
[Guest]: and for that you need a lot of resources.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.760
[Guest]: But the problem that India faced,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.760
[Guest]: that we had a democracy and private properties.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.760
[Guest]: So, you can't do the kind of planning,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.360
[Guest]: which, for example, Soviet Russia did.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.360
[Guest]: So, you had to do these kind of appropriations.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.360
[Amit Varma]: So, in a sense, it's just as Nehru made the mistake of thinking

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.360
[Amit Varma]: India needs to be a planned economy

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.360
[Amit Varma]: and not realizing that economies grow by themselves

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.360
[Amit Varma]: and the government should just essentially stay out of the way

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.360
[Amit Varma]: and maintain the rule of law.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.360
[Amit Varma]: And Indira took it one step forward by saying that,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.360
[Amit Varma]: hey, we need more resources to control and plan the economy.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.360
[Amit Varma]: So, we will take it from the private sector.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.360
[Guest]: Yeah, in a way, we were not learning the lessons.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.960
[Guest]: So, for example, the planning entire thing started in 1950

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.960
[Guest]: and during the time we nationalized,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.960
[Guest]: in the decade of 1950, we nationalized transportation,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.960
[Guest]: we nationalized mining,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.960
[Guest]: we nationalized parts of insurance corporations.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.960
[Guest]: But always the reason of not getting the right result

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.960
[Guest]: from the planning was given that we don't have enough resources.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.960
[Guest]: So, you kept on trying to get more and more resources

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.960
[Guest]: and it was in that same spirit

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
[Guest]: that we nationalized bank in 1969 and then again in 1980.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, tell me something,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.560
[Amit Varma]: it's one of the interesting things about the nationalizations of 69

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.560
[Amit Varma]: and all of the other similar measures that Indira carried out

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.560
[Amit Varma]: were that despite the economic reasoning given,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.560
[Amit Varma]: which you've just laid out,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.560
[Amit Varma]: there was also a political backdrop to it.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit about that political backdrop?

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.160
[Guest]: The little political backdrop could broadly be, I think, framed

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.160
[Guest]: in terms of that all major political parties

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.160
[Guest]: and the entire rhetoric at the time

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.160
[Guest]: was extremely interventionist in nature.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.160
[Guest]: So, no matter all the mainstream parties

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.160
[Guest]: were different shades of, you could say, interventionism.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.160
[Amit Varma]: With the sole exception of Swatantra, which was…

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.160
[Guest]: Yeah, which died soon after.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.160
[Guest]: So, what they were trying to do is

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.160
[Guest]: they were trying to outdo each other.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.160
[Guest]: So, you want to appear more pro-poor.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.160
[Guest]: So, you have to go and take away properties of someone,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.760
[Guest]: people who are otherwise rich.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.760
[Guest]: So, bankers, insurance, people who run insurance companies,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.760
[Guest]: you take away those properties and say that,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.760
[Guest]: yes, we are doing it for poor and we are directing resources

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.760
[Amit Varma]: so that in future probably India will develop.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Very intuitive, zero-sum thinking, in other words.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting immediate backdrop is that Indira Gandhi was sort of,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.760
[Amit Varma]: this is when the Congress kind of broke into two,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Congress I and Congress O.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.760
[Amit Varma]: For Indira, because the other faction of the Congress

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.360
[Amit Varma]: was leaders who had lived through the narrow years

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.360
[Amit Varma]: but kind of learned from the mistakes

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.360
[Amit Varma]: and were trying for a course correction.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.360
[Amit Varma]: The only way for Indira to differentiate herself

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.360
[Amit Varma]: was to go further leftward.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.360
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of pro-poor rhetoric,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.360
[Amit Varma]: though these actions of course harm the poor the most,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.360
[Amit Varma]: but the rhetoric is pro-poor,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.360
[Amit Varma]: was a very good way of setting her brand apart.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, Garibi Hata, Indira is India and so on.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.360
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me something, just going back to the scene objectives.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the unseen effects,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.960
[Amit Varma]: to what extent were even those scene objectives attained?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.960
[Guest]: Well, frankly speaking, not much.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.960
[Guest]: And when you nationalize these banks,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.960
[Guest]: so as I was mentioning the first tranche was done in 1969

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.960
[Guest]: when you nationalized 14 banks

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.960
[Guest]: and then again in 1980 when you nationalized 6 more.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.960
[Guest]: So what you had was majority of the banking

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.960
[Guest]: was all publicly owned, all owned by the government of India.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.960
[Guest]: So you couldn't say that what,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.960
[Guest]: you don't have basically a counterfactual.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.560
[Guest]: You can't say if there was a private sector bank,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.560
[Guest]: what would have happened?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.560
[Guest]: Because all banking in India at the time

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.560
[Guest]: was owned by the government and run by them.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.560
[Guest]: So, both the objectives of financial inclusion

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.560
[Guest]: and directed credit,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.560
[Guest]: in hindsight people have studied this.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.560
[Guest]: In 2008, I think Planning Commission set up

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.560
[Guest]: a committee under the chairmanship of Raghuram Rajan

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.560
[Guest]: and he studied public sector banking

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.560
[Guest]: in a little bit detail,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.160
[Guest]: did some studies on ransom numbers

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.160
[Guest]: and judged the effectiveness of public sector banking

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.160
[Guest]: having existed for now about 30-40 years,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.160
[Guest]: what were the success.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.160
[Guest]: And on both the measures,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.160
[Guest]: it turned out that they had not done really well.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.160
[Guest]: So just to quickly tell you about a few of them.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.160
[Guest]: So take for example financial inclusion.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.160
[Guest]: On financial inclusion,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.160
[Guest]: the committee found that

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.160
[Guest]: poor in richly branched urban areas

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.160
[Guest]: have no more access than in poor in rural areas.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.760
[Guest]: So the problem of financial inclusion

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.760
[Guest]: is not so much about availability of branches

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.760
[Amit Varma]: but rather poverty itself.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.760
[Guest]: Second for example could be

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.760
[Guest]: that they found that

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.760
[Guest]: no systematic relationship existed

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.760
[Guest]: between regional credit disbursement

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.760
[Guest]: and the presence of public sector bank.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.760
[Guest]: Then they also found that in rural areas

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.760
[Guest]: where private banks are present,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.760
[Guest]: they don't discriminate against the poor.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.760
[Guest]: So at the end of the day,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.760
[Guest]: it's business for them.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.360
[Guest]: Rajan in fact has concluded that

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.360
[Guest]: the kind of environment you want to build

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.360
[Guest]: is where you compete for the poor.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.360
[Guest]: Now when you look at the other objective

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.360
[Guest]: which was directed credit,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.360
[Guest]: in recent years we have seen that private banks

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.360
[Guest]: have done better than public sector banking

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.360
[Guest]: in achieving the priority sector lending criteria.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.360
[Guest]: Just to give you a quick background,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.360
[Guest]: the priority sector lending

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.360
[Guest]: is something that RBI mandates

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.360
[Guest]: that every commercial bank in India,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.360
[Guest]: private or public,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.360
[Guest]: will have to lend 40 rupees

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.960
[Guest]: out to priority sectors

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest]: which are agriculture,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.960
[Guest]: micro, small and medium enterprises etc.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960
[Guest]: So in those areas,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.960
[Guest]: the committee found that

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.960
[Guest]: the private sector banks have done

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.960
[Guest]: a much better job than a public sector bank.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.960
[Guest]: Then again coming back to the same directed credit,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.960
[Guest]: they also found that

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.960
[Guest]: in terms of loan timing,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.960
[Guest]: in times of drought in a district,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.960
[Guest]: private banks appear to provide

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.960
[Guest]: more agricultural loans

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.960
[Guest]: while public sector banks

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.560
[Guest]: are still harmful.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.560
[Guest]: And when it comes to quality of directed lending,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.560
[Guest]: the share of NPAs in the PSL

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.560
[Guest]: has been higher for public sector banks.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And the greater efficiency

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.560
[Amit Varma]: and the higher quality

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.560
[Amit Varma]: that the private banks provide

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.560
[Amit Varma]: is of course because of the incentives involved

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.560
[Amit Varma]: which we will come to later.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.560
[Amit Varma]: But I just wanted to point out

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.560
[Amit Varma]: this funny mishearing

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.560
[Unknown]: that when you spoke about

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.560
[Amit Varma]: the Raghuram Rajan committee,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.560
[Amit Varma]: you said they are ransom numbers

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.160
[Amit Varma]: but let's get to the crux of the matter.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Before we even get to the unseen effects,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.160
[Amit Varma]: the unseen effects are really a consequence

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.160
[Amit Varma]: of the incentives in play.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.160
[Amit Varma]: How the incentives are different

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.160
[Amit Varma]: in public sector banks

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.160
[Amit Varma]: from private sector banks.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.160
[Guest]: If you think about it,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.160
[Guest]: think of any government enterprise.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.160
[Guest]: Right now we are discussing public sector banks

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.160
[Guest]: but that is true for almost any other enterprise.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.160
[Guest]: So when you are running an enterprise,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.760
[Guest]: what is your objective?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.760
[Guest]: If it is a private enterprise,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.760
[Guest]: the objective is profit maximization.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.760
[Guest]: Now I should forewarn that

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.760
[Guest]: the government and the public sector banks themselves

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.760
[Guest]: they know that the profit maximization

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.760
[Guest]: is not their goal.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.760
[Guest]: So their goal is financial inclusion

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.760
[Guest]: and directed credit

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.760
[Guest]: and we just saw that they have not been able

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.760
[Guest]: to successfully achieve this credit.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.760
[Guest]: Now the incentive, the way it works

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.760
[Guest]: for public sector banks

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.360
[Guest]: they don't have too much of

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.360
[Guest]: you know, they have complete job security.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.360
[Guest]: So no matter what mishap happens

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.360
[Guest]: their jobs are guaranteed.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.360
[Guest]: They don't have any incentive or disincentive

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.360
[Guest]: because if they do a good job

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.360
[Guest]: they are not going to get a great pay hike

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.360
[Guest]: or if they do a bad job

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.360
[Amit Varma]: they are not going to get a rap on the knuckles.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.360
[Amit Varma]: So essentially what is true of all governments

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.360
[Amit Varma]: what is true of public sector banks

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.360
[Amit Varma]: therefore also is what Friedman mentioned

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.360
[Amit Varma]: in his four ways of spending

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: so there are four ways in which you can spend money.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.960
[Amit Varma]: One, you can spend your own money on yourself

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.960
[Amit Varma]: when you obviously try to maximize value

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.960
[Amit Varma]: because you are spending it on yourself

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.960
[Amit Varma]: but you also want to economize

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.960
[Amit Varma]: because it is your own money.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.960
[Amit Varma]: The other is when you spend your money on someone else

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.960
[Amit Varma]: when you want to economize

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.960
[Amit Varma]: but you don't care so much about value

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.960
[Amit Varma]: because it is going to someone else.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.960
[Amit Varma]: The third is when you spend someone else's money on yourself

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.960
[Amit Varma]: when you want value

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.960
[Amit Varma]: but you don't really care about economizing

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.960
[Amit Varma]: because it is someone else's money

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.560
[Amit Varma]: they will work in a company and send you on a foreign trip

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.560
[Amit Varma]: and you will be ordering whatever you want in room service

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.560
[Amit Varma]: because that is taken care of by the company.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And the fourth way

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.560
[Amit Varma]: is when you spend somebody else's money on somebody else

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.560
[Amit Varma]: where you don't care about value

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.560
[Amit Varma]: and you don't care about economizing

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.560
[Amit Varma]: it is not your money

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.560
[Amit Varma]: you are not spending it on anyone else

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.560
[Amit Varma]: and that is all of government

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.560
[Amit Varma]: and to add to that

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.560
[Amit Varma]: this is the fact that all of government

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.560
[Amit Varma]: is therefore also tenured

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.160
[Amit Varma]: and their incentives are not there

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.160
[Amit Varma]: it is just their incentives revolve around

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.160
[Amit Varma]: how they can use their power for personal benefit

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: and that is something that is a problem

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.160
[Amit Varma]: with any public sector enterprise

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.160
[Amit Varma]: especially public sector banks

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.160
[Guest]: and one reason why they haven't achieved their objectives.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.160
[Guest]: In a way you could say that is true, that is correct.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.160
[Amit Varma]: Getting to the crux of the matter

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.160
[Amit Varma]: the unseen effects

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.160
[Amit Varma]: can you elaborate on some of the unseen effects

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.160
[Guest]: that come from these perverse incentives?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.160
[Guest]: Sure, there are too many

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.760
[Guest]: but we will limit ourselves to a few of them.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.760
[Guest]: First you can directly look at

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.760
[Guest]: what are the direct costs in terms of

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.760
[Guest]: so these banks have to regularly go

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.760
[Guest]: for recapitalization

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.760
[Guest]: and because it is government owned

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.760
[Guest]: so the liability lies on the government

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.760
[Guest]: and government has to finance it

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.760
[Guest]: that means we taxpayers have to pay for it

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.760
[Guest]: and some of the data that we had collected

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.760
[Guest]: some time ago we found that

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.760
[Guest]: so in about 30 years

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.760
[Guest]: from 1985-86 onwards till now

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.360
[Guest]: the amount of money that taxpayers had to pay

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.360
[Guest]: is 1,47,000 crore

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.360
[Guest]: for the recapitalization of banks

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.360
[Guest]: now imagine the direct cost which we incur

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.360
[Guest]: for maintaining these banks

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.360
[Guest]: all those alternate uses

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.360
[Guest]: that these money could have been used for

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.360
[Guest]: we know that our criminal justice system

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.360
[Guest]: is so poorly staffed

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.360
[Guest]: in terms of policemen and the number of judges you can hire

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.360
[Guest]: so 1,47,000 crore is a lot of money

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.360
[Guest]: so of course one is the direct cost itself

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.960
[Guest]: then this also promotes inefficiency

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.960
[Guest]: in the entire banking system

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.960
[Guest]: so for example

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.960
[Guest]: the people who run this

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.960
[Unknown]: they don't have the skin in the game

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.960
[Guest]: so think of the example like

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.960
[Guest]: Maruti when it comes to car industry

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.960
[Guest]: and Bajaj when it comes to scooters

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.960
[Guest]: so you didn't see much of

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.960
[Guest]: or BSN or MTNL when it came to telephone

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.960
[Guest]: so you didn't see much of

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.960
[Guest]: technological advancement when it was happening

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.560
[Guest]: when they had sort of

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.560
[Guest]: almost a monopoly on these sectors

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.560
[Guest]: so similarly the same is true with banks

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.560
[Guest]: so for the longest period

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.560
[Guest]: you didn't see any advancement

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.560
[Guest]: and even today public sector banks

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.560
[Guest]: are almost always one step behind

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.560
[Guest]: the advancement that the private sector banks have done

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.560
[Guest]: many of the public sector banks

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.560
[Guest]: they struggle with running

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.560
[Guest]: or ATMs, internet banking is crashed

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560
[Amit Varma]: they don't run very efficiently

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.560
[Amit Varma]: just to take this point forward about

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.560
[Amit Varma]: inclusion and you mentioned

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.160
[Amit Varma]: telephones and I'm glad you do so

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.160
[Amit Varma]: like I grew up in the 80s

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.160
[Amit Varma]: where we had one government telecom provider

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.160
[Amit Varma]: which was MTNL and we had one airline

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.160
[Amit Varma]: which was Air India slash Indian Airlines

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.160
[Amit Varma]: for domestic and foreign

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.160
[Amit Varma]: and what you found was

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.160
[Amit Varma]: now I was from a privileged family

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.160
[Amit Varma]: we had phones at home

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.160
[Amit Varma]: but otherwise if you applied for a phone

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.160
[Amit Varma]: there were 5 year waiting periods

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.160
[Amit Varma]: massive scarcity

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.160
[Amit Varma]: not just technology

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.160
[Amit Varma]: just basic scarcity

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.760
[Amit Varma]: this guy couldn't dream of flying

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.760
[Amit Varma]: it was like a very big deal at the time

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.760
[Amit Varma]: and what happened is

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.760
[Amit Varma]: the moment the government opened it up

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.760
[Amit Varma]: because of competition

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.760
[Amit Varma]: inclusion happened

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.760
[Amit Varma]: today anybody can buy a phone

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.760
[Amit Varma]: today your maidservant who comes home

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.760
[Amit Varma]: has a phone which can do so much more

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.760
[Amit Varma]: than the most advanced technology

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.760
[Amit Varma]: of those times

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.760
[Amit Varma]: and today far more people fly

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.760
[Amit Varma]: than back in the day

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.760
[Amit Varma]: it's become much more commonplace

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.360
[Amit Varma]: and these specific sectors were simply opening it up

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.360
[Amit Varma]: and today therefore MTNL seems irrelevant

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.360
[Amit Varma]: Air India seems irrelevant

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.360
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully won't exist for too long

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.360
[Amit Varma]: as a government owned company

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.360
[Amit Varma]: and why doesn't the same logic apply to banking?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.360
[Guest]: Well that is a question which has been

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.360
[Guest]: unfortunately not even been asked

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.360
[Guest]: so whether it comes to academicians

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.360
[Guest]: they think this as a political economy problem

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.360
[Guest]: this is unsolvable

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.360
[Guest]: so they just can't touch it

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.360
[Guest]: Raghuram Rajan committee report

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.960
[Guest]: it was giving us a recommendation

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.960
[Guest]: it falls short of

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.960
[Guest]: suggesting privatization of the banks

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.960
[Guest]: the most recent example is in 2014

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.960
[Guest]: I think it was RBI which

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.960
[Guest]: constituted a PGNI committee report

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.960
[Guest]: and I think they are the ones who

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.960
[Guest]: delve very deeply into the governance

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.960
[Guest]: of public sector banks

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.960
[Guest]: and they also almost you know

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960
[Guest]: have explicitly said that

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.960
[Guest]: you know we can't consider almost

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.960
[Guest]: privatization of banks

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.960
[Guest]: so their entire set of recommendations

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.560
[Guest]: is centered around what all they can do

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.560
[Amit Varma]: within the current system

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.560
[Amit Varma]: So essentially they will identify

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.560
[Amit Varma]: It has become sort of a holy cow

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.560
[Amit Varma]: So they will identify the problem correctly

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.560
[Amit Varma]: and they know what's wrong with it

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.560
[Amit Varma]: but they just stop short of

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.560
[Amit Varma]: suggesting the correct solution

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.560
[Guest]: even though they know it

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.560
[Guest]: Is that because of pressures

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.560
[Guest]: in the political economy per se?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.560
[Guest]: I don't know

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.560
[Guest]: maybe it could just be that

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.560
[Guest]: they see this as a holy cow

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.160
[Guest]: RBI has mandated private sector lending

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.160
[Guest]: which should achieve the objective

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.160
[Guest]: of the government

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.160
[Guest]: so no matter whether you are

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.160
[Guest]: ICICI bank or State Bank of India

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.160
[Guest]: you have to give certain amount of credit

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.160
[Guest]: so in this case 40% and 80%

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.160
[Guest]: of that goes to agriculture

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.160
[Guest]: directly to you know

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.160
[Guest]: the credit response should go into these areas

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.160
[Guest]: so it should not matter

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.160
[Guest]: I mean you have already mandated

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.160
[Amit Varma]: so whether it is State Bank of India

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.160
[Amit Varma]: tomorrow gets privatized

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.760
[Amit Varma]: as it may

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.760
[Amit Varma]: if you have the mandate

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.760
[Amit Varma]: you don't need the public sector banks

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.760
[Guest]: because your purpose is achieved

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.760
[Amit Varma]: and it is achieved better

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.760
[Amit Varma]: and more efficiently

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.760
[Amit Varma]: but I am sorry I interrupted you

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.760
[Amit Varma]: and set you off on this digression

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.760
[Amit Varma]: so the first two unseen effects

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.760
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned were

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.760
[Guest]: when banks get recapitalized

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.760
[Guest]: it basically comes from taxpayers money

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.760
[Guest]: which is us

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.760
[Amit Varma]: and you mentioned the humongous amount

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.360
[Amit Varma]: see these figures don't mean a thing to me

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.360
[Amit Varma]: because I can't comprehend 50,000 crores

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.360
[Amit Varma]: I can comprehend 50,000 or even 50 crores

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.360
[Amit Varma]: what is 50,000 crores?

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean if you stacked up 10 rupee coins

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.360
[Amit Varma]: you would probably get from here to the moon

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.360
[Guest]: I think so probably

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.360
[Amit Varma]: or maybe not whatever

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.360
[Guest]: we leave it to someone else

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.360
[Amit Varma]: if you take a different currency

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.360
[Amit Varma]: probably Mars even

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.360
[Amit Varma]: yeah I mean Zimbabwe currency

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.360
[Amit Varma]: you can just get out of the Milky Way

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.360
[Amit Varma]: right so the two unseen effects

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.960
[Amit Varma]: one is the fact that

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.960
[Amit Varma]: all the recapitalization expenses

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.960
[Amit Varma]: are basically born by us

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.960
[Amit Varma]: and you've demonstrated how it has happened

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.960
[Amit Varma]: through the years 50,000 crores

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.960
[Amit Varma]: over the last three years

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.960
[Amit Varma]: and the second is that

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.960
[Amit Varma]: there's inefficiency because of incentives

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.960
[Amit Varma]: because the bureaucrats who run the banks

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.960
[Amit Varma]: have no skin in the game as you put it

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.960
[Amit Varma]: and therefore they don't really

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.960
[Guest]: I mean why should they do a good job

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.960
[Guest]: what else?

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.960
[Guest]: so we have been listening recently

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.560
[Guest]: rising NPS is a part of that

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.560
[Guest]: now how does that happen?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.560
[Guest]: so imagine a world where you have a monopoly

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.560
[Guest]: over giving out banking

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.560
[Guest]: and today almost about 70% of the banking business

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.560
[Guest]: is run by public sector banks

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.560
[Guest]: in many areas they are the only banks operating

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.560
[Guest]: so if you want a loan

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.560
[Guest]: you have to go to that neighborhood bank

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.560
[Guest]: which is owned by the government

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.560
[Guest]: and the guy sitting there at the head of the table

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.560
[Guest]: who has to sign your loan

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.560
[Guest]: and award that loan to you

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.160
[Guest]: he has this arbitrary power

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.160
[Guest]: and you can't turn to someone else

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.160
[Guest]: the local moneylender you will go to

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.160
[Guest]: will probably charge you 40% or maybe even more

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.160
[Guest]: so you know that in this case

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.160
[Guest]: you are stuck with that

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.160
[Guest]: so what this does is

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.160
[Guest]: well this becomes a case of corruption then

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.160
[Guest]: so the arbitrary power

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.160
[Guest]: which is now lying in the hands of monopoly

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.160
[Guest]: in a way which has been existed for a long time

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.160
[Guest]: and the incentives the way we discussed

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.760
[Guest]: in a way breeds corruption

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.760
[Guest]: it becomes a breeding ground for corruption

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.760
[Guest]: outside of that

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.760
[Guest]: when we are talking about NPAs

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.760
[Guest]: a direct and obvious consequence of all this

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.760
[Guest]: is the higher NPAs

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.760
[Guest]: there is no need or incentive for the PSB employee

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.760
[Guest]: to do a thorough check of a prospective borrower

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.760
[Guest]: so if I go and want a loan

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.760
[Guest]: for about a crore rupees

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.760
[Guest]: to buy a house from an ICCA bank

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.760
[Guest]: the guy who is going to award me that loan

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.360
[Guest]: is going to be very thorough with this

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.360
[Guest]: but if he is going to look into my credit history

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: whether I have paid back loans in the past on time or not

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.360
[Guest]: now there are agencies which are doing this kind of

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.360
[Guest]: reporting and background checks for you

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.360
[Guest]: but not necessarily those kind of incentives

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.360
[Guest]: exist for public sector bank

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.360
[Guest]: and therefore you will see that the NPAs

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.360
[Guest]: for the public sector bank

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.360
[Guest]: are almost always higher than

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.360
[Amit Varma]: those for private sector banks

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.360
[Amit Varma]: in fact the opposite incentives exist

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.360
[Amit Varma]: because often if powerful politicians say

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.960
[Amit Varma]: give him a loan or give her a loan

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.960
[Amit Varma]: they don't really have an option but to agree

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.960
[Amit Varma]: the columnist Vivek Kaul wrote an interesting piece

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.960
[Amit Varma]: on the site that I edit

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.960
[Amit Varma]: Pragati.com

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.960
[Amit Varma]: the name of the piece is called

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.960
[Amit Varma]: the separation of knowledge and power

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.960
[Amit Varma]: and he gave some great figures in there

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.960
[Amit Varma]: now consider these

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.960
[Amit Varma]: in the SBI their bad loans ratio of the bank

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.960
[Amit Varma]: when it came to home loans was 0.43%

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.960
[Amit Varma]: when it came to auto loans it was 0.65%

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.960
[Amit Varma]: for overall retail loans it was 0.55%

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.560
[Amit Varma]: but Vivek's piece reveals

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.560
[Amit Varma]: for large corporates it's 9.67%

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.560
[Amit Varma]: for mid corporates it's 19.35%

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.560
[Amit Varma]: for small and medium enterprises

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.560
[Amit Varma]: it's 7.04%

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.560
[Amit Varma]: which means 10 to 20 times

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.560
[Amit Varma]: as much as for auto loans or retail loans

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.560
[Amit Varma]: and far far more than the NPAs

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.560
[Amit Varma]: of private sector banks

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.560
[Amit Varma]: and the reason for this is essentially

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.560
[Amit Varma]: that politician tells you

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.560
[Amit Varma]: that you have to give him

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.160
[Amit Varma]: and another interesting figure he points out

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.160
[Amit Varma]: is he refers to a specific loan

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.160
[Amit Varma]: where a public sector bank

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.160
[Amit Varma]: gave a loan at a debt to equity ratio

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.160
[Amit Varma]: of 14.6 to 1

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.160
[Amit Varma]: while no private sector bank

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.160
[Amit Varma]: will ever give a similar loan

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.160
[Amit Varma]: at a debt to equity ratio more than 2 to 1

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.160
[Amit Varma]: and this is 14.6 to 1

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.160
[Amit Varma]: this specific loan that he talks about

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.160
[Amit Varma]: which is obviously political pressure

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.160
[Amit Varma]: and is deeply irresponsible

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.160
[Amit Varma]: and that is why we have such a massive NPA

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.160
[Guest]: problem in the country today

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.760
[Guest]: and this brings me to another unseen effect

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.760
[Guest]: of the ownership of government banks

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.760
[Guest]: is that it creates an uneven playing field

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.760
[Guest]: in the market

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.760
[Guest]: so there is sort of sovereign guarantee

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.760
[Guest]: which lies behind all these public sector banks

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.760
[Guest]: which have been created

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.760
[Guest]: by an almost act of parliament

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.760
[Guest]: so you won't see even their name appear

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.760
[Guest]: in the other public sector enterprises

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.760
[Guest]: so there is a sovereign guarantee

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.760
[Guest]: which these public sector banks enjoy

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.760
[Guest]: which a private sector bank does not enjoy

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.360
[Guest]: so a public sector bank can never go bust

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.360
[Guest]: that means because they have the taxpayers

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.360
[Guest]: always standing behind to bail them out

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.360
[Amit Varma]: so essentially if a public sector bank

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.360
[Amit Varma]: gives a loan to someone for 70,000 crores

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.360
[Amit Varma]: and that person defaults

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.360
[Amit Varma]: hey no sweat because the taxpayer pays for it

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.360
[Amit Varma]: right whereas with the private sector bank

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.360
[Amit Varma]: the taxpayer doesn't pay for it

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.360
[Amit Varma]: the bank can go bust

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.360
[Amit Varma]: it's the bank's responsibility

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.360
[Amit Varma]: and therefore the incentives are much better

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.360
[Guest]: within the organization to prevent

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.360
[Guest]: that kind of occurrence

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.960
[Guest]: so it's a forced market to develop

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.960
[Guest]: for banking

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.960
[Guest]: because it depresses

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.960
[Guest]: the private sector bank's competitiveness

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.960
[Guest]: to compete

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.960
[Guest]: and even then you will find it

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.960
[Guest]: our private sector banks

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.960
[Guest]: have done excellently well

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.960
[Guest]: by grabbing almost more than 30%

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.960
[Guest]: of the market share

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.960
[Guest]: from the time they were allowed

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.960
[Amit Varma]: to come in and start being in the business

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.960
[Amit Varma]: with banking

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.960
[Amit Varma]: but there is an argument that the counterfactual

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.560
[Amit Varma]: that private sector banks simply didn't exist

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.560
[Amit Varma]: because what public sector banks also do

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.560
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out in our conversation

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.560
[Amit Varma]: with me earlier

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.560
[Amit Varma]: is that they create an uneven playing field

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.560
[Amit Varma]: which stops private sector banks from growing

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.560
[Guest]: exactly

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.560
[Guest]: then there are some of the other unseen effects

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.560
[Guest]: of public sector banks

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.560
[Guest]: are that it depresses the growth in the economy

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.560
[Guest]: so when the flow of credit is determined

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.560
[Guest]: arbitrarily by the government or bureaucrat

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560
[Guest]: and not by the profitability or viability

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.560
[Guest]: of a business

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.160
[Guest]: then the hardened savings

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.160
[Guest]: which a banking institution

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.160
[Guest]: is supposed to channelize

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.160
[Guest]: into other productive users

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.160
[Guest]: now gets channelized

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.160
[Guest]: into non-productive users

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.160
[Guest]: that's why the higher NPAs etc

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.160
[Guest]: so you see that the otherwise growth

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.160
[Guest]: of the economy

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.160
[Guest]: would have been much higher

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.160
[Guest]: than what we see now

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.160
[Guest]: which also causes less jobs to be created

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.160
[Amit Varma]: and other related effects

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.160
[Amit Varma]: exactly, so in a proper free market

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.760
[Amit Varma]: where everything is just for supply and demand

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.760
[Amit Varma]: the money would go where the money is needed the most

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.760
[Amit Varma]: and that is something that the government

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.760
[Amit Varma]: with its fatal conceit of central planning

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.760
[Guest]: simply cannot manage

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.760
[Guest]: right, right

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.760
[Guest]: then another unseen effect

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.760
[Guest]: is the damage it does to the fiscal consolidation

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.760
[Guest]: so we have something called FRBM Act

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.760
[Guest]: Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.760
[Guest]: where the government of India

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.760
[Guest]: has put a constraint on itself

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.760
[Guest]: saying that we will abide by these rules

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.760
[Guest]: and not spend more than

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.360
[Guest]: say a certain amount of money

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.360
[Guest]: in this case being more than 3% of GDP

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.360
[Guest]: as fiscal deficit

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.360
[Guest]: so they won't cross that

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.360
[Guest]: but from the time of financial crisis

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.360
[Guest]: they have always been breaching that number

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.360
[Guest]: they have never gotten back to it

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.360
[Guest]: and sovereign credit rating agencies

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.360
[Guest]: when they come and rate India

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.360
[Guest]: they have always reprimanded in a way

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.360
[Guest]: the government saying that

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.360
[Guest]: you guys have been very profligate

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.360
[Guest]: particularly when it comes to banking

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.360
[Guest]: and not being able to control your NPAs

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.960
[Guest]: it prevents India from getting a good rating

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.960
[Guest]: and when you don't get a good rating

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.960
[Guest]: that means the cost of borrowing

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.960
[Guest]: for the entire economy goes up

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.960
[Guest]: so any business when they go out of India

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.960
[Guest]: try to borrow money

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.960
[Guest]: the cost of borrowing for it goes up

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.960
[Guest]: and similarly for India itself

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.960
[Guest]: the sovereign bonds that the government of India

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.960
[Guest]: will issue

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.960
[Amit Varma]: it will be able to raise funds

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.960
[Amit Varma]: at a higher rate from foreign borrowers

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.960
[Amit Varma]: so the ripple effects of that

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.960
[Amit Varma]: essentially go far far beyond

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.560
[Amit Varma]: the tax payers money going into

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.560
[Amit Varma]: capitalizing these banks

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.560
[Amit Varma]: going to the whole economy

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.560
[Amit Varma]: being curtailed as a result of all of this

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.560
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned the financial crisis

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.560
[Amit Varma]: so I want to ask you a question here

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.560
[Amit Varma]: which a lot of people speaking

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.560
[Amit Varma]: in favor of public sector banks

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.560
[Amit Varma]: often say that look

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.560
[Amit Varma]: we didn't suffer so badly

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.560
[Amit Varma]: from the 2008 financial crisis

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.560
[Amit Varma]: because so much of our banking

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.560
[Guest]: was public sector and blah blah blah

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.560
[Guest]: and this is the way the system is

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.160
[Guest]: so imagine a guy who is living in

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.160
[Guest]: a jungle of say central India

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.160
[Guest]: somewhere in it could be

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.160
[Guest]: Chhattisgarh or Jharkhand

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.160
[Guest]: when the crisis hit he was not affected at all

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.160
[Guest]: the same analogy can be used for India

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.160
[Guest]: so if you are not integrated

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.160
[Guest]: with the world economy

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.160
[Guest]: and a crisis is hit

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.160
[Guest]: and if you don't say that I didn't get hurt

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.160
[Guest]: because I was able to regulate

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.160
[Guest]: my banking system very well

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.160
[Guest]: it's not a very good argument to make

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.760
[Guest]: but you also lost quite a lot

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.760
[Guest]: had you been integrated into the global economy

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.760
[Guest]: you would have been able to have access

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.760
[Guest]: to these sources of finance

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.760
[Guest]: you would have been able to make

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.760
[Guest]: the kind of investments which you were never able to do

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.760
[Guest]: etc. etc.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.760
[Amit Varma]: so the opportunity cost is very high that way

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.760
[Amit Varma]: in other words what you are saying is

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.760
[Amit Varma]: if we were integrated into the world economy

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.760
[Amit Varma]: the gains from that would have been

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.760
[Amit Varma]: so much over the years

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.760
[Amit Varma]: that even if we suffered more

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.760
[Amit Varma]: in percentage loss terms

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.360
[Amit Varma]: we would still overall be far better off than what we were

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.360
[Guest]: definitely

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360
[Guest]: I mean look at the per capita income

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.360
[Guest]: of the countries which suffered

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.360
[Guest]: and per capita income of India

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.360
[Guest]: even after the crisis

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.360
[Guest]: they are much better off

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.360
[Amit Varma]: than we are today

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.360
[Guest]: so in a sense it's not a feature it's a bug

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.360
[Guest]: you could say that yeah

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.360
[Guest]: but I'll also say that

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.360
[Guest]: public sector banks

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.360
[Guest]: are not exactly completely

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.360
[Guest]: the culprits here

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.960
[Guest]: they are victims

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.960
[Guest]: let me explain that a bit

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.960
[Guest]: so public sector banks

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.960
[Guest]: have to go through dual regulation

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.960
[Guest]: so on the one hand

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.960
[Guest]: RBI regulates them like every other

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.960
[Guest]: commercial bank private banks

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.960
[Guest]: while Ministry of Finance also regulates them

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.960
[Guest]: number two is that

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.960
[Guest]: the poor pay compared to

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.960
[Guest]: a private sector bank

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.960
[Guest]: so which we have discussed briefly

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.960
[Guest]: in the beginning

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.960
[Guest]: that there is no way

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.560
[Guest]: and which cannot be changed without permission

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.560
[Guest]: from say Ministry of Finance

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.560
[Guest]: or a finance minister or somewhere

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.560
[Guest]: at that level

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.560
[Guest]: you cannot get good talent

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.560
[Guest]: through which you can probably do a better business

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.560
[Guest]: then there is external

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.560
[Guest]: vigilance enforcement through

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.560
[Guest]: Chief Vigilance Commissioner

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.560
[Guest]: or CBI

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.560
[Guest]: which are mandated to look into

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.560
[Guest]: the workings and the dealings

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.560
[Guest]: of public sector bank

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.560
[Guest]: in certain cases public sector banks

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.160
[Guest]: do RBI inquiries so what happens is that

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.160
[Guest]: the incentive that the banker has

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.160
[Guest]: knowing that he is going

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.160
[Guest]: to be publicly

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.160
[Guest]: scrutinized

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.160
[Guest]: from all these various agencies

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.160
[Guest]: is to play a little more safe

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.160
[Guest]: and not trying to take

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.160
[Guest]: kind of risks that

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.160
[Guest]: otherwise a private banker

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.160
[Guest]: would do and therefore increase

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.160
[Guest]: and these are some of the reasons probably

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.160
[Guest]: through which a public sector bank

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.160
[Amit Varma]: should be on par and play with

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.760
[Guest]: it should be freed up basically

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.760
[Guest]: and try and let them operate

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.760
[Guest]: like a private sector bank and that can happen

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.760
[Guest]: through making them

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.760
[Amit Varma]: like privatizing them

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.760
[Amit Varma]: so in a sense this is like the flip side of the NPA problem

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.760
[Amit Varma]: the NPA problem is that you are forced

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.760
[Amit Varma]: by political pressure to give out loans

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.760
[Amit Varma]: to people which you know are bad loans

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.760
[Amit Varma]: that are never coming back

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.760
[Amit Varma]: and the flip side of that is that

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.760
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to giving out loans

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.760
[Amit Varma]: because you know that every action of yours

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.760
[Amit Varma]: will be scrutinized

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.360
[Amit Varma]: and whereas with a private sector bank

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.360
[Amit Varma]: there is a healthy amount of risk

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.360
[Amit Varma]: that you have to take on

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.360
[Amit Varma]: with due diligence of course

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.360
[Amit Varma]: which public sector bank employees

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.360
[Amit Varma]: because they are not being rated on performance per se

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.360
[Amit Varma]: just want to cover their asses

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.360
[Amit Varma]: except when order comes from Netaji

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.360
[Amit Varma]: Right, exactly

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.360
