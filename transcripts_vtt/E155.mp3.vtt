00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day. I dreamed that while browsing in a bookshop, I ran into

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.560
[Amit Varma]: the me of 1990 from 30 years ago. He's 16 years old. I'm 46. He was walking around in

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.760
[Amit Varma]: the street in 1990 and walks into this bookstore, which magically also has another door leading

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.140
[Amit Varma]: out to 2020. The poor lad is bewildered by the books here. I watch him barely as he opens

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.220
[Amit Varma]: one book to that early page in which the date of publishing is written. And then he steps

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.180
[Amit Varma]: back in shock and horror. He turns around to see who else is there. But I'm the only

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.900
[Amit Varma]: one there. Our eyes meet, but he doesn't know he is me 30 years later. No doubt he imagines

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.400
[Amit Varma]: his future self differently. And as I now remember, he also imagines his present self

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.800
[Amit Varma]: differently from what it is. I look at him with jealousy. He's so slim with all his life

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.360
[Amit Varma]: ahead of him. I look at him with revulsion. I remember who I was my anxieties and my prejudices,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
[Amit Varma]: my unearned arrogance, my foolish vanity. I look at him with pity. He will take so long

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.160
[Amit Varma]: to learn so little and then it might be too late. And meanwhile, the poor lad is trapped

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.360
[Amit Varma]: in the future. As I am lost in these thoughts, I see him turn around and walk towards me.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.140
[Amit Varma]: I recoil in horror because at that moment, as his young eyes meet mine, it strikes me

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:27.720
[Unknown]: that he is less of a stranger to me than I am to myself. Welcome to the scene and the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
[Unknown]: unseen. Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.160
[Amit Varma]: host Amit Verma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. I'm often amazed by how much the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.360
[Amit Varma]: world has changed in the last 30 years, perhaps more than in any other 30 year span in history.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Technology, social media, globalization have all transformed our society. We normalize

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.480
[Amit Varma]: change so quickly. So yesterday's miracle is often today's banal. Yesterday's magic

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.360
[Amit Varma]: is today's science. So some of us don't even realize how much we have changed and are changing.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.200
[Amit Varma]: I explored some of this territory in episode 137 of the scene and the unseen in which the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: great columnist Santosh Desai shared his insights on the changes in our society in the last

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.200
[Amit Varma]: 30 years. And my guest today is Paromita Vora, another columnist who never fails to take

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.760
[Amit Varma]: me deeper into myself. So much of her work makes me look at the familiar with new eyes

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.120
[Amit Varma]: and new eyes. In fact, is a theme of some of her work. Paromita has made films, written

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.040
[Amit Varma]: many columns, created installations and open minds. Also, she brings to all her work a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.240
[Amit Varma]: lens that is different from the male gaze of men with beards, as she calls them, which

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.360
[Amit Varma]: misses as much as it sees. And as the show is called the scene and the unseen, how could

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I have a better guest on it than Paromita? Welcome to the show, Paro.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
[Guest]: Hi, thank you.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.600
[Amit Varma]: So, Paro, before we sort of get down to your work and all the weighty themes of this episode,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.480
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about yourself. What's your journey like? What did the seven-year-old

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Paro want to be?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.680
[Guest]: I think I wanted to be a librarian when I was seven years old. I seem to remember that.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.760
[Guest]: Which is a little bit like a drunk wanting to own an alcohol shop, right? I just I wanted

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.800
[Guest]: unlimited access to books like many of us at that age in that era.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.840
[Guest]: Where was this? Where were you born and brought up?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.000
[Guest]: I was born in Pune, but I was brought up in many different places because my father was

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.920
[Guest]: in the Air Force. And in fact, one of the things wherever I went was to find the local

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.240
[Guest]: lending library and become a member. And when I was seven, we were actually posted in Hyderabad

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.280
[Guest]: in Sikandarabad, which is a beautiful cantonment town and full of a sense of Enid Blyton like

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.000
[Guest]: mystery. Because, you know, since it's a cantonment town, it still has all those old colonial

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.840
[Guest]: buildings with very high ceilings. And I don't know if there's a secret passage behind this

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.480
[Guest]: room and all of that.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.560
[Amit Varma]: All famous five and five letters.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
[Guest]: And my brain was definitely chock full of having read all that stuff. And I wanted more

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.280
[Guest]: than anything to have a secret club, except I didn't have too many friends. And there

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.160
[Guest]: was a very old colonial club called the Sikandarabad Club, and it had a separate room, which was

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.360
[Guest]: a children's library, like almost like a little house inside some what felt like a forest

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.480
[Guest]: to me. When I saw it as a grown up, I was like, oh, it's just a few plants. And there

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.800
[Guest]: was a very elderly or seemed elderly to me at that time, Anglo Indian lady who ran the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.600
[Guest]: library. I was a bit scared of her, but she sort of took to this funny kid who would come

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320
[Guest]: every day. Every day I would go to the library for a new book, right?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.800
[Guest]: Were you the only kid who would go every day?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.040
[Guest]: I think I was the only kid who used to go to the library, maybe. I mean, there was a

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.760
[Guest]: shelf of Nancy Drew's and Hardy Boys and you know, that sort of thing.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And you read both.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.560
[Guest]: So I read both. I read all very quickly. And I might have been the only kid who was reading

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.160
[Guest]: the other books in the library, right? And she was very sweet. I was scared of her, but

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.720
[Guest]: now when I look back, she was very sweet, always looking for books to give me. And I

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.320
[Guest]: guess this was my idea of heaven as an odd child who didn't have a lot of friends, who

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.720
[Guest]: was a little peculiar and a bit of a misfit. So I obviously felt like when I grow up, if

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm a librarian, I'll always be at home.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And what is that kind of moment where you discover a different kind of literature from

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.440
[Amit Varma]: the children's literature? Like I remember for me, it was like I was very privileged

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.880
[Amit Varma]: in the sense my father had thousands of books at home. And one day I stumbled upon a book

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.640
[Amit Varma]: titled The House of the Dead. And of course, it seemed like a nice adventure book. And

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.040
[Amit Varma]: I picked it up. And it was Dostoevsky's account of his time in prison in Siberia. And I was

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.520
[Amit Varma]: completely hooked. So that's kind of, you know, I can remember that as a moment that

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.440
[Amit Varma]: changed everything for me. Was it a similar sort of?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.320
[Guest]: So I mean, I don't have such a precise memory, but I do think that this voraciousness is

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.000
[Guest]: a way that you, like your life changes because your appetite is constantly leading you to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.520
[Guest]: look for more and more things. And my parents had a lot of books and all the books used

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.800
[Guest]: to be kept in the study room, which had the television. So and you didn't really, I mean,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.320
[Guest]: back in the 70s, you watch TV once a week for the Sunday movie or Chitrahaar or whatever.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.240
[Guest]: So that room itself used to feel like a mystery room because you didn't go in there very often.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.480
[Guest]: Nobody was staying in that room. And that bookshelf, once I'd finished all my books,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.080
[Guest]: I obviously would keep looking. I must confess that the book I remember most was some kind

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.760
[Guest]: of a porno I found, I think. But yes. And then I got caught reading it and got whacked

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.720
[Guest]: also. But I mean, I think the first grownup book that I remember reading, though I don't

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.480
[Guest]: remember the book now, was Of Mice and Men. And I do think there's something fantastic

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.280
[Guest]: about reading something you don't really get. But knowing, you know, there is something

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.320
[Guest]: to get here. You know, there is that feeling of mystery and excitement and adventure and

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.400
[Guest]: gives you something to look forward to and push towards that I want to become the person

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.840
[Guest]: who understands that book. And so you start looking for other books along the way. And

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.440
[Guest]: I think in the same way, a little bit later, we were posted in Baghdad. My dad was posted

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.640
[Guest]: in Baghdad. And there was a Kendra Vidyalaya there.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640
[Amit Varma]: Kendra Vidyalaya in Baghdad?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.560
[Guest]: Yes. And in fact, you know, in the Kendra Vidyalaya, because I had studied in the South,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.240
[Guest]: my Hindi was horrible. And I was like, I cannot study Sanskrit. Like Hindi is bad enough,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.840
[Guest]: but now suddenly, so I cried and cried and I was somehow excused. And my Sanskrit teacher

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.280
[Guest]: refused to take that lying down. And she said, I'll give you extra classes in Sanskrit.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.600
[Guest]: And I'm very grateful to her because Sanskrit is a pretty systematic language. And because

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.400
[Guest]: now I see that I'm a conceptual thinker, so I really took to it. And my Hindi teacher

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.760
[Guest]: was very upset because I got like 100 on 100 in Sanskrit and some 5 on 10 or whatever 50%

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.840
[Guest]: in Hindi. And she felt betrayed by all of this. But I feel that my teachers at that

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:35.600
[Guest]: time also, teachers take an interest in the odd kids who they feel are bookish. And my

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.680
[Guest]: teachers gave me many books. So I remember that my social studies teacher gave me Alex

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.080
[Guest]: Haley's Roots, when I must have been 11 or something. So again, while reading it, I of

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.040
[Guest]: course understood that book, it was not so hard to understand. But it was a little bit

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.120
[Guest]: more grown up than the stage I was at. But I think all of those things, yes, did help

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.520
[Guest]: me know that the world is a very complex and interesting and different place. And all the

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.080
[Guest]: places I'm not supposed to go are the places I should definitely go and check out.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.800
[Amit Varma]: No, and it strikes me that back in those days, 70s, 80s, for a curious, imaginative Indian

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.640
[Amit Varma]: kid, which I also was in the 80s, I can remember there's really not much to do. You read books,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.760
[Amit Varma]: if you're fortunate enough to have books available to you, read them. But today there is so much.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.560
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you to take sort of a step out of yourself for a moment and imagine the seven

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.280
[Amit Varma]: year old Paromita or the 10 year old Paromita in today's times. Is she still reading as

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.960
[Amit Varma]: much? What is she doing? How is she driven?

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.720
[Guest]: I think a seven year old version of me probably would not exist very easily. Well, maybe they

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.760
[Guest]: do exist. I think I don't think that a seven year old today would be reading as much. But

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.880
[Guest]: I don't think that they're any different in terms of a sense of curiosity. In fact, you

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.080
[Guest]: know, the strange coexistence in India, especially of how on the one hand, kids are very separate

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: from adults. But on the other hand, they're all mixed up in adult life. I think it creates

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.960
[Guest]: a particular kind of condition. So I do think that seven year olds today are both very grown

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.800
[Guest]: up in some of the things they understand in ways that we certainly weren't. We were a

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.200
[Guest]: little bit more lost in the woods. But I think there is still a sense of mystery and science

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.080
[Guest]: that they're very interested in. I think certainly if I was seven today, I would be a little

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.520
[Guest]: bit more interested in doing experiments and learning how things work because YouTube is

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.520
[Guest]: the new library, right? I mean, the internet is a new library for kids. And I think they

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.840
[Guest]: are discovering varied things in it in their own way.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Can we explore the thought a little bit further? Like when you talk about how adult life is

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.800
[Amit Varma]: much more interspersed with childhood life than it was then, is that in some ways maybe

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.320
[Amit Varma]: a threat to the innocence of childhood? Or what does it mean for the experience of childhood?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.640
[Guest]: You know, I am not a fan of this innocence of childhood idea. I don't think that children

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.920
[Guest]: are any more or less innocent than anybody else. I mean, I perceive myself as a very

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.480
[Guest]: innocent person still. So I think innocence is a quality that all of us have. And some

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.720
[Guest]: of us hold on to it till we die. And some of us don't. And one of the reasons that we

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.080
[Guest]: don't is because innocence has a certain vulnerability involved, right? And when I say innocent,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:15.360
[Guest]: I don't mean naive or unknowing of the world, right? But rather that you're willing to be

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.120
[Guest]: surprised, rather that you're willing to imagine, like, going to something anew.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.440
[Amit Varma]: You're not jailed.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.720
[Guest]: Yes. So one of my favorite pieces of writing actually is William Blake's songs of innocence

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.800
[Guest]: and experience. And for me, it was a very novel idea when I read it that, well, being

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.040
[Guest]: innocent is not the same as being good. To know and then be good is very different than

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.760
[Guest]: to be virtuous by not knowing anything and maintaining innocence, right? So I'm not using

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.880
[Guest]: innocence in that way, but I'm using it in the sense of being open and vulnerable and

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.200
[Guest]: going in with a childlike curiosity and willingness to be delighted by something.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.060
[Guest]: That's why, you know, one of my dhaadiwala irritations is the way in which people speak

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.760
[Guest]: as if they already know everything.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.760
[Guest]: Yeah, the men with beard syndrome you have often written about.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.160
[Guest]: Yes, yes. And you know, Twitter has given so much play to that tendency. So somebody

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.040
[Guest]: will always say, oh, this is just happening because, you know, the liberal does this and

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.880
[Guest]: now the right wing is doing that and now this thing and that thing. And yeah, I don't disagree.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.280
[Guest]: But I also feel that if we can so neatly wrap everything up, then there's nothing left to

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.360
[Guest]: really learn in the world. And that is never true. There's always something new happening

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.360
[Guest]: at every moment. And innocence requires being open to that possibility rather than saying

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.360
[Guest]: that I know what everything is.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.360
[Guest]: I think the opposite of innocence is a kind of fear, which is if I don't already know

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.200
[Guest]: everything, then who am I? What am I? Like, you know, what's my role? So I think there

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.160
[Guest]: is that. But to go back to your question about the interspersing of adult and child, you

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.480
[Guest]: know, I think that it's actually not so much as it threatens children's innocence, but

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.480
[Guest]: it threatens their individuality. You know, the possibility of being bored, which is something

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.280
[Guest]: we are talking about as children, that you had to make your own entertainment. So you

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.240
[Guest]: kind of always were getting into places you were not supposed to. You inserted yourself

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.400
[Guest]: into adult life, tried to watch movies that were forbidden to you, tried to read your

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.400
[Guest]: parents' books, eavesdropped way too much on adult conversations in an effort to entertain

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.320
[Guest]: yourself as much as curiosity about what's forbidden. And I think today adults insert

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.960
[Guest]: themselves into children's lives too much. They want to pre-decide. And in a society

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.960
[Guest]: which already pre-decides so much, you know, in terms of our identity, so much is already

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.440
[Guest]: set out for the kind of life that we might end up having. Now there's an extra layer

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.520
[Guest]: of it that your kid is going to like, you know, parenting as an idea has taken hold

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.360
[Guest]: of middle-class India in a very big way. And especially with more nuclear families, the

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.000
[Guest]: tendency of parents to be involved in their children's lives to the extent where children

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.040
[Guest]: don't really have a strong sense of privacy, individuality, fallow time, a place basically

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.080
[Guest]: to become yourself. Because that's really what that time is, that you figure yourself

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: out as you go along, because nobody's really paying that much attention to you. And I think

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.960
[Guest]: paying too much attention to children is binding adults and children in some kind of an unhealthy

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.040
[Guest]: circle where, I mean, how do you also grow older if you're all the time in the role of

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.640
[Guest]: parenting, right? Because becoming older is also a pleasurable new experience. I can say

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.280
[Guest]: now that I'm growing older, it's because it's completely different. It's an unknown world.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.000
[Amit Varma]: That really gives me hope because I'm terrified of it. And yet it's happening.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.320
[Guest]: I think it's fantastic because you do change and you don't know you. You have the chance

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.200
[Guest]: to get to know yourself all over again in different phases of your life. And honestly,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.360
[Guest]: the biggest romance you'll ever have in your life is with yourself. So this newness of

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.400
[Guest]: you and even the fact that you're slower or that you think differently, you don't automatically

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.160
[Guest]: know all the popular culture. I was terrified of this happening to me because I love popular

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.080
[Guest]: culture. And now that I don't automatically know all of it, it's actually pretty okay

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.680
[Guest]: because there are some new things that I know or some harder things that I want to do, that

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.360
[Guest]: I feel able to do. And this is all a kind of new discovery of myself and through that

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: a new discovery of the world and other people, right? But I think if you lock yourself into

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.080
[Guest]: that role of parenting, then this kind of a stunting happens of both parents and children.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:30.800
[Guest]: So I think that childhood then doesn't become the place from which you grew up as it ought

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.680
[Guest]: to be. And I do see that replicated in a lot of young people's lives, a lot of young people

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.600
[Guest]: that I encounter, that there is also a desire to please the parents over much. There is

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.320
[Guest]: a desire to excel very fast in a way that is not possible when you're very young. You

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.720
[Guest]: need that time to become good at something, to learn. The importance of being unimportant,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.920
[Guest]: in other words, has really been devalued, right? Because to not matter all that much

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:06.600
[Guest]: gives you the freedom to make mistakes and meander. But to all the time be in somebody's

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:13.200
[Guest]: gaze is suffocating. And I feel that is really the loss that some childhoods are experiencing.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.880
[Amit Varma]: That's a very profound thought. And it also brings me to the question like both what you

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.180
[Amit Varma]: said about children suddenly having parents much more involved in growing up and also

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.080
[Amit Varma]: in the whole notion of the love affair with yourself, like you said, which I imagine for

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.000
[Amit Varma]: everyone would be a love-hate relationship. Brings me to the question of the construction

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.240
[Amit Varma]: of the self. Like if I may quote from one of your pieces, you've written an excellent

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.760
[Amit Varma]: article and all the pieces I refer to will be linked from the show notes. Quote, being

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.560
[Amit Varma]: yourself is often sold to us as something ineffable, as if there is a virgin self, noble

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.520
[Amit Varma]: and unadulterated found in the departmental store of life between Auroville mindfulness

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and vintage chic, which we must find and display for best results. Stop quote. And this really

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.680
[Amit Varma]: spoke to me because it's always struck me that you know what all these self help books

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.120
[Amit Varma]: talk about being true to yourself and finding yourself and being authentic and all of that

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.800
[Amit Varma]: is sort of circling around the central question of what are we it's not that all of us are

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.880
[Amit Varma]: unique. I mean, I tend to think that all of us are fundamentally the same. We are not

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.600
[Amit Varma]: blank slates because we are all hardwired in different but very similar ways. And obviously,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.720
[Amit Varma]: we are brought up very differently and go through different influences. But rather than

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.120
[Amit Varma]: searching for an authentic self, I think it is more, perhaps, a wise to search for the

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.320
[Amit Varma]: best self that you can be after you define yourself. And this you know, when you from

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.160
[Amit Varma]: the point of view of growing up, for example, just thinking aloud, it seems to me that children

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.160
[Amit Varma]: at the time we grew up would have a lot more space to themselves to think about stuff and

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.880
[Amit Varma]: to find what interests them and where they want to do. Whereas now perhaps the anxieties

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.440
[Amit Varma]: that are ubiquitous in modern lives are onto them much earlier than they used to be. And

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.240
[Amit Varma]: they're anxious to please their parent, they're anxious to please their peers on social media,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.460
[Amit Varma]: they're anxious to be validated and get notifications and retweets and so on. And dealing with anxiety

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.720
[Amit Varma]: is something that I think you will have to do anyway in an adult life. But now it comes

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.520
[Guest]: much earlier than it otherwise would.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.560
[Guest]: It does. And I think like the fact that you're always supposed to be present for somebody

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:20.080
[Guest]: else's gaze, really, it's disturbing, you know, because it creates a distortion of yourself.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.600
[Guest]: And I have to say that I don't think it's bad to be present for somebody else's gaze.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:33.640
[Guest]: I think this seeing and being seen is not just a social kind of thing. It's also a profound

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:39.880
[Guest]: human exchange that when two people meet each other, they see something about each other.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.720
[Guest]: That's what makes conversations really happen, right? I mean, the fact is that like why is

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.440
[Guest]: dating in India such an arduous thing? It's because people don't really have much by way

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.200
[Guest]: of the art of conversation going on for them, right? So there can be a dullness about or

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.240
[Guest]: a kind of by rote feeling about so many exchanges, because you're not really seeing the other

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.240
[Guest]: person and nor are you showing something of yourself. I mean, another version of this

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.280
[Guest]: is like sometimes women will say that I dress for myself. And they're saying it's reactively

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.680
[Guest]: because otherwise you're scrutinized so much for the way that you look as a woman. But

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.440
[Guest]: I think it's all right. It's all right to dress for yourself, but also to dress to please

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.440
[Guest]: others, also to dress to attract others. That is part of the exchange. Life is all about

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.840
[Guest]: yourself and others, yourself in the world, right? But I think that to be locked into

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.600
[Guest]: one thing where you can't withdraw from other people's gaze. Yes, I think that it's a terrifying

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.800
[Guest]: thought for me. So maybe I note it more when it's happening. But I think what I noticed

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.080
[Guest]: is that, you know, I began living on my own when I was 22 and it was very, very important

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.840
[Guest]: for me and not in a Virginia Woolf room of one's own kind of way, although it turned

00:18:52.840 --> 00:19:00.240
[Guest]: out that that's a very important truth. But I mean, I just want I didn't want to share

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.880
[Guest]: a place with anybody. I lived very poor in tenement housing, but I knew I had to be on

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.760
[Guest]: my own. And of course, I got some of the snide stuff from my relatives, not my own family,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.440
[Guest]: but my extended family about, well, obviously, if a girl wants to live on her own completely,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.200
[Guest]: what is it for? It's because she wants to mess around with boys. And I did want to mess

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.400
[Guest]: around with boys, of course. But I also just wanted not to be scrutinized all the time.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.800
[Guest]: I didn't want to account for every minute of my thoughts and movements. I just wanted

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.200
[Guest]: to come and go as I pleased. It was very hard being 22 or 23 and living on your own with

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.080
[Guest]: very little money. Even simple things like I didn't know how to cook properly and, you

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.760
[Guest]: know, I didn't have a fridge. There were a lot of logistical things you learn to navigate.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.940
[Guest]: But it was the most important thing I ever did for myself because, yes, by being completely

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:55.120
[Guest]: on my own, I figured myself out. And it takes such a long time to do that. So if young people

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.160
[Guest]: don't have that space to even start that journey. And we live in a society that is so social

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.160
[Guest]: and so family oriented and people are so keen on marriage. When are you going to get that

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.480
[Guest]: time? Right. So I feel, yes, that we do need to worry about maybe not social media so much

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.920
[Guest]: because I think that if you have that sense of a relationship with yourself, it gives

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.120
[Guest]: you a resilience vis-a-vis social media as well. I don't think you become as dependent

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.320
[Guest]: on that validation if you are given the time and you learn to make it important to yourself.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.760
[Amit Varma]: But how many people have that? And also what it strikes me and you've written about this

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.240
[Amit Varma]: very eloquently about, you know, how it's changed through the decades is just how one

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.120
[Amit Varma]: navigates relationships in the sense that like what you correctly said is that, you

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.800
[Amit Varma]: know, one of my favorite writers, Georges Simenon, the French author, once said that

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.880
[Amit Varma]: the fundamental problem in all his work was how one person can communicate anything to

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.080
[Amit Varma]: another person. We are all in a sense strangers to each other, which at one sense is bizarre

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.360
[Amit Varma]: because we're all in a sense the same. But when you speak about the, you know, the problems

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.640
[Amit Varma]: of communication between men and women in modern India, which is especially acute outside

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.320
[Amit Varma]: elite circles, where there are so many anxieties, crippling anxieties and all of that. And it

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.440
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that it's so tragic. You have a boy and a girl sitting with each other and

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.240
[Amit Varma]: the boy is essentially dating a vision of the person he wants to be with and vice versa.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.880
[Amit Varma]: And they don't know the real person. And when the real people collide, it inevitably results

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.040
[Amit Varma]: in heartbreak and you can live in that kind of denial and delusion all your life.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.760
[Guest]: You can. And I think so much of it also has to do with the fact that life is broken down

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.960
[Guest]: and that's not a new thing, but it's exacerbated now. Life is just like broken down into milestones

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.640
[Guest]: and goalposts, right? So you're just very anxious about getting to the next goalpost.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.240
[Guest]: And that also in the dating scenario gets replicated, right? Like, am I going to get

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.600
[Guest]: to first place? Am I going to get to second place? Am I going to do this? Is this going

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.560
[Guest]: to be a real thing? Is this going to be no strings attached? What is it? Like constantly

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.480
[Guest]: worrying about what it is rather than figuring out what you're feeling at that moment, right?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.200
[Guest]: So experiential things are not encouraged in our society. I remember that there was

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.880
[Guest]: a young woman who was part of a television show that I made and she had come away from

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.080
[Guest]: Meerut to be an actress in Bombay. And, you know, I mean, she didn't have much of a chance

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:18.320
[Guest]: of it. And then at some point she met Honey Singh at some awards function. I didn't even

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.400
[Guest]: know who Honey Singh was at the time we were making it. And in fact, I mean, one piece

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.360
[Guest]: of footage, she's dancing to something and I'm like, wow, this music is really awesome

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.000
[Guest]: that she's dancing to it. And my colleague was like, that's Honey Singh. And I'm like,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.880
[Guest]: oh my God, isn't that the person that everybody hates? But you know, the fact that she loved

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.840
[Guest]: his music and she got to meet him. And that was kind of like the excitement of the Bombay

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.960
[Guest]: dream that you may not become the actress, but you can still meet your idol. So there

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.480
[Guest]: was a magical quality. And it was a show in which women shot their own lives on video

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.200
[Guest]: for about a year. So she, you know, I remember she met Honey Singh at the awards function

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.920
[Guest]: and then she goes with a friend on the bike, on bandstand. And she's so happy that this

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.640
[Guest]: has happened to her. And she calls her mom and she's like, Mom, do you know what? I met

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.400
[Guest]: Honey Singh today. And her mother says, what's the use of that? And her face collapses and

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:16.360
[Guest]: she says, I mean, I was feeling happy. But what's the point of it? How does it matter?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.080
[Guest]: What's it going to add up to? It's something that we find a lot that we have to account

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:26.080
[Guest]: for. You repeatedly have stories of young people telling you that my parents don't care

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.440
[Guest]: that I found a job that I really, really enjoy. They just are like, oh, are you going to be

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.480
[Guest]: able to buy a house at x date? Are you able to do that? So now if that's what you're boiled

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480
[Guest]: down to,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.480
[Guest]: You could say she has an innocence by your definition, and they've lost it.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.400
[Guest]: In fact, in fact, I remember that in one of the scenes, she was waiting for an audition

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.560
[Guest]: and she started talking to another boy who was at the audition. And she asked him, how

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.880
[Guest]: old are you? And he said, 21. And she said, innocent. I loved the way she said it so much.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.320
[Guest]: So I also do frequently that were innocent. So but yes, she had that innocence, I have

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.520
[Guest]: to say, and maybe that's why what attracted me to as a character that she had the exuberance

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.960
[Guest]: to be happy, to allow life to surprise and delight her even in the shittiest of circumstances.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.160
[Guest]: She was also willing to be in the shittiest of circumstances, because she imagined that

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160
[Guest]: something good might happen.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Which film was this and when was this?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.560
[Guest]: It wasn't a film, it was a series that I did for Zee TV called Connected Hamtam. And it

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.320
[Guest]: was about five women at a turning point in their lives, real life women, who shot their

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.600
[Guest]: own lives with a video camera for one year. And then we made like these 65 thematic episodes

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600
[Guest]: with it.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600
[Guest]: And when was this?

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600
[Guest]: 2013, I think.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600
[Guest]: Oh, okay. Have you met her since?

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I've been in touch with her. It's been a while. She's still the same. She's still

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.760
[Guest]: the same. And it's pretty remarkable, right? Because she still hasn't become an actress.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.320
[Guest]: But she still thinks she might.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.880
[Amit Varma]: The interesting thing about Honey Singh is though a lot of his music and lyrics are misogynist

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.480
[Amit Varma]: and he is whatever they say is a specific rape song that was attributed to him was actually

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
[Amit Varma]: fake news.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480
[Amit Varma]: It was by another band.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.600
[Guest]: But he is misogynist. And I think like, the outrage against his lyrics, you know, I feel

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.760
[Guest]: divided about it. But I do think that, you know, if performers can be encouraged to think

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.520
[Guest]: outside the box, because these are also by rote formats, right, that you're gonna write

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.960
[Guest]: about a girl like this, and you're gonna do this, but you can actually write something

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.720
[Guest]: completely different, because a lot of it is also about the music and the kind of rhythmic

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.440
[Guest]: quality of the lyrics, right?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.960
[Amit Varma]: But just thinking aloud, I guess, in an artistic sense, the more successful you are, the more

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.240
[Amit Varma]: you're incentivized to play it safe. Because if something has brought you there, boy meets

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.320
[Amit Varma]: girl songs have brought you there, why would you try something different, you know, and

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.360
[Amit Varma]: therefore, you only try to do different things where you're not successful. So whatever,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, you

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.160
[Guest]: I mean, I think there's some truth in that. I think that only people who the people who

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.440
[Guest]: create newness and change are always the people who don't, who are not in the system already,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.360
[Unknown]: right, who are not the beneficiaries. So that really brings us back to why dhariwala men

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.640
[Guest]: are so predictable and boring, why they'll always really imagine that the utterly boring

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.400
[Guest]: thing they've said is worth saying. It's because the system has rewarded them endlessly, right,

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.120
[Guest]: for just being guys. And so there's no challenge to that. Of course, the challenge has come

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.560
[Guest]: because you are seeing a complete change in gender relationship.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.840
[Guest]: The challenges come from you. I mean, just dhariwala columnist versus non dhariwala columnist.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm presuming you include me among dhariwala columnists.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480
[Unknown]: I don't know about that.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.480
[Unknown]: Yeah, now you're going to be polite.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.480
[Amit Varma]: I refuse to come into all this.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480
[Amit Varma]: Okay, that's okay.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:36.040
[Guest]: No, I'm just saying that, like, there is a shift, right? There are so many kinds of,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.960
[Guest]: I mean, it's not just about women, like the entire trans community poses a complete rethink

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.760
[Guest]: to how we talk about gender and how we talk about each other for that matter. And I know

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.080
[Guest]: that sometimes political correctness feels like too much of a schlep. And it feels like,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.640
[Guest]: oh, but you know, you're being too persnickety. But the thing is, it is the thing that brings

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.560
[Guest]: a shift in our way of looking at things, right? And whenever somebody tells me that, oh, it's

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.400
[Guest]: so difficult to use the pronoun they, like, what's the big deal? But you know, there was

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.120
[Guest]: a time when nobody, I remember that when I would say, please don't write miss, write

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:18.240
[Guest]: miss for me, people would be like, they'd roll their eyes. See, this is what I mean.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:25.080
[Guest]: Boys love puns, but boys who will become men with beards. I used to always say I want a

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.280
[Guest]: t-shirt that says Pushpa, I hate puns because boys are often subjected to the unending puns

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.600
[Amit Varma]: and I'd be like, stop it, stop it. I don't often do this, but anyway, you've caught me

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:41.360
[Guest]: in a weak moment. If you say so. So I think that there is a challenge posed to that way

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.600
[Guest]: of being and thinking. And I think those people who embrace the challenge will do something

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.520
[Guest]: fantastic and new. And those who don't embrace the challenge, but who become sulky in the

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.560
[Guest]: face of the challenge or say that I'm being attacked and what do you people know? You

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:03.600
[Amit Varma]: will just keep doing the same old thing and become obsolete. So choose. Yeah, no. And

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.840
[Amit Varma]: what strikes me is that look, the universal anxiety that we all have and that humans have

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.240
[Amit Varma]: their hard wire to have is the anxiety to be loved, to be validated by others, right?

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you keep constructing yourself in response to what you think others would

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.000
[Amit Varma]: appreciate in you. You might define the others differently from people around you, but whatever

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.440
[Amit Varma]: you construct yourself that another thing is when society is changing so fast. And when

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.960
[Amit Varma]: the preferences of society are changing so fast, that also means that that constant reconstruction

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.720
[Amit Varma]: of the self also then has to gather us, you know, then the requirement for that gathers

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.880
[Amit Varma]: a certain velocity. And I can totally see a lot of people, including men with beards,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.480
[Amit Varma]: including, you know, middle aged people like me, who are just then the reflexive responses

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.640
[Amit Varma]: to say, no more, you know, you know, what is this shit?

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.480
[Guest]: I mean, I think change is overwhelming, you know, change inside you and change outside

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:00.600
[Guest]: you is overwhelming. But maybe it also means making a different relationship to time. And

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:07.120
[Guest]: I would stress again, a different relationship to yourself. I think I have a friend who feels

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:15.520
[Guest]: annoyed by the way that I seem to keep shifting subjects I work on, because I do get interested

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.920
[Guest]: in a topic for a very long time, right? Like, I worked on a lot of things about the city

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.280
[Guest]: for an extremely long time. But just when writing about Bombay and making films about

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.960
[Guest]: Bombay became a cool thing, it felt like I shifted focus.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.680
[Amit Varma]: You made a film trying to find Sandra from Bandra. Everybody watch it, please link from

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.600
[Guest]: the show notes. Yeah, so I'm thinking you're a rabbit hole person. I'm a rabbit hole person.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.640
[Guest]: As in you find a subject you like and you go down the rabbit hole. Yeah, but I go down

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.080
[Guest]: the rabbit hole is the correct way, actually, because it's not like I'm not a completist.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.680
[Guest]: I won't read all the books by writer and because I'm not a boy, I'll not get all the albums.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.920
[Guest]: But I'm definitely willing to go down the rabbit hole and see what will happen. And

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.080
[Guest]: then once like the full pleasure of it has been experienced for me. And there must be

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.360
[Guest]: something perverse that when the really big rewards start coming in, because now that

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.880
[Guest]: thing has become more established as an idea and more people are working on it, I start

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.160
[Guest]: to lose interest in it. And I don't feel like doing it anymore. Now, this might just be

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.240
[Guest]: my personality quirk. But I think that saved me from some of the things that you're talking

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.040
[Guest]: about right now. So my friend who's annoyed with me, he calls me bunky Julia because he's

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.080
[Guest]: like the closer success comes to you, the more inside the forest you want to go and

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.240
[Guest]: like investigate some new Florida and fauna. And I'm like, Yeah, but imagine I get to do

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.160
[Guest]: it. So there are many ways to define success. One would be that I just sit in the same damn

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:41.720
[Guest]: tree until the turn of the tree comes around, right? Or the other is that I really like

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.240
[Guest]: I've worked for 30 years doing a number of very different things. I have not conformed

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.240
[Guest]: to this idea of the brand, right, that you just do one thing in one way, and then you

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.400
[Guest]: become really, really successful. And no, I'm not really successful in that sense. But

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.160
[Guest]: for me, the definition of success is that I want to do certain things. And I get to

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.480
[Amit Varma]: do them. And there's a memorable line from one of your columns that seems to express

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.080
[Amit Varma]: this where you talk about how the treadmill has been sold as a journey. Yes. And you've

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.400
[Amit Varma]: basically said that no, you know, I'm not getting on one of these treadmills. I'm going

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.240
[Guest]: deeper into the forest. And you know, it's because I have a great annoyance and dislike

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:23.320
[Guest]: of being bored. Like I cannot tolerate boredom of the kind that comes from pretense. So I

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.760
[Guest]: don't mean like sitting at a railway platform for three hours is unbearable. On days it

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.840
[Guest]: may be unbearable on days it's pretty okay to drift off. But that thing that you make

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.760
[Guest]: me watch a movie that is just pretentious. Yeah, it's like there's nothing new in it.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.200
[Guest]: It's just pontificating. Or somebody writes the same old politically correct posturing

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.000
[Guest]: kind of novel that I'm supposed to hail it as the great new piece of political writing.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.640
[Amit Varma]: I refuse. In fact, you've created a hashtag that sort of sums all this up. Why don't you

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.880
[Guest]: share it with us? Yes, I want to make this hashtag famous. Hashtag bore mat kar yaar.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Social media, please find ways to make this hashtag famous because it applies to

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.640
[Guest]: so much. Right. And I also think that if people refuse to be bored, the world will have a

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.640
[Guest]: lot more like lively work, you know, I think that actually, I feel the hashtag very political,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.200
[Guest]: because I see so many people do a lot of boring work, but still get to be in really important

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.200
[Guest]: places, you know, like you'll see the same filmmakers in the same kind of film and everybody's

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.760
[Guest]: trashing the films, but they're again making those kinds of films. And the same opportunities

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.480
[Guest]: that are writers, there are columnists, there's all kinds of things. And it is privilege.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.840
[Guest]: The very fact that you have gender and caste and class on your side means that you get

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.920
[Guest]: the right to bore other people. And I think you can boil it down to a very simple experience

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.480
[Guest]: that of going to a family dinner. And there's always one uncle who bores you, you know,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: better let me tell you. And then they'll start telling you about, you know, whatever, whatever

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.320
[Guest]: is a new course, they don't even know anything about it, but they will start to tell you.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.160
[Guest]: And I used to always get angry when this used to happen. I used to leave the table, I used

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.080
[Guest]: to say, abo kuch nahi pata, my parents would be like, you can't talk like that. And I'm

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.960
[Guest]: like, he can't talk like that. I know more about it than him. So this insubordination

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.960
[Guest]: wasn't coming out of rudeness or any kind of youthful hotheadedness. It is just like,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.120
[Guest]: how can you bore me? Because that boringness is coming out of your right to oppress me.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.480
[Guest]: You are taking up my time. You don't think that you have to charm me, please me, engage

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.280
[Guest]: with me. That is boredom, right? That you think I'm not there. I just have to be this

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.760
[Guest]: blank and captive audience to whatever you throw my way.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.080
[Amit Varma]: But then, you know, that brings up an interesting question, which is that, does that mean that,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.920
[Amit Varma]: for example, a filmmaker who wants a film to unwind at its own pace, like say, a Tarkovsky

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.600
[Amit Varma]: or a Bellator or whatever, is boring you and is not conscious enough of entertaining the

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600
[Guest]: audience as you say?

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.200
[Guest]: No, I don't think that boredom is the opposite of entertainment in the conventional sense,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:52.680
[Guest]: right? To engage me, to challenge me is to not bore me. Even when I said earlier that

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.360
[Guest]: the idea that you would show me the same hackneyed thing, the hackneyed thing pretending to be

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.520
[Guest]: new is a thing I can't bear. And we have too much of that around. Somebody is supposed

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.800
[Guest]: to be a cutting edge filmmaker who's not like that. That edge won't even cut butter. So

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.480
[Guest]: I just feel like I don't want to. I don't want to be part of receiving any of that.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.640
[Guest]: I won't see those films. Like now, because I'm older, I also have a new column called

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:25.640
[Guest]: Life is Short, by column I don't mean writing column, but like it's a section in my invisible

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.280
[Guest]: notebook that I'm not seeing that film because life is short. I'm not going to do that because

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.760
[Guest]: life is short. But to engage us, to make us see the world differently, like a Tarkovsky,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:42.120
[Guest]: classical music, Drupad, these are difficult things to learn and to enter sometimes, not

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.040
[Guest]: always. But I think the invitation to the entry is full of, there is a passion, there's

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.480
[Guest]: an intelligence, there's a challenge to me. I don't mind being challenged. I may even

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.960
[Guest]: come out saying that didn't really work for me, but I don't mind if there is that honesty

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.920
[Guest]: of that artist really wanting to do something, really having something to say. Right. So

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.200
[Guest]: I obviously don't mean that's something that is like, I met somebody the other day who

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.280
[Guest]: said like, you know, people don't have an attention span for more than six minutes now.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.360
[Guest]: So the ideal length for a video is, or it should be 25 minutes, which every listener

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.720
[Guest]: of the scene in the unseen knows is utter bullshit. It is bullshit because you know,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.520
[Guest]: I think films are as long as they need to be. And they could be very long and very short.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: So I have made films 13 minutes long. I have made films 95 minutes long. I mean, I make

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.360
[Guest]: the film till the film is there. And I've had people watch the long films and the short

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.400
[Guest]: films. Somebody can feel bored in a 10 minute film also. I frequently felt bored in a 10

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.160
[Amit Varma]: minute film. You can feel bored in 30 seconds. Just to sort of pick up one of the phrases

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.840
[Amit Varma]: you use, which was hackneyed. And I'm again thinking aloud here. But you know, when I

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.480
[Amit Varma]: was a cricket writer, a decade and a half ago, and one of my constant bugbears was that

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Indian writers use so many effing cliches in their writing, you know, like Martin Amis

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.280
[Amit Varma]: titled one of his books, a war against cliche and cliches are obviously the biggest. And

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.800
[Amit Varma]: it happens far more in cricket. And after a while, I realized that no, wait a minute,

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.880
[Amit Varma]: it's not because they don't know. Or it's not because they can't think outside cliches.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.720
[Amit Varma]: It's because especially in places like the Hindu where this post writing was supposed

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.880
[Amit Varma]: to be very good and was extremely bad and cliche ridden. And you know, verbose and flowery

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:19.360
[Amit Varma]: and cliche ridden. And, and I realized that it is a virtue to know as many cliches as

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:26.640
[Amit Varma]: you can, as for example, you know, Ravi Shastri does or Sidhu does, or whatever, you know,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:33.080
[Amit Varma]: when I was blogging back on the blogspot version of India Uncut in perhaps circa 2005 2006,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.520
[Amit Varma]: I started documenting Shastri's cliches well before anybody else. And it came to more than

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.720
[Amit Varma]: 100 posts, I think, because, you know, it would just think I don't know much about Shastri.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And, and I find this problem in films also, though, I am obviously not as educated

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:52.040
[Amit Varma]: in terms of films, as you are to be able to speak about it. But I find it one, the problem

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:58.440
[Amit Varma]: of avoiding cliches is harder in films. Because if you typically set up a scene in a particular

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.960
[Amit Varma]: way, it almost like becomes a convention ki pehle long shot fir mid shot, koi baat kar

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.080
[Amit Varma]: raha hai to close up, stuff like that. How do you avoid those cliches, which are perhaps

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.160
[Amit Varma]: harder to avoid, but all other kinds of cliches, like the way a story unfolds, or whatever.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, am I right in saying that the cliche is a bigger problem in Indian popular culture?

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.040
[Guest]: So I think that there is, I don't know if the cliche is a bigger problem. I don't I

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.440
[Guest]: mean, like, see, right now, there are the protests going on, and people are writing

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:32.760
[Guest]: poems at like a high, high rate. slogans are amazing. Yeah. And you're seeing so much newness.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.080
[Guest]: You're seeing a real absence of cliches. Otherwise, you know, protests when you were younger,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.920
[Guest]: like we used to cringe because they were a they were a location of cliches. And so much

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: of political language has been ridden by political cliche. But I would like to argue that one

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.560
[Guest]: can look at this occurrence of what you're calling cliche in two different ways. One

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.440
[Guest]: is that certainly in India, or Indian culture, Indian social culture, there seems to be a

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.800
[Guest]: great comfort derived from saying something which everybody knows. And there's a deep suspicion

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:09.880
[Guest]: of the person who is saying something that seems not so familiar. But more so if that

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.640
[Guest]: person is trying to say that I'm better than you, because I'm saying something not so familiar,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:20.560
[Guest]: right? So yes, the joke, which we all know, will always make a group of people crack up.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.000
[Guest]: And we always feel like, I mean, there'll be those of us who feel like this is a cliche

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.400
[Guest]: joke where people laughing at it. But there is something about like a kind of community

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.160
[Guest]: culture, where saying things which everybody knows, makes me seems to make urban middle

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.440
[Guest]: class people feel comfortable. So there's one type of cliche operating there. The other

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:44.160
[Guest]: is writing artistic production, where you do not expect to find cliche, you know, which

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.480
[Guest]: is supposed to be the place where cliches are killed. So the new things can be made

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.760
[Guest]: are so comfortably cliched, which I think does have a lot to do with privilege. Because

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.960
[Guest]: really, if a lot of your work and I'll take documentary film as an example, I think that

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.480
[Guest]: so much of Indian documentary filmmaking, there have been some great filmmakers here.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.240
[Guest]: And I don't even want to preface the word doc filmmaking with documentary filmmaking

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.520
[Guest]: as if it's not a film, I feel very irritated with those who say, I'm going to make a film.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.480
[Guest]: And they always mean fiction feature. But really, a documentary is also a film.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, this is why in my introduction, I specifically made sure I referred to you

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.640
[Guest]: as a filmmaker, not as a documentary film.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:29.160
[Guest]: Yeah. So I mean, the thing is, I make documentaries and documentaries are a kind of film. But

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.840
[Guest]: I think that while there's been like tremendously exciting work done in Indian documentary,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.920
[Guest]: you also have had a convention of the political documentary, which says the same things in

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.200
[Guest]: the same way forever and ever. And it is more a demonstration of your political position

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.480
[Guest]: than a real exploration of an idea from your political perspective. These are two different

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.280
[Guest]: things, right? So I feel like the first, which is just demonstrating your political position,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.360
[Guest]: is simply a reiteration of your privilege.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Can you illustrate that? I mean, not with specific people or so on, but you know.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.640
[Guest]: So, you know, for example, I would say that there'll be a roster of topics of importance.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.640
[Guest]: And communalism has always been on top of the list. If you want to show that you're

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.560
[Guest]: communal, you have to be anti-communal. So, for example, speaking about feminism, it's

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:22.920
[Guest]: not that high on the list. It's not considered to be that important. So similarly, having

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:28.560
[Guest]: a film which will not have a commentary is considered to be a purer kind of filmmaking

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.560
[Guest]: because you're letting the people speak in their own voices. These are certain cliches

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.720
[Guest]: of filmmaking. They're not cliches when they started out. They came from a very particular

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:46.040
[Guest]: place that the technology of cinema made it possible for us to record interviews. And

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.600
[Guest]: why should I impose what something means onto you? But after some time, it just becomes

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.440
[Guest]: a stock fashion of shooting something. You know, I'm not even really thinking about this.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.240
[Guest]: I will make a film in which people will speak in their own voices. They will only fit into

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.440
[Guest]: a schema of what is liberal and not liberal. But by making that film, what is really happening,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.040
[Guest]: I am showing that I am liberal. And because I am liberal, I should have the privilege

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.600
[Guest]: to decide things for others. And my way of saying should rule the country. So a lot of

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:20.720
[Guest]: the enterprise of documentary film was too closely entangled with the idea of the nation

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:26.200
[Guest]: state and how the nation state should be. So either it's critiquing the nation state

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.640
[Guest]: or it is with films division expressing the desires of the nation state. In contrast to

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:40.840
[Guest]: that, what you do have in the late 90s and early 2000s is a kind of like an efflorescence

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.640
[Guest]: of filmmaking approaches where somebody is making a film about their parents. Somebody

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:52.480
[Guest]: is making a film about body image. I made a film about feminism and what it means to

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.880
[Guest]: me. So you're actually seeing suddenly that documentary becomes a way to express yourself

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:05.360
[Guest]: creatively and politically. And that gets rid of some of the cliches. So what I want

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.200
[Guest]: to say actually is that a cliche in form or cliche in work is really a cliched way of

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.080
[Guest]: thinking. It presents something that is otherwise considered to be a cliche suddenly seems fresh

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.920
[Guest]: when it is located in a different way of thinking. And I would say we should also be careful

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.240
[Guest]: to distinguish between cliches and conventions. I don't think that conventions are automatically

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.160
[Guest]: bad things. I think the convention becomes a cliche when the filmmaker is not really

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.400
[Guest]: thinking or the artist is not really thinking why they want something in their film, right?

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.320
[Guest]: So I'll give you an example in film criticism. One of the things that you frequently find

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:47.560
[Guest]: people saying in India is, oh, you know, it's Indian films are inferior because they have

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: song and dance. People are running around trees. This idea that realism makes a film

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.560
[Guest]: more rational, that it makes it superior and serious. And therefore, it's an art film and

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.960
[Guest]: that's what we should aspire to. I think this is such a primitive way to think about something.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.200
[Guest]: You know, realism is only an aesthetic because everything is a lie. Everything that we make

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.640
[Guest]: is a construction. So realism is a kind of way in which I make the film. And fantasy

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.960
[Amit Varma]: is another way in which I might make the film.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.040
[Amit Varma]: You're never realistic. You're just pretending to be realistic is what you're saying. And

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.640
[Guest]: therefore, it has as much artifice only expressed differently.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:27.000
[Guest]: So realism is an artifice, the same way that when you say, oh, today is Desi day. So today

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.600
[Guest]: you wear a saree. As if to say you are not Desi on the rest of the days, but you are

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.600
[Guest]: Desi and your dress is as Desi as a saree in some senses. Is English and Indian languages

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.000
[Guest]: one of those same discussions, right? So what is considered to be the norm and what is considered

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.160
[Guest]: to be the oddity or the exception then has a lot to do with who is in a place of privilege

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.240
[Guest]: or what ideas are being privileged, right? So the idea that we now have to shake off

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:58.880
[Guest]: this Desi-ness, it's like having some kind of an accent in your English that you have

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.680
[Guest]: songs in your film, right? That makes the film somehow infradig. I feel this is really

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.120
[Guest]: cliche thinking because in fact, the presence of the songs is an act of great sophistication

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.280
[Guest]: in filmmaking. It's the poetic with the prosaic, right? It's a place of emotion. It's a place

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.880
[Guest]: of eroticism. We've had great poets write songs in Hindi films. You have amazing song

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.520
[Guest]: picturizations. The height of sophistication of Hindi filmmaking is in the songs. The height

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:30.800
[Guest]: of stupidity is in the criticism that says, Oh my God, these songs. So, you know, a stupid

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:38.080
[Guest]: gaze can destroy something beautiful so quickly. And the stupid gaze often comes with just

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.920
[Guest]: privilege, which doesn't recognize that there are other ways of looking at the world. And

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.720
[Guest]: that's why that gaze is always destined to become obsolete. The person who retains their

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.840
[Guest]: innocence in a way, which is to say that I could be wrong. I could change the way I think.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest]: There is no danger in changing the way I think because I'm not clinging to my privilege at

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.760
[Guest]: all costs. That person is not going to become obsolete because they will always be open

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.040
[Guest]: to the new thing, feel delighted by it, and then employ it in their work, right? So I

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.840
[Guest]: think that's the kind of cliche tendency which creates boringness. So we now will have very

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:14.240
[Guest]: boring films or very retrograde films in their thought, which look realistic. So now everybody

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.160
[Guest]: will say it's very good. And, you know, it's these are the people who will put India in

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.960
[Guest]: the international scene. Why do we care so much about the international scene? Like who's

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.720
[Guest]: gaze that's performing for somebody else's gaze? I mean, we've got a massive country

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.680
[Guest]: with massive audiences. I think we're pretty okay. So, you know, that's why I love Shahrukh

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.040
[Guest]: Khan because Shahrukh Khan is like, no, I care about the Indian audience.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.120
[Amit Varma]: And this is fascinating because I was talking about cliches and cricket writing in popular

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.440
[Amit Varma]: culture. And you sort of expanded my gaze on cliches, by pointing out that cliches can

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.520
[Amit Varma]: apply to ideology and politics as well. And what it boils down to is that, you know, another

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.880
[Amit Varma]: way of thinking about this is that look, the world is deeply complicated. So we have to

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.800
[Amit Varma]: explain it to ourselves by making up stories about it, by building frames through which

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.940
[Amit Varma]: we can look at the world and things make sense. And we build those frames. And those frames

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:07.280
[Amit Varma]: give us a certain comfort and therefore become a cliched way of thinking. And especially

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:13.680
[Amit Varma]: in modern, we start to assume they are normal. Yeah, yeah, right. And that seems to be especially

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.280
[Amit Varma]: hardened in modern times by two things. One is, of course, social media has the effect

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.000
[Amit Varma]: of drawing us into echo chambers and what Cass Sunstein calls group polarization, where

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.160
[Amit Varma]: within groups who agree with us, we become increasingly more extreme than we already

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.520
[Amit Varma]: were and more hardened. And the other also is that, you know, I feel incredibly thankful

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.240
[Amit Varma]: that 25 years ago, there was no Twitter, because I would have said and done the stupidest things.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And then, because I have put something out in public, I would have felt compelled out

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.200
[Amit Varma]: of ego to double down on it. And that could actually have become my hardened position,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.760
[Amit Varma]: almost forced by the gaze of others that once I have said this, and then people attack me,

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.920
[Amit Varma]: and then I double down on it. And then I find a tribe that agrees with the original thing

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.300
[Amit Varma]: I said, and soon I am part of the tribe and any independent thinking I could subsequently

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.160
[Amit Varma]: have done, sort of vanishes. And that's, that's something that worries me.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.360
[Guest]: Do you think that really you never had hardened positions before Twitter, in your peer group?

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Of course I did. But I think they arose gradually. And I also think that the early positions

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:19.160
[Amit Varma]: I had when I was in college, might have hardened, I'm speculating, might have hardened, had

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.960
[Amit Varma]: I actually taken positions on them in social media, and joined a particular ideological

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.200
[Amit Varma]: tribe or the other, and then I would never have been able to leave.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.400
[Guest]: Maybe I don't know. But I think that, you know, already the previous discussion we were

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.640
[Guest]: having tells us that maybe social media amplifies what is already out there. But I do think

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:43.480
[Guest]: that there are so many people who choose something very early in life, and then stick to it,

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:50.120
[Guest]: no matter what, even if they're miserable, stay in bad marriages, in awful jobs, because

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.580
[Guest]: I think that's what they ought to do. They've said that this is what they are, and now they

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.120
[Amit Varma]: cannot possibly abandon it.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a sunk cost fallacy plus the inertia of life.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.760
[Guest]: Inertia of fear, what else is out there, plus great dependence on how other people see you.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.160
[Guest]: So I think like this hardening of positions, first of all, I think in youth, we all do

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.760
[Guest]: it to some extent or the other. So for example, a common example of it is when two people

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.760
[Guest]: you know who are romantically involved fall out with each other, right? And say you've

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.680
[Guest]: never liked your friend's boyfriend. And then she's like, he's this way and he's that way.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.000
[Guest]: You're like, yeah, I always felt he's this way. I'm so relieved you're not seeing him.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.960
[Guest]: After one week, they get back together. It's over, right? Like you're out of the picture.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:39.920
[Guest]: Because to some extent, so I think it's the fact that people feel like they want to disconnect

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.680
[Guest]: themselves from that position which they had. That's one way. So they harden the position

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.640
[Guest]: for the boyfriend. No, I never said that. You were the one who was saying this, whatever,

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.640
[Guest]: that would be one. The other thing is that once they have said he's horrible, they're

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.500
[Guest]: unable to go back to the person because they have said he's horrible, right? So this tendency

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:03.200
[Guest]: to harden the position, I think it's a human tendency. I do think that, yeah, because social

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:09.960
[Guest]: media is so amplified and social media rewards you fast. You have reason to stick with very

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.640
[Guest]: silly type of things. But I don't think it's any different than real life. The fact that

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:21.760
[Guest]: you won't leave a marriage, relationship, job, career choice, house, family that's cruel

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:27.200
[Guest]: to you, whatever, all of these things. I mean, when you see the show The Crown, you often

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.280
[Guest]: wonder why Princess Margaret doesn't just give everyone a kick and go off. But she's

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.620
[Guest]: just embedded in that royal family, its privileges, and wanting their approval despite the immense

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:43.040
[Guest]: cruelty to her. So I feel like actually that happens. And social media has created different

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.960
[Guest]: types of cultural capital and rewarding very quickly. So it's very difficult for you to

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.560
[Guest]: leave those rewards, but it is exactly the same as life. And in other words, I have also

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.480
[Guest]: seen people on social media change their positions over time. I have seen them become different.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.680
[Guest]: I have been trolled a couple of times very badly online quite some time ago before it

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:09.680
[Guest]: was such a common thing. And because it was not so common, it was traumatic for me. And

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:15.600
[Guest]: the first time around, I cried. I felt like I'll never recover from it. It felt very,

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.960
[Guest]: very serious. But I think the impact that it had on me actually was, A, I thought very

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:29.080
[Guest]: hard about why it had happened. I felt there was even, I didn't agree with it, but I didn't

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:34.320
[Guest]: disagree with the essential political thought that it emerged from. And actually, because

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.600
[Guest]: I suffered so much from its cruelty, it did change a little bit the way I began to write

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:43.280
[Guest]: about other people. So I feel in the long run, it did change me, and it did change my

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.160
[Guest]: positions. Since I'm not a person who takes a lot of, like, I don't spend a lot of my

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.040
[Guest]: time online, I don't express myself online in the same way. Perhaps I'm not the right

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.160
[Guest]: person to talk about it. But I do feel that this interactivity with others can yield many

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.480
[Guest]: selves. And I have seen other people also change the way that they are. I don't think

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:08.680
[Guest]: it's impossible. But and I do think that through this very, you know, like, hyperkinetic format

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:13.840
[Guest]: that we're in, we will also reach a place of conversation, which is more reasonable,

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.840
[Amit Varma]: I hope.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.720
[Amit Varma]: No, and I don't want to be an old man with beard railing against social media. And oh,

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.720
[Guest]: look what the young...

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.720
[Guest]: No, you love social media.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I love social media. And one of the things that I think it gives us is an escape

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.600
[Amit Varma]: from cliche. Because we are exposed to newer kinds of thinking than we otherwise would

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.840
[Amit Varma]: have been newer forms of art than we otherwise would have been. And that sort of changes

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.160
[Amit Varma]: everything. So I kind of came into this episode thinking, okay, there are three big themes,

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:42.360
[Amit Varma]: I guess we'll talk about, which are feminism, documentary filmmaking, and desire and sexuality.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And instead, we've had this delightfully digressive chat, which we will continue, which I'm very

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.720
[Amit Varma]: happy. This is exactly I think my listeners will agree, this is exactly how a good conversation

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:56.400
[Amit Varma]: should be. And we shall continue after the break and also get to those three topics.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So let's take a quick commercial break.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.800
[Amit Varma]: If you've gotten so far in this podcast, it means you like listening to good audio content

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.640
[Amit Varma]: and you're thirsty for knowledge. In that case, I'd urge you to check out Storytel,

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.840
[Amit Varma]: the sponsors of this episode. Storytel is an audiobook platform that has a massive range

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.320
[Amit Varma]: of audiobooks from around the world. Their international collection is stellar, but so

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.680
[Amit Varma]: is their local collection. They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks. What's

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.320
[Amit Varma]: more, I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I talk

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.240
[Amit Varma]: about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of the book and so on.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:40.200
[Amit Varma]: As long as Storytel sponsors the show, I will recommend an audiobook that I liked on that

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.720
[Amit Varma]: platform every week. My recommendation for this week is a brilliant collection of short

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.160
[Amit Varma]: stories by Hansda Sauvendra Shekhar called The Adivasi Will Not Dance. When I first read

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.200
[Amit Varma]: this book, it reminded me of Manto. And you can now listen to The Adivasi Will Not Dance

00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:01.000

[Amit Varma]: that Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com. Welcome back to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Paromita Vohra on many, many different non-cliched things. And let's

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of get back to biography. So you know, one of the interesting things I learned about

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.880
[Amit Varma]: you while trying to research for the show was that you once worked in the same place

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:26.680
[Amit Varma]: as I did, which is Channel V. And you wrote Videocon flashback for Javed Jafri for a short

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.920
[Amit Varma]: time for a short time. And I wrote Timex Timepass for him a little while after that, you know,

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:37.960
[Amit Varma]: both of us also worked with Manu Chopra, who was the lead writer on both those shows. Take

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.840
[Amit Varma]: me through your journey working while living alone in Mumbai. Like, were you sure from

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.760
[Amit Varma]: the start that you want to be a filmmaker? What did you want to be? How was that process

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760
[Guest]: like?

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:53.080
[Guest]: I think, I mean, like people often ask me, when did you decide this? I decided early.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:58.120
[Guest]: But it was not decided. I mean, I don't know. I was not a very career minded person. I was

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.240
[Guest]: very like I wanted to work, but I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I studied English

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.080
[Guest]: literature in college. I went to a great college with great teachers, Miranda House. And I

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:12.160
[Guest]: kind of felt like I'll just do my MA now. And I didn't have any plan in life. I had

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:19.960
[Guest]: a teacher, Zakia Pathak. She was really awesome. Very strict, very rigorous intellectually.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:24.320
[Guest]: And she used to wear fantastic earrings. So we were all very dazzled by her. And she taught

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:31.120
[Guest]: us the Greek classics. And I was quite a chela of hers and would feel devastated if I disappointed

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.680
[Guest]: her in any way. In my third, and you know, I had no friends. I was just like misfit character.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.760
[Guest]: I didn't even take the U special because I was so scared of other people. The U special

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.000
[Guest]: is a bus in Delhi, which is only for the university, the university special. It's a DTC bus, but

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.240
[Guest]: it only goes to the university from different areas. But I didn't go in it. In fact, I suffered

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.960
[Guest]: the bad DTC buses because I was more scared of my peers than of the molesters in the buses.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.760
[Guest]: Why were you scared of your peers?

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:02.520
[Guest]: Because I perceived myself to be very odd. I thought people would mock me or make fun

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:08.920
[Guest]: of me or something. Like I really felt very uncomfortable with other people. And I felt

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:14.240
[Guest]: my differentness very acutely, in part maybe because I had changed schools such a lot.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:20.200
[Guest]: And being the new kid always, you're already very strange and different and bookish. And

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.920
[Guest]: then you're also the new kid. And I was very shy. I am very shy, although it doesn't seem

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.560
[Guest]: that way. So I think I found it very difficult. I found it very, very difficult to be a young

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:35.480
[Guest]: person. And I wasn't like other young people with that life and those pursuits that young

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.840
[Guest]: people have. So it's only later in college that I began to make some friends. So I had

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:45.400
[Guest]: friends in school, not that I didn't, but I didn't have that kind of youth lifestyle

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:52.560
[Guest]: that many of my peers did. My cousins, my sister, all of them. So anyway, in the end

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:58.140
[Guest]: of my first year, I came second in the university. But I know there have been the doldrums academically

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.360
[Guest]: for quite a long time. So suddenly, I mean, I made the college famous. So I suddenly became

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.520
[Guest]: famous. And that gave me a certain amount of confidence, which is why I also have this

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.880
[Guest]: belief that, you know, people always telling you that you must learn to love yourself and

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.280
[Guest]: only then the world will love you. But I don't think so. I think sometimes when the world

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.120
[Guest]: loves you, you also learn to love yourself. And certainly when people began to take me

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.520
[Guest]: seriously because I had got some kind of academic rank, I also took myself a bit seriously.

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:28.960
[Guest]: I felt a bit more confident as I started making some friends. And then I made a lot of friends

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.800
[Guest]: and I became extremely sociable. And by the time I hit the third year, I was like, anyway,

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:38.600
[Guest]: I didn't like the third year syllabus so much. And I began doing a little badly, relatively.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.000
[Guest]: And one day Sakya Pathak met me in the corridor and she said, Paramita, what do you plan to

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.280
[Guest]: do after college? She had this very clipped way of talking. I don't know, ma'am, I think

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.600
[Guest]: I'll do my MA. I also said it in this very like, I'm so stylish, I don't know what I'm

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:58.000
[Guest]: going to do. And she said, this is an extremely non-serious approach. It's very nice to be

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.880
[Guest]: popular, but that doesn't mean that your studies should suffer. So I said, no, ma'am, I don't

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:09.160
[Guest]: know. I immediately became siddha. And I said, no, I think I'm going to do my MA. She said,

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.520
[Guest]: we would love to have somebody like you in academics, but it's very important to go out

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.480
[Guest]: into the real world and see what else there is. And if you don't like it, you can always

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:23.520
[Guest]: come back. I'm so happy she said that to me because I kind of took it to heart. And then

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.560
[Guest]: my friends were doing this, they're going to apply for this Mastcom thing. And by then

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.680
[Guest]: I knew, like people used to let me be a journalist. I didn't want to be a journalist. I knew I

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:37.000
[Guest]: wanted to do something creative and documentary films sort of like made its appearance on

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.760
[Guest]: my horizon. And I thought like, maybe this. And then I came to Bombay to study at the

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:47.600
[Guest]: Sophia College at the Polytech doing Mastcom. And the first Bombay Documentary Festival happened

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.200
[Guest]: when I was in college. And we got that week off to watch films. So every day from nine

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.080
[Guest]: in the morning to nine at night, I watched films nonstop. And I think it was fantastic

00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.240
[Guest]: because I saw that documentaries are very open ended form. You can make anything, everything

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.680
[Guest]: is a documentary, right? And it was also because there were not only Indian films, but films

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:10.280
[Guest]: from all time in India. So I saw filmmakers like Shastri, Sukhdev, etc, who've seen a

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:15.240
[Guest]: resurgence and rediscovery in the last few years, but whom we didn't know in the 90s.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.620
[Guest]: And I also saw great filmmakers from around the world. It was like an amazing edition

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.620
[Amit Varma]: of the festival.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.240
[Amit Varma]: What are the people who struck you or what are the films which struck you in particular

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.600
[Guest]: and inspired you?

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.600
[Guest]: Well, I think I remember that I saw India 67 by Sukhdev and felt amazed that this was

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.880
[Guest]: a film I could make. You know, Anand Patwardhan came to show us Bombay, our city and it totally

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.760
[Guest]: like galvanized me as a young person, I felt full of political fervor. But of course, later,

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:45.200
[Guest]: Jean Rouge, Chronicle of a Summer is my favorite film, favorite film, I adore that film. And

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.160
[Guest]: it was, it's just my desire to make a film like that someday. And Agnes Varda, whom I

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:56.720
[Guest]: love very much. So these, you know, Chris Marker, I think these are all filmmakers.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.520
[Guest]: And as you can see many, like Chris Marker is a very abstract filmmaker. So to go back

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.960
[Guest]: to our earlier conversation, although I believe that things should be engaging and pleasurable,

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.000
[Guest]: I do think pleasure is also intellectual. I think thinking is the greatest pleasure

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.800
[Guest]: in the world. It's the most luxurious and voluptuous thing that we can have is to just

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.920
[Guest]: think. So all of these filmmakers actually think in different ways, and they have created

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.680
[Guest]: different forms for the way they think. So I love that. And I felt this is a form in

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:26.760
[Guest]: which I can be political, creative, expressive, and I can be myself. I can find myself. I'm

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:31.480
[Guest]: saying this retrospectively. I don't think I had this thought at that age. But I felt

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:36.280
[Guest]: ki haan. I mean, if you look at it biographically, perhaps the story of my life is the story

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:45.320
[Guest]: of hiding from my peers at all times. No, no one else from your Mastcom class went came

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:50.960
[Guest]: to this documentary. No, actually, I'm trying to think is anybody else? No. I was the only

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.320
[Guest]: person who who makes documentary films from my badge, if I remember right. Some people

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.040
[Guest]: might have applied for the internships, like, you know, whatever, I got to do my internship

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.040
[Guest]: with Anand Patwardhan, which was also very lucky for me, because it was right at the

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.120
[Guest]: heart of what I wanted to do. And I worked for Anand for three and a half years, which

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.480
[Guest]: was, I would say, a great political education. Imagine you're a middle class kid, and you

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.360
[Guest]: end up working for a political filmmaker. There I discovered textile mill workers union,

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.240
[Guest]: I discovered organizations like Awaz-e-Niswa, Ekta Samiti. I mean, there was just a whole

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:29.040
[Guest]: world of independent artists and political people, actors, filmmakers, all sorts of people

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.200
[Guest]: coming in and out of Anand's house. He did all his work on his own, right, like all he

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.080
[Guest]: owned his own equipment and edited his own films. So for a young person, it was a great

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:44.640
[Guest]: exposure to filmmaking as well. I was also lucky because it was at one of the most fertile

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.120
[Guest]: periods of Anand's life. And I think it didn't hurt that he had a very obsessively hardworking

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.200
[Guest]: assistant like me, to augment that a bit, but he made three films while I worked with

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.360
[Guest]: him. So I also got a lot of learning from it. And you know, I have my differences with

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:04.760
[Guest]: his kind of filmmaking, and we've argued about that. But I think it opened up, it opened

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.800
[Guest]: up a world for me. It helped me to add, even the fact that I had differences, right? The

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.560
[Guest]: fact that I sat for three years and watched him edit, allowed me to think that I don't

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.400
[Guest]: think he should do this. I don't think we should talk about this in this way. And that's

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.800
[Guest]: a big thing, to be able to work with an artist for a long time, to see how their voice is,

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.760
[Guest]: to not only be thinking of what kind of film you want to make, just to be immersed. It

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.320
[Guest]: is such an amazing experience and a very great learning, which I think young people really

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.920
[Guest]: deprive themselves of nowadays, because everybody's very keen to make something of their own fast.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.080
[Guest]: But I think just being a bit lucca, and being an assistant for a long period of time was

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.400
[Guest]: good for me. When I quit my job there, I worked with a couple of other filmmakers, Richard

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.080
[Guest]: Joshi. But then also, I was living in Bombay, and I had to earn a living, right? So I ended

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.320
[Guest]: up doing like, I directed a couple of episodes on one show you might remember called Show

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320
[Guest]: Theme. Do you remember?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.320
[Amit Varma]: No, I don't remember which one.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.840
[Guest]: Oh God, it used to be on Doordarshan. And it was one of those early, in the 80s, a show

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.400
[Guest]: where there would be a theme. And there would be an anchor talking about that theme. And

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.680
[Guest]: then there'll be scenes from films or songs from films around that theme. And I directed

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.680
[Guest]: an episode where Bhagyashree Patwardhan was the anchor. So I was quite excited. So yeah,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.680
[Guest]: I worked with Manju Singh. I don't know if you would remember her, Manju Didi. She used

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680
[Amit Varma]: to do one children's show on TV.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.680
[Guest]: The name is familiar. I think I'm a few years after you in the last few years.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
[Guest]: Four or five years.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.680
[Guest]: Yeah, the late 80s is like, I don't...

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So but you've seen Golmal, the Rishikesh Mukherjee.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Of course, yeah, yeah.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.680
[Guest]: So the person who plays Amol Palekar's sister, she was like this famous Manju Didi of Doordarshan,

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.840
[Guest]: right? And so I worked with her, which was, yeah, she was already, not many people knew

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.680
[Guest]: her anymore. But she also had produced this great series called Ek Kahani.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680
[Unknown]: I remember.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.680
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. So, you know, I mean, it was already at the end of her glory days, but still, it

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.680
[Guest]: was an interesting thing to go into all these different universes. Then Channel V happened

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.680
[Guest]: and I worked there for a while. I wrote a soap opera, which had never got made. I did

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.680
[Guest]: a bunch of different things. And I'm very grateful for that chance. I worked on Sanjay

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.680
[Guest]: Leela Bhansali's film Khamushi. I wrote some of the scenes in that film.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680
[Amit Varma]: Horrendous.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:17.680
[Amit Varma]: I just said horrendous in response to Bhansali. I'm sure your scenes were very good.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.680
[Guest]: I mean, actually, I'm a great fan of Bhansali's.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Khamushi is actually a pretty good film, but I'm not a fan of his later work. I have to

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.680
[Guest]: confess.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.680
[Guest]: Oh, well, I loved Hamdil Dei Chukya Sanam and I love Ram Leela. But yes, I got a lot

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.680
[Guest]: of gullies for writing a column in which I praised Ram Leela from my friends because

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.680
[Guest]: they went and saw it and they were like, Paro, what do you mean?

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.680
[Guest]: You are trolling us now.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.680
[Guest]: I feel like Bombay afforded all these possibilities. Two things, really. One is that you could

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.680
[Guest]: go into completely different universes. It's not just that you're stuck with your own kind

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.680
[Guest]: of people. It's not like you moved to Bombay and stayed in the Bandra-Varsova stretch and

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.680
[Guest]: hung out with other hipsters and tried to make it in a fairly sanitized media industry.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.680
[Guest]: But really here, to make a living, you did what you could do. On the one hand, what would

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.680
[Guest]: now be called hipster space of Channel V. There was a very political space of political

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.680
[Guest]: documentary. There was a slightly like seedy space of the B-grade television and sometimes

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.680
[Guest]: writing some faalto script for somebody, whatever. Corporate films. I worked for a corporate

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.680
[Guest]: filmmaker for a while, but it was so good. I worked on a couple of ad films. So to have

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.680
[Guest]: this very agnostic kind of Catholic exposure, to learn that I really don't want to do this,

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.680
[Guest]: oh, I see what is needed to do this. I think it was really good for me. I think it somehow

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.680
[Guest]: was formative in a way I didn't understand at that time. And I think it was lucky for

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.680
[Guest]: me because it mirrored my personality without my realizing it, because I am very eclectic

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.680
[Guest]: in my tastes, in my work, and in the worlds I like to belong to. So this kind of a queer

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: existence, you could say.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Did it also shape your personality as much as mirror it?

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:05.680
[Guest]: Who can say? I think certainly the fact that you go into different places allows you to

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.680
[Guest]: see things from different points of view. When you're working on a film, your job is

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.680
[Guest]: to do whatever is needed to be done for that film. So in a sense, you sign on to the enterprise

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.680
[Guest]: and you see it from the point of view of that enterprise, whatever is needed to be seen.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.680
[Guest]: You may disagree with it. You may say, ye mujhe jamta nahi hai, ye film ko aise nahi

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.680
[Guest]: banana chahiye, whatever, and leave. But you have been through that whole journey. So I

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.680
[Guest]: think this is valuable. Yes, maybe it does shape your personality in that you learn to

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.680
[Guest]: be more relaxed about yourself because you also become more confident about what you

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:39.680
[Guest]: think. Whereas if you always exist only in one universe, you may lose some of that confidence

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.680
[Guest]: in yourself because you become very dependent on the dynamics of that universe.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and what I see in a lot of young people today, like you mentioned earlier, that they

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.680
[Amit Varma]: want to make their thing very fast. And there is a sense of entitlement that the world sort

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.680
[Amit Varma]: of owes them something. And your experience seems interesting, not just in terms of the

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.680
[Amit Varma]: fact that you had a long apprenticeship in various places, or that, you know, the eclectic

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:09.680
[Amit Varma]: nature of your learning. But also, would you say that part of growing as an artist, one

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.680
[Amit Varma]: quality that is important to be able to grow as an artist is also humility, where you're

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.680
[Amit Varma]: willing to learn from others and from different sort of setups, even if, you know, you're

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.680
[Amit Varma]: not looking down and saying, oh, this is B grade, I don't want to do this. But it's like,

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.680
[Amit Varma]: no, what can I learn from this? Is that a big part? Because it seems to me that one

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.680
[Amit Varma]: of the follies of youth, and you know, certainly one of the things I lacked when I was younger

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and I've only gradually come to appreciate, is that humility where you are not the center

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.680
[Amit Varma]: of the universe.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.680
[Guest]: I think not being the center of the universe is very well put. It's very important. I come

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.680
[Guest]: from a mixed family. My father was Punjabi and my mom is half Bengali and half Khoja.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.680
[Guest]: And when my mother experienced the full and pleasurable force of Punjabiyat, I would say,

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:55.680
[Guest]: because I love being Punjabi. She always used to say that, you know, something would happen

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.680
[Guest]: and she'd say, oh, PMS, which was not pre-menstrual syndrome, Punjabi male syndrome.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.680
[Amit Varma]: Twitter kindly note, this can be another hashtag.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:10.680
[Guest]: But it would be about how much boys are valued, actually, that mothers love their sons more

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.680
[Guest]: than they love their daughters. But the way in which we value boys and don't value girls

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.680
[Guest]: is that boys don't really know what it is not to be the center of the universe.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.680
[Guest]: And in a sense, what we discussed earlier about young people or children, the fact that

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.680
[Guest]: children are always at the center of their parents' universe. So that becomes a crisis

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.680
[Guest]: when you're not at the center of the universe. You feel anxious and you feel you're failing

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.680
[Guest]: if you're not all the time at the center of the universe, which is a lot of what accrues

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.680
[Guest]: through social media validation, right? That, OK, I'm at the center. I'm at the center

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.680
[Guest]: of the conversation. So I think, yes, not being at the center of things was very important

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.680
[Guest]: for me. Maybe it suited my personality, which is that I'm scared of everybody and wants

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.680
[Guest]: to hide, but it also did shape my perspective. In fact, it allowed me to come to the center

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.680
[Guest]: from time to time without feeling I have to be there all the time, right?

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:02.680
[Guest]: And this idea of a dance, I like the metaphor of the dance in so many ways because it is

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:07.680
[Guest]: about somebody leads, somebody follows. You can take turns doing that, or there can be

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.680
[Guest]: a group of people. You can be a backup dancer for some time, and then you can be the central

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.680
[Guest]: dancer for some time. And sometimes when you work on a friend's film, it is that, right?

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.680
[Guest]: I've had friends who are filmmakers work on my films. I have worked on my friend's film

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.680
[Guest]: in any sort of capacity sometimes. Recently, I directed a video and I had very bad assistant

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.680
[Guest]: directors on it, and I knew that I was going to get screwed if I didn't get better help.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.680
[Guest]: And I called up my friend, and three of my women friends were all directors who've all

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.680
[Guest]: made feature films and are accomplished directors. They came and they assisted me like they were

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.680
[Guest]: writing things on cupcakes and they were just doing everything. And this other friend of

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:49.680
[Guest]: mine who'd come to the set was like, wow, these women are amazing. And look at the way

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.680
[Guest]: they've just taken over and they know what to do. And I'm like, obviously they're filmmakers,

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.680
[Guest]: but they didn't have any hang ups about coming and just doing that. And I think I feel the

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.680
[Guest]: same way, right? So I think what that gave me, it's not only about it's okay not to be

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.680
[Guest]: at the center, it gave me tremendous enjoyment of life, right? Like it is so enjoyable not

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:11.680
[Guest]: to be the one who's responsible. When you are working on somebody else's film, you're

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.680
[Guest]: having all the fun of being on a project without a really big responsibility of...

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.680
[Amit Varma]: You share in the pleasure of the work without the pressure so much.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's like being an aunt, right? Like you get the fun of the kids without...

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Without having to change the diapers.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.680
[Guest]: But you're also there as a support to your friends. And you experience that. What does

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:35.680
[Guest]: it mean to be part of a group in a positive sense while being an individual? Actually,

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.680
[Guest]: you get to experience that. That's one thing. I think the other thing that it taught me,

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.680
[Guest]: which is very important, you know, is to get out of that cliché thinking. No thing is

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.680
[Guest]: automatically better or worse. You look at everything for itself. One of my favorite

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.680
[Guest]: lines is a line from a Hindi film song, a very old Hindi film song. And it is,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.680
[Guest]: Badli teri nazar to nazare badal gaye. If you look at something differently, it looks

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.680
[Amit Varma]: different, right? It's what gaze you bring to it.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.680
[Amit Varma]: I think your film Unlimited Girls has this quote from, quote about changing your eyes

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.680
[Guest]: instead of...

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.680
[Guest]: Now a very famous masterposed. The journey of discovery lies not in seeking new landscapes,

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680
[Amit Varma]: but in finding new eyes.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680
[Guest]: Yeah, which really struck me.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.680
[Guest]: No, it is a beautiful thought. It's an important thought. Love is that kind of a thing, right?

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.680
[Guest]: That when you look at something with the gaze of love, you see it very differently than

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.680
[Guest]: when you look at it with a cold gaze. So very bad behavior, looked at compassionately and

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.680
[Guest]: with love, becomes explained that somebody is hurting, so they are behaving badly. And

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.680
[Guest]: you understand that. As opposed to when you're not looking at them with love and you're just

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.680
[Guest]: like, what the hell is this behavior? And both gazes are important and valid in their

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.680
[Guest]: own ways. So I think I learned the value of that.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.680
[Guest]: It also opened me up in a very interesting way. So for example, while making my films,

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:58.680
[Guest]: I found this peculiar experience that often people whose politics I agreed with would

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.680
[Guest]: behave obnoxiously. And people whose politics I was opposed to would behave very nicely

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.680
[Guest]: with me, right? Like you're interviewing some fundamentalist, moral policing type of

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.680
[Guest]: person, and they're calling you to their house and taking out their best china and

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.680
[Guest]: giving you sarson ka saag and makki ki roti. And there's somebody whose politics you

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.680
[Guest]: admire and they keep you waiting, they cancel at the last minute. And to be open to

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.680
[Guest]: understanding this, that you know, you can agree and disagree with people at multiple

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.680
[Guest]: levels. I can disagree with your behavior, while agreeing with your ideas, and vice

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.680
[Guest]: versa. Actually, it also changed my political perspective. So I feel like traversing all

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.680
[Guest]: of these different universes allowed me to be politically much more open.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and this is something like what you just spoke about speaks to this fundamental

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.680
[Amit Varma]: truth of what Walt Whitman expressed in, you know, I contain multitudes. And the thing

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.680
[Amit Varma]: is, in today's day and age, where everything is, oh, there I go on my man with beard social

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.680
[Guest]: media rant again, but it made you so self conscious. You made me so self conscious.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Excellent. Actually shaved today before coming. So but not that that takes away my beard.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, so you know, we often want to see the world in binaries. And we refuse to

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.680
[Amit Varma]: accept that people can have so many multiple sides to them. But there is this almost this

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.680
[Amit Varma]: need to condemn anyone as a hero or a villain. And anyone who tries to find nuances

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.680
[Amit Varma]: is basically shat upon by all sides. You know, for example, when Vajpayee died, and it was

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.680
[Amit Varma]: all a binary. And the truth of the matter is that he enabled fascism to a certain extent.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:37.680
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, he was an excellent Prime Minister. And there's no harm in sort of,

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, accepting both those sides. And even within those sides, the different sort

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.680
[Amit Varma]: of journeys that he made. And it's, you know, the same with Nehru, for example, you know,

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.680
[Amit Varma]: again, a great man, I can say a lot that is good about him, and a lot that is bad about

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.680
[Amit Varma]: him. But today, it's like you only see a Nehru which is a caricature, not a real, fully rounded

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680
[Guest]: person.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Just a person who was trying to do something, right?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And you never consider the circumstances of the times or what those people are sort of

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.680
[Amit Varma]: responding to or reacting to or whatever.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.680
[Guest]: No, I think that what you say thinking in binaries is the great affliction of our times,

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680
[Guest]: you know, and the internet.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.680
[Guest]: Spoken like a man with beard, honestly.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:22.680
[Guest]: Once in a while, we take your privilege for ourselves, just as a little bow, not the whole

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:31.680
[Guest]: costume. But I think that, you know, eventually, we can't remain in that binary, you know,

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.680
[Guest]: human beings can't. And we will always shake ourselves free from it. And then the binary

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.680
[Guest]: tries to impose itself on us and we shake ourselves free from it. So I do think that

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.680
[Guest]: things like poetry, art, feminism, all of these things, they exist to demolish that

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:52.680
[Guest]: binary and the queerness of being politically, humanly, sexually, emotionally. That's life.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.680
[Guest]: That's actually where life happens, you know. The truth lies in the middle, as they say

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:05.680
[Guest]: sometimes. But I think that's not a fashionable viewpoint right now. I think that why it's

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.680
[Guest]: particularly difficult is because if you're not willing to see things like step out of

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:17.680
[Guest]: them for a second and see them as processes that are occurring, people play a certain

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.680
[Guest]: part in history and certain really good intentions can have really bad effects at times. We see

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.680
[Guest]: this in individual life and we see this in historical moments. And if we're not able

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.680
[Guest]: to do that for ourselves, we will always feel very afflicted. And I think we'll find it

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.680
[Guest]: difficult to, we'll be anxious all the time, like our anxieties will, it'll ratchet up

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:45.680
[Guest]: our anxieties. And we do see that as well, right? So I guess we will find a way as human

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.680
[Guest]: beings to move away from these binaries. I do think that a lot of the protests that we

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.680
[Guest]: see around us right now in this political moment is actually a push back against this

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.680
[Guest]: very, very constricting way in which both liberal and right-wing politics have often

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.680
[Guest]: constructed reality and politics for us. You are seeing now people redefining that politics.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.680
[Guest]: And I think we can't look at these protests, for instance, only in terms of the immediate

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.680
[Guest]: result, but in a long-term sense, they signal a shift in the way people are thinking about

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.680
[Guest]: who they are, how they should be, how politics should happen, who should make that politics

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.680
[Guest]: happen. What we call leaderless revolutions is not an easy thing, but it is there. It's

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.680
[Guest]: a real thing that's happening, right? There are multiple leaders, multiple voices. So

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.680
[Guest]: I think it indicates that we want to get out of the binary and we're looking for a way

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.680
[Guest]: to do it. That's why a lot of it is happening offline. It's not coming from the online,

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680
[Amit Varma]: which has become rigid as a structure.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.680
[Amit Varma]: That's very true. And a reflection of that is perhaps these spontaneous protests that

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.680
[Amit Varma]: are happening throughout the country over the last few days. And they're not led by

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.680
[Amit Varma]: anyone or even any particular ideological core or whatever. They're just spontaneous

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.680
[Amit Varma]: outbursts and within them, they contain so much diversity. And yet they're all responding

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.680
[Guest]: to the times in this passionate way.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.680
[Guest]: And perhaps it was important for some time to assert our differences. Maybe that was

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.680
[Guest]: needed to not say hum sab ek hai, because hum sab ek nahi hai. To assert that differentness,

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.680
[Guest]: to talk about caste, gender, sexuality, class, language, ethnic identities, all of these

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.680
[Guest]: things, maybe we needed to do that in order to come to a place of some commonality, right?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.680
[Guest]: So I do see it also as that kind of a cyclical movement.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Let's kind of get back to the first of our themes I wanted to pursue, which is

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.680
[Unknown]: no, don't give that embarrassed look. I'm thoroughly enjoying this. This is my model

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.680
[Amit Varma]: conversation. I sadly booked the studio only for three hours. So we have an hour and a

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.680
[Amit Varma]: half only to go. Let's talk about sort of documentary filmmaking. And one of the things

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.680
[Amit Varma]: that you've spoken about is how there were these traditional notions of what documentaries

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.680
[Amit Varma]: are and your journey through discovering documentaries and making them yourself changed

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.680
[Amit Varma]: those notions completely. Can you elaborate a bit on that?

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.680
[Guest]: So I think the kind of documentary film orthodoxies that I inherited were very much about

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:11.680
[Guest]: the political activist documentary, which, you know, chose an issue, followed that issue,

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:18.680
[Guest]: interviewed people to get their perspective, critiqued the kind of structures of privilege

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.680
[Guest]: that were creating those inequalities. There was, as I said earlier, a roster of important

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:31.680
[Guest]: topics. So you talked about communism, labor, caste, very much lower down the line gender.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:38.680
[Guest]: Sexuality was nowhere on the scene for sure in the films. You also had what I call the

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.680
[Guest]: pan-Indian documentary, right? Documentaries that were made often represented themselves

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:48.680
[Guest]: as being about India. And these issues were supposed to represent the concerns of all

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:57.680
[Guest]: of India. I think when I started making films as an assistant, this was the orthodoxy, but

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.680
[Guest]: there were other... See, there was also a partial history of documentary that you received

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:08.680
[Guest]: since this was the overwhelming way in which a documentary was considered important.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.680
[Guest]: Like, how did a documentary attain significance if it had all of these qualities?

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.680
[Guest]: Then it would be circulated among certain spaces because it's not like it was going

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.680
[Guest]: to the market and then people were liking it or not liking it.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.680
[Guest]: There was a completely different logic by which documentary circulated.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.680
[Guest]: So it conformed very much to fulfilling these notions of what is a good documentary.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.680
[Guest]: However, that said, there were a few filmmakers, both who existed before.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.680
[Guest]: Like, for example, films division was considered a government film.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:45.680
[Guest]: But as we now know, there were, of course, great filmmakers working in FD in the 60s

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.680
[Guest]: and their films are now, like when we watch them, I feel very modern, very exciting,

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.680
[Guest]: critical of the government. All of that is also going on, right?

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.680
[Guest]: But we never really got to know about those films when we were young people,

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.680
[Guest]: insofar as anybody got to know anything about documentary.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.680
[Guest]: Even working in documentary, the people and the filmmakers you got to know about

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.680
[Guest]: were all of them who were involved in the political documentary.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.680
[Guest]: But a few filmmakers were on the scene.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.680
[Guest]: Reena Mohan made this exquisite film called Kamla Bai about the first woman

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.680
[Guest]: to be on the Indian screen, Kamla Bai Gokhale.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.680
[Guest]: It's a very unusual film because it's only Kamla Bai talking for 40 minutes

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680
[Guest]: and she is indescribable.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:29.680
[Guest]: She's very profane and full of character and sharpness. She's 88 or something in the film.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.680
[Guest]: She's very old in the film, but it's incredible.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.680
[Guest]: And I had never seen a film like that.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.680
[Guest]: And it's very important to see Indian films which are different, right?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.680
[Guest]: Like, it's not enough to see films from other countries.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.680
[Guest]: You need to see something which is of your context.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.680
[Guest]: There was Madhushri Dutta.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.680
[Guest]: There were, I would say, a number of women filmmakers who were emerging on the scene

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.680
[Guest]: who were making films quite differently, who were looking at the idea of biography as history,

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.680
[Guest]: for instance, which is another way of saying the personal is political.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.680
[Guest]: So, there was a beautiful film called Sagira Begum by Sameera Jain,

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.680
[Guest]: which was made in the 90s.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.680
[Guest]: So, a little bit of this was beginning to happen.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.680
[Guest]: By the time that I started, when I started to make films, you know, technology was also changing.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.680
[Guest]: So, video was coming in.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.680
[Guest]: So, you have to understand that when first films were made on celluloid,

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.680
[Guest]: before liberalization, you had to get permission to even buy a roll of film.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.680
[Guest]: You had to apply for a permit.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.680
[Guest]: So, it was expensive and it was difficult.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.680
[Guest]: But then with video coming in, a certain kind of democratization of access starts to happen,

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.680
[Guest]: but it was still expensive.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.680
[Guest]: So, I made my first couple of films on a format called Betacam.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.680
[Guest]: And then digital video came in.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.680
[Guest]: And it coincided, I think, with the fact that we'd had 10 years after liberalization.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:47.680
[Guest]: So, many of the traditional audiences of documentary film had actually scattered, right?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.680
[Guest]: People's movements.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.680
[Guest]: All of that had, to some extent, been decimated.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.680
[Guest]: Trade unions and even women's organizations, to an extent.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.680
[Guest]: NGOs had come in.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.680
[Guest]: A lot of shift had happened on the political landscape.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:05.680
[Guest]: So, I think there was a need to build up a new political audience or a new audience.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.680
[Guest]: And I think that my generation of filmmakers, if one were to think that there were people

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:13.680
[Guest]: who entered documentaries from a purely political perspective,

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.680
[Guest]: a generation after that that entered documentaries from a kind of...

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.680
[Guest]: They studied filmmaking and they were also looking at it filmically.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.680
[Guest]: And then I think you have a generation like mine, which is coming at it from a very creative

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.680
[Guest]: and personal and political, everything, perspective.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.680
[Guest]: And I'm going to say that I'm generalizing.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's not that everybody has a creative impulse.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.680
[Guest]: But because it coincided with the coming of digital technology,

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.680
[Guest]: it enabled a lot of experimentation.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:47.680
[Guest]: And I think when I made Unlimited Girls in 2002, I was also able to fully express

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.680
[Guest]: something that I was feeling filmically, like to bring into it every format almost

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.680
[Guest]: that I had poked my nose into in the last 10 years of working and living in Bombay.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.680
[Guest]: But I also, I think I wanted to politically express what I was seeing in the world around me.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:05.680
[Guest]: I didn't want to replicate the political orthodoxies that I was being given.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:12.680
[Guest]: And I think that was a significant shift that you are making a film with an observational politics.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.680
[Guest]: Your politics is not pre-decided.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.680
[Guest]: There is no schema.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680
[Guest]: You have a question in your heart.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.680
[Guest]: What was my question in Unlimited Girls?

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.680
[Guest]: If you're a feminist, can you still have love?

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.680
[Guest]: What makes feminists, what makes people say, I believe in equality,

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.680
[Guest]: but I don't know if I want to call myself a feminist.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.680
[Guest]: It's the fear of losing love.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.680
[Guest]: It's the fear of losing belonging.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.680
[Guest]: And this was a thought that I, as a 30-year-old who had lived a feminist life for 10 years,

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.680
[Guest]: was thinking about.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.680
[Guest]: And I didn't think that the answer that you get from many movements that, you know,

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.680
[Guest]: you'll always have the sisterhood, was really an answer that worked.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.680
[Guest]: So that question drove the making of that film.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.680
[Guest]: That film was full of all the things that I love, from yellow nail polish,

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.680
[Guest]: to internet chat rooms, to making these fake ads.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.680
[Guest]: Like, it was full of my desires, my pleasures, what I had seen in the world,

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.680
[Guest]: what I found amazing.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.680
[Guest]: And it was also full of my own personal political experiences,

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.680
[Guest]: which was of living on my own, decorating my own house,

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:15.680
[Guest]: feeling the excitement of being a grown-up person in a city

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.680
[Guest]: where you have your own power, allowed to give you your own power.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.680
[Guest]: It's not the power that is delivered to your parents' house or your aunt's house,

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.680
[Guest]: your own newspaper bill.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.680
[Guest]: You know, even these things, your own house key,

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.680
[Guest]: they're such crucial, exciting bits of being a grown-up.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.680
[Guest]: And all of that is in the film, actually.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.680
[Guest]: Having my own camera.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:38.680
[Guest]: And also, actually, this thing that I call feminism and think about partially,

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.680
[Guest]: what is it actually?

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.680
[Guest]: To go on a journey of discovering it.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.680
[Guest]: And I think it paralleled both my own personal needs and desires,

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.680
[Guest]: as well as something that perhaps other young people felt

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:52.680
[Guest]: in a language that was very much of the time.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.680
[Guest]: You know, John Waters, a filmmaker whom I love,

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.680
[Guest]: has this thing that he says artists are never ahead of their times.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.680
[Guest]: Artists are off their times.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.680
[Guest]: People are behind the times.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:07.680
[Guest]: But in a way, I think, yes, some films come along which are off their time.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.680
[Guest]: They're so deeply off their time that they will always remain contemporary

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.680
[Guest]: for that reason, because they were contemporary in the moment.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680
[Guest]: So they're not created in order to mirror their times.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.680
[Amit Varma]: They are their times.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and I mean, you made Unlimited Girls in 2002,

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.680
[Amit Varma]: and I'm ashamed to confess, as I did to you,

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.680
[Amit Varma]: I only watched it recently while after I invited you.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.680
[Amit Varma]: You're in a big, shameful group of people. Don't worry.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm in a big, shameful group of people.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.680
[Amit Varma]: But again, what you said really strikes me as true,

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.680
[Amit Varma]: because it is not of 2002, although it has a lot of delightful,

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.680
[Amit Varma]: artifact-y things like a computer booting up and a Yahoo chat room.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.680
[Amit Varma]: But it is really of this time.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.680
[Amit Varma]: And I was particularly struck, one, by how in such an entertaining

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.680
[Amit Varma]: and empathetic way you documented what was essentially

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.680
[Amit Varma]: your intellectual journey of discovering what feminism was,

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.680
[Amit Varma]: which I thought was sort of that central quest,

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.680
[Amit Varma]: and two, also how it was constructed.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, one of the things that you have sometimes spoken about

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.680
[Amit Varma]: is the artificial distinction between fiction and documentary

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.680
[Amit Varma]: and the power of the camera.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that, and again, this is something common

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.680
[Amit Varma]: to documentaries and social media, that wherever you are,

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.680
[Amit Varma]: in either of these, you are supposed to be real.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.680
[Amit Varma]: You're pretending it's a real you, but it's performative.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.680
[Amit Varma]: You're performing for the world.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So as a documentary filmmaker, also you're absorbing what is a performing.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in some sense, of course, as we chat with each other,

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.680
[Amit Varma]: we are performing for each other in the audience.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And what is interesting, what I found really lovely about Unlimited Girls

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.680
[Amit Varma]: is a lot of it is fiction, you know, like the chats that you portray

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.680
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, and some of it is, but it's so crisply put together.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.680
[Guest]: It is such good storytelling.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.680
[Guest]: Thank you.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.680
[Guest]: I mean, I think, you know, I also, filmmaking is a collective enterprise,

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.680
[Guest]: and I mean my editor, Jabeen, my cameraman, Mrinal Desai,

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.680
[Guest]: or everybody who was part of the film and so many people.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.680
[Guest]: I feel that the greatest artifact of Unlimited Girls is the credits.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.680
[Guest]: The credits are very long, and if you read the credits,

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.680
[Guest]: you'll see the names of many people who went on to be independent filmmakers.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.680
[Guest]: So really, I think there was a big scene that was also part of the making

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.680
[Guest]: of Unlimited Girls that helped me to make the film that I made.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.680
[Guest]: I was part of that scene, and that's an amazing thing to have.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.680
[Guest]: But I think that there was a way, like there was an idea, right?

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.680
[Guest]: Like there was primarily a creative idea of how the film would be told,

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680
[Guest]: and it came from a political idea.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.680
[Guest]: I will not make a film which is a debate between patriarchy and feminism,

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.680
[Guest]: which is going to be a zero-sum game.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.680
[Guest]: I'm not interested in that.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.680
[Guest]: I want to talk about feminism for all the fantastic things it is,

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.680
[Guest]: like what feminism has made possible for me and made possible in the world.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.680
[Guest]: So this is a film about feminism, which will not waste its time talking about patriarchy,

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.680
[Guest]: in part because it's a waste of time to talk about patriarchy.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.680
[Guest]: Like why will I pay so much attention to something I don't like

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.680
[Guest]: when I could spend so much time talking about something I love?

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.680
[Guest]: And two, I do believe that many films have been made already

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.680
[Guest]: before I made Unlimited Girls, which critiqued patriarchy.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.680
[Guest]: So there is no need for me to reinvent that wheel.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.680
[Guest]: I'm going to assume that people understand that.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.680
[Guest]: So I'm not going to think that my audience needs to be indoctrinated.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.680
[Guest]: I am not making the film to indoctrinate my audience,

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.680
[Guest]: but to have a conversation with my audience.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.680
[Guest]: So I want to make a film about two people who are a little bit separated on the spectrum,

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.680
[Guest]: Chunky Girl and Fearless, who are both feminist-ish, as I call it.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.680
[Guest]: But Fearless is like, yeah, I mean, I guess I am one, but I don't know.

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.680
[Guest]: It's a label, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So let me figure it out.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.680
[Guest]: And at the end of the film, Fearless is like, yes, it's a compliment to be called a feminist.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.680
[Amit Varma]: So she makes that journey from ambivalence to ownership.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.680
[Amit Varma]: You of course voice Fearless in the film, but did that also mirror your own development?

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.680
[Guest]: No, I never had any ambivalence about being a feminist.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.680
[Guest]: Like the first time somebody said that, oh, don't listen to her, she's a feminist,

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.680
[Guest]: before I really knew what the word meant, I was like, sounds good.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.680
[Guest]: Whatever. Yeah, feminist.

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.680
[Guest]: Because if the thing you're saying, don't listen to her, is a problem for you,

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.680
[Guest]: and I love that thing, I'm cool. Call me what you want.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.680
[Guest]: So I've always owned that word.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:07.680
[Guest]: And I have really, my life has been illuminated and animated by the idea of feminism, among other ideas.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.680
[Guest]: But I think that this idea that there'll be a conversation,

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.680
[Guest]: and also when I began researching the film, I found so many well-kept cyclostyle notes,

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.680
[Guest]: because cyclostyling is another artifact for another time,

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.680
[Guest]: which were of all these conferences and all these meetings that had happened,

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.680
[Guest]: and so many disagreements, right? So many disagreements.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:31.680
[Guest]: At one of the feminist conferences, there was a whole discussion on whether lesbianism can be a feminist issue.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.680
[Guest]: And it was decided that it's not.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.680
[Guest]: And there was a sense of deep betrayal, because there were so many lesbian women

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.680
[Guest]: who were also in the feminist movement.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.680
[Guest]: But you saw the same people coming back to another conference two years later,

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680
[Guest]: you were seeing a shift.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.680
[Guest]: So actually it was kind of fantastic to read all those notes and see,

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.680
[Guest]: these people keep arguing with each other, but they keep coming back to the table,

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.680
[Guest]: and they keep changing.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.680
[Guest]: And when you look at the history of the movement, one of the reasons

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.680
[Guest]: that it has remained as a movement in a very strong sense,

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.680
[Guest]: is it has always tried to learn from its mistakes.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.680
[Guest]: It may not always have done so successfully, but Shah Bano, Bhavri Devi,

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.680
[Guest]: these have been landmark moments in the history of the Indian women's movement,

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.680
[Guest]: which have shown a mirror to privilege and forced women to reassess

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.680
[Guest]: what it means to be a feminist in India, right?

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.680
[Guest]: So I think this is a great quality, this conversational quality of the movement.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.680
[Guest]: And I wanted to replicate this conversation without having

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.680
[Guest]: what a famous filmmaker, Deepa Dhanraj calls,

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.680
[Guest]: well, her cameraman, rather Navro's contractor calls,

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.680
[Guest]: women sitting in a circle talking,

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.680
[Guest]: which was a kind of motif of many feminist films.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.680
[Guest]: And I was like, how do I get these women in a circle talking?

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.680
[Guest]: Take them out of the circle, put them in a chat room.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.680
[Guest]: Yes, put them in a chat room. That is exactly what I did.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680
[Guest]: I put them in a chat room.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.680
[Guest]: And the chat room itself is a mixture of fiction and nonfiction,

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.680
[Guest]: because some of the voices are real women's voices.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.680
[Guest]: Some are actors. Some are lines that people actually said.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.680
[Guest]: Some are lines that I wrote to make the conversation more seamless.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.680
[Guest]: So, you know, the film does feel crisp and seamless,

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.680
[Guest]: because it is constructed in the way a fiction film would be constructed,

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.680
[Guest]: but using reality materials.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.680
[Guest]: And I also don't believe, as you know, I've already said ad nauseum in this discussion,

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.680
[Guest]: that realism is just a costume, like any other costume.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.680
[Guest]: And I think that the whole idea of the documentary

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.680
[Guest]: is very intertwined with the idea of the nation state.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.680
[Guest]: And the fact that it has been removed from the market has been very bad for documentary.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.680
[Guest]: Because had it been part of the market just like every other film,

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.680
[Guest]: it would be meaningful and it would keep changing in different ways.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.680
[Guest]: I think what is very significant about Unlimited Girls is

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.680
[Guest]: it was a film very deeply in relationship to an audience.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.680
[Guest]: And all my films have been very much in relationship to an audience.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.680
[Guest]: So it's not like I have a position which is very pure and now I'm going to tell it to you.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.680
[Guest]: But it's like, I want to dance with you.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.680
[Guest]: Come, let's dance. I'm leading the dance.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:45.680
[Guest]: But let's dance.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.680
[Guest]: You're free to misinterpret the film in a different way and disagree with it.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.680
[Guest]: I keep the film structures very open in ways that I don't mind if people disagree.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.680
[Guest]: There's enough places for you to disagree and agree.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.680
[Guest]: So that is also how the film is constructed.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.680
[Guest]: There is not a unitary.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.680
[Guest]: My position, I think, is very clear.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.680
[Guest]: You can make up in the films what I actually think.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.680
[Guest]: But I feel happy that I found a structure of work

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.680
[Guest]: which allows for other points of view to be kind of framed.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.680
[Guest]: And I think this was significant about Unlimited Girls.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.680
[Guest]: And in the years since I've had many, many young filmmakers tell me

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.680
[Guest]: I never was interested in documentary till I saw Unlimited Girls.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.680
[Guest]: And I thought, oh, it's possible to do it this way.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.680
[Guest]: So I think it's also important that something gets made so that

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.680
[Guest]: the way that I saw other people's films and felt like, OK, I can do this.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.680
[Guest]: So you keep increasing that possibility.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.680
[Guest]: The other thing which you're really doing when you're doing that is that

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.680
[Guest]: since you're refusing to replicate the positions and the formats that came before you,

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.680
[Guest]: you are actually also foregoing that privilege.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.680
[Guest]: You are unmaking privilege.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.680
[Guest]: And I can't stress how important I think this is.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.680
[Guest]: The thing is, I don't want to be disingenuous

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.680
[Guest]: and say that by making films in the way that I did,

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:55.680
[Guest]: I lost privilege and also I didn't get to be in the A-list festivals

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.680
[Guest]: and I'm always in some peculiar position.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.680
[Guest]: But of course, she matters.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.680
[Amit Varma]: But exactly how does she matter kind of is a question in people's minds.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And you also pointed out about how you never got any awards.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And someone who was on many of these award panels once told you that,

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, I love your films more than all these other people,

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680
[Amit Varma]: but you are too entertaining.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you're too enjoyable.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680
[Amit Varma]: You're too enjoyable.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.680
[Guest]: It's not entertaining, it was you're too enjoyable.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.680
[Guest]: And I thought, how sad for you that you doubt your own enjoyment so much.

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:25.680
[Guest]: What happened to you that you don't believe that the thing you like

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.680
[Guest]: is worth embracing in public?

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.680
[Guest]: And that is a story of most people's lives.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.680
[Guest]: The thing that they love, they do not have the confidence to own.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.680
[Amit Varma]: You could call Shakespeare enjoyable.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.680
[Guest]: Shakespeare is enjoyable.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.680
[Guest]: He is and in his time he was a commercial guy, Dickens.

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680
[Guest]: Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorite plays

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.680
[Guest]: because it's just been enjoyable, right?

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.680
[Guest]: So I think that this idea of enjoyment,

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.680
[Guest]: it's a deep discomfort with the body, the body's pleasures,

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.680
[Amit Varma]: simple human pleasures.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.680
[Amit Varma]: That art must take effort.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And if I'm consuming it effortlessly and laughing,

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.680
[Guest]: then maybe it's not art.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.680
[Guest]: So the thing that thinking can be pleasurable,

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.680
[Guest]: like all of this is woven into our miracles.

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:04.680
[Guest]: But the thing is, what you said earlier, the power of the camera.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.680
[Guest]: I was interviewed for a film and I started crying.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.680
[Guest]: And I was shocked because I thought, like, I'm a filmmaker.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.680
[Guest]: I know what's going on.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.680
[Guest]: And I don't want to be seen crying on camera, right?

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.680
[Guest]: So I think that it made me very conscious

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.680
[Guest]: that the camera has a power dynamic beyond and above everything.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680
[Amit Varma]: This is under the skin or something.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680
[Guest]: Skin deep.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.680
[Guest]: Skin deep, yeah, sorry.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.680
[Guest]: But I think that what it helps me to do is think hard

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.680
[Guest]: about how can I tackle this problem of privilege.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680
[Guest]: And one of the ways in which I did it is, you know,

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.680
[Guest]: creating this persona of fearless or the persona of goddess Annapurna.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.680
[Guest]: There are all these very strange characters

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.680
[Guest]: who are telling the tale of the film, whom you can't fully trust.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.680
[Guest]: So it's a way of telling you that you don't need to trust a filmmaker.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.680
[Guest]: I form no intimate relationships with my subjects.

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.680
[Guest]: In fact, I don't have, I mean, I have what I call an intellectual intimacy

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.680
[Guest]: in the format of interview that I do, which is a bit like what we're doing.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.680
[Guest]: Like, it'll be a lengthy interview, but it won't be very intensely personal.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.680
[Guest]: Like, don't spill your guts.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.680
[Guest]: I don't make friends with people.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.680
[Guest]: I don't lie to them about my political position, even if we're opposed,

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.680
[Guest]: because I want to do the maximum possible for you

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.680
[Guest]: to not tell me anything you don't want to tell me.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680
[Guest]: And I might still try to get it out of you,

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.680
[Guest]: but you should have some agency to deny me, right?

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.680
[Guest]: Now, I don't believe that I'm always able to achieve this perfectly,

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680
[Guest]: but it's my desire.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.680
[Guest]: And I think as a filmmaker, I do have that much ego,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.680
[Guest]: that even if you don't give me everything that would make it an easy interview to cut,

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.680
[Guest]: I can still do something to make this good, right?

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.680
[Guest]: So I think Unlimited Girls was all of those things.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:42.680
[Guest]: And in the films that followed, I guess I explored this path in different ways.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.680
[Guest]: And, you know, the different films obviously had different kinds of results,

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.680
[Amit Varma]: but these were the central questions.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, Unlimited Girls will be linked from the show notes.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.680
[Amit Varma]: So please do watch the film there.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.680
[Amit Varma]: I want to talk a lot more about feminism,

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:59.680
[Amit Varma]: but I have a couple of questions about filmmaking that I'll sort of get out of the way.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.680
[Amit Varma]: One is an ethical question and the other is an aesthetic question,

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.680
[Amit Varma]: but also with an ethical component.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And the ethical question is that, you know, you have once said, quote,

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.680
[Amit Varma]: the central dilemma of documentary is that you're taking someone else's story

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.680
[Amit Varma]: and making something with that, stop quote.

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And this is also a question asked to, for example,

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.680
[Amit Varma]: many narrative nonfiction writers or long form journalists,

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.680
[Amit Varma]: that you go into someone's life and you spend time with them

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and you take their trust and you take their stories.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And then you just go away and it's for your own self-interest.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.680
[Amit Varma]: You build something that will benefit you and not them.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.680
[Guest]: This is clearly something you've grappled with.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:35.680
[Guest]: Yes. And I think that my discomfort with that, you know,

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.680
[Guest]: that I take somebody's story and on what pretext that is going to,

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:40.680
[Guest]: it's politically important.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.680
[Guest]: That's what people always told, right?

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.680
[Guest]: It's very important to tell your story because it will make a difference.

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.680
[Guest]: But will it make a difference to that person's life?

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.680
[Guest]: Oftentimes not. Right.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.680
[Guest]: And I think it's only by confronting that,

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.680
[Guest]: that I arrived at a different form of filmmaking,

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.680
[Guest]: which did not require people to expose themselves on camera,

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.680
[Guest]: but only to say what they think about something.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.680
[Guest]: So, in fact, you know, even I made a film called Q2P,

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.680
[Guest]: which is about public toilets.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.680
[Guest]: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.680
[Guest]: There was no Swachh Bharat Abhiyan then.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.680
[Amit Varma]: There was a Shat Pratishas Chauchala Abhiyan.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680
[Amit Varma]: It was called that in those days.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Which later movie renamed, of course.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.680
[Guest]: So, I think even in that film,

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:21.680
[Guest]: a lot of it is like, what do you think about this?

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.680
[Guest]: What do you feel about this? Right?

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.680
[Guest]: So, actually, it's that kind of an intellectual conversation.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.680
[Guest]: And even so, some lines get crossed,

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:32.680
[Guest]: like, I shot this woman bathing her little baby.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680
[Guest]: And that's always an uncomfortable sequence, right?

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.680
[Guest]: Because she's on the road, so I filmed it.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.680
[Guest]: Would I go into your house and film you bathing your baby?

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.680
[Guest]: I couldn't without your permission.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.680
[Guest]: And sometimes you try to build in something

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.680
[Guest]: which is self-reflexive into the film.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.680
[Guest]: But I feel that's also a little bit of a disingenuous thing.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.680
[Guest]: But that said, you know, this power dynamic will remain.

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.680
[Guest]: It will remain in research.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.680
[Guest]: It will remain in any time that we engage with each other.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.680
[Guest]: You may edit some things out of this interview.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.680
[Guest]: I'm trying to retain agency.

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.680
[Guest]: You're trying to give me some.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.680
[Guest]: But yet, we have some desires of our own.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And I think this is part of human life.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.680
[Guest]: I never actually edit anything from interviews.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680
[Guest]: You're so ethical.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.680
[Guest]: But since I edit a lot.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.680
[Guest]: But I think there is a way in which we are always trying

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680
[Guest]: to get something from each other, right?

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680
[Guest]: All relationships are about that.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.680
[Guest]: So the question is, what's the max ethical place

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.680
[Guest]: we can bring our relationship to?

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.680
[Guest]: What's the max ethical place a filmmaker

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.680
[Guest]: or a person working with nonfiction

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680
[Guest]: can bring their work to?

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.680
[Guest]: I think different artists address and solve

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.680
[Guest]: this question differently.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.680
[Guest]: I think I solve mine by introducing huge elements

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.680
[Guest]: of fiction so that the onus is not on the nonfiction story.

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.680
[Guest]: I don't make films which are character-driven.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.680
[Guest]: I'm very uncomfortable with a single-character film.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:45.680
[Guest]: Not all.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.680
[Guest]: There are some great ones.

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.680
[Guest]: But mostly, I also don't make films about topics

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.680
[Guest]: which are like other people's suffering,

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.680
[Guest]: mind for importance.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680
[Guest]: I don't know if it's right or wrong.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:00.680
[Guest]: But this has been my way of addressing it.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.680
[Guest]: So I guess I have ended up making what you'd call

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.680
[Guest]: an essay film, which really thinks about a concept

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.680
[Guest]: or an idea rather than takes one particular reality

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.680
[Guest]: and then tries to make a story out of that reality

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.680
[Amit Varma]: which will stand in for a larger idea.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and it did strike me about Unlimited Girls

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.680
[Amit Varma]: while I was watching that.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.680
[Amit Varma]: There is no one in that film who would feel

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.680
[Amit Varma]: exploited by your having shown them in that way.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And I sort of go by Kant's categorical imperative

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of never using another person as a means

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680
[Amit Varma]: instead of an end.

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And the means versus end informs a lot of my

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.680
[Amit Varma]: value judgments, which is why, for example,

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm completely opposed to string operations

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.680
[Amit Varma]: because whatever the higher cause is,

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.680
[Amit Varma]: it's based on deception.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:39.680
[Amit Varma]: You're deceiving someone.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.680
[Amit Varma]: But the way you are tackling that,

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.680
[Amit Varma]: if I got you correctly, is by being very straightforward

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.680
[Amit Varma]: with the subject on what it is exactly

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.680
[Amit Varma]: than what you're doing.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.680
[Amit Varma]: And then they have the agency to deal with that

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.680
[Amit Varma]: how they will.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.680
[Guest]: And also that the larger structure of the film

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.680
[Guest]: doesn't depend on them.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.680
[Guest]: Actually, the larger structure of the film

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680
[Guest]: depends on my artistry, right?

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.680
[Guest]: So I make myself vulnerable.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.680
[Guest]: And I feel like you have to put your ass on the line.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.680
[Guest]: This hiding behind the subject

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.680
[Guest]: in order to get political importance.

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.680
[Guest]: I am strictly opposed to it, and I hate it.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.680
[Guest]: And I feel there's so much of what we call

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.680
[Guest]: virtue signaling, right, online.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680
[Guest]: So you see that online also,

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.680
[Guest]: but you saw that also in political work.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.680
[Guest]: So I think, yeah, but at some level,

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.680
[Guest]: I also feel like, you know,

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.680
[Guest]: if you look at the history of art,

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.680
[Guest]: art has almost never used reality.

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.680
[Guest]: Until photography emerges,

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.680
[Guest]: you don't have realistic forms of that kind

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.680
[Guest]: because even when you make a botanical image,

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.680
[Guest]: we know it's an image.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.680
[Guest]: The artistry is present.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.680
[Guest]: So we never believe that it's the thing itself.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.680
[Guest]: So this idea that I shot something,

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.680
[Guest]: and that thing is the truth,

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.680
[Guest]: so I am very good

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.680
[Guest]: because I showed you the truth.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.680
[Guest]: That idea only emerges very late

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.680
[Guest]: in the history of art.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.680
[Guest]: So if you look at Indian culture,

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.680
[Guest]: we don't have this realism funda at all, right?

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.680
[Guest]: Like, you look at all our forms,

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.680
[Guest]: and the closest you get

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.680
[Guest]: to something that engages with

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.680
[Guest]: factuality or reality around us,

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.680
[Guest]: actuality, as we call it,

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.680
[Guest]: is the imitator.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.680
[Guest]: So the behrupia wears,

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.680
[Guest]: dons a persona,

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680
[Guest]: and then,

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.680
[Guest]: it's not on a stage,

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.680
[Guest]: but it's within real life, right?

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.680
[Guest]: So I might don the persona of a milkman

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.680
[Guest]: and come to your house every day,

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.680
[Guest]: but you don't know I'm the behrupia,

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.680
[Guest]: who's pretending to be a milkman.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.680
[Guest]: Or I might dress up as Lord Shiva

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680
[Guest]: and roam around,

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.680
[Guest]: and am I Lord Shiva or am I the behrupia?

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.680
[Guest]: People respond to me differently, right?

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.680
[Guest]: So this notion compels me in a very interesting,

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.680
[Guest]: I find it very interesting,

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.680
[Guest]: that the closest we come to an actuality form

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.680
[Guest]: is one which actually mixes fiction

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.680
[Guest]: and non-fiction.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680
[Guest]: And it does so in order to comment on the world.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.680
[Guest]: Because how you respond to the behrupia

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.680
[Guest]: says something about you,

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.680
[Guest]: as well as how well the behrupia has done their job.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.680
[Guest]: And when you really look at the history

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.680
[Guest]: of behrupia practice,

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.680
[Guest]: you know, behrupias are not allowed to stay

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.680
[Guest]: in their mask,

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.680
[Guest]: I mean, in their persona,

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.680
[Guest]: for more than a certain number of days.

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.680
[Guest]: I forget the number of days now.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.680
[Guest]: Because you should not become the mask.

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.680
[Guest]: And I mean, this is a very interesting question

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.680
[Guest]: when it comes to online anonymous accounts,

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.680
[Guest]: like Twitter accounts which are anonymous.

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.680
[Amit Varma]: There are behrupias which become the mask, perhaps?

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.680
[Guest]: Yes.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.680
[Guest]: And when you become the mask,

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.680
[Guest]: you become attached to the power of the mask.

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.680
[Guest]: That is why you must not stay in the persona

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.680
[Guest]: for too long.

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.680
[Guest]: Because otherwise you get attached

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.680
[Guest]: to the power of that anonymity.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.680
[Guest]: And then it will lose its meaningfulness

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.680
[Guest]: to destabilize reality, right?

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.680
[Guest]: The jester, or the behrupia,

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.680
[Guest]: destabilizes reality.

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.680
[Guest]: But if you keep on and on being that,

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.680
[Guest]: you will become part of the power structure.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.680
[Guest]: Because you have a power by being hidden.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.680
[Guest]: So it should remain at the level

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.680
[Guest]: of vulnerability for both of you.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.680
[Guest]: Which is exactly like love, right?

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.680
[Guest]: It should remain at the level

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680
[Guest]: of vulnerability for both of you.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.680
[Guest]: Otherwise it's oppression.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.680
[Guest]: So I think that it's an interesting thing

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.680
[Guest]: to work with a form that uses fictional methods

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.680
[Guest]: and the fiction inside the non-fiction

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.680
[Guest]: to think about reality.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680
[Amit Varma]: That's a fascinating insight.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.680
[Amit Varma]: My next question, which I promise,

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:53.680
[Amit Varma]: which is really an esoteric question,

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.680
[Amit Varma]: is that I noticed in Unlimited Girls,

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.680
[Amit Varma]: for example, and it's probably selective noticing.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me if I'm overthinking it.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.680
[Amit Varma]: But you had a lot of shots

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.680
[Amit Varma]: which were very unobtrusive

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.680
[Amit Varma]: in the sense you're shooting them

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.680
[Amit Varma]: from a low angle or from the side

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and you're not in their face.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And is that a deliberate thing

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.680
[Amit Varma]: in terms of you don't want them

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.680
[Amit Varma]: to be conscious of the camera?

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.680
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, you're hiding it

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.680
[Amit Varma]: out of their natural line of sight?

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.680
[Guest]: No, the camera was never hidden

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.680
[Guest]: because of the camera person.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.680
[Amit Varma]: No, it's not hidden.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.680
[Guest]: Just in the sense that it's not

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.680
[Guest]: immediately visible right there.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I think...

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.680
[Amit Varma]: That you take the camera

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.680
[Amit Varma]: out of the action, so to say,

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.680
[Guest]: and it's just...

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.680
[Guest]: But I think it wasn't so much

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680
[Guest]: in order to make them feel that way.

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.680
[Guest]: But there was this idea

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.680
[Guest]: that you would not see Fearless,

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.680
[Guest]: but Fearless would kind of stand in

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:38.680
[Guest]: for the camera.

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.680
[Guest]: It was like a virtualness

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.680
[Guest]: of you being in Fearless's body.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.680
[Guest]: But also because I was really

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.680
[Guest]: experimenting in Unlimited Girls

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.680
[Guest]: with this conversational interview thing,

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.680
[Guest]: which means I was doing interviews

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.680
[Guest]: for two, three hours.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.680
[Guest]: And so I wanted the conversation feeling

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.680
[Guest]: rather than the interview feeling

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.680
[Guest]: to be there.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:53.680
[Guest]: So that's really why the choices

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.680
[Guest]: of camera angle were made in that way.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk about feminism.

01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Like in your film,

01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.680
[Amit Varma]: you ask, I think, Urvashi,

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680
[Amit Varma]: the very direct question,

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.680
[Amit Varma]: how did she become a feminist?

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.680
[Amit Varma]: So since you have asked her

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.680
[Amit Varma]: that almost seemingly lame question,

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:08.680
[Amit Varma]: it gives me the freedom to ask you.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.680
[Guest]: How did you become a feminist?

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.680
[Guest]: Obviously, I don't know the answer to it

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.680
[Guest]: because I think I always naturally was

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.680
[Guest]: naturally born feminist.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.680
[Guest]: But I think, you know,

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.680
[Guest]: I arrived at the idea of feminism

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680
[Guest]: in a very strong way

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.680
[Guest]: through the feeling of not belonging

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.680
[Guest]: to whatever were the normative structures.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.680
[Guest]: Not because I was cast out of them necessarily.

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.680
[Guest]: Although, yes, in part,

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.680
[Guest]: I didn't fit in many, many senses.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.680
[Guest]: But because I also didn't like them.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.680
[Guest]: Like I didn't feel comfortable.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.680
[Guest]: I didn't feel comfortable being

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.680
[Guest]: the fat girl who's always supposed to be jolly

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.680
[Guest]: and please everybody and say,

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.680
[Guest]: I know, I know I'm fat,

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.680
[Guest]: but that doesn't mean I'm going to try

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:46.680
[Guest]: and look good.

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:47.680
[Guest]: Don't worry.

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680
[Guest]: Meaning I didn't want to fit

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680
[Guest]: into all those categories.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.680
[Guest]: I didn't want to be the entertaining person

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.680
[Guest]: who's also not very intellectual

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.680
[Guest]: or the intellectual person

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.680
[Guest]: who's automatically boring.

01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:59.680
[Guest]: Like I didn't want to fit in any boxes.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.680
[Guest]: And I think that's where it started for me

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.680
[Guest]: that I won't fit in the box

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.680
[Guest]: and I don't feel this way.

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:06.680
[Guest]: So why can't I say it?

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:07.680
[Guest]: I want to do this.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:08.680
[Guest]: So why can't I do it?

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.680
[Guest]: I blame my parents because

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680
[Guest]: I grew up in a household

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.680
[Guest]: where pleasure was paramount.

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.680
[Guest]: You were encouraged at a very early age.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:17.680
[Guest]: Not encouraged,

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:18.680
[Guest]: but it was just the way everybody was.

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.680
[Guest]: What do you like?

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.680
[Guest]: What music do you like?

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.680
[Guest]: What do you feel like wearing?

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.680
[Guest]: What your tastes were

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.680
[Guest]: and what your enjoyment was,

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.680
[Guest]: was given a lot of importance in my house,

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.680
[Guest]: both in my father's house

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.680
[Guest]: and my mother's house.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.680
[Guest]: So there was that

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.680
[Guest]: and there was the fact

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.680
[Guest]: that my grandparents were both in the movies

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.680
[Guest]: and my grandparents were separated.

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.680
[Guest]: So I also had this kind of a model

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.680
[Guest]: of unconventionality in a more literal sense.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.680
[Guest]: And I felt that I got a lot out of that.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:45.680
[Guest]: I got to be whoever I was

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:46.680
[Guest]: because of the world,

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.680
[Guest]: because of all these things.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.680
[Guest]: And I think the more that other people described me,

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.680
[Guest]: the more irritated I would feel.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.680
[Guest]: And the need to describe myself

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:57.680
[Guest]: on my own terms was very, very important.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.680
[Guest]: And I think that led me to feminism

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.680
[Guest]: in a more formal sense.

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:03.680
[Guest]: I don't think, I mean,

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.680
[Guest]: although because people think

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.680
[Guest]: in more conventional ways,

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.680
[Guest]: it's not like all my work

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:10.680
[Guest]: has head-on addressed feminism

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.680
[Guest]: or feminist issues.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.680
[Guest]: I don't think of feminism as a topic.

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.680
[Guest]: I think of it as a lens.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.680
[Guest]: And it's a way of asking questions,

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.680
[Guest]: as Fearless says in the film.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680
[Guest]: It's not the answer.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680
[Guest]: It is the question.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.680
[Guest]: So feminism's always a question

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680
[Guest]: that I bring to something.

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.680
[Guest]: And it can be to filmmaking.

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.680
[Guest]: It can be to the way we talk to each other.

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.680
[Guest]: It can be to the way I dress.

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.680
[Guest]: It can be to thinking about

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.680
[Guest]: how to decorate my house even sometimes.

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.680
[Guest]: And of course,

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.680
[Guest]: to think about how politics works.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.680
[Guest]: So I think that is what made me a feminist.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and in your film,

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.680
[Amit Varma]: you have a character musing about

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.680
[Amit Varma]: is feminism a choice?

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Can you choose to be a feminist?

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And your position on that seems to be,

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:49.680
[Amit Varma]: you use the phrase,

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.680
[Amit Varma]: live feminism,

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680
[Amit Varma]: that your feminism is something lived.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And your position on that seems to be

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680
[Amit Varma]: that you have no,

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.680
[Amit Varma]: that once you realize you're a feminist,

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.680
[Amit Varma]: you're a feminist.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.680
[Amit Varma]: It's not a choice.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And I equate it to, for example,

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.680
[Amit Varma]: my atheism,

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.680
[Amit Varma]: that you don't choose to be an atheist.

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.680
[Amit Varma]: You just figure out one day that,

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.680
[Amit Varma]: oh, all this is bullshit.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.680
[Amit Varma]: why should I believe in some,

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:08.680
[Guest]: you know?

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.680
[Guest]: So it's not a label that you walk into.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a label that you find

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.680
[Guest]: to describe yourself.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.680
[Guest]: There is a character actually in Unlimited Girls

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.680
[Guest]: who says that.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.680
[Guest]: I won't be defined.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.680
[Guest]: I'd be described

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:17.680
[Guest]: by being called a feminist.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:19.680
[Guest]: And I felt that was a very powerful thing she said.

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:20.680
[Guest]: That something,

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.680
[Guest]: that you say,

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.680
[Guest]: oh, that's what I am.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.680
[Guest]: That's the name for people like me, right?

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.680
[Guest]: And it's very important

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680
[Guest]: to find that for yourself.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.680
[Guest]: That's not the only thing I am,

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.680
[Amit Varma]: is also what people are saying.

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And another interesting take

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.680
[Amit Varma]: I found in the film,

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.680
[Amit Varma]: which is also relevant

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.680
[Amit Varma]: in modern times,

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.680
[Amit Varma]: is where one character talks about how,

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.680
[Amit Varma]: I think fearless only,

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.680
[Amit Varma]: where you'd like to

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.680
[Amit Varma]: define feminism by,

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.680
[Amit Varma]: quote,

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:45.680
[Amit Varma]: identifying yourself through the things

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.680
[Amit Varma]: that you like,

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:47.680
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Whereas a lot of modern feminism,

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:50.680
[Amit Varma]: and in fact,

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.680
[Amit Varma]: a lot of modern Hindutva,

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:53.680
[Amit Varma]: seems to be defining itself

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.680
[Amit Varma]: by the things

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.680
[Amit Varma]: that it is in opposition to.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.680
[Guest]: Actually,

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.680
[Guest]: Urvashi Butalia also says this in her interview,

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.680
[Guest]: that, you know,

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.680
[Guest]: we knew what we didn't want,

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.680
[Guest]: but we didn't always know

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:04.680
[Guest]: what we did want.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.680
[Guest]: And that was difficult.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.680
[Guest]: I think we all have to be so careful

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.680
[Guest]: not to become scolds,

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680
[Guest]: because then we'd all become

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.680
[Guest]: dhariwala men, you know,

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.680
[Guest]: like always telling other people

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.680
[Guest]: how you ought to be.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.680
[Guest]: I think of feminism as an idea

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.680
[Guest]: which really gives you a lot of play

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.680
[Guest]: in thinking what kind of person

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:21.680
[Guest]: you want to become.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.680
[Guest]: Do you want to fit into

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.680
[Guest]: the predefined schemas

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.680
[Guest]: of gender that society offers you?

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.680
[Guest]: Or do you think that you actually

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.680
[Guest]: can walk down a road and figure out,

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.680
[Guest]: which flower you are in the garden of life

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:34.680
[Guest]: in a way, so to speak,

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.680
[Guest]: that everything is not in these neat

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.680
[Guest]: beds that...

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.680
[Guest]: So I think that feminism is,

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680
[Guest]: and for women,

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.680
[Guest]: because it is something that was drawn

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.680
[Guest]: from the experiences of women,

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.680
[Guest]: hence it has certain tenets.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.680
[Guest]: It's not that it's just everything.

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.680
[Guest]: Just because I say I'm a feminist

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.680
[Guest]: doesn't mean every single thing

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680
[Guest]: that I do will be feminist.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.680
[Guest]: And I think that's something

01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.680
[Guest]: to be very careful of,

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:55.680
[Guest]: because you should not go

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.680
[Guest]: into that purest,

01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.680
[Guest]: basically inquisitorial mode,

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.680
[Guest]: that I am the priest of this thing

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.680
[Guest]: and now I will see

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.680
[Guest]: whether you are pure enough or not.

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.680
[Guest]: It's something like a fantastic

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.680
[Guest]: magic thingy,

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.680
[Amit Varma]: like something in Harry Potter.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And because you're feminist,

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.680
[Amit Varma]: you can both do things

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:15.680
[Amit Varma]: which are feminist

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.680
[Amit Varma]: and do things which are just things

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:18.680
[Guest]: and do things which are not

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.680
[Guest]: feminist at times.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:20.680
[Guest]: So you're not...

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680
[Guest]: Once I went on a date with a guy

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.680
[Guest]: who kept asking me, like,

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.680
[Guest]: one after the other, like,

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.680
[Guest]: so what do you feel about 498A?

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.680
[Guest]: But what about this?

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:27.680
[Guest]: But don't you think that...

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.680
[Guest]: And, you know,

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.680
[Guest]: after that I was like,

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:30.680
[Guest]: okay, you know,

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.680
[Guest]: I'm not like the feminist

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.680
[Amit Varma]: answer generator here.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Can we just talk about...

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Somebody should build

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.680
[Amit Varma]: a feminist answer generator.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680
[Amit Varma]: Twitter, take that up also.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, it's happening

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.680
[Amit Varma]: all over the field.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.680
[Amit Varma]: But I thought I'm a feminist

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680
[Guest]: and I'm just trying to talk about

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.680
[Guest]: topics that interest you.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680
[Guest]: And I was like,

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680
[Guest]: well, a lot of things interest me

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.680
[Guest]: and your limited understanding

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.680
[Guest]: of feminism

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680
[Guest]: is not really interesting to me.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680
[Guest]: So that's the other thing, right?

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.680
[Guest]: That people never make an effort

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:54.680
[Guest]: to understand what something

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:55.680
[Guest]: that they don't already know is.

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.680
[Guest]: So most people define feminism

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.680
[Guest]: by 498A is a topic

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.680
[Guest]: you're supposed to discuss.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.680
[Guest]: Do feminists hate men or not?

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.680
[Guest]: Equality sometimes

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.680
[Guest]: enters the conversation.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:06.680
[Guest]: I want to do something

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:07.680
[Guest]: for the upliftment of women.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:08.680
[Guest]: This is most people's notion

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.680
[Guest]: of feminism, right?

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.680
[Guest]: Feminism, those are like

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.680
[Guest]: some tiny little dot parts

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.680
[Guest]: of feminism.

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.680
[Guest]: Feminism is about imagining

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:17.680
[Guest]: a different world.

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.680
[Guest]: It's about imagining ourselves

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:20.680
[Guest]: as different people.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.680
[Guest]: It's about reimagining relationships

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.680
[Guest]: between people.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.680
[Guest]: And, I mean,

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:25.680
[Guest]: I've often said this,

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.680
[Guest]: it's about looking at the world

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.680
[Guest]: with a look of love,

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.680
[Guest]: giving importance to things

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.680
[Guest]: that were not considered important

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.680
[Guest]: in the old structures, right?

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:34.680
[Guest]: So for example,

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.680
[Guest]: if women sat together

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.680
[Guest]: and discussed their personal experiences

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:38.680
[Guest]: and understood,

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.680
[Guest]: hey, this is not happening

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.680
[Guest]: only to me.

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.680
[Guest]: It's happening to many women

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.680
[Guest]: and it's happening to us

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.680
[Guest]: because we are women.

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:44.680
[Guest]: There was a click moment

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.680
[Guest]: for everybody.

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:46.680
[Guest]: They felt a sense

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.680
[Guest]: of coming together.

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.680
[Guest]: This oral experience,

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.680
[Guest]: which was never given

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.680
[Guest]: any importance, you know,

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:52.680
[Guest]: in a world where everything

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.680
[Guest]: has to be written.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.680
[Guest]: The fact that I have

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680
[Guest]: experienced something,

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.680
[Guest]: my experience was given importance.

01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.680
[Guest]: It contributed to an understanding

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.680
[Guest]: of the world, right?

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.680
[Guest]: This is something

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.680
[Guest]: that happened in the movement

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.680
[Guest]: and it happens in oral culture

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:05.680
[Guest]: with many communities, right?

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.680
[Guest]: Adivasi communities.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:08.680
[Guest]: We have sung songs

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680
[Guest]: and remembered people

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:10.680
[Guest]: for a long time.

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:11.680
[Guest]: We give that importance,

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.680
[Guest]: let's say.

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680
[Guest]: So I feel like

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.680
[Guest]: this way of thinking

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.680
[Guest]: is very central to feminism.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680
[Guest]: The personal is political

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.680
[Guest]: and the political is personal.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.680
[Guest]: That you make sense

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.680
[Guest]: of the world

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.680
[Guest]: also through your

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.680
[Guest]: own experiential relationship

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:25.680
[Guest]: with it.

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.680
[Guest]: And that's also why

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:27.680
[Guest]: the unspoken,

01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:28.680
[Guest]: or the unseen,

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.680
[Guest]: as you might say,

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.680
[Guest]: is important in feminism.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680
[Guest]: That you may be

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.680
[Guest]: talking to me respectfully,

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.680
[Guest]: but I may feel disrespected.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.680
[Guest]: You may say that,

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:37.680
[Guest]: like the person

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.680
[Guest]: who was asking about 498A,

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:39.680
[Guest]: et cetera,

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:40.680
[Guest]: perhaps thought that

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.680
[Guest]: they were trying to

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.680
[Guest]: talk to me about feminist topics.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:45.680
[Guest]: But actually,

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.680
[Guest]: I was finding it

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.680
[Guest]: violent and annoying

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:49.680
[Guest]: because I just thought like,

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:50.680
[Guest]: you're not even trying

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.680
[Guest]: to understand what I think.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:52.680
[Guest]: You're just telling me

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680
[Guest]: what you think I think, right?

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.680
[Guest]: So in some sense,

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:56.680
[Guest]: it's not doing that.

01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:58.680
[Guest]: But allowing a thing's importance

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.680
[Guest]: to manifest itself

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:01.680
[Guest]: and to learn about a thing

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680
[Guest]: and then to value it

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.680
[Guest]: for what it is.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.680
[Guest]: That's what feminism

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.680
[Guest]: enables us to do.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:07.680
[Guest]: And I think

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:08.680
[Guest]: that it is important

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:09.680
[Guest]: to read the debates

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.680
[Guest]: that have gone into feminism.

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680
[Unknown]: It is important

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680
[Guest]: to read feminist writers.

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680
[Guest]: And there's, you know,

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.680
[Guest]: do paise ka feminist ideas

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680
[Guest]: that people espouse.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.680
[Guest]: I don't believe in it.

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.680
[Guest]: I mean,

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:20.680
[Guest]: I'm a highly serious person.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:22.680
[Guest]: And I believe that

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.680
[Guest]: you should study

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680
[Guest]: anything that you're interested in.

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.680
[Guest]: Sonal Shukla says

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.680
[Guest]: this awesome thing

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.680
[Guest]: in Unlimited Girls

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.680
[Guest]: and she's at a library,

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.680
[Guest]: so it's quite fitting

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.680
[Guest]: that she says it.

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.680
[Guest]: That, you know,

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:32.680
[Guest]: if any other topic

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.680
[Guest]: you would have to read,

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.680
[Guest]: you would have to know

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.680
[Guest]: the history of something.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.680
[Guest]: You won't say you're an economist,

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:37.680
[Guest]: but you don't read anything

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.680
[Guest]: about economy, right?

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.680
[Guest]: But for feminism,

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.680
[Guest]: everybody feels they can comment on it

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.680
[Guest]: without ever, ever

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.680
[Guest]: finding out about it.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680
[Guest]: Including people

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:45.680
[Guest]: who say that they are feminists

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680
[Guest]: who never look at

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.680
[Guest]: the history of feminism

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680
[Guest]: in the world,

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.680
[Guest]: in India.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.680
[Guest]: Like, it's okay to just

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.680
[Guest]: pick up some stuff

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.680
[Guest]: from the ether

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.680
[Guest]: and read a few things.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:55.680
[Guest]: I've had

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:56.680
[Guest]: feminist women,

01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:57.680
[Guest]: young feminist women

01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.680
[Guest]: saying to me,

01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.680
[Guest]: like, why do I have to read

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.680
[Guest]: ten books?

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.680
[Guest]: And I'm like,

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.680
[Guest]: why don't you want to?

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.680
[Guest]: Why don't you want to see

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.680
[Guest]: what other people have said?

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:05.680
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to do the same thing.

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:06.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in a sense,

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:07.680
[Amit Varma]: I have the same grouch

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.680
[Amit Varma]: about economics that

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.680
[Amit Varma]: nobody will comment on,

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:10.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.680
[Amit Varma]: how a jet engine works

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.680
[Amit Varma]: unless they've actually studied,

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:13.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, that.

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.680
[Amit Varma]: But everybody feels like

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.680
[Amit Varma]: they're an expert on economics

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680
[Amit Varma]: or kuch bhi bol do.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting,

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680
[Amit Varma]: I caught you when you just,

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680
[Amit Varma]: earlier you were talking

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.680
[Unknown]: and saying,

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:22.680
[Unknown]: I'm entertaining,

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.680
[Guest]: bore mat kar yaar.

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.680
[Guest]: Now suddenly you're

01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.680
[Guest]: a highly serious person.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:26.680
[Amit Varma]: But for a moment

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:27.680
[Amit Varma]: I thought I busted you there.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.680
[Guest]: You didn't bust me.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.680
[Guest]: I think that,

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.680
[Guest]: seriousness is the most

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.680
[Guest]: entertaining thing

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.680
[Amit Varma]: there is in the world, right?

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.680
[Guest]: Because it's so rich.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680
[Guest]: I would bloody well hope so

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.680
[Guest]: because I am told

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:38.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm too serious.

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:39.680
[Amit Varma]: You know,

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:40.680
[Amit Varma]: so I've just launched

01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:41.680
[Amit Varma]: this new book show

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:42.680
[Amit Varma]: on Storytel

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:43.680
[Amit Varma]: called The Book Club

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.680
[Amit Varma]: and on the second episode

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:45.680
[Amit Varma]: which released yesterday

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.680
[Amit Varma]: or which is going to release

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.680
[Amit Varma]: the yesterday

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680
[Guest]: of the release of this

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:49.680
[Guest]: but hasn't yet released

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:50.680
[Guest]: at the time.

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:51.680
[Guest]: We're already all lost.

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.680
[Amit Varma]: But yeah,

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:53.680
[Amit Varma]: is on a book

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:54.680
[Amit Varma]: I really love,

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:55.680
[Amit Varma]: a woman by

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Mary Wollstonecraft

01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.680
[Amit Varma]: and one of the reasons

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.680
[Amit Varma]: I love Wollstonecraft

01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:59.680
[Amit Varma]: goes to what you're saying,

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.680
[Amit Varma]: which is where

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.680
[Amit Varma]: she talks about,

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:02.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:03.680
[Amit Varma]: first of all,

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.680
[Amit Varma]: she's not just

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:05.680
[Amit Varma]: an early feminist.

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:06.680
[Amit Varma]: She's a serious

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.680
[Amit Varma]: political philosopher

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.680
[Amit Varma]: wasn't given that credit

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.680
[Amit Varma]: in her day

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.680
[Amit Varma]: because of course

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.680
[Amit Varma]: she's a woman

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:12.680
[Amit Varma]: and I wish she was

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:13.680
[Amit Varma]: given that credit today

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:14.680
[Amit Varma]: and what she does,

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.680
[Amit Varma]: which I love

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:16.680
[Amit Varma]: is that she takes

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.680
[Amit Varma]: ideas from John Locke

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.680
[Amit Varma]: who is called

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.680
[Amit Varma]: the father of liberalism

01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.680
[Amit Varma]: and is indeed my hero.

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:21.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.680
[Amit Varma]: where I get my liberalism

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.680
[Amit Varma]: from and my notions

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.680
[Amit Varma]: and she points out

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:25.680
[Amit Varma]: what in those days

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.680
[Amit Varma]: was a radical notion

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.680
[Amit Varma]: that human rights

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.680
[Amit Varma]: have to apply

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.680
[Amit Varma]: to all humans,

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:30.680
[Amit Varma]: not just to men

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.680
[Amit Varma]: and she draws

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.680
[Amit Varma]: her feminism

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.680
[Amit Varma]: so beautifully from there

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:34.680
[Amit Varma]: that it is

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:35.680
[Amit Varma]: immediately apparent

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.680
[Amit Varma]: and what I've also

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:37.680
[Amit Varma]: always believed

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:38.680
[Amit Varma]: that if you're liberal

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680
[Amit Varma]: and of course,

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.680
[Amit Varma]: the word has many meanings

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:41.680
[Amit Varma]: nowadays,

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.680
[Amit Varma]: but in the sense

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.680
[Amit Varma]: that I mean

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:44.680
[Amit Varma]: that if you're liberal,

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.680
[Amit Varma]: you are by default

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:46.680
[Amit Varma]: a feminist

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.680
[Amit Varma]: and this goes to

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.680
[Amit Varma]: one of the things

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.680
[Amit Varma]: that you said

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:50.680
[Amit Varma]: in your film

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:51.680
[Amit Varma]: where you said,

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:52.680
[Amit Varma]: quote,

01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:53.680
[Amit Varma]: you're not talking

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:54.680
[Amit Varma]: about changing

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.680
[Amit Varma]: a house,

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.680
[Amit Varma]: you're not talking

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.680
[Amit Varma]: about changing

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.680
[Amit Varma]: the whole house,

01:53:58.680 --> 01:53:59.680
[Amit Varma]: stop quote,

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.680
[Amit Varma]: and I've always seen

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.680
[Amit Varma]: feminism as not just

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.680
[Amit Varma]: something that relates

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.680
[Amit Varma]: to women,

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.680
[Amit Varma]: but relates to men,

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:05.680
[Amit Varma]: particularly in the sense

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.680
[Amit Varma]: of the male gaze

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.680
[Amit Varma]: and we are talking

01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:08.680
[Amit Varma]: about the seen

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and I think

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:11.680
[Amit Varma]: all men live

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:12.680
[Amit Varma]: in a sort of reality,

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.680
[Amit Varma]: which is so different

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:14.680
[Amit Varma]: from the way women

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:15.680
[Amit Varma]: live in in the sense

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.680
[Amit Varma]: that when women

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.680
[Amit Varma]: are out in the street,

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.680
[Amit Varma]: they are so much

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:19.680
[Amit Varma]: more hyper aware

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.680
[Amit Varma]: of everyone

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:21.680
[Amit Varma]: who's passing them

01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:22.680
[Amit Varma]: they are so much

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.680
[Amit Varma]: more aware

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.680
[Amit Varma]: there being a woman

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.680
[Amit Varma]: makes them aware

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of so many other things

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:27.680
[Amit Varma]: which are unseen

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.680
[Amit Varma]: by men who don't give a shit

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:29.680
[Amit Varma]: who are just nonchalantly

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.680
[Amit Varma]: they can walk into a lift

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.680
[Amit Varma]: or they can go wherever

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.680
[Amit Varma]: would you agree

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.680
[Guest]: with this sort of?

01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:36.680
[Guest]: Yeah,

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.680
[Guest]: I think men don't look

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.680
[Guest]: at their surroundings

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:39.680
[Amit Varma]: because the surroundings

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.680
[Guest]: have been built

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:41.680
[Guest]: to facilitate them

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.680
[Guest]: and don't threaten them.

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:43.680
[Guest]: Yeah,

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.680
[Guest]: they don't threaten them.

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:45.680
[Guest]: Sure.

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.680
[Guest]: But men feel very threatened

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:47.680
[Guest]: by the presence of women

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.680
[Guest]: like there have been

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.680
[Guest]: these studies done

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.680
[Guest]: where

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680
[Guest]: I'm not saying it

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680
[Guest]: that men have reported

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680
[Guest]: saying that 50%

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.680
[Guest]: of the people in the room

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.680
[Guest]: were women

01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:56.680
[Guest]: when there were only

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.680
[Unknown]: like 15%.

01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.680
[Guest]: So like any women

01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.680
[Guest]: are too many women

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:00.680
[Guest]: for men, right?

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:02.680
[Guest]: And similarly,

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:04.680
[Guest]: if you have one woman's

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:05.680
[Guest]: perspective,

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:07.680
[Guest]: you feel you did your job.

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:08.680
[Guest]: You know,

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.680
[Guest]: like you don't

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:10.680
[Guest]: that there should be

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.680
[Guest]: an equal number

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:12.680
[Guest]: or a sizable number

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.680
[Guest]: of women

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.680
[Guest]: and trans people

01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:16.680
[Guest]: and queer people

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:17.680
[Guest]: and all kinds of people

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.680
[Guest]: quite effortlessly

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:19.680
[Guest]: speaking

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.680
[Guest]: in a newspaper

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.680
[Guest]: or on a television show

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:23.680
[Guest]: or part of your

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:24.680
[Guest]: set of interests

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:25.680
[Guest]: or the realities

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.680
[Guest]: that you take into account.

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:28.680
[Guest]: This does not seem to occur

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.680
[Guest]: to cis heterosexual men,

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:32.680
[Guest]: right?

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:33.680
[Guest]: And to cis men in general.

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.680
[Guest]: They're like,

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:36.680
[Guest]: this is normal.

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.680
[Guest]: And they believe

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680
[Guest]: that they're feminists

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.680
[Guest]: just because

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.680
[Guest]: they're not beating their wives.

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.680
[Guest]: Basically,

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.680
[Guest]: the bar for what makes you

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.680
[Guest]: a feminist in men's minds

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.680
[Guest]: is so low, right?

01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.680
[Guest]: And I do think

01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:49.680
[Guest]: that men also continue

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.680
[Guest]: to get congratulated

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.680
[Guest]: for the very,

01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.680
[Guest]: like people always giving

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.680
[Guest]: lollipops to boys

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:54.680
[Guest]: for doing nothing much.

01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:55.680
[Amit Varma]: For basic decency at most.

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, basic decency.

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.680
[Amit Varma]: You suddenly a big hero.

01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.680
[Guest]: No, he really tries, yeah.

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.680
[Guest]: Like I've had like

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.680
[Guest]: women also say that to me

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:02.680
[Guest]: that I think so and so

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.680
[Guest]: are pretty good.

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:04.680
[Guest]: I'm like,

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:05.680
[Guest]: now that his name

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:06.680
[Guest]: came out in MeToo,

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:07.680
[Guest]: do you still feel good?

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:08.680
[Guest]: You know,

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.680
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:10.680
[Guest]: I never imagined.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:11.680
[Guest]: I'm like, yeah,

01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:12.680
[Guest]: come on, dude.

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:13.680
[Guest]: I mean, you are so busy

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:14.680
[Guest]: being grateful to some guy

01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:15.680
[Guest]: for, I don't know,

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.680
[Guest]: just talking about

01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.680
[Guest]: sexual violence

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.680
[Guest]: or just making dinner

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.680
[Guest]: one day

01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:20.680
[Guest]: or just like

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:21.680
[Guest]: talking the talk.

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.680
[Guest]: Why don't be grateful?

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.680
[Guest]: Like be demanding,

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:24.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.680
[Guest]: be assertive and say,

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.680
[Guest]: hey, you got to shape up.

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:28.680
[Guest]: So anybody who thinks

01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:30.680
[Guest]: that a man is well-rounded,

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.680
[Guest]: if he has not read

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.680
[Guest]: a bunch of women writers,

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:34.680
[Guest]: I really think

01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:35.680
[Guest]: you need to change

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:36.680
[Amit Varma]: the way you think.

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And you wrote in a column

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.680
[Amit Varma]: once that, you know,

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:39.680
[Amit Varma]: when the whole

01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:40.680
[Amit Varma]: MeToo thing happened,

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:41.680
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the men

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.680
[Amit Varma]: who were named,

01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.680
[Amit Varma]: whoever you had met

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:44.680
[Guest]: personally, you knew

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.680
[Guest]: you were not surprised.

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:46.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:47.680
[Guest]: Well, it's the radar

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.680
[Guest]: of men who are not

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.680
[Guest]: interested in women

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.680
[Guest]: at all for themselves.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a pro-forma

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:52.680
[Amit Varma]: interaction they do.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:54.680
[Guest]: So I never liked them,

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.680
[Guest]: I mean,

01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.680
[Guest]: I always felt like

01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.680
[Guest]: he's a solid bore

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:00.680
[Guest]: and he's just going

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.680
[Guest]: on and on talking at me.

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:03.680
[Guest]: And, you know,

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:04.680
[Guest]: I'm very talkative

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:05.680
[Unknown]: as is clear.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.680
[Guest]: And so I think

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:07.680
[Guest]: and he,

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.680
[Guest]: I can feel that

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:09.680
[Guest]: he's not interested

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.680
[Guest]: in what I have to say.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.680
[Guest]: I can feel it.

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:12.680
[Guest]: And so I don't want

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.680
[Guest]: to listen to his boring jokes

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.680
[Guest]: and his extremely

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:15.680
[Guest]: ordinary insights.

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.680
[Guest]: I think my insights

01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:17.680
[Guest]: are better than his insights.

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.680
[Guest]: So my ego,

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:19.680
[Guest]: in a sense,

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.680
[Guest]: my intellectual ego

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:21.680
[Guest]: allows me to see

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.680
[Guest]: that this is not

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.680
[Guest]: a person who truly,

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.680
[Guest]: truly respects women

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.680
[Guest]: as people.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:26.680
[Guest]: And I have met

01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:27.680
[Guest]: enough men

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.680
[Guest]: who do respect women

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:29.680
[Guest]: as people to know

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.680
[Guest]: that it can be different,

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.680
[Guest]: right?

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:32.680
[Guest]: Had I never met

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:33.680
[Guest]: any other kind of man,

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:34.680
[Guest]: had I never had a father

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.680
[Guest]: who really liked me

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:36.680
[Guest]: as a person,

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:37.680
[Guest]: even if he was fed up

01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:38.680
[Guest]: of all my choices,

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.680
[Guest]: perhaps I wouldn't have

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.680
[Amit Varma]: known what that looks like.

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:41.680
[Amit Varma]: And you also mentioned

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:42.680
[Amit Varma]: that, you know,

01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:43.680
[Amit Varma]: when you were at your

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.680
[Amit Varma]: father's house

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.680
[Amit Varma]: and the feminist

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.680
[Amit Varma]: asked what you like,

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.680
[Amit Varma]: what you wear,

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:48.680
[Amit Varma]: did that play a part

01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:49.680
[Amit Varma]: in making you

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:50.680
[Amit Varma]: a feminist by default

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:51.680
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that

01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:52.680
[Amit Varma]: you weren't then

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.680
[Amit Varma]: indoctrinated so much

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.680
[Guest]: in the ways of patriarchy?

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.680
[Guest]: No, not at all.

01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.680
[Guest]: I mean, of course,

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:57.680
[Guest]: there was some amount

01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.680
[Guest]: of, you know,

01:57:58.680 --> 01:57:59.680
[Guest]: girls, boys thing,

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:00.680
[Guest]: and especially

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.680
[Guest]: when you grow older.

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:02.680
[Guest]: But I think I was very

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.680
[Guest]: lucky in that sense

01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.680
[Guest]: that I remember a moment

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.680
[Guest]: when I was in the car

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.680
[Guest]: with my dad

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.680
[Guest]: going to the market

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:08.680
[Guest]: or something.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:09.680
[Guest]: And he said to me,

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:10.680
[Guest]: we had just moved to Delhi.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.680
[Guest]: And so we were close

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.680
[Guest]: to the rest of the family

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:13.680
[Guest]: for the first time.

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.680
[Guest]: And he said,

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:16.680
[Guest]: you're not going

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.680
[Guest]: to grow up

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.680
[Guest]: and just get married

01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:19.680
[Guest]: after college

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.680
[Guest]: like some of your cousins.

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:21.680
[Guest]: You know that, right?

01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.680
[Guest]: Like you're going

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.680
[Guest]: to be somebody.

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.680
[Guest]: And how many people's

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.680
[Guest]: parents say that to them?

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.680
[Amit Varma]: That's lovely.

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.680
[Guest]: Yeah, it's fantastic.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:29.680
[Guest]: And the other very important,

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:30.680
[Guest]: like I have talked about this

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:31.680
[Guest]: often to my friends

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.680
[Guest]: moment is,

01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.680
[Guest]: so my father was really

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.680
[Guest]: not very happy

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.680
[Guest]: with most of the choices

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.680
[Guest]: I made.

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.680
[Guest]: And even the way I dressed

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:39.680
[Guest]: and like generally

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.680
[Guest]: he did find me quite

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.680
[Guest]: like jungly

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:42.680
[Guest]: and what are you doing?

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.680
[Guest]: And I was a bit

01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:44.680
[Guest]: of a disappointment.

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:45.680
[Guest]: She's such a bright girl.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.680
[Guest]: She's making documentaries.

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:47.680
[Guest]: I don't know if anyone

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.680
[Guest]: watches them or not.

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:49.680
[Guest]: And thank God

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:50.680
[Guest]: I started going to America

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.680
[Guest]: and all that.

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.680
[Amit Varma]: So people thought

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:53.680
[Amit Varma]: that I must be doing something

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:54.680
[Amit Varma]: if other people care about me.

01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:55.680
[Amit Varma]: People of this generation

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.680
[Unknown]: don't get where going abroad

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:57.680
[Unknown]: is so routine.

01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:58.680
[Guest]: But in our generation,

01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.680
[Guest]: fuck if someone's gone abroad.

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680
[Guest]: It's like validation

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.680
[Guest]: of the biggest.

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:02.680
[Unknown]: It's like having 5 million

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:03.680
[Unknown]: Twitter followers.

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.680
[Guest]: So one trip

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:05.680
[Guest]: is all you need.

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:06.680
[Unknown]: So,

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.680
[Guest]: but the thing is that

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:08.680
[Guest]: I went to a film festival.

01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:09.680
[Guest]: My father was very ill.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.680
[Guest]: This was a little

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.680
[Guest]: while ago.

01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:12.680
[Guest]: He died.

01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:13.680
[Guest]: I went to a film festival.

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:14.680
[Guest]: I won an award.

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.680
[Guest]: Rare enough occurrence for me.

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:16.680
[Guest]: And then I came back to Delhi

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:17.680
[Guest]: and my friend called

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:18.680
[Guest]: from abroad.

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:19.680
[Guest]: And my father answered

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:20.680
[Guest]: to landlines

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.680
[Guest]: and extensions.

01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:22.680
[Guest]: So my father

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.680
[Guest]: answered the phone upstairs

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:24.680
[Guest]: and I answered

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:25.680
[Guest]: the phone downstairs.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.680
[Guest]: And I was listening

01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:27.680
[Guest]: to their conversation

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.680
[Guest]: and she said,

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.680
[Guest]: uncle,

01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.680
[Guest]: you must be so proud

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.680
[Guest]: of Paramita.

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.680
[Guest]: She's going to all these festivals.

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:33.680
[Guest]: She's winning all these

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:34.680
[Guest]: prizes for her films.

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:35.680
[Guest]: He said, yes,

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.680
[Guest]: I'm proud of her,

01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.680
[Guest]: but I'm really proud of her

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:38.680
[Guest]: because she's a very honest girl.

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.680
[Guest]: And I thought like,

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:40.680
[Guest]: wow, that is

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:41.680
[Guest]: it's so nice to hear

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:42.680
[Guest]: that your father

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:43.680
[Guest]: sees you as a person.

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Did he ever tell you that?

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.680
[Guest]: He did.

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:46.680
[Guest]: Actually,

01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:47.680
[Guest]: when my father was sick,

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.680
[Guest]: you know,

01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:49.680
[Guest]: we became,

01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:50.680
[Guest]: I mean, we were close,

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:51.680
[Guest]: but there was a lot

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:52.680
[Guest]: of personal conversation

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:53.680
[Guest]: between my dad and I.

01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:54.680
[Guest]: And I think

01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:55.680
[Guest]: this was very special.

01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:56.680
[Guest]: Like, I think the fact

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:57.680
[Guest]: that my father

01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:58.680
[Guest]: was a very emotional person also.

01:59:58.680 --> 01:59:59.680
[Guest]: He was not a very

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.680
[Guest]: alpha kind of person,

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.680
[Guest]: but very caring parent,

02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:03.680
[Guest]: all of that.

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:04.680
[Guest]: And the thing is,

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.680
[Guest]: this thing,

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.680
[Guest]: disagreeing with my choices,

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.680
[Guest]: but letting them be.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:10.680
[Guest]: Not forcing

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.680
[Guest]: or trying to force me

02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:12.680
[Guest]: to be otherwise.

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:13.680
[Guest]: Continuously complaining also,

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:14.680
[Guest]: like forever.

02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.680
[Guest]: My father wanting me

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.680
[Guest]: to open a PPF account.

02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.680
[Guest]: I've written a column about it

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.680
[Guest]: that he just kept on saying,

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:20.680
[Guest]: beta, open a PPF account.

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.680
[Guest]: I'd be like,

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.680
[Guest]: I don't have money

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:23.680
[Guest]: to put in a PPF account.

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.680
[Unknown]: And then we had

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:25.680
[Unknown]: a very big fight about it.

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.680
[Guest]: He said, okay,

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.680
[Guest]: I will never tell you again.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:28.680
[Guest]: You know,

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:29.680
[Guest]: I'm your well-wisher

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.680
[Guest]: and you're not listening to me.

02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:31.680
[Guest]: I was like, great,

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:32.680
[Guest]: never tell me again.

02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:33.680
[Guest]: Thank God.

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:34.680
[Guest]: And three years went by

02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.680
[Guest]: and my dad never discussed

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:36.680
[Guest]: the PPF account.

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:37.680
[Guest]: And then one day

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.680
[Guest]: when I was like relaxed,

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.680
[Guest]: he said, beta,

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:40.680
[Guest]: if you would just open

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.680
[Guest]: your PPF account.

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:42.680
[Guest]: And I was like, okay,

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:43.680
[Guest]: let's go tomorrow

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.680
[Guest]: and open it.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.680
[Guest]: And my father was so,

02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:46.680
[Guest]: so happy, right?

02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.680
[Guest]: So there was a way

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:48.680
[Guest]: in which, yes,

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.680
[Guest]: he would complain.

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:50.680
[Guest]: He would try to push me

02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:51.680
[Guest]: to do things

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:52.680
[Guest]: that he thought

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:53.680
[Guest]: were the right thing.

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:54.680
[Guest]: But he never forced

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.680
[Guest]: a conversation about marriage.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.680
[Guest]: He talked to me about it once.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:57.680
[Guest]: I said,

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.680
[Guest]: I don't want to get married.

02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.680
[Guest]: He said, but,

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:00.680
[Guest]: and he didn't say you should

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:01.680
[Guest]: because people do it.

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.680
[Guest]: He said, but beta,

02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.680
[Guest]: logon ke sukh-tuk hote hain.

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.680
[Guest]: You need to share them

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:05.680
[Guest]: with somebody.

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:06.680
[Guest]: And I said, no, papa,

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:07.680
[Guest]: I think I'll really be okay.

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.680
[Guest]: I have a lot of friends

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:09.680
[Guest]: that really think I'll be okay.

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:10.680
[Guest]: And he said, okay,

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:11.680
[Guest]: if you say so.

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And he never raised it again.

02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:13.680
[Guest]: Amazing.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.680
[Guest]: Right?

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.680
[Guest]: So I do think

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:16.680
[Guest]: this is very important.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm not setting my dad up

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:18.680
[Amit Varma]: as some kind of

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.680
[Amit Varma]: great model of feminism.

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:20.680
[Amit Varma]: No, but for a man

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.680
[Guest]: of his generation,

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.680
[Guest]: like, my God, yeah.

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.680
[Guest]: But it was sweetness in him.

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680
[Guest]: It was the ability to love me

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680
[Guest]: that made him do it.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.680
[Guest]: It was not because

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:27.680
[Guest]: of being feminist.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.680
[Guest]: What I'm trying to say

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:29.680
[Guest]: is that he was

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:30.680
[Guest]: a very loving person.

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:31.680
[Guest]: He loved people.

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.680
[Guest]: People loved my dad.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:33.680
[Guest]: He was very caring.

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.680
[Guest]: He took his role

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.680
[Guest]: as somebody who's an elder person,

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680
[Guest]: thinking about younger people

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.680
[Guest]: and it's an important thing to do.

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:39.680
[Guest]: Now, I had older people

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.680
[Guest]: look out for me.

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.680
[Guest]: It was important for me.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:43.680
[Guest]: I feel I must do it for others.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680
[Guest]: I feel that the parenting thing

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.680
[Guest]: that we spoke about

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.680
[Guest]: in the beginning,

02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:47.680
[Guest]: it discourages the idea

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:48.680
[Guest]: that all children

02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.680
[Guest]: are our children.

02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:50.680
[Guest]: That's why it discourages us

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:51.680
[Guest]: from understanding

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:52.680
[Guest]: that public university

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:53.680
[Guest]: is very important

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.680
[Guest]: because it's not just

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:56.680
[Guest]: my kid going to Ashoka.

02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:57.680
[Guest]: It's about all kids

02:01:57.680 --> 02:01:58.680
[Guest]: getting the chance

02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.680
[Guest]: to study and do well, right?

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.680
[Guest]: I should care about it

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:01.680
[Guest]: at a social level.

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:02.680
[Guest]: And I think he had that.

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:03.680
[Guest]: It was a very

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:04.680
[Guest]: ordinary Indian quality,

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:05.680
[Guest]: I think, before.

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.680
[Guest]: And I think

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:07.680
[Guest]: that just created

02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.680
[Guest]: a sense of

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:11.680
[Guest]: it's okay to be who you are.

02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:13.680
[Guest]: You will still be loved, right?

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:14.680
[Guest]: So the question of feminism

02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:15.680
[Guest]: that if I'm a feminist,

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.680
[Guest]: if I go against everything

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:17.680
[Guest]: that is taught to me,

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.680
[Guest]: will anybody still love me?

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.680
[Guest]: So when you are taught

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:21.680
[Guest]: at a young age

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:22.680
[Guest]: that you will still be loved,

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:23.680
[Guest]: even though you won't

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:24.680
[Guest]: be agreed with,

02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:25.680
[Guest]: this is a very big learning.

02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:26.680
[Guest]: And I think that

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:27.680
[Guest]: even though I was an awkward kid,

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.680
[Guest]: even though I've had

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:30.680
[Guest]: lots of difficulties fitting in

02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:32.680
[Guest]: and continue to be rude to people

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.680
[Guest]: and struggle, actually,

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:35.680
[Guest]: with the real world,

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:36.680
[Guest]: so to speak,

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.680
[Guest]: I don't think I'm a very savvy person.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.680
[Guest]: And I do find it a struggle.

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:41.680
[Guest]: But it's okay, you know.

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.680
[Guest]: I feel that something

02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:43.680
[Guest]: or the other will happen.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.680
[Guest]: And I think this was

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:45.680
[Guest]: an early learning.

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:46.680
[Guest]: And I think it's a very

02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.680
[Guest]: enabling thing for feminism.

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680
[Guest]: Your friends,

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680
[Guest]: having friendships,

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680
[Guest]: being encouraged

02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680
[Guest]: to have friendships.

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680
[Guest]: I don't think many families

02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:54.680
[Guest]: give kids that, right?

02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:55.680
[Guest]: Like, make friends,

02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:56.680
[Guest]: go out,

02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.680
[Guest]: let your friend come over

02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:58.680
[Guest]: and stay the night.

02:02:58.680 --> 02:02:59.680
[Guest]: You can go and stay the night

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:00.680
[Guest]: at your friend's house.

02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.680
[Guest]: Very early on,

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680
[Guest]: this kind of social relationships

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.680
[Guest]: with others,

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:05.680
[Guest]: my parents had a lot of friends.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680
[Guest]: So I think these were

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680
[Guest]: great learnings

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680
[Guest]: that helped me

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.680
[Guest]: in my feminist journey.

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And this empathy

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.680
[Amit Varma]: and this openness

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.680
[Amit Varma]: to others that you talk about

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:14.680
[Amit Varma]: is, I think, also relevant

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.680
[Amit Varma]: in current battles

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.680
[Amit Varma]: in feminism nowadays.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, for example,

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.680
[Amit Varma]: there was this book

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Christina Hoff Sommers

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.680
[Amit Varma]: wrote in 1994

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.680
[Amit Varma]: where she coined the terms

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.680
[Amit Varma]: equity feminism

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:24.680
[Unknown]: and gender feminism,

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:25.680
[Unknown]: which, you know,

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:26.680
[Amit Varma]: for the benefit of my listeners,

02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.680
[Amit Varma]: I'll quickly give a summary.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Equity feminism basically

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:30.680
[Amit Varma]: comes from the view that

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.680
[Amit Varma]: men and women should have

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:33.680
[Amit Varma]: equal treatment

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.680
[Amit Varma]: in the eyes of the law

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:35.680
[Amit Varma]: and basically equality

02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:36.680
[Amit Varma]: of opportunity

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:37.680
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And gender feminism

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:39.680
[Amit Varma]: looks deeper

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:40.680
[Amit Varma]: at the sort of structures

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.680
[Amit Varma]: that have led to

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.680
[Amit Varma]: women being oppressed

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.680
[Amit Varma]: like the patriarchy

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:46.680
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And I actually hold

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:48.680
[Amit Varma]: that there is truth to both.

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't see why

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:50.680
[Amit Varma]: they have to be

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.680
[Amit Varma]: two separate things.

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:52.680
[Amit Varma]: But what gender feminism

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.680
[Amit Varma]: can also often

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.680
[Amit Varma]: go into

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:56.680
[Amit Varma]: is what

02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:57.680
[Amit Varma]: is the current

02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:58.680
[Amit Varma]: identity politics

02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:59.680
[Amit Varma]: of today,

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.680
[Amit Varma]: which is not just within feminism

02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:01.680
[Amit Varma]: but in different domains.

02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:02.680
[Amit Varma]: But what

02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:03.680
[Amit Varma]: that identity politics

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:04.680
[Amit Varma]: seems to do

02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.680
[Amit Varma]: is that as opposed

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.680
[Amit Varma]: to the empathetic view,

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.680
[Amit Varma]: it takes a view

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:09.680
[Amit Varma]: that others,

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:10.680
[Amit Varma]: the other person,

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.680
[Amit Varma]: where suddenly

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.680
[Amit Varma]: patriarchy is not only

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680
[Amit Varma]: the enemy,

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.680
[Amit Varma]: men are the enemy.

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore you have

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.680
[Amit Varma]: these very harsh,

02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:18.680
[Amit Varma]: strict binaries,

02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:19.680
[Amit Varma]: which is why,

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:20.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Steven Pinker in his book

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:22.680
[Amit Varma]: The Blank Slate

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:23.680
[Amit Varma]: had once speculated

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:24.680
[Amit Varma]: that the reason

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.680
[Amit Varma]: behind the bizarre thing

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.680
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of women say

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:27.680
[Amit Varma]: they are not feminists

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.680
[Amit Varma]: is that they are put off

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.680
[Amit Varma]: by this second kind

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.680
[Amit Varma]: of feminism

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:31.680
[Amit Varma]: where you are treating

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:32.680
[Amit Varma]: men as the enemy

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and treating yourself

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.680
[Amit Varma]: as a victim.

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.680
[Amit Varma]: And that actually,

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:36.680
[Amit Varma]: like,

02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:37.680
[Amit Varma]: I, of course,

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.680
[Amit Varma]: look at feminism

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:39.680
[Amit Varma]: from the Lockian,

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.680
[Amit Varma]: Wallstonecraft,

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:41.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.680
[Unknown]: equity feminist kind of way.

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Shit, you're smiling

02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:44.680
[Amit Varma]: like you're thinking

02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:45.680
[Amit Varma]: man is there.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:46.680
[Guest]: But I'm just sort of,

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.680
[Guest]: yeah,

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.680
[Amit Varma]: so that's kind of

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.680
[Amit Varma]: how I look at it

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.680
[Amit Varma]: from my individual rights view,

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:51.680
[Amit Varma]: which all my listeners

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:52.680
[Amit Varma]: are sort of aware of.

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:53.680
[Amit Varma]: But there is also

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:54.680
[Amit Varma]: this identity politics,

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: which I think

02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.680
[Amit Varma]: is in opposition to this

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:57.680
[Amit Varma]: because like I understand

02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.680
[Amit Varma]: that identity politics

02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.680
[Amit Varma]: is real.

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:00.680
[Amit Varma]: It's all around us.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.680
[Amit Varma]: We suffer from it.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.680
[Amit Varma]: Women suffer from it.

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.680
[Amit Varma]: But I think the answer

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:04.680
[Amit Varma]: to identity politics

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:06.680
[Amit Varma]: is on emphasizing

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:07.680
[Amit Varma]: individual rights

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.680
[Amit Varma]: and the autonomy

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and dignity of every individual.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think

02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.680
[Amit Varma]: that you can

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:13.680
[Amit Varma]: fight identity politics

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.680
[Amit Varma]: with an equal

02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.680
[Amit Varma]: and opposite identity politics

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:16.680
[Amit Varma]: because you just then

02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.680
[Amit Varma]: enter into warfare.

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.680
[Guest]: I think that,

02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:19.680
[Guest]: you know,

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:20.680
[Guest]: to go back to the discussion

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.680
[Guest]: about how feminism

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:22.680
[Guest]: gives value

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:23.680
[Guest]: to many different things

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:24.680
[Guest]: and in that sense

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:25.680
[Guest]: is an inherently queer

02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:26.680
[Guest]: theory

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:27.680
[Guest]: because it says

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.680
[Guest]: that there is not

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.680
[Guest]: only one way.

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:31.680
[Guest]: Patriarchy insists

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:32.680
[Guest]: on these unitary identities

02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:34.680
[Guest]: and hierarchies, right?

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.680
[Guest]: That one thing

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:36.680
[Guest]: is more important

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:37.680
[Guest]: than another thing.

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:38.680
[Guest]: Whereas feminism actually

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:39.680
[Guest]: says there are different values.

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.680
[Guest]: Everything has its own

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.680
[Guest]: different value

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.680
[Guest]: and its own place

02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.680
[Guest]: in a way, right?

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:46.680
[Guest]: So, I think that

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:47.680
[Guest]: identity politics

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:48.680
[Guest]: is very important

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:49.680
[Guest]: because

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:50.680
[Guest]: when you're talking

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:51.680
[Guest]: about a rights framework,

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:52.680
[Guest]: we do live in societies

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.680
[Guest]: that afford rights to people

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:55.680
[Guest]: and where some people

02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:56.680
[Guest]: get more rights

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.680
[Guest]: or some rights

02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:58.680
[Guest]: don't work for people

02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:59.680
[Guest]: because they don't

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:00.680
[Guest]: take into account

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.680
[Guest]: centuries of inequality,

02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:03.680
[Guest]: structures that are

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:04.680
[Guest]: rooted in that inequality

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.680
[Guest]: and to replicate inequality.

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:07.680
[Guest]: I once worked

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680
[Guest]: in a television company

02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.680
[Guest]: for a short time

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.680
[Guest]: when I was making that show

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:11.680
[Guest]: and I was appalled

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:12.680
[Guest]: at how the structure

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:13.680
[Guest]: is essentially constructed

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.680
[Guest]: to produce mediocrity.

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:16.680
[Guest]: It's not that people

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.680
[Guest]: want to be mediocre

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:18.680
[Guest]: but anybody who is

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:19.680
[Guest]: not going to be mediocre

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:20.680
[Guest]: is going to suffer

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:21.680
[Guest]: and is going to be

02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:22.680
[Amit Varma]: disliked by that system.

02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Which is actually a structure

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:24.680
[Guest]: at a lot of big corporations.

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:25.680
[Guest]: Yes, it's corporate structure.

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:26.680
[Guest]: That's definitely true.

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:27.680
[Guest]: So I feel like similarly

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680
[Guest]: patriarchy is also

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.680
[Guest]: a corporate structure

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:30.680
[Guest]: which is designed

02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.680
[Guest]: to create mediocrity actually

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:32.680
[Guest]: and call it meritocracy.

02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:33.680
[Guest]: Caste is that kind

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:34.680
[Guest]: of a structure.

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:35.680
[Guest]: It creates mediocrity

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.680
[Guest]: but says it's merit.

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:37.680
[Guest]: So I think that

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.680
[Guest]: identity politics

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:39.680
[Guest]: is important

02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:40.680
[Guest]: when we are talking

02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.680
[Guest]: about rights

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:42.680
[Guest]: so that we can foreground

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:43.680
[Guest]: that there are

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.680
[Guest]: diverse populations

02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:45.680
[Guest]: with diverse

02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:46.680
[Guest]: sets of experiences

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.680
[Guest]: and they all need

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:48.680
[Guest]: to come to rights

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:49.680
[Guest]: from a different place.

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:50.680
[Guest]: That rights are not also

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.680
[Guest]: some unitary kind of notion.

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.680
[Guest]: It's important to challenge

02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:55.680
[Guest]: also day-to-day

02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:56.680
[Guest]: normalizations of

02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.680
[Guest]: social relations

02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:59.680
[Guest]: which we don't question.

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:02.680
[Guest]: I don't agree

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.680
[Guest]: that women don't like

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.680
[Guest]: to say they are feminists

02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:07.680
[Guest]: because they feel

02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:08.680
[Guest]: it's a man-hating thing.

02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.680
[Guest]: I think women who fear

02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:10.680
[Guest]: losing privilege

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.680
[Guest]: and privilege

02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.680
[Guest]: always accrues from men.

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.680
[Guest]: Unfortunately,

02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.680
[Guest]: we are still in a world

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.680
[Guest]: where men get to decide

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.680
[Guest]: what's important and not.

02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:19.680
[Guest]: You would have to be

02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:20.680
[Guest]: really bloody-minded

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:21.680
[Guest]: person like me

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.680
[Guest]: who says I really

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:23.680
[Guest]: do not care what men think.

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:24.680
[Guest]: In fact, I don't care

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:25.680
[Guest]: what anybody thinks.

02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:26.680
[Guest]: I think this is important.

02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.680
[Guest]: I'm going to do it, right?

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.680
[Guest]: So I think that's got

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:30.680
[Guest]: its own costs

02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:32.680
[Guest]: and its own advantages.

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.680
[Guest]: But essentially,

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:34.680
[Guest]: men decide if you're important,

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.680
[Guest]: if a man chooses you,

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.680
[Guest]: decides to look at you,

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.680
[Guest]: listen to you,

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.680
[Guest]: you feel you are important.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:40.680
[Guest]: So those who are still

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.680
[Guest]: very tied to that power structure

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:44.680
[Guest]: fear losing the privileges

02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.680
[Guest]: by stepping away from it.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.680
[Guest]: They are very well aware

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:48.680
[Guest]: that they will lose

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.680
[Guest]: their privileges.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.680
[Guest]: They will not be part

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:51.680
[Guest]: of that scene.

02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:52.680
[Guest]: Sooner or later,

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:53.680
[Guest]: when you get beaten up

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.680
[Guest]: by the police,

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:55.680
[Guest]: they leave that scene.

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:56.680
[Guest]: I feel, you know,

02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.680
[Guest]: that's what I see happening

02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:58.680
[Guest]: with a lot of older women

02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.680
[Guest]: who've not left

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:01.680
[Guest]: the privilege structure.

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:02.680
[Guest]: That said,

02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:03.680
[Guest]: eventually identity politics

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.680
[Guest]: also has to, I feel,

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.680
[Guest]: what you're calling empathy,

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:08.680
[Guest]: I would call imagination,

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.680
[Guest]: which is the point of it is

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:11.680
[Guest]: to loosen the grip

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.680
[Guest]: of that identity on yourself.

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.680
[Guest]: And it's very difficult

02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.680
[Guest]: to imagine yourself changing

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:17.680
[Guest]: if you can't imagine

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:18.680
[Guest]: other people changing.

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:21.680
[Guest]: So you have to conceptualise change

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:23.680
[Guest]: within identity politics.

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.680
[Guest]: And that's got to somehow

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.680
[Guest]: at some point.

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680
[Guest]: See, there's an evolutionary

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.680
[Guest]: thing also, right?

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.680
[Guest]: So there'll be an evolutionary

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:30.680
[Guest]: moment where there'll be

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:31.680
[Guest]: a lot of anger

02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:32.680
[Guest]: and hardline positions

02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:34.680
[Guest]: and a feeling of enmity

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.680
[Guest]: because there is an enmity,

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:36.680
[Guest]: actually.

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:38.680
[Guest]: People, identities are

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:39.680
[Guest]: inimical to each other.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:40.680
[Guest]: My expressing myself

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:42.680
[Guest]: in certain ways

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:43.680
[Guest]: has to be done

02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:44.680
[Guest]: with difficulty

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.680
[Guest]: because the world doesn't let me.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:46.680
[Guest]: So in that sense,

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:47.680
[Guest]: there is an enmity

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:48.680
[Guest]: and the world is inimical

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:49.680
[Guest]: to my progress.

02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:50.680
[Guest]: So there will be a time

02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.680
[Guest]: of conflict.

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:52.680
[Guest]: But yes, of course,

02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:53.680
[Guest]: we cannot harden into that

02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.680
[Guest]: because then we are

02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:55.680
[Guest]: not going to be able to change.

02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.680
[Guest]: Even I can't change

02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.680
[Guest]: if I can't imagine

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.680
[Guest]: that you can change, right?

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.680
[Guest]: So in order to have

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:03.680
[Guest]: that imagination of change,

02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:04.680
[Guest]: what's the language

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:05.680
[Guest]: of conversation

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:06.680
[Guest]: we are going to have?

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:07.680
[Guest]: How am I going to point out

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:08.680
[Guest]: your privilege to you

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:09.680
[Guest]: without saying that

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.680
[Guest]: you are incapable of changing?

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.680
[Amit Varma]: This really becomes a question.

02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Or rather, how are you going

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.680
[Amit Varma]: to point out my privilege to me

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:17.680
[Amit Varma]: without me feeling

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.680
[Amit Varma]: that you're attacking me personally?

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:19.680
[Guest]: Well, how are you going

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.680
[Guest]: to look at your own privilege?

02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:21.680
[Guest]: Or how are you going to learn

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:22.680
[Guest]: not to feel attacked

02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:23.680
[Guest]: when your privilege is pointed out

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.680
[Guest]: is also a way I can put it, right?

02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:26.680
[Guest]: I think a lot of people

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:27.680
[Guest]: feel attacked just by having

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.680
[Guest]: their privilege pointed out.

02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:30.680
[Guest]: And to some extent,

02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:31.680
[Guest]: you have to get over it.

02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.680
[Guest]: So to go back to the time

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.680
[Guest]: when I got trolled,

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680
[Guest]: for a minute,

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:35.680
[Guest]: I did stop to think like,

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:36.680
[Guest]: why did I get trolled so badly?

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:37.680
[Guest]: I wasn't doing that.

02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:38.680
[Guest]: That's what I meant.

02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:39.680
[Guest]: And I say that.

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:40.680
[Guest]: I don't think it was fair

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:41.680
[Guest]: what happened to me.

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:43.680
[Guest]: But I could see.

02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:44.680
[Guest]: A friend of mine

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.680
[Guest]: was very irritated with me

02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:46.680
[Guest]: and said, don't do that.

02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.680
[Guest]: Don't see his point of view

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.680
[Guest]: because that's like just,

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.680
[Guest]: you know, hurting yourself.

02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:52.680
[Guest]: And I'm like, actually,

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:54.680
[Guest]: I don't agree with him,

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:55.680
[Guest]: but I see where he's coming from.

02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.680
[Guest]: And I have some other gain

02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.680
[Guest]: about thinking this through, you know.

02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:01.680
[Guest]: So without going into details about that,

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:02.680
[Guest]: I just feel like

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.680
[Guest]: it's not always the onus on me

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:06.680
[Guest]: to attack you nicely.

02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:08.680
[Guest]: It's always also the onus on you

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:10.680
[Guest]: to not be reactive to my attack.

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.680
[Guest]: And that is also why I think

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.680
[Guest]: the look of love is important.

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.680
[Guest]: That sometimes

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.680
[Guest]: when somebody attacks us,

02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:18.680
[Guest]: we also have to look at them

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.680
[Guest]: with the thought that,

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:21.680
[Guest]: oh my God, there's decades of privilege.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.680
[Guest]: I mean, centuries of privilege on my side

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:24.680
[Guest]: and centuries of lack of privilege

02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:25.680
[Guest]: on the other.

02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:26.680
[Guest]: For one second,

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:27.680
[Guest]: let me not get upset.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:28.680
[Guest]: It's upsetting,

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:29.680
[Guest]: but let me not act on my upset.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:31.680
[Guest]: I mean, one can also conceptualize that,

02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:32.680
[Guest]: right?

02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:33.680
[Guest]: And I think it is, again,

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:34.680
[Guest]: a two-way street, right?

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.680
[Guest]: If you forever and ever,

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:37.680
[Guest]: despite my trying,

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.680
[Guest]: say that, oh, you cannot change,

02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.680
[Guest]: then no change is possible,

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:42.680
[Guest]: because without unmaking privilege,

02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:44.680
[Guest]: how will we remake privileges?

02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:47.680
[Guest]: So I think this is an important question,

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:48.680
[Guest]: but I would say, again,

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:49.680
[Guest]: it's not a question of interaction.

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.680
[Guest]: It is a question of imagination.

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:53.680
[Guest]: And for example,

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.680
[Guest]: the term toxic masculinity,

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:56.680
[Guest]: which after some time

02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:59.680
[Guest]: starts to stand in for all of masculinity,

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.680
[Guest]: that masculinity is automatically toxic.

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:04.680
[Guest]: When I have that imagination of masculinity,

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:05.680
[Guest]: I'm basically telling you,

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:06.680
[Guest]: you can't change.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.680
[Guest]: If you're a man,

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.680
[Guest]: well, until the great feminist utopia arrives,

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680
[Guest]: you are doomed.

02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:12.680
[Guest]: You know, so this determinism,

02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:15.680
[Guest]: I think, is an absence of imagination.

02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:18.680
[Guest]: I wrote a comic about acid attack victims, right?

02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:20.680
[Guest]: And in which the main character,

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:21.680
[Guest]: I mean, the main villain,

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.680
[Guest]: was called Ahamkara,

02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:23.680
[Guest]: and he spews acid.

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:25.680
[Guest]: Like, it's very complicated.

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:26.680
[Guest]: He gets a boon,

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.680
[Guest]: and somebody makes him drink acid,

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.680
[Amit Varma]: but basically he becomes this guy.

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:30.680
[Amit Varma]: Ahamkara spewing acid, though,

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.680
[Guest]: is very well done.

02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:33.680
[Guest]: So he is continuously,

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:36.680
[Guest]: like, he has a power to spew acid.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680
[Guest]: And then he brings all these women

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:38.680
[Guest]: who are victims of acid attack

02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.680
[Guest]: into this island,

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:40.680
[Guest]: where he says,

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.680
[Guest]: nobody wants you,

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:42.680
[Guest]: I will look after you.

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:43.680
[Guest]: Now, this is actually

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:44.680
[Guest]: a liberal kind of position at one level.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:46.680
[Guest]: So it's not what you imagine.

02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:47.680
[Guest]: The protector of these women

02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.680
[Guest]: will actually be weakening them

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:50.680
[Guest]: by saying,

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:51.680
[Guest]: nobody wants you.

02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:52.680
[Guest]: And then Priya,

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:53.680
[Guest]: who's a superheroine

02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.680
[Guest]: who comes and saves them,

02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:56.680
[Guest]: she actually has this mirror,

02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:57.680
[Guest]: magic mirror,

02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:58.680
[Guest]: and it's the mirror of love.

02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:00.680
[Guest]: So when you look at yourself in the mirror,

02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:02.680
[Guest]: you see what you really are from inside.

02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:03.680
[Guest]: And you're reminded

02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:04.680
[Guest]: that you are not only the wound

02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:05.680
[Guest]: that you have sustained,

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:06.680
[Guest]: but you're much more than that.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:07.680
[Guest]: And you liberate yourself

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:10.680
[Guest]: from Ahamkara's grip.

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.680
[Guest]: When the women liberate themselves

02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:12.680
[Guest]: from Ahamkara's grip,

02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:14.680
[Guest]: Ahamkara ceases to be a demon.

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:16.680
[Guest]: He becomes very diminished.

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:17.680
[Guest]: And Priya gives him the mirror

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:18.680
[Guest]: and says, look at yourself.

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.680
[Guest]: And he refuses.

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.680
[Guest]: And she leaves the mirror with him

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:22.680
[Guest]: and all the women leave.

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.680
[Guest]: And she's like,

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:24.680
[Guest]: maybe one day he will look at it.

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:25.680
[Guest]: So for me,

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:26.680
[Guest]: it was always the conception

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:28.680
[Guest]: that Ahamkara could change if he wants.

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.680
[Guest]: They don't want to sit here

02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:31.680
[Guest]: and now try to reform him.

02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680
[Guest]: They have liberated themselves.

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.680
[Guest]: They're off.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.680
[Guest]: Now, if he wants to sit

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.680
[Guest]: on his stupid acid island

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.680
[Guest]: and feel sorry for himself,

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:38.680
[Amit Varma]: that's his problem.

02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:39.680
[Amit Varma]: I think the diminution of Ahamkara

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.680
[Amit Varma]: should be everybody's personal quest.

02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I just want to say

02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:43.680
[Amit Varma]: I agree with everything you said.

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:45.680
[Amit Varma]: The clarification I want to make though

02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:49.680
[Amit Varma]: is that what I meant about identity politics

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:50.680
[Amit Varma]: is that one, it is real.

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:52.680
[Amit Varma]: All these structures you speak about,

02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.680
[Amit Varma]: the oppression of the patriarchy

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:56.680
[Amit Varma]: and so on are all real, indisputable.

02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:57.680
[Amit Varma]: I think they are very useful

02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:58.680
[Amit Varma]: at the level of analysis.

02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.680
[Amit Varma]: I think when you actually start engaging,

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:02.680
[Amit Varma]: bringing identity politics

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.680
[Amit Varma]: can become a bit of an issue.

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.680
[Amit Varma]: For example,

02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:07.680
[Amit Varma]: if I am in a discussion online

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and people are saying,

02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:10.680
[Amit Varma]: check your privilege,

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:12.680
[Amit Varma]: that stops the conversation immediately.

02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:13.680
[Amit Varma]: When people say that,

02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:15.680
[Amit Varma]: oh, you are Savarna, shut up.

02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm immediately removed

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:17.680
[Amit Varma]: from the conversation.

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:19.680
[Amit Varma]: That stops the conversation immediately.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:20.680
[Amit Varma]: It might be true

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.680
[Amit Varma]: that what I am saying

02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.680
[Amit Varma]: is influenced by my privilege,

02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:24.680
[Amit Varma]: but bringing it up,

02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:26.680
[Amit Varma]: I think poisons the discourse

02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:27.680
[Amit Varma]: because I strongly feel

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:28.680
[Amit Varma]: that the discourse

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:31.680
[Amit Varma]: should always center on argument

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:32.680
[Amit Varma]: and not on the people

02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.680
[Amit Varma]: making the argument.

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.680
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense,

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.680
[Amit Varma]: I think identity politics

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680
[Amit Varma]: at the level of analysis

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.680
[Amit Varma]: and just understanding

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:41.680
[Amit Varma]: what is wrong with our world

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:42.680
[Amit Varma]: is essential.

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:43.680
[Amit Varma]: But at the level of action

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:44.680
[Amit Varma]: and actually bringing

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:45.680
[Amit Varma]: that identity politics

02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.680
[Amit Varma]: by othering people

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.680
[Amit Varma]: and treating them with contempt,

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:49.680
[Amit Varma]: even if they are the people

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.680
[Amit Varma]: with privileges and positions in power,

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.680
[Amit Varma]: doesn't help the discourse

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:54.680
[Guest]: and therefore hinders change.

02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.680
[Guest]: I mean, I think contempt

02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:56.680
[Guest]: always hinders change.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.680
[Guest]: So I would agree with you there.

02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:00.680
[Guest]: Check your privilege

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:02.680
[Guest]: has come to be a term

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:03.680
[Guest]: of stopping people from talking

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.680
[Guest]: rather than a term

02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:06.680
[Guest]: that is just what it is.

02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:07.680
[Unknown]: Exactly.

02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:09.680
[Guest]: So I think like all of these things,

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.680
[Guest]: like toxic masculinity,

02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.680
[Guest]: which has come to be

02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.680
[Guest]: a meaningless term, right?

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.680
[Guest]: You just use it.

02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:15.680
[Guest]: You just chop it on anything

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.680
[Amit Varma]: and then that's it.

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:18.680
[Guest]: Actually, I use it a fair bit.

02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:20.680
[Guest]: I don't.

02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:22.680
[Amit Varma]: I am like I am car.

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:23.680
[Amit Varma]: I am getting so diminished

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:25.680
[Guest]: by this conversation with you.

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:26.680
[Guest]: So I just feel like

02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:27.680
[Guest]: it's very like

02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:28.680
[Guest]: I think we should all

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:29.680
[Guest]: think a little bit

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:30.680
[Guest]: about the language we use.

02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:31.680
[Guest]: I agree with you

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:33.680
[Guest]: that is this language

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.680
[Guest]: conceptualizing a movement forward

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:36.680
[Guest]: or is it not?

02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.680
[Guest]: And you know,

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680
[Guest]: I wouldn't argue with you

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.680
[Guest]: if I feel like many right wing people

02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:42.680
[Guest]: when they say horrible things to me,

02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:43.680
[Guest]: my latest ploy is to say

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:44.680
[Guest]: you are being very silly

02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:45.680
[Guest]: or like you should behave

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:46.680
[Guest]: like a grown up or something.

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.680
[Guest]: Then they get a little confused

02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:50.680
[Guest]: by this auntie kind of response.

02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:54.680
[Amit Varma]: But I think millennials

02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:55.680
[Amit Varma]: won't know what it is,

02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.680
[Amit Varma]: but you were auntie 303.

02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:58.680
[Amit Varma]: I was auntie 303.

02:14:58.680 --> 02:14:59.680
[Amit Varma]: Look it up young kids

02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:01.680
[Guest]: who don't know what that is.

02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:03.680
[Guest]: So we might come up

02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:04.680
[Guest]: with the various modes

02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.680
[Guest]: of engagement, right?

02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:07.680
[Guest]: But I feel like, yeah,

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:08.680
[Guest]: if there is a person

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:09.680
[Guest]: who's unable to see

02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:10.680
[Guest]: their limitations,

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:11.680
[Guest]: I usually don't engage

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:12.680
[Guest]: with them at all.

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:14.680
[Guest]: I don't have a great desire

02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:15.680
[Guest]: to engage with them.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:16.680
[Guest]: And I do feel

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.680
[Guest]: there's a lot of worth

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.680
[Guest]: in sometimes not engaging.

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.680
[Guest]: So I feel the compulsory engagement

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:23.680
[Guest]: which happens online

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:25.680
[Guest]: is what also drives us

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.680
[Guest]: to these absolute positions,

02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:28.680
[Guest]: which makes it impossible

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:29.680
[Guest]: to have a conversation

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:30.680
[Guest]: that imagines change.

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:32.680
[Guest]: And I think that, yes,

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:33.680
[Guest]: if you spend less time

02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:34.680
[Guest]: thinking about the other,

02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:35.680
[Guest]: which is a little bit different

02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:36.680
[Guest]: than what you're saying,

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.680
[Guest]: which is othering people,

02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:38.680
[Guest]: there is an other

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:39.680
[Guest]: and there is a self

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.680
[Guest]: in everything.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.680
[Guest]: So if you find that somebody else

02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:43.680
[Guest]: is very bothersome

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.680
[Guest]: and their identity

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:45.680
[Guest]: is preventing them

02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:47.680
[Guest]: from seeing you in a certain way,

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:49.680
[Guest]: I would not engage with them.

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:51.680
[Guest]: I would rather grow my own stuff

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:53.680
[Guest]: and force them to engage with me.

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.680
[Guest]: The lawyer Flavia Agnes

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.680
[Guest]: did a very interesting thing.

02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:59.680
[Guest]: I made a film on two of her clients.

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:00.680
[Guest]: And one of her clients,

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:01.680
[Guest]: her husband,

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.680
[Guest]: tried to kill her

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.680
[Guest]: or some drama happened.

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:04.680
[Guest]: Then he had a girlfriend

02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:06.680
[Guest]: whom he brought into the house

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:07.680
[Guest]: and he threw this woman,

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.680
[Guest]: his wife, out of the house.

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:11.680
[Guest]: So she went to Flavia saying,

02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:12.680
[Guest]: I want a divorce.

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:13.680
[Guest]: And Flavia was like,

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:14.680
[Guest]: do you want a divorce?

02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:16.680
[Guest]: Or do you need a house to live in?

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:17.680
[Guest]: Like, which is the thing you want?

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:18.680
[Guest]: So she felt,

02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.680
[Guest]: OK, I've been thrown out of the house.

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:20.680
[Guest]: I've been treated badly.

02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:21.680
[Guest]: I don't want this man.

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:23.680
[Guest]: But really, what did that do?

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:24.680
[Guest]: That left everything

02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:25.680
[Guest]: on the man's terms.

02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:26.680
[Amit Varma]: He didn't want her either, right?

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.680
[Guest]: He wins if he gets a divorce.

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.680
[Guest]: But she needed a house to live in.

02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:32.680
[Guest]: Like, that house was also hers.

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:33.680
[Guest]: So Flavia was like,

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:34.680
[Guest]: see, if you're back in the house,

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:36.680
[Guest]: I can get a stay order.

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.680
[Guest]: He cannot throw you out of the house.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:38.680
[Guest]: But once you're out of the house,

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.680
[Guest]: it's difficult for me to get an order

02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:40.680
[Guest]: to go back into the house.

02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:42.680
[Guest]: So you must first go back into the house.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:44.680
[Guest]: So she went back into the house,

02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.680
[Guest]: like she, whatever,

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:46.680
[Guest]: had the key and all that.

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:48.680
[Guest]: And after that, a stay order.

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.680
[Guest]: And then the judge was like,

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:50.680
[Guest]: OK, you have to separate the house

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:51.680
[Guest]: into two sections,

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:52.680
[Guest]: her section and his section.

02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:54.680
[Guest]: And he harassed her like crazy

02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.680
[Guest]: while she was there.

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.680
[Guest]: But she had to stand strong.

02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:58.680
[Guest]: So finally, he was like,

02:16:58.680 --> 02:16:59.680
[Guest]: OK, what will it take for you

02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:00.680
[Guest]: to give me a divorce?

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:01.680
[Guest]: And then he was like,

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:03.680
[Guest]: OK, now we'll talk, right?

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:05.680
[Guest]: So there is a way in which you don't,

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.680
[Guest]: you're bad.

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:08.680
[Guest]: It's not, I'm good.

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.680
[Guest]: That's what I need.

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:10.680
[Guest]: That's what I'm going to do.

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:11.680
[Guest]: To bring the other person to your terms,

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.680
[Guest]: I think is a very important

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:14.680
[Guest]: political effort.

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.680
[Guest]: And so, yes, I know argument,

02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:17.680
[Guest]: nicety, all of those things

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:18.680
[Guest]: matter to me as well.

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.680
[Guest]: Empathy is very important to me.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:21.680
[Guest]: But I think that the real heart of politics

02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.680
[Guest]: is about strengthening yourself,

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:24.680
[Guest]: strengthening your position,

02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:26.680
[Guest]: and then getting people to talk to you

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.680
[Guest]: on your terms instead of

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.680
[Guest]: always falling into their terms.

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.680
[Guest]: What is happening today

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:30.680
[Guest]: with the protests

02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:31.680
[Guest]: is that instead of immediately

02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:33.680
[Guest]: falling victim to the right-wing agenda

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:34.680
[Guest]: and then getting into

02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:35.680
[Guest]: those meaningless arguments,

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:36.680
[Guest]: people are like, ha ha ha, joke,

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:37.680
[Guest]: ha ha ha, poem,

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.680
[Guest]: something, something.

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:40.680
[Guest]: So the terms of the discourse are changing.

02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.680
[Guest]: And that is the really

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.680
[Guest]: revolutionary thing about it.

02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And really, the flowering of art

02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:46.680
[Amit Varma]: is the one silver lining in all of this

02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:48.680
[Amit Varma]: because the cartoons, the poetry,

02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:50.680
[Guest]: hum kaagas nahi dikhayenge.

02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:51.680
[Guest]: But art is the place, right,

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:52.680
[Amit Varma]: where change happens,

02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:55.680
[Guest]: where what is coming and what is going

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:57.680
[Guest]: can do so in a much more fluid way, right?

02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:58.680
[Amit Varma]: And you have made my job easier

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:00.680
[Amit Varma]: because this is such a lovely segue

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:02.680
[Amit Varma]: into the influence of popular culture

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.680
[Amit Varma]: on you and on, you know,

02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:07.680
[Amit Varma]: and on your work.

02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for that happenstance.

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:10.680
[Unknown]: You're welcome.

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:12.680
[Unknown]: I was wondering ki kaise cut kare abhi.

02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:13.680
[Guest]: Madam toh itni films mein

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:14.680
[Amit Varma]: itni fluidly kar leti hai.

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.680
[Guest]: Lekin hum podcast mein first going home.

02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:17.680
[Guest]: Dekho maine kar hi liya.

02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:18.680
[Guest]: People do everything for men.

02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:19.680
[Guest]: What to do?

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:20.680
[Guest]: Ha ha ha.

02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:22.680
[Amit Varma]: Kuch bhi nahi kar paate aapne aap.

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Well, shows your empathy.

02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for that.

02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:27.680
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah, I mean,

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:28.680
[Amit Varma]: you've engaged with popular culture

02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:30.680
[Amit Varma]: at a very serious level.

02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:32.680
[Amit Varma]: You haven't sat back and said

02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:33.680
[Amit Varma]: ki nahi yeh misogyny hai,

02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.680
[Amit Varma]: yeh yeh hai, yeh wo hai.

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:36.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, obviously,

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: all the cliches about containing multitudes,

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:40.680
[Amit Varma]: but you have loved popular culture.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the very fact that you wrote

02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.680
[Amit Varma]: flashback presumably with our old friend

02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Imtiaz Baghdadi,

02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:46.680
[Amit Varma]: the great researcher,

02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.680
[Amit Varma]: is just a sign of that love.

02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:49.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:52.680
[Amit Varma]: recently you wrote a column on SRK

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:55.680
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, how his evolution

02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.680
[Amit Varma]: mirrors evolution of middle class India.

02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And you wrote a similar thing about rom-coms,

02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.680
[Amit Varma]: how they also mirror the...

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:02.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the influence

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:04.680
[Amit Varma]: popular culture has had on you.

02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And have you always loved it?

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Was there a point at which you sat back

02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and started thinking about,

02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:11.680
[Amit Varma]: looking at it with a critical gaze?

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And what did you then find

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:13.680
[Guest]: when you did that?

02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:14.680
[Guest]: So, you know,

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.680
[Guest]: I think it's interesting that...

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.680
[Guest]: So I didn't ever think of myself

02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:18.680
[Guest]: as outside of popular culture, right?

02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:20.680
[Guest]: Like most young people,

02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:22.680
[Guest]: the big thing was radio in my youth.

02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:23.680
[Guest]: And then there would be just like...

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:25.680
[Guest]: It was so difficult to get Western music

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:26.680
[Guest]: when I was a teenager.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.680
[Guest]: And there were these two programs on radio

02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.680
[Guest]: called Play It Cool and In The Groove.

02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:31.680
[Guest]: In The Groove came in the evening

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:32.680
[Guest]: and Play It Cool came in the morning.

02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.680
[Guest]: So I would listen to them

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:34.680
[Guest]: and then you would copy down

02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:35.680
[Guest]: the lyrics of songs

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:36.680
[Guest]: because you didn't know

02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:37.680
[Unknown]: when that song would come again

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.680
[Unknown]: and when you would get to hear the song, right?

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.680
[Guest]: So that thing of trying to have the song.

02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I think you kids listening to this today

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:43.680
[Amit Varma]: should kindly realize

02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.680
[Amit Varma]: how freaking lucky you are.

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.680
[Amit Varma]: You can listen to any song

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:47.680
[Guest]: anytime you want.

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:48.680
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, that's another of the things

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.680
[Guest]: about YouTube that I love

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.680
[Guest]: that I can listen to any song I want.

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:53.680
[Guest]: Recently, somebody asked me

02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.680
[Guest]: what I wanted for my birthday

02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:55.680
[Guest]: and I said, I want a CD player

02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:56.680
[Guest]: and they were like,

02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:57.680
[Guest]: who even has a CD player anymore?

02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:59.680
[Guest]: And I'm like, well, I have 500 CDs,

02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:01.680
[Guest]: so I need a CD player, right?

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:02.680
[Guest]: But the thing is that

02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:04.680
[Guest]: this idea that culture

02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:05.680
[Guest]: is just what you like.

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.680
[Guest]: Popular culture is what you like.

02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:07.680
[Guest]: You do it very effortlessly

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:08.680
[Guest]: when you're young.

02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:09.680
[Guest]: It's only later on

02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:10.680
[Guest]: that you start getting told

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:11.680
[Guest]: that something is high culture,

02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:12.680
[Guest]: something is low culture,

02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:13.680
[Guest]: you shouldn't like this.

02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:14.680
[Guest]: But definitely, I am the generation

02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:16.680
[Guest]: that grew up being told

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:17.680
[Guest]: that Hindi films...

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:19.680
[Guest]: People who like Hindi films

02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.680
[Guest]: and Hindi film songs

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.680
[Guest]: are definitely, like, uncool.

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.680
[Guest]: So, Hindi film music was not cool

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.680
[Guest]: the way it is now normal for people.

02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:27.680
[Guest]: But my grandfather

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:29.680
[Guest]: was a music director in films.

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:30.680
[Guest]: I mean, he was

02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:31.680
[Guest]: a very famous film composer.

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.680
[Amit Varma]: What was his name?

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Anil Biswas.

02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh!

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:35.680
[Guest]: God, you are his granddaughter.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:36.680
[Guest]: I am his...

02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:37.680
[Amit Varma]: He was my nana.

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:38.680
[Guest]: I will ask you to sing

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.680
[Guest]: at the end of this interview.

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.680
[Guest]: And in fact,

02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.680
[Guest]: Badli Teri Nazar To Nazare Badal Gaye

02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:43.680
[Unknown]: is a line from one of the songs

02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:44.680
[Unknown]: he composed.

02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:45.680
[Guest]: So, and my grandmother

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:46.680
[Guest]: was an actress

02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:48.680
[Guest]: and she was a film producer later.

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:49.680
[Guest]: So, my uncle

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.680
[Guest]: was also a music director.

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:52.680
[Guest]: So, I lived in a house

02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:53.680
[Guest]: which was full of Hindi film songs.

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:54.680
[Guest]: We listened to the radio.

02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:55.680
[Guest]: My father loved music.

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:56.680
[Guest]: He was of the generation

02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:58.680
[Guest]: that gets educated in Urdu,

02:20:58.680 --> 02:20:59.680
[Guest]: not Hindi.

02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:00.680
[Guest]: So, he couldn't even

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.680
[Guest]: write his own name in Hindi.

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:02.680
[Guest]: But there was all this, like,

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:03.680
[Guest]: Urdu poetry also in the house

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:04.680
[Guest]: and Begum Akhtar also in the house

02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:06.680
[Guest]: and Hindi film songs also.

02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:08.680
[Guest]: Some porno books

02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:09.680
[Amit Varma]: that I didn't follow

02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:10.680
[Amit Varma]: the Roman Empire.

02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:11.680
[Amit Varma]: Which you were spanked for finding.

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Why should anyone

02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:13.680
[Guest]: get spanked for finding it?

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.680
[Guest]: As well as they are 7 years old

02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:15.680
[Guest]: and reading porno, I don't know.

02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:16.680
[Guest]: Like, they shouldn't get spanked.

02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:17.680
[Guest]: I don't agree with that.

02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:18.680
[Guest]: But, yeah.

02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:19.680
[Guest]: Would that change your whole life?

02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:20.680
[Guest]: Yes, well, agents of wish.

02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.680
[Guest]: But the thing is,

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:22.680
[Guest]: so, I think that

02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.680
[Guest]: it was just normal

02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:24.680
[Guest]: to enjoy.

02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:25.680
[Guest]: Playing Antakshari

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:26.680
[Guest]: was a big thing you did.

02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.680
[Guest]: So, it was funny for me

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.680
[Guest]: that the thing

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:29.680
[Guest]: which you liked to do

02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:30.680
[Guest]: most of the time,

02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:31.680
[Guest]: you then pretend

02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:32.680
[Guest]: to other people

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:33.680
[Guest]: that you don't do.

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:34.680
[Guest]: This, I did find strange.

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:35.680
[Guest]: Plus, it really was

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.680
[Guest]: my family thing.

02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:37.680
[Guest]: I recently interviewed

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:38.680
[Guest]: Raveena Tandon

02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.680
[Guest]: for something.

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:40.680
[Guest]: And, you know,

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:41.680
[Guest]: one of the things she said

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:42.680
[Guest]: is that, well,

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:43.680
[Guest]: I went to, like, Jamnabai

02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.680
[Guest]: and there everybody

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:45.680
[Guest]: was like, Hindi film.

02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:46.680
[Guest]: Eww.

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:47.680
[Guest]: But that's the world

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:48.680
[Guest]: I came from.

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:49.680
[Guest]: So, they looked down on me.

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:50.680
[Guest]: But I was like,

02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:51.680
[Guest]: what's wrong with it?

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.680
[Guest]: So, I feel like this idea

02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:53.680
[Guest]: was always strange to me.

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:54.680
[Guest]: But, I remember

02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:55.680
[Guest]: when I started working

02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:56.680
[Guest]: for Anant,

02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:57.680
[Guest]: that one day

02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:58.680
[Guest]: I was sent to

02:21:58.680 --> 02:21:59.680
[Guest]: some film studio

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:00.680
[Guest]: and there was

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:01.680
[Guest]: some recording

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:02.680
[Guest]: of some film

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:03.680
[Guest]: going on.

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:04.680
[Guest]: And I asked,

02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:05.680
[Guest]: it's a new film

02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:06.680
[Guest]: called Ramgad Ke Sholay.

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:07.680
[Guest]: Basically,

02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:08.680
[Guest]: it will be all these

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.680
[Guest]: duplicate actors

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:10.680
[Guest]: who are going to play Sholay

02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:11.680
[Guest]: but as the copies

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.680
[Guest]: and it's a parody.

02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:13.680
[Guest]: So, I came back

02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:14.680
[Guest]: and I was like,

02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:15.680
[Guest]: there's going to be

02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.680
[Guest]: this movie called

02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.680
[Guest]: Ramgad Ke Sholay

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:18.680
[Guest]: and, you know,

02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:19.680
[Guest]: I saw Amrish Puri

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:20.680
[Amit Varma]: in the studio today

02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:21.680
[Amit Varma]: and something.

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And everybody was like,

02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:23.680
[Guest]: what's with this chick?

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.680
[Guest]: Like, why is she so

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:25.680
[Guest]: into all this?

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.680
[Guest]: So, they were not

02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:27.680
[Guest]: into that thing

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:28.680
[Guest]: but obviously,

02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.680
[Guest]: the coming of

02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.680
[Guest]: television

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:31.680
[Guest]: and, like,

02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:32.680
[Guest]: post-liberalization

02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:33.680
[Guest]: cultures

02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:34.680
[Guest]: brought all this out

02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:35.680
[Guest]: and I was in the

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:36.680
[Guest]: lucky position

02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:37.680
[Guest]: when I wrote

02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:38.680
[Guest]: Flashback of

02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:39.680
[Guest]: being a person

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:40.680
[Guest]: who knew

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:41.680
[Guest]: Hindi film songs

02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:42.680
[Guest]: but who also knew

02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:43.680
[Guest]: Indo-Western combo

02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:44.680
[Guest]: to be able to

02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:45.680
[Guest]: succeed in media

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.680
[Guest]: at that time

02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:47.680
[Guest]: and I think

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:48.680
[Guest]: I did have it.

02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:49.680
[Guest]: So, it was a lucky thing

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:50.680
[Guest]: but most people

02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:51.680
[Guest]: who were like me

02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:52.680
[Guest]: were not working

02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:53.680
[Guest]: in that programming place.

02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:54.680
[Amit Varma]: You know,

02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:55.680
[Guest]: they used to work

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.680
[Unknown]: in promos

02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:57.680
[Unknown]: if you remember.

02:22:57.680 --> 02:22:58.680
[Guest]: So, the cooler people

02:22:58.680 --> 02:22:59.680
[Guest]: were still in promos

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:00.680
[Guest]: and the slightly

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:01.680
[Guest]: uncool people

02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:02.680
[Guest]: were writing all this

02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Hindi film music

02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:04.680
[Amit Varma]: based programming

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:05.680
[Amit Varma]: but I was in that

02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:06.680
[Amit Varma]: uncool place

02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:07.680
[Guest]: as always.

02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:08.680
[Guest]: But it was a bit

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.680
[Guest]: cooler than in my time.

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:10.680
[Guest]: So, I think that,

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:11.680
[Guest]: you know,

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:12.680
[Guest]: people didn't like it

02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:13.680
[Guest]: and of course,

02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:14.680
[Guest]: because I,

02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:15.680
[Guest]: in my house,

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:16.680
[Guest]: there wasn't a difference

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:17.680
[Guest]: made between poetry

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:19.680
[Guest]: and Hindi film songs.

02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:20.680
[Guest]: People liked both

02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:21.680
[Guest]: and they seemed

02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:22.680
[Guest]: to be at ease with it.

02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.680
[Guest]: So, I may have

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.680
[Guest]: inherited that.

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.680
[Guest]: But also,

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:26.680
[Guest]: I don't,

02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:27.680
[Guest]: I mean,

02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.680
[Guest]: I do think that

02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:29.680
[Guest]: there is something

02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:30.680
[Guest]: different about the fact

02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:31.680
[Guest]: that I don't just enjoy it.

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:32.680
[Guest]: I obviously also

02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:33.680
[Guest]: look at it critically

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.680
[Guest]: but not in the sense

02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.680
[Guest]: of criticizing it

02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:36.680
[Guest]: but I see something

02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:37.680
[Guest]: happening in it.

02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:38.680
[Guest]: I'm not sure

02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:39.680
[Guest]: how that started

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:40.680
[Guest]: to happen

02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:41.680
[Guest]: but I would credit

02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:43.680
[Guest]: Nandini Ramnath

02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.680
[Guest]: with making me think about it

02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:47.680
[Guest]: in a more formal way

02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:48.680
[Guest]: because she and I

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:50.680
[Guest]: would often discuss things

02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:51.680
[Guest]: and she would be like,

02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:52.680
[Guest]: I really like what you said

02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:53.680
[Guest]: about that

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:54.680
[Guest]: or that's really interesting

02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:55.680
[Guest]: or something.

02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.680
[Guest]: Some of it,

02:23:56.680 --> 02:23:57.680
[Guest]: you know,

02:23:57.680 --> 02:23:58.680
[Guest]: it came from my irritation

02:23:58.680 --> 02:23:59.680
[Guest]: with all the left liberals

02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:00.680
[Guest]: who are older than me

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:01.680
[Guest]: who were like saying,

02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:02.680
[Guest]: this is regressive culture.

02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:04.680
[Guest]: All of Hindi film music

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:05.680
[Guest]: and new stuff,

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:06.680
[Guest]: Govinda is aggressive,

02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:07.680
[Guest]: this one is aggressive

02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:08.680
[Guest]: and my feeling was

02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:09.680
[Guest]: not really,

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:10.680
[Amit Varma]: you have a class snobbery

02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:11.680
[Amit Varma]: thing going on here.

02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Govinda is bloody amazing.

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:13.680
[Guest]: But, you know,

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:14.680
[Guest]: people felt many things.

02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:15.680
[Guest]: There was misogyny as well,

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:16.680
[Guest]: of course,

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:17.680
[Guest]: as you're rightly pointing out

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:18.680
[Guest]: but there was also

02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:19.680
[Guest]: many interesting

02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:20.680
[Guest]: class settings

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:21.680
[Guest]: and it was just

02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:22.680
[Guest]: the creativity

02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:23.680
[Guest]: of the writing

02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:24.680
[Guest]: and the exuberance

02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:25.680
[Guest]: of popular culture

02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:26.680
[Guest]: which I loved

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:27.680
[Guest]: and every time

02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:28.680
[Guest]: somebody fishes out

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:29.680
[Guest]: their guitar

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:30.680
[Guest]: and starts singing

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:31.680
[Guest]: Bob Dylan's song,

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.680
[Guest]: I start breaking out

02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:33.680
[Guest]: in hives.

02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:34.680
[Amit Varma]: So this thing that,

02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:35.680
[Amit Varma]: I used to hate boys

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:36.680
[Amit Varma]: who like Pink Floyd,

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:37.680
[Amit Varma]: for example.

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.680
[Amit Varma]: I know you like Pink Floyd.

02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:39.680
[Amit Varma]: Not that I don't like Dylan

02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:40.680
[Guest]: but this kind of canon

02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:41.680
[Guest]: of what is great.

02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:42.680
[Amit Varma]: So I think

02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:43.680
[Unknown]: and I remember

02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:44.680
[Guest]: the Simi Garewal show

02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.680
[Guest]: which everybody

02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:46.680
[Guest]: loved to hate

02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:47.680
[Guest]: but which I loved

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:48.680
[Guest]: and I think

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:49.680
[Guest]: my reasons for loving it

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:50.680
[Guest]: was solid,

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:51.680
[Guest]: really good interviews,

02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:52.680
[Guest]: people talking about

02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:53.680
[Guest]: their personal lives,

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:54.680
[Guest]: you never got that anywhere.

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:55.680
[Guest]: Like Abhishek Bachchan

02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.680
[Guest]: or thinking about

02:24:56.680 --> 02:24:57.680
[Guest]: being single,

02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:58.680
[Guest]: Raveena Tandon

02:24:58.680 --> 02:24:59.680
[Guest]: talking about her

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.680
[Guest]: adopting these two girls,

02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:01.680
[Guest]: her heartbreak,

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:02.680
[Guest]: Dev Anand talking

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:03.680
[Guest]: about his relationship

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:04.680
[Guest]: with his ex-wife,

02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:05.680
[Guest]: you never got that

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:06.680
[Guest]: anywhere.

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.680
[Guest]: Dev Anand talking about

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:09.680
[Guest]: his relationship with Surya

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.680
[Guest]: and how he could never

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.680
[Guest]: really love anybody after.

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:12.680
[Guest]: Like you never got

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:13.680
[Guest]: this kind of conversation

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:14.680
[Guest]: anywhere else.

02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:15.680
[Guest]: She was small C

02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:16.680
[Guest]: but she was also

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:17.680
[Guest]: all of these things, right?

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:18.680
[Guest]: And so I would be talking

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:19.680
[Guest]: to Nandini Ramnath about it

02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.680
[Guest]: and then she started

02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:21.680
[Guest]: asking me to write pieces,

02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:22.680
[Guest]: longer pieces about it

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:23.680
[Guest]: for Time Out.

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.680
[Guest]: I thought,

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:25.680
[Guest]: really?

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:26.680
[Guest]: You think?

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:27.680
[Guest]: So I wrote a piece

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:28.680
[Guest]: about Himesh Trishamiya

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:29.680
[Guest]: then I wrote a piece

02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.680
[Guest]: about Simi Garewal.

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:31.680
[Guest]: So these were things

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:32.680
[Amit Varma]: people didn't take seriously.

02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:33.680
[Amit Varma]: What was your take on Himesh?

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.680
[Guest]: I coined a good term

02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:36.680
[Guest]: for him,

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:37.680
[Guest]: his him-ness.

02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:38.680
[Guest]: But you know,

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:40.680
[Guest]: I saw his popularity

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:41.680
[Guest]: in a structural way.

02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:43.680
[Guest]: It's not like I was a fan,

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.680
[Guest]: but I could see that

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.680
[Guest]: around that time

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:46.680
[Guest]: I wrote a television series

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.680
[Guest]: about the business of Bollywood

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:49.680
[Guest]: for a business channel

02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:50.680
[Guest]: and that would help me

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:51.680
[Guest]: to see that,

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:53.680
[Guest]: okay, he has these hooks

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:54.680
[Guest]: and his music allows you

02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:55.680
[Guest]: to make dance steps

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:56.680
[Guest]: that are hooks.

02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:57.680
[Guest]: So this is the early

02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.680
[Guest]: version of virality.

02:25:58.680 --> 02:25:59.680
[Guest]: Like it's very quick

02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.680
[Guest]: to catch on.

02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:02.680
[Guest]: And at the same time

02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.680
[Guest]: he kind of comes

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:05.680
[Guest]: from the legacy of Altaf Raja

02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:07.680
[Guest]: into a more remixed idea.

02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:08.680
[Guest]: That's why he's very popular

02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.680
[Guest]: with auto rickshaw drivers.

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:12.680
[Guest]: You know, so it's kind of

02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:13.680
[Guest]: the end of T-series

02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:15.680
[Guest]: and the coming of something new,

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:17.680
[Guest]: a different Indo-Western fusion

02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:18.680
[Guest]: from what happened

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:19.680
[Guest]: immediately post-liberalization

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:21.680
[Guest]: that he's offering.

02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:23.680
[Guest]: And this Urdufication,

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:24.680
[Guest]: I used to call it.

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:25.680
[Guest]: Like he only had a repertoire

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.680
[Guest]: of about six Urdu words

02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:28.680
[Guest]: and he would use them

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:29.680
[Guest]: liberally in the songs.

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.680
[Guest]: So you get that old

02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:32.680
[Guest]: Altaf Raja punk

02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:34.680
[Guest]: or that vibe,

02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:36.680
[Guest]: but with this Moroccan beats.

02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:37.680
[Guest]: So it allows many

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:38.680
[Guest]: different populations

02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:39.680
[Guest]: to enter it

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:40.680
[Guest]: and participate in it.

02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:41.680
[Guest]: And it creates this virality

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:42.680
[Guest]: of the dance step

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:44.680
[Guest]: and the repetitive hook, etc.

02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:45.680
[Guest]: And then there was

02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.680
[Guest]: all the other fantastic thing

02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:47.680
[Guest]: like the village,

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:48.680
[Guest]: which thought that

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:51.680
[Guest]: if you sang Jhalak Dikhla Aaja,

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:52.680
[Guest]: you would get possessed

02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:53.680
[Amit Varma]: by a ghost.

02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:54.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, can you believe it?

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Like when you said

02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:56.680
[Guest]: Ek baar aaja, aaja, aaja, aaja,

02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.680
[Guest]: and the ghost used to enter you.

02:26:58.680 --> 02:26:59.680
[Guest]: So there was a village

02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:00.680
[Guest]: in Gujarat which was,

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:01.680
[Guest]: you were not allowed

02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:02.680
[Unknown]: to sing those songs.

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:03.680
[Guest]: Wow.

02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:04.680
[Guest]: So, I mean,

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:05.680
[Guest]: there was all of this,

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:06.680
[Guest]: like, you know,

02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:07.680
[Guest]: this kind of cultural material

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:08.680
[Guest]: that floats around

02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:09.680
[Guest]: and you listen

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:10.680
[Guest]: and you think like,

02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:11.680
[Guest]: what does it tell you

02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:12.680
[Guest]: about what people are feeling?

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:13.680
[Guest]: And what does it tell you

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:14.680
[Guest]: about how the world

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:15.680
[Guest]: is changing around us?

02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.680
[Guest]: And it was,

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:17.680
[Guest]: it was, it's like being

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.680
[Guest]: in a playground, right?

02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:19.680
[Guest]: Because you go in there

02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:20.680
[Guest]: and you're seeing

02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:21.680
[Guest]: all these things

02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:22.680
[Guest]: and you're like,

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:23.680
[Guest]: oh, this is what it means.

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:24.680
[Guest]: Oh, this is what it means.

02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:25.680
[Guest]: And that's exciting.

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:26.680
[Guest]: So I think that's

02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:27.680
[Guest]: what I felt about it.

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:28.680
[Guest]: Over time, of course, yeah,

02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:29.680
[Guest]: it's all the things.

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.680
[Guest]: It's trusting what I loved.

02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:31.680
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan always,

02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:32.680
[Guest]: people always made fun

02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:33.680
[Guest]: of me for that.

02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:34.680
[Guest]: You know, he can't act

02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:35.680
[Guest]: and I'm like,

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.680
[Guest]: what a kind of like

02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:37.680
[Guest]: dumb ass thing to say.

02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:38.680
[Amit Varma]: He can't act.

02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:39.680
[Amit Varma]: That's bullshit.

02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:40.680
[Guest]: First, I mean,

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:41.680
[Guest]: come on.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.680
[Guest]: Please.

02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:43.680
[Amit Varma]: We should take this outside.

02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Outside, yeah.

02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I feel like that's

02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:46.680
[Amit Varma]: bringing realism

02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:47.680
[Amit Varma]: into fantasy, right?

02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Like people don't love

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:49.680
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan for his acting.

02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:50.680
[Guest]: They love him for something

02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:51.680
[Guest]: else he unlocks in us.

02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:52.680
[Guest]: So I think that's

02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:53.680
[Guest]: what I felt about it.

02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:54.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:55.680
[Guest]: I mean,

02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:56.680
[Guest]: I feel like that's

02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:57.680
[Guest]: bringing realism

02:27:57.680 --> 02:27:58.680
[Guest]: into fantasy, right?

02:27:58.680 --> 02:27:59.680
[Guest]: Like people don't love

02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:00.680
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan for his acting.

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:01.680
[Guest]: So I think that making

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:02.680
[Guest]: sense of cinema

02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:03.680
[Guest]: in a literal way,

02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:04.680
[Guest]: and especially

02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:05.680
[Guest]: with popular culture,

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:06.680
[Guest]: it's a very stupid

02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:07.680
[Guest]: thing to do.

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:08.680
[Guest]: Popular culture

02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:09.680
[Guest]: is all about sensation

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.680
[Guest]: and how we feel things.

02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:12.680
[Guest]: So it allows us

02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:13.680
[Guest]: to feel things fully.

02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:14.680
[Amit Varma]: It overtakes us.

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.680
[Amit Varma]: So what do you think is

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.680
[Amit Varma]: the way I am judging

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:17.680
[Amit Varma]: Shah Rukh as a bad actor

02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:18.680
[Amit Varma]: and the way I might

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:19.680
[Amit Varma]: look down on some

02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.680
[Amit Varma]: popular cinema

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:21.680
[Amit Varma]: is valid from

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.680
[Amit Varma]: its frame of reference,

02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:23.680
[Amit Varma]: but that frame of reference

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:24.680
[Amit Varma]: is inapplicable

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:25.680
[Amit Varma]: because these films

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:26.680
[Guest]: are not trying to do that.

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:27.680
[Guest]: They're not.

02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:28.680
[Guest]: Their enterprise

02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:29.680
[Guest]: is completely different.

02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:30.680
[Guest]: Sure.

02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.680
[Guest]: So you can't really

02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.680
[Guest]: bring that lens to it.

02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:33.680
[Guest]: But I also feel

02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:34.680
[Guest]: there's a squeamishness

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:35.680
[Guest]: about simple pleasure,

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:36.680
[Guest]: right?

02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:37.680
[Guest]: Bodily pleasure

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.680
[Guest]: is a problem for people.

02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:39.680
[Guest]: Later on,

02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:40.680
[Guest]: it became fashionable

02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:41.680
[Guest]: to write about

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:42.680
[Guest]: popular culture,

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:43.680
[Guest]: but it's written about

02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:44.680
[Guest]: in a fairly

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:45.680
[Guest]: loveless fashion.

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:46.680
[Guest]: No longer.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.680
[Guest]: I think there are

02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:48.680
[Guest]: new writers.

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:49.680
[Guest]: I mean,

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.680
[Guest]: other writers

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:51.680
[Guest]: who are doing

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:52.680
[Guest]: really interesting

02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:53.680
[Guest]: work on Bollywood now,

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:54.680
[Guest]: Hindi films,

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.680
[Guest]: whatever.

02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:56.680
[Guest]: But yeah,

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.680
[Guest]: for a long time.

02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.680
[Guest]: And I think

02:28:58.680 --> 02:28:59.680
[Guest]: that's what

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.680
[Guest]: they wanted to do

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.680
[Guest]: in a film,

02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.680
[Guest]: the way they represented

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.680
[Guest]: queerness,

02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:04.680
[Guest]: the way they allowed

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:05.680
[Guest]: sex to be present,

02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:06.680
[Guest]: the voice that they gave

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:07.680
[Guest]: to women,

02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:08.680
[Guest]: the voice that they gave

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:09.680
[Guest]: to emotion,

02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:10.680
[Guest]: which is completely

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:11.680
[Guest]: lacking in our cinema

02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:12.680
[Guest]: right now.

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:13.680
[Guest]: And I feel

02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:14.680
[Guest]: that's part of the success

02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:15.680
[Guest]: of a film like Abish Singh

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:16.680
[Guest]: that it is so much

02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.680
[Guest]: about emotion

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.680
[Guest]: that it's the only place

02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:19.680
[Guest]: that people are getting

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:20.680
[Guest]: to talk about feelings.

02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:21.680
[Guest]: So whatever its problems

02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:22.680
[Guest]: might be,

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.680
[Guest]: they're clinging to that,

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.680
[Guest]: you know?

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.680
[Guest]: So I feel by removing

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.680
[Guest]: songs from films,

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:27.680
[Guest]: which gave some expression

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.680
[Guest]: to our feelings as well.

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:29.680
[Guest]: So I think

02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:30.680
[Guest]: the playback song itself

02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:31.680
[Guest]: as a thing,

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.680
[Guest]: that the voice

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:33.680
[Guest]: and the person

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.680
[Guest]: are two different people.

02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:35.680
[Guest]: It's itself

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:36.680
[Guest]: such a queer idea.

02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:37.680
[Guest]: I know it,

02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:38.680
[Guest]: but I accept it.

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.680
[Guest]: It's a fiction.

02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:40.680
[Unknown]: I know the reality,

02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:41.680
[Guest]: but I accept

02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:42.680
[Guest]: the fiction as real,

02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:43.680
[Guest]: you know?

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:44.680
[Guest]: I know

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:45.680
[Guest]: that it's

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.680
[Guest]: Lata Mangeshkar's voice,

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:47.680
[Guest]: Nutan's voice.

02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:48.680
[Guest]: Unless it's Himesh

02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:49.680
[Guest]: who's acting

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:50.680
[Guest]: in the film.

02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:51.680
[Amit Varma]: No,

02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:52.680
[Amit Varma]: if it's Himesh,

02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:53.680
[Guest]: then Himesh takes

02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:54.680
[Guest]: over everything.

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:55.680
[Amit Varma]: He's him-less.

02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah,

02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:57.680
[Guest]: he is the fiction

02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.680
[Guest]: and the nonfiction.

02:29:58.680 --> 02:29:59.680
[Guest]: So he erases the actor

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:00.680
[Guest]: in a certain sense,

02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:01.680
[Guest]: and that is why

02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:02.680
[Guest]: he tried to become

02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:03.680
[Guest]: an actor eventually.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:04.680
[Guest]: But yeah,

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.680
[Guest]: so I think like

02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:06.680
[Guest]: there is a lot of complexity

02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:07.680
[Guest]: in popular culture,

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:08.680
[Guest]: which is poetic,

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:09.680
[Guest]: which speaks to us,

02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:10.680
[Guest]: which says something

02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:11.680
[Guest]: about subterranean parts

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:12.680
[Guest]: of ourselves.

02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:13.680
[Guest]: And I found it

02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:14.680
[Guest]: a great way

02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:15.680
[Guest]: to understand life.

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:16.680
[Guest]: I'm not saying

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:17.680
[Guest]: to understand society

02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.680
[Guest]: as if I'm something outside it.

02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:19.680
[Guest]: I feel it's a great way

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:20.680
[Amit Varma]: to understand life

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:21.680
[Amit Varma]: and who we are.

02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So not just watching the film,

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.680
[Amit Varma]: but also saying that

02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:24.680
[Amit Varma]: why am I reacting this way

02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:25.680
[Amit Varma]: instinctively to this aspect

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of the film?

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And then that makes you

02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:28.680
[Guest]: see the world differently.

02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:29.680
[Guest]: So, you know,

02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:30.680
[Guest]: Ulka Anjaria has written

02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:31.680
[Guest]: this book called

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:32.680
[Guest]: Reading India Now.

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:35.680
[Guest]: And she's an academic.

02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:36.680
[Guest]: And for about a year

02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:37.680
[Guest]: while she was in India

02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:38.680
[Guest]: on her sabbatical,

02:30:38.680 --> 02:30:39.680
[Guest]: I would see her

02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:40.680
[Guest]: at every talk that I gave

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:41.680
[Guest]: and every event

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:42.680
[Guest]: I was part of.

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:43.680
[Guest]: And I'm like,

02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:44.680
[Guest]: wow, she's so culturally active.

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:45.680
[Guest]: She goes to everything.

02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, she's stalking me.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:47.680
[Guest]: No, actually,

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:48.680
[Guest]: well, she kind of was

02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:49.680
[Guest]: because a year later.

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:50.680
[Guest]: And then, you know,

02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:51.680
[Guest]: I had drinks with her one day

02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:52.680
[Guest]: and I asked her,

02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:53.680
[Guest]: what are you working on?

02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.680
[Guest]: And she said,

02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:55.680
[Guest]: I'm working on contemporary culture

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:56.680
[Guest]: and Chetan Bhagat

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:57.680
[Guest]: and something and all of that.

02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:58.680
[Guest]: I'm like, yeah, yeah,

02:30:58.680 --> 02:30:59.680
[Guest]: sounds good.

02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:00.680
[Guest]: But I didn't think about it

02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:01.680
[Guest]: too much afterwards.

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:02.680
[Guest]: And about a year later,

02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:03.680
[Guest]: she sent me a chapter

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:04.680
[Guest]: saying that there is a chapter

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:05.680
[Guest]: on your work in my book

02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:06.680
[Guest]: and I wanted you to read it.

02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:07.680
[Guest]: And I hope I'm not

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.680
[Guest]: misrepresented in any way.

02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:09.680
[Guest]: And when I read the chapter,

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:12.680
[Guest]: I was halfway between

02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:13.680
[Guest]: like ecstasy and tears

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:14.680
[Guest]: because I felt like

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:15.680
[Guest]: nobody had understood my...

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.680
[Guest]: First of all,

02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:17.680
[Guest]: she has read everything

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.680
[Guest]: I've written,

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:19.680
[Guest]: which is a massive amount

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:20.680
[Guest]: of reading.

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.680
[Guest]: And she had seen

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:22.680
[Guest]: everything I've made

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:23.680
[Guest]: and understood

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:24.680
[Guest]: what I was trying to do,

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:25.680
[Guest]: which was fantastic.

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.680
[Guest]: And one of the things

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:27.680
[Guest]: that she wrote about

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:28.680
[Guest]: was my review of

02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:29.680
[Guest]: Anarkali of Ara.

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:30.680
[Guest]: And she said,

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:31.680
[Guest]: it's the idea of the critic

02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.680
[Guest]: as a lover

02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.680
[Guest]: that you love the thing,

02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:35.680
[Guest]: but you critique it

02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:36.680
[Guest]: from a place of love,

02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:37.680
[Guest]: not from a place of contempt,

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:38.680
[Guest]: which is what you were

02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:39.680
[Guest]: talking about, right?

02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:40.680
[Guest]: And so for me,

02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:41.680
[Guest]: like when I saw

02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:42.680
[Guest]: Anarkali of Ara,

02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:43.680
[Guest]: I felt relief.

02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.680
[Guest]: And I'm like,

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:45.680
[Guest]: why am I feeling so...

02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:46.680
[Guest]: Like this feeling I had

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:47.680
[Guest]: at the end of the film

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:48.680
[Guest]: because, you know,

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:49.680
[Guest]: throughout the film,

02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:50.680
[Guest]: I realized I'd been

02:31:50.680 --> 02:31:51.680
[Guest]: holding my breath,

02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.680
[Guest]: no matter what.

02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:53.680
[Guest]: It's going to be like

02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:54.680
[Guest]: that fucking film Pink,

02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:55.680
[Guest]: where the men

02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:56.680
[Guest]: will uplift the woman.

02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:57.680
[Guest]: But that's not

02:31:57.680 --> 02:31:58.680
[Guest]: what the film was.

02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.680
[Guest]: The film was about her

02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.680
[Guest]: just wanting to sing

02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:01.680
[Guest]: and dance again.

02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:02.680
[Guest]: It wasn't about

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:03.680
[Guest]: her wanting revenge.

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:04.680
[Guest]: She didn't even want to.

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:05.680
[Guest]: She just wanted to sing

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:06.680
[Guest]: and dance and wear

02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:07.680
[Guest]: blingy clothes again.

02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:08.680
[Guest]: She didn't want to be

02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:09.680
[Guest]: only the moment

02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:10.680
[Guest]: of sexual crime,

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:11.680
[Guest]: which people are

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:12.680
[Guest]: continuously reducing

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:13.680
[Guest]: women to, right?

02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:14.680
[Guest]: You're the victim

02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:15.680
[Guest]: of the crime

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.680
[Guest]: and you're nothing else.

02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.680
[Guest]: So when she ends

02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:18.680
[Guest]: with that thing

02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:19.680
[Guest]: and I came out

02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:20.680
[Guest]: and I was like,

02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:21.680
[Guest]: this is a film

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:22.680
[Guest]: made for people like me

02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:23.680
[Guest]: who want to say yes,

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:24.680
[Guest]: who it's not only

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:25.680
[Guest]: about no means no,

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:26.680
[Guest]: it's also about

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:27.680
[Guest]: yes means yes

02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:28.680
[Guest]: when I want to,

02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:29.680
[Guest]: not when you want to,

02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:30.680
[Guest]: which is something

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:31.680
[Guest]: totally missing in our films.

02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:32.680
[Guest]: So the idea of

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:33.680
[Guest]: writing about something

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:34.680
[Guest]: because you see it as

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:35.680
[Guest]: enabling,

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:36.680
[Guest]: important,

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:37.680
[Guest]: vibrant,

02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:38.680
[Guest]: I think that is

02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:39.680
[Guest]: a critical place

02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:40.680
[Guest]: that we don't feel enough,

02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:41.680
[Guest]: right?

02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:42.680
[Guest]: And the way that

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:43.680
[Guest]: I relate to popular culture

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.680
[Guest]: is really to look at

02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:45.680
[Guest]: what it enables,

02:32:45.680 --> 02:32:46.680
[Amit Varma]: not what it disables.

02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:47.680
[Amit Varma]: So the natural follow-up

02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:48.680
[Amit Varma]: question to that,

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:49.680
[Amit Varma]: which has two parts to that

02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:50.680
[Amit Varma]: and one is cliched,

02:32:50.680 --> 02:32:51.680
[Amit Varma]: but the other may

02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:52.680
[Amit Varma]: maybe slightly less

02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:54.680
[Amit Varma]: is in your time,

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:55.680
[Amit Varma]: in the time that you've been

02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:56.680
[Amit Varma]: writing and working

02:32:56.680 --> 02:32:57.680
[Amit Varma]: the last 30 something years,

02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:58.680
[Amit Varma]: one,

02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.680
[Amit Varma]: how has popular culture changed?

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Or rather,

02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:01.680
[Amit Varma]: that's a question.

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:02.680
[Amit Varma]: There are two parts to it.

02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:03.680
[Amit Varma]: How has popular culture changed?

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:04.680
[Amit Varma]: One,

02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:05.680
[Amit Varma]: in a general sense of,

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:06.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:07.680
[Amit Varma]: you think of,

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:08.680
[Amit Varma]: for example,

02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:09.680
[Amit Varma]: the market for entertainment

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and as society changes,

02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:11.680
[Amit Varma]: you imagine popular culture

02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:12.680
[Amit Varma]: will change

02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:13.680
[Amit Varma]: and how much of that

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:14.680
[Amit Varma]: has happened

02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:15.680
[Amit Varma]: and what does it reflect?

02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And a part two of the question

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:18.680
[Amit Varma]: is that Bollywood

02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:20.680
[Amit Varma]: is often like

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:21.680
[Amit Varma]: governance,

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.680
[Amit Varma]: in fact,

02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:23.680
[Amit Varma]: driven by the elites,

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:24.680
[Amit Varma]: that you have a few

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:25.680
[Amit Varma]: privileged elites

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:26.680
[Amit Varma]: and a few structures

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:27.680
[Amit Varma]: and, you know,

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:28.680
[Amit Varma]: most new actors

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:29.680
[Amit Varma]: who come in

02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:30.680
[Amit Varma]: are coming in

02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:31.680
[Amit Varma]: because they're the son

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.680
[Amit Varma]: or daughter of someone

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and blah blah blah

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:34.680
[Amit Varma]: and you have these

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:35.680
[Amit Varma]: big families

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:36.680
[Amit Varma]: ruling over the thing

02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:37.680
[Amit Varma]: and what I find interesting

02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:38.680
[Amit Varma]: is that to a certain extent,

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:39.680
[Amit Varma]: these elites are

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:40.680
[Amit Varma]: driving the change.

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:41.680
[Amit Varma]: So when I look at a film

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:42.680
[Amit Varma]: like, say,

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Kapoor and Sons,

02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:44.680
[Amit Varma]: which has come out of,

02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I think,

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:46.680
[Amit Varma]: the Karan Johar stable

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:47.680
[Amit Varma]: and I'm thinking,

02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:49.680
[Amit Varma]: gayness is such a

02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:50.680
[Amit Varma]: natural,

02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:51.680
[Amit Varma]: normal thing

02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:52.680
[Amit Varma]: but is it happening

02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:53.680
[Amit Varma]: this way

02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:54.680
[Amit Varma]: because the elites

02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:55.680
[Amit Varma]: are more,

02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:56.680
[Amit Varma]: so to say,

02:33:56.680 --> 02:33:57.680
[Amit Varma]: with it

02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:58.680
[Amit Varma]: or have,

02:33:58.680 --> 02:33:59.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:00.680
[Amit Varma]: progressed further

02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:01.680
[Amit Varma]: than the rest of society.

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:02.680
[Guest]: I mean,

02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:03.680
[Guest]: I don't know if I'm being

02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:04.680
[Guest]: very coherent but...

02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.680
[Guest]: I don't think the elites

02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.680
[Guest]: have progressed,

02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:07.680
[Unknown]: first of all.

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:08.680
[Guest]: I think the elites

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:09.680
[Guest]: can often be more conservative

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:10.680
[Amit Varma]: than many other parts

02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:11.680
[Amit Varma]: of society

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.680
[Amit Varma]: but that's also

02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:13.680
[Guest]: not really fair.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:14.680
[Guest]: I mean,

02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:15.680
[Guest]: I look at things like

02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:16.680
[Guest]: Kapoor and Sons

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.680
[Guest]: but I like

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Four More Shorts,

02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:19.680
[Guest]: please.

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:20.680
[Guest]: Because I feel

02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:21.680
[Guest]: Made in Heaven

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:22.680
[Guest]: is very Bhadur Lok

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and it's like a very

02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:24.680
[Guest]: nationalist kind of thing.

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:25.680
[Guest]: But it's got

02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:26.680
[Amit Varma]: this very national...

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:27.680
[Amit Varma]: I meant the aspect

02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:28.680
[Amit Varma]: of showing

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:29.680
[Amit Varma]: gayness in a very

02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:30.680
[Guest]: natural way

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:31.680
[Guest]: and not in a caricature

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:32.680
[Guest]: sort of...

02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:33.680
[Guest]: Gayness in a natural way

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:34.680
[Unknown]: also has become

02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:35.680
[Unknown]: a kind of

02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:36.680
[Guest]: liberal calling.

02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:37.680
[Guest]: Cliché.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:38.680
[Guest]: Cliché, yeah.

02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:39.680
[Guest]: So I will get tea

02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:40.680
[Guest]: but it's still there

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:41.680
[Guest]: for its issue

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:42.680
[Guest]: to an extent

02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:43.680
[Guest]: and Made in Heaven

02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:44.680
[Guest]: takes a lot of

02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:45.680
[Guest]: its power

02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:46.680
[Guest]: from the juicy

02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:47.680
[Guest]: personal dynamics

02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:48.680
[Guest]: as from its

02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:49.680
[Guest]: very worthy

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:50.680
[Guest]: kind of interest

02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:51.680
[Guest]: in social issues.

02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:52.680
[Guest]: It's like 10 episodes

02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:53.680
[Guest]: of one social topic

02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:54.680
[Guest]: after the other.

02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:55.680
[Guest]: Whereas Four More Shorts,

02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.680
[Guest]: please, is about four girls

02:34:56.680 --> 02:34:57.680
[Guest]: who want to have sex,

02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:58.680
[Guest]: make money and

02:34:58.680 --> 02:34:59.680
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.680
[Amit Varma]: solve their emotional life.

02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:01.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'm with that.

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:02.680
[Amit Varma]: I haven't actually seen it.

02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.680
[Guest]: I'm going to go back

02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:04.680
[Amit Varma]: and watch it.

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:05.680
[Amit Varma]: You may not like it.

02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:06.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a bit trashy

02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:07.680
[Amit Varma]: but I was like with it.

02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:08.680
[Guest]: How dare you say

02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:09.680
[Guest]: I don't like trashy things.

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:10.680
[Guest]: I'm called the Govinda

02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:11.680
[Guest]: of podcasting for a reason.

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:13.680
[Amit Varma]: Control yourself.

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:14.680
[Guest]: The podcast is three hours long

02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:15.680
[Amit Varma]: and it's a good thing.

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, if I made it

02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:17.680
[Guest]: five hours long

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:18.680
[Guest]: they'd call me

02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:19.680
[Guest]: I don't know

02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:20.680
[Guest]: the Bela Tower

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:21.680
[Guest]: of podcasting.

02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:22.680
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.680
[Guest]: It's all about size.

02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:24.680
[Guest]: So the thing is that

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:25.680
[Guest]: I feel that

02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:26.680
[Guest]: Bollywood first

02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:27.680
[Guest]: if we're talking

02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:28.680
[Guest]: about popular culture

02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:29.680
[Guest]: it's not only Bollywood.

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:30.680
[Guest]: But Bollywood

02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:31.680
[Guest]: at first

02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.680
[Guest]: was like

02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:33.680
[Guest]: full of people

02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:34.680
[Guest]: who are not elites.

02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:35.680
[Guest]: There were elites

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:36.680
[Guest]: of course,

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:37.680
[Guest]: Devakarani and all

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:38.680
[Guest]: there were Brahmins

02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:39.680
[Guest]: there were upper caste people

02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:40.680
[Guest]: but there were a lot

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:41.680
[Guest]: of Muslims

02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:42.680
[Guest]: there were a lot

02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:43.680
[Guest]: of Anglo-Indian women

02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:44.680
[Guest]: there were a lot of

02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:45.680
[Guest]: melting pot feeling

02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:46.680
[Guest]: about Bollywood

02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:47.680
[Guest]: early on.

02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:48.680
[Guest]: And then of course

02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:49.680
[Guest]: families start

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:50.680
[Guest]: to come in

02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:51.680
[Guest]: and studios

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:52.680
[Guest]: and systems

02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:53.680
[Guest]: and privileges form.

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:54.680
[Guest]: It was always very

02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:55.680
[Guest]: driven by those camps

02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.680
[Guest]: but in its

02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:57.680
[Guest]: content

02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:58.680
[Guest]: also

02:35:58.680 --> 02:35:59.680
[Guest]: it represented

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:00.680
[Guest]: a far more diverse

02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:01.680
[Guest]: world than

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:02.680
[Guest]: today's Bollywood

02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:03.680
[Guest]: does.

02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:04.680
[Guest]: Right.

02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:05.680
[Guest]: Which is to say

02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:06.680
[Guest]: you had working class people

02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:07.680
[Guest]: you had queer people

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:08.680
[Guest]: not being gay

02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:09.680
[Guest]: in that accepted sense

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.680
[Guest]: but you had

02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:11.680
[Guest]: a lot of queer presence.

02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:12.680
[Guest]: If you look at older

02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:13.680
[Guest]: kind of men

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:14.680
[Guest]: who are singing

02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:15.680
[Guest]: those Kavadis

02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:16.680
[Guest]: you see queer presence

02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:17.680
[Guest]: in a very much

02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:18.680
[Guest]: more potent

02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:19.680
[Guest]: because it's not

02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.680
[Guest]: been neatly

02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:21.680
[Guest]: you know like

02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:22.680
[Guest]: politically correctly

02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:23.680
[Guest]: presented.

02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:24.680
[Guest]: Now both things

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:25.680
[Guest]: have a different power

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:26.680
[Guest]: is what I'm saying.

02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:27.680
[Guest]: I'm not saying

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:28.680
[Guest]: one is better than the other

02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:29.680
[Guest]: but it's not necessarily

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:30.680
[Guest]: a linear progression

02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:31.680
[Guest]: of one progressiveness

02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:32.680
[Guest]: and then

02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:33.680
[Guest]: it's getting better

02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.680
[Guest]: and better.

02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:35.680
[Guest]: But I think

02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:36.680
[Guest]: what's

02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:37.680
[Guest]: what's happened

02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:38.680
[Guest]: the significant change

02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:39.680
[Guest]: in popular culture

02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:40.680
[Guest]: is in fact

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:41.680
[Guest]: I don't think

02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:42.680
[Guest]: it's the same

02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.680
[Guest]: in the rest of India.

02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:44.680
[Guest]: It has been

02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:45.680
[Guest]: excessively corporatized

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:46.680
[Guest]: it works

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:47.680
[Guest]: excessively by

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:48.680
[Guest]: corporate logics

02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:49.680
[Guest]: which means

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:50.680
[Guest]: it works by

02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:51.680
[Guest]: playing the numbers

02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:52.680
[Guest]: not really by

02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:53.680
[Guest]: the slightly

02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:54.680
[Amit Varma]: maverick quality

02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:55.680
[Amit Varma]: of creativity.

02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:56.680
[Guest]: I agree

02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:57.680
[Guest]: so there's no imagination.

02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:58.680
[Guest]: Yeah

02:36:58.680 --> 02:36:59.680
[Guest]: so it's not potent

02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:00.680
[Guest]: it's not risk taking

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:01.680
[Guest]: you know

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:02.680
[Guest]: it's a fairly

02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:03.680
[Guest]: risk averse

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:04.680
[Guest]: kind of space

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:05.680
[Guest]: creatively

02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:06.680
[Guest]: from time to time

02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:07.680
[Guest]: you'll see something

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:08.680
[Guest]: but not really

02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:09.680
[Guest]: and people don't back

02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:10.680
[Guest]: the risky thing

02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:11.680
[Guest]: it plays out in

02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:12.680
[Guest]: all the worlds

02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:13.680
[Guest]: that we have

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:14.680
[Guest]: but

02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:15.680
[Guest]: digital

02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:16.680
[Guest]: I mean

02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.680
[Amit Varma]: TikTok

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:18.680
[Amit Varma]: I was just going to

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:19.680
[Amit Varma]: come to TikTok

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:20.680
[Amit Varma]: because I have this

02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:21.680
[Amit Varma]: feeling that

02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:22.680
[Guest]: this is one thing

02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:23.680
[Guest]: you and I could bond over

02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:24.680
[Guest]: we could sit and

02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.680
[Guest]: watch TikTok together

02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:26.680
[Guest]: but the thing is

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:27.680
[Guest]: that

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:28.680
[Guest]: why I don't watch

02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:29.680
[Guest]: a lot of TikTok

02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:30.680
[Guest]: but the power

02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:31.680
[Guest]: of TikTok is

02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:32.680
[Guest]: it has overturned

02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:33.680
[Guest]: the logic of celebrity

02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:34.680
[Guest]: actually

02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:35.680
[Guest]: I no longer

02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:36.680
[Guest]: need Ranveer Singh

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:37.680
[Guest]: because I am

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.680
[Guest]: Ranveer Singh

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:39.680
[Guest]: right

02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:40.680
[Guest]: TikTok can have

02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:41.680
[Guest]: million followers

02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:42.680
[Guest]: like that

02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:43.680
[Guest]: you don't need English

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:44.680
[Guest]: you don't need literacy

02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:45.680
[Guest]: even

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:46.680
[Guest]: you just need to know

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:47.680
[Guest]: how to make a great

02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:48.680
[Guest]: 20 second clip

02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.680
[Guest]: right

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:50.680
[Guest]: so what is it doing

02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:51.680
[Guest]: it is actually

02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680
[Guest]: making popular culture

02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:53.680
[Unknown]: folk culture again

02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:54.680
[Guest]: yeah

02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:55.680
[Guest]: this division of

02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:56.680
[Guest]: culture into folk

02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:57.680
[Guest]: and not folk

02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.680
[Guest]: is a colonial division

02:37:58.680 --> 02:37:59.680
[Guest]: but actually

02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:00.680
[Guest]: folk culture was

02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:01.680
[Guest]: culture

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:02.680
[Guest]: and Bollywood

02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:03.680
[Guest]: is a kind of

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:04.680
[Guest]: urban folk

02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:05.680
[Guest]: that's all it was

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:06.680
[Guest]: right

02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:07.680
[Guest]: you have all these

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:08.680
[Guest]: great Shahis

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:09.680
[Guest]: I mean

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:10.680
[Guest]: one of the reasons

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:11.680
[Guest]: I used a Lavani

02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:12.680
[Guest]: to make a film

02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:13.680
[Guest]: about consent

02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:14.680
[Guest]: for Agents of Ishq

02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:15.680
[Guest]: was because

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:16.680
[Guest]: I looked at Lavani

02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:17.680
[Guest]: and I was like

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:18.680
[Guest]: oh my god

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:19.680
[Guest]: this is so sexy

02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:20.680
[Guest]: and it's so clever

02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:21.680
[Guest]: a form

02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.680
[Guest]: and it will allow me

02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.680
[Guest]: to say something

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:24.680
[Guest]: fairly didactic

02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:25.680
[Guest]: without being didactic

02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.680
[Guest]: because it is totally

02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:27.680
[Guest]: rooted in lived experience

02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:28.680
[Guest]: right

02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:29.680
[Guest]: it's an experiential form

02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:30.680
[Guest]: actually

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:31.680
[Guest]: so you've always had

02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:32.680
[Guest]: multiple folk

02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:33.680
[Guest]: and pop cultures

02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:34.680
[Guest]: I won't say folk

02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:35.680
[Guest]: multiple popular cultures

02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:36.680
[Guest]: have existed

02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:37.680
[Guest]: but the corporatization

02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:38.680
[Guest]: in Punjab

02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:39.680
[Guest]: Bollywood was not

02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:40.680
[Guest]: a big factor there

02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:41.680
[Guest]: because pop music

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:42.680
[Amit Varma]: is the main

02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:43.680
[Amit Varma]: popular culture

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.680
[Amit Varma]: and south people

02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:45.680
[Amit Varma]: listening to this

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.680
[Guest]: will be so pissed off

02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:47.680
[Guest]: at me because

02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.680
[Guest]: they're like

02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:49.680
[Guest]: what Bollywood is not

02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:50.680
[Guest]: yeah what are you

02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:51.680
[Guest]: talking about

02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:52.680
[Guest]: so but I'm saying

02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:53.680
[Guest]: even the big

02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:54.680
[Guest]: big film

02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:55.680
[Guest]: producing states

02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:56.680
[Guest]: or regions

02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:57.680
[Amit Varma]: right

02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:58.680
[Guest]: so yes maybe

02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:59.680
[Guest]: Tamil movies

02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:00.680
[Guest]: are very big

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:01.680
[Guest]: but nevertheless

02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:02.680
[Guest]: movie production

02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:03.680
[Guest]: is very corporatized

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:04.680
[Guest]: it is corporatized

02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:05.680
[Guest]: although there is

02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:06.680
[Guest]: much more inventiveness

02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:07.680
[Guest]: in the big

02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:08.680
[Guest]: film producing culture

02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.680
[Guest]: you have a lot

02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:10.680
[Guest]: more inventiveness

02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:11.680
[Guest]: you have a lot

02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:12.680
[Guest]: more relationship

02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:13.680
[Guest]: with the audience

02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:14.680
[Guest]: what corporatization

02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:15.680
[Guest]: does is it severs

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:16.680
[Amit Varma]: the relationship

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.680
[Amit Varma]: between audience

02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:18.680
[Amit Varma]: and creator

02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:19.680
[Amit Varma]: and not just that

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:20.680
[Amit Varma]: what you know

02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:21.680
[Amit Varma]: the fact also remains

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:22.680
[Amit Varma]: is that because of

02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:23.680
[Guest]: technology and the

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:24.680
[Amit Varma]: internet today

02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:25.680
[Amit Varma]: anyone in the country

02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:26.680
[Guest]: can see Malayalam

02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:27.680
[Guest]: films and get

02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:28.680
[Guest]: inspired by them

02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:29.680
[Guest]: exactly

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:30.680
[Guest]: which would not

02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:31.680
[Guest]: have been the case

02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:32.680
[Guest]: 20 years ago

02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:33.680
[Guest]: you're reaching

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:34.680
[Guest]: the long tail

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:35.680
[Guest]: but I think that

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:36.680
[Guest]: has been incorporated

02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:37.680
[Guest]: into the everyday

02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:38.680
[Guest]: practice of life

02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:39.680
[Guest]: now we have done it

02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:40.680
[Guest]: again

02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:41.680
[Guest]: there are moments

02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:42.680
[Guest]: you know I also

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:43.680
[Guest]: know that

02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:44.680
[Guest]: facetiously when we

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:45.680
[Guest]: would do Diwali puja

02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:46.680
[Guest]: since we are a

02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:47.680
[Guest]: most untraditional

02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:48.680
[Guest]: family

02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:49.680
[Guest]: we would sing

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:50.680
[Guest]: some filmy kind

02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:51.680
[Guest]: of prayer song

02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:52.680
[Guest]: like

02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:53.680
[Guest]: so the way in

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:54.680
[Guest]: which popular

02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:55.680
[Guest]: culture

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:56.680
[Guest]: and the fact

02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:57.680
[Guest]: that many people

02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:58.680
[Guest]: sing bhajans

02:39:58.680 --> 02:39:59.680
[Guest]: which are based

02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:00.680
[Guest]: on filmy tunes

02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:01.680
[Guest]: so we have

02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:02.680
[Guest]: always had that

02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:03.680
[Guest]: mixture of everyday

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:04.680
[Guest]: life and popular

02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:05.680
[Guest]: culture

02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:06.680
[Guest]: which is not

02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:07.680
[Guest]: real

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:08.680
[Guest]: but actually

02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:09.680
[Guest]: being the only

02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:10.680
[Guest]: spokesperson

02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:11.680
[Guest]: creating a binary

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:12.680
[Guest]: of culture

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:13.680
[Guest]: in a sense

02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:14.680
[Guest]: it has lived

02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:15.680
[Guest]: its day

02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:16.680
[Guest]: and that is why

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:17.680
[Guest]: today when people

02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:18.680
[Guest]: say why aren't

02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:19.680
[Guest]: Bollywood stars

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:20.680
[Guest]: saying something

02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:21.680
[Guest]: about politics

02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:22.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm like

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:23.680
[Amit Varma]: who cares

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:24.680
[Amit Varma]: have some pity

02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:25.680
[Amit Varma]: on them

02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:26.680
[Guest]: because they

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:27.680
[Guest]: can't in a way

02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:28.680
[Amit Varma]: and one of the

02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:29.680
[Amit Varma]: really popular

02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:30.680
[Amit Varma]: hashtags on

02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:31.680
[Amit Varma]: tiktok if you

02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:32.680
[Amit Varma]: remember

02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:33.680
[Guest]: was the onions

02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:34.680
[Guest]: I would say

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:35.680
[Amit Varma]: a lot of popular

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.680
[Amit Varma]: tiktok is extremely

02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:37.680
[Guest]: misogynist as well

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:38.680
[Guest]: which our society is

02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:39.680
[Guest]: but we are also

02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:40.680
[Guest]: seeing all these

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:41.680
[Amit Varma]: grannies and

02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:42.680
[Guest]: so many people

02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:43.680
[Guest]: doing like

02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.680
[Amit Varma]: cartwheels

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:45.680
[Amit Varma]: grannies doing

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:46.680
[Amit Varma]: cartwheels

02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:47.680
[Amit Varma]: and so many

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:48.680
[Guest]: women with channels

02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:49.680
[Guest]: of their own

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.680
[Guest]: and millions of

02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:51.680
[Guest]: followers

02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:52.680
[Guest]: and also

02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:53.680
[Guest]: I met this

02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:54.680
[Guest]: woman

02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:55.680
[Guest]: I keep forgetting

02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:56.680
[Guest]: her name

02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:57.680
[Guest]: but she is

02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:58.680
[Guest]: very well

02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.680
[Guest]: known on

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:00.680
[Guest]: tiktok

02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:01.680
[Guest]: she used to

02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:02.680
[Guest]: do motivational

02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:03.680
[Guest]: videos

02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:04.680
[Guest]: on tiktok

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:05.680
[Guest]: because

02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:06.680
[Guest]: English is so

02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:07.680
[Guest]: good

02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:08.680
[Guest]: can't you

02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:09.680
[Guest]: teach us

02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:10.680
[Guest]: English on

02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:11.680
[Amit Varma]: tiktok

02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:12.680
[Amit Varma]: so she started

02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:13.680
[Guest]: doing conversational

02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:14.680
[Guest]: English videos

02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:15.680
[Guest]: on tiktok

02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.680
[Guest]: and she has a

02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:17.680
[Guest]: huge following

02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:18.680
[Guest]: so I also

02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:19.680
[Guest]: think

02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:20.680
[Guest]: this response

02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:21.680
[Guest]: apparently in a

02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:22.680
[Guest]: couple of

02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:23.680
[Guest]: weeks she had

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:24.680
[Guest]: some million

02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.680
[Guest]: followers

02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:26.680
[Guest]: but the

02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:27.680
[Guest]: relationship

02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:28.680
[Unknown]: between audience

02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:29.680
[Unknown]: and creator

02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.680
[Guest]: is what

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:31.680
[Guest]: digital has

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:32.680
[Guest]: become

02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:33.680
[Guest]: so

02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:34.680
[Guest]: I think

02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:35.680
[Guest]: it's

02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.680
[Guest]: an

02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:37.680
[Guest]: exciting

02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:38.680
[Guest]: moment

02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:39.680
[Guest]: for popular

02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:40.680
[Guest]: culture

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:41.680
[Guest]: and I

02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:42.680
[Guest]: would say

02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:43.680
[Guest]: even for

02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:44.680
[Guest]: myself

02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:45.680
[Guest]: something

02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:46.680
[Guest]: that I

02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:47.680
[Amit Varma]: could do

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:48.680
[Amit Varma]: with

02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:49.680

[Guest]: girls

02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:51.680
[Guest]: because of

02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:52.680
[Guest]: the coming

02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:53.680
[Guest]: of digital

02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:54.680
[Guest]: culture

02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:55.680

[Guest]: film

02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:57.680
[Guest]: that didn't

02:41:57.680 --> 02:41:58.680
[Guest]: look like

02:41:58.680 --> 02:41:59.680
[Guest]: any film

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:00.680
[Guest]: before

02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:01.680
[Guest]: it cost

02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:02.680
[Guest]: less

02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:03.680
[Amit Varma]: it was

02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:04.680
[Amit Varma]: in my

[Guest]: to worry

02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:35.680
[Amit Varma]: too much

02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:36.680
[Amit Varma]: about

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.680
[Amit Varma]: bollywood's

02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:38.680
[Amit Varma]: badness

02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:39.680
[Amit Varma]: because it's

02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:40.680
[Amit Varma]: not that

02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:41.680
[Amit Varma]: important anymore

02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:42.680
[Amit Varma]: so we

02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:43.680
[Amit Varma]: have now

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:44.680
[Amit Varma]: this episode

02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:45.680
[Amit Varma]: has reached

02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:46.680
[Amit Varma]: that stage

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.680
[Amit Varma]: of self

02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:48.680
[Amit Varma]: loathing

02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:49.680
[Amit Varma]: where I'm

02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:50.680
[Amit Varma]: hating on

02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:51.680
[Amit Varma]: myself

02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:52.680
[Amit Varma]: for having

02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:53.680
[Amit Varma]: an amazing

02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.680
[Amit Varma]: guest but

02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.680
[Amit Varma]: not enough

02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:56.680
[Amit Varma]: time to

02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:57.680
[Amit Varma]: do justice

02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:58.680
[Amit Varma]: to her

02:42:58.680 --> 02:42:59.680

[Amit Varma]: journey

02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:17.680
[Guest]: going to

02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:18.680

02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:19.680
[Guest]: this

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:20.680

[Guest]: right

02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:22.680
[Guest]: now

[Guest]: to

02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:43.680
[Guest]: start

02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:45.680
[Guest]: this

02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:46.680
[Guest]: journey

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:47.680
[Guest]: right

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:48.680
[Guest]: now

02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:49.680
[Guest]: and

02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:50.680
[Guest]: I'm

02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:51.680
[Guest]: going

02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:52.680
[Guest]: to

02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:53.680
[Guest]: start

02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:54.680
[Guest]: this

02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:55.680
[Guest]: journey

02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:56.680
[Guest]: right

02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:02.920
[Guest]: Indian sexual lives. As soon as we started, however, it kind of blew up for us because

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:05.880
[Guest]: people started writing saying, I also want to write a story, and I have an experience I want

02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:10.360
[Guest]: to share, and I also want to be an agent of Ishq. And so now it has become actually a very co-created

02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.920
[Guest]: kind of space where we make some things, but a lot of user-generated materials on the site

02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:19.800
[Guest]: where people send in their narratives. We work with a huge number of really talented illustrators

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:23.480
[Guest]: and more and more keep getting added because people just write to us saying, I love your

02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:28.520
[Guest]: stuff, and I also want to draw for you. So I think now Agents of Ishq has become that kind

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:33.640
[Guest]: of a community space where people are talking about sex and love in a very open, honest,

02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:37.640
[Guest]: and thoughtful way. If you haven't seen it, please check it out, folks who are listening.

02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Agentsofishq.com, the link, of course, will be on the show notes.

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:45.640
[Guest]: Yes. And also, I think one of the things we've done is a lot of cutting-edge work on consent,

02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:50.040
[Guest]: like cutting edge in the world, because we made this Lavani about consent, which is, first of all,

02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.440
[Guest]: very entertaining and awesome, but also because it said that consent is not just about the binary of

02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:59.640
[Guest]: yes and no, but it's about yes, no, and maybe. And I do think that the maybe space is very important

02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:06.120
[Guest]: generally as a feminist, because the idea that somebody will take time to decide is the most

02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:09.880
[Amit Varma]: fearful thing for us all. In fact, one very evocative phrase I learned from you was a

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.120
[Guest]: garden of consent. Yes, the garden of consent.

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Which is a space where everything is fluid. It's not necessarily a yes or a no. And you've even,

02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:22.200
[Amit Varma]: in a separate place, spoken about relationships and dating, for example, as more of an exploration.

02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So it's not a goal-oriented thing, by end of first date, I must get to this base or that base.

02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:30.120
[Amit Varma]: But you have to think of it as an open-ended exploration, which,

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.920
[Guest]: and there are so many modern anxieties. I mean, there'll be many people who'll

02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:38.040
[Guest]: have the experience on Tinder of somebody not wanting to meet them unless sex is guaranteed.

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:43.880
[Guest]: And I have often said to such people that, you know, you may be worried whether I will sleep

02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.160
[Guest]: with you or not, but how do you know you will want to sleep with me when you meet me? I mean,

02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.160
[Guest]: it's a question not only about what you're getting from the other person, but thinking about what you

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:55.640
[Guest]: really want, which I think people don't do because they're so anxious about achieving that goal.

02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.880
[Guest]: And there's a fantastic piece on agents of ish written by an Indian woman of Caribbean origin

02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.560
[Guest]: called Flirting Without Agendas. And it's about appreciating each other,

02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:07.480
[Guest]: not about flirting in order to get something, which is what you're saying the goal.

02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:12.040
[Guest]: So I think like there are all of these very beautiful ideas that conform more to the way

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:16.360
[Guest]: that we actually wish to live life, if we may or may not always be living it that way,

02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:22.680
[Guest]: that I think makes it also, it's an important project, I think, because it dares to say many

02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:27.480
[Guest]: things that people feel, but are scared to say out loud. And it could not have been done without

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:31.640
[Guest]: the very strong feminist grounding that it has, right? So it centers the experience of women

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:36.120
[Guest]: and queer people first. Men are not the center of the conversation. Their experiences are not

02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:40.600
[Guest]: what drives the idea of what is liberation. Liberation is different for each person is

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:45.960
[Guest]: what we believe. And everybody's ability and possibility to define their own sexual journeys

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:50.680
[Guest]: is what qualifies as liberation. If you really, really feel you are monogamous, then you are

02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:55.400
[Guest]: liberated if you live that life. And if you're really and truly polyamorous, you're liberated

02:46:55.400 --> 02:47:00.520
[Guest]: if you can live that life, right? So there's no one liberation. I Love Latika is a project that I

02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:08.520
[Guest]: did purely for pleasure and joy for myself. It's a digital interactive project where there is vine

02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:14.040
[Guest]: with many, many different kinds of flowers and fruits. Many are not realistic. And when you

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:19.800
[Guest]: click on it, on any fruit, it opens, either it becomes a flower or it starts like oozing pulp

02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:25.560
[Guest]: and many erotic things like that. And it plays a poem, an audio clip of a poem, which is an erotic

02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:31.400
[Guest]: poem from an old one, a new one from different places in the world. So it's actually just that.

02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:37.480
[Guest]: It's like a little room surrounded by a diaphanous curtain that you go into and you just look at all

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:45.080
[Guest]: these gorgeous and surreal flora and fauna and listen to erotic poems. And while watching people

02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:50.520
[Guest]: play with the Love Latika, I felt very much that people love poetry. They don't know they love it

02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:56.200
[Guest]: sometimes, but poetry should be read out and spoken so that people can develop a personal

02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:00.920
[Guest]: relationship with it. It shouldn't only be in books, so it also should be in books. And also

02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:06.440
[Guest]: that actually people, when reconnected with their erotic selves, become at home with themselves.

02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:10.760
[Guest]: I really felt what you said at the beginning of our conversation, that people always think about

02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:16.760
[Guest]: other people looking at them. So we never see anybody in a state of repose. Where they're

02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.920
[Guest]: comfortable in their own skin. Yeah, at home with themselves, right? It's very rare. Everybody's

02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:24.520
[Guest]: very conscious of being looked at today, even if it's only because they're taking selfies all the

02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:29.720
[Guest]: time. But suddenly I saw people just immersed in themselves and it was beautiful. And some people

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.720
[Guest]: said I felt very vulnerable while being there. So that was all very delightful. Yeah.

02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.280
[Amit Varma]: This is a moment, Paromita, when I am going to acknowledge my privilege because it's a great

02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:42.920
[Amit Varma]: privilege talking to you. I mean, I've got so many insights and so much wisdom and so much to think

02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:45.240
[Guest]: about from this conversation. Thank you for coming on the show.

02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:47.800
