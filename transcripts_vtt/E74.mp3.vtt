00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.360
[Amit Varma]: I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: take a shot at answering all these questions and many more.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.280
[Amit Varma]: I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
[Amit Varma]: action.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I speak to experts on economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and constitutional

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.640
[Amit Varma]: law so that their insights can blow not only my mind but also yours.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.720
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen releases every Monday.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So do check out the archives and follow the show at sceneunseen.in.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.400
[Amit Varma]: You can also subscribe to The Scene and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to prefer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And now let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.760
[Amit Varma]: I was passing by a football stadium the other day and I saw that there was a giant party

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760
[Amit Varma]: going on inside.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.280
[Amit Varma]: There was loud music and the aroma of delicious food.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280
[Amit Varma]: I decided to gatecrash the party.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I sneaked in and I found that there were hundreds of people, mostly pot-bellied men, dancing

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.920
[Amit Varma]: wildly, shooting guns in the air, hugging each other and shouting, Modi ji zindabad,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.520
[Amit Varma]: Modi ji zindabad.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.220
[Amit Varma]: There was a giant picture of Narendra Modi on one wall with garlands around it.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.480
[Amit Varma]: The sound system blared out loud bhajans with a disco beat.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.400
[Amit Varma]: I stopped one gentleman who had an open bottle of Old Monk in his hand and asked him why

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.760
[Amit Varma]: he was celebrating.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.880
[Amit Varma]: He told me, because achche din are here, Modi ji has brought us achche din.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.920
[Amit Varma]: And at this, the crowd started chanting, achche din, achche din, achche din.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.480
[Amit Varma]: Wait a minute, I asked the guy, you surely don't believe in that achche din nonsense,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480
[Amit Varma]: do you?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600
[Amit Varma]: We know now that those were empty promises.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.880
[Amit Varma]: The man turned to me with a beat-fixed smile.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880
[Amit Varma]: They weren't empty promises for us, he said.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.140
[Amit Varma]: In fact, our dins could not be any more achche.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.640
[Amit Varma]: You see, we are chartered accountants.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.800
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, I'm going to be talking about the GST, the goods and services tax.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Of the Modi government's big economic measures, most people now agree that demonetization

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.040
[Amit Varma]: was a huge failure, if not an outright humanitarian disaster.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.400
[Amit Varma]: I call it the largest assault on property rights in the history of humanity.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.200
[Amit Varma]: But on GST, opinion is mixed.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.040
[Amit Varma]: People like the idea of a good and simple tax, as it is sometimes called.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.280
[Amit Varma]: And I must say that the idea behind the tax appeals to me as well.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.880
[Amit Varma]: But is it really a good and simple tax?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.440
[Amit Varma]: Most critics say that the implementation of GST was badly flawed, and argue only about

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.920
[Amit Varma]: the extent of that.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.160
[Amit Varma]: Well, to discuss the GST with me, I've invited my good friend Shruti Rajagopalan, who teaches

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.880
[Amit Varma]: economics at Purchase College in the State University of New York.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.480
[Amit Varma]: A quick disclaimer, my conversation with her was recorded on Skype, so I apologize in advance

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.160
[Amit Varma]: if the sound quality drops in parts.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.280
[Amit Varma]: But before we go there, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.800
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.680

[Amit Varma]: Shruti, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Amit.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, I've started this new tradition on my shows of just chatting with my guests and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.320
[Amit Varma]: asking them a few personal questions, so the listeners can get to know them a little better.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.480
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, one presumes that listeners knows them as well as I may, and we go straight

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440
[Amit Varma]: on to the dry technical stuff.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.880
[Amit Varma]: So you're an economist and a lawyer.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.640
[Guest]: How did you land up here?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.800
[Guest]: Because I have made many, many, many mistakes in my life.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.200
[Guest]: No, I studied economics at the undergrad level at Delhi University, which was great fun.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.280
[Guest]: I always thought I would end up being a lawyer and ended up going to Delhi University to

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.920
[Guest]: the Faculty of Law to get a law degree.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.800
[Guest]: And about a semester or a semester and a half into it, I really didn't enjoy the course

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.920
[Guest]: at all.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.360
[Guest]: I loved studying the law, but I was quite certain I won't enjoy the practice.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.680
[Guest]: And as I did more legal research, I figured that at the core of it, I'm, I'm an economist.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.220
[Guest]: So I don't think in normative terms, I really think in positive terms as an analytical framework.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.240
[Guest]: So even though I loved studying law, law doesn't come with its own analytical framework, right?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Can you explain that in simple language, not thinking in normative terms and thinking in

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840
[Guest]: analytical terms?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.280
[Guest]: So you can basically make arguments on either side when you have a legal case.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.000
[Guest]: And this is not to say that, you know, every argument is equally valid, right?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.200
[Guest]: So it depends on what kind of structure you have, what is the style of argumentation?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.400
[Guest]: What is the standard in each particular legal system?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.000
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, you don't get an answer like, you know, if you ask me, Shruti,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.720
[Guest]: I'm thinking of taking a walk out of the window on the third floor, what do you think is going

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.880
[Guest]: to happen?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.720
[Guest]: We all know what's going to happen, you're going to fall down, right?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.080
[Guest]: Similarly, economics gives you a very, very clean analytical framework, right?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.360
[Guest]: This is the law of opportunity cost, the law of scarcity, right?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.920
[Guest]: All positive analysis is strongly rooted in these ideas.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.320
[Guest]: And if you ask like the window question, what happens when the price of onions goes up?

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.800
[Guest]: A simple answer is the quantity demanded of onions goes down.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.240
[Guest]: So economics gives you a very clean, positive framework.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.080
[Guest]: Now, you may not like the answer that the quantity demanded of the onions went down,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080
[Guest]: right?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.200
[Guest]: You may not like the outcome.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.960
[Guest]: But it gives you a very clean way to think about the world, right?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.040
[Guest]: How does how do people in the world behave when they confront scarcity?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.840
[Guest]: And when they have certain incentives provided by the institutional structure?

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.160
[Guest]: So I found this very missing in law.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.120
[Guest]: In law, people make legal decisions and create legal policy as if they were not to be implemented

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.960
[Guest]: by humans, right?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.960
[Guest]: As if these these policies are going to be implemented by an omniscient, benevolent,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.880
[Guest]: all knowing, just, fair, mythical creature.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.240
[Guest]: So that part of the law really bothered me.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.880
[Guest]: And so I decided that the correct field for me is really law and economics, which allows

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.080
[Guest]: me to look at legal structures, which I'm fascinated by.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.080
[Guest]: But the analytical framework comes from economics, all the assumptions that you make about the

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.920
[Guest]: world come from the discipline of economics, so simple assumptions, like, we analyze people

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.320
[Guest]: at the individual level, not at the organizational or the structural level, right?

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.760
[Guest]: That individuals are self interested, and they respond to incentives, and that we live

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.680
[Guest]: in a world of scarcity.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.760
[Guest]: So if you start with these basic assumptions, you would be surprised how quickly you can

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: get insight into how complex systems work, which is the entire discipline of law and

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
[Guest]: economics.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.120
[Guest]: So that really fascinated me.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.480
[Guest]: Then I decided, you know, I will go into law and economics.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.760
[Guest]: And I eventually ended up getting my PhD in economics.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.360
[Guest]: I was very interested in some sub fields.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.240
[Guest]: One of them is constitutional economics.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: And the other is public choice.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.200
[Guest]: So I went to George Mason University, where, at the time, James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.040
[Guest]: you know, sort of the, the really, the people who were there at the foundation of these

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.960
[Guest]: disciplines were teaching there, and their students and their tradition.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.400
[Guest]: So I went to George Mason to study this stuff, and eventually, just just fell in love with

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.400
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And can you sort of tell our listeners a little bit more about what is constitutional economics?

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.960
[Amit Varma]: And what is it like, what do you study when you do that?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.480
[Amit Varma]: And what is public choice theory?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.500
[Guest]: So constitutional economics is just what I was telling about law and economics, but specifically

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.320
[Guest]: for constitutional rules, there are two parts to it.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.600
[Guest]: One is sort of like, think of it as a sort of thought experiment.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.600
[Guest]: If five people got together, and their end goal was x, what kind of rules are they likely

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.320
[Guest]: to design to get x?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.760
[Guest]: Okay, so this could be you play poker, it could be at the level of poker or parlor games,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760
[Guest]: right?

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.240
[Guest]: Or it could be at the level of what should be the individual rights framework in a system.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.520
[Guest]: So when a good example of constitutional economics is something like analyzing the difference

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.560
[Guest]: between presidential and parliamentary systems, right, this is at the constitutional level.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.360
[Guest]: If you were framing a constitution today, how would you frame it?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.720
[Guest]: Would you go for a presidential system?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.240
[Guest]: Or would you go for a parliamentary system, and that depends on what the individual framers

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.680
[Guest]: have in mind as their end goals, right?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.480
[Guest]: So some people believe that power is very much concentrated in the executive, in a presidential

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
[Guest]: system.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.480
[Guest]: So people who are worried about that kind of concentration of power or interest group

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.980
[Guest]: capture might prefer a parliamentary system, right?

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.640
[Guest]: Some people believe in a parliamentary system, there's too much churn, there's too much law

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.000
[Guest]: ruling, because there's no, doesn't produce like a clear victor, right?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.960
[Guest]: So people who are worried about those concerns prefer a presidential system.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.240
[Guest]: So it really depends on who are the people coming together to form the rules, and what

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.120
[Guest]: are their end goals with respect to those rules.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.240
[Guest]: So that's one.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.840
[Guest]: The other part of it is what are the consequences of these rules, right?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.080
[Guest]: And we've done a couple of episodes on this.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.600
[Guest]: What are the consequences of, for instance, the eminent domain provision or the lack of

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.020
[Guest]: it in the current Indian constitution, right?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:05.040
[Guest]: So when you have weak constitutional rules, how do individuals respond to that system?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.200
[Guest]: And what are the good or bad or terrible consequences that take place?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.920
[Guest]: We did something similar on constitutionalizing caste, where we talked about what are the

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.760
[Guest]: incentives for people of all different castes to hold on to their caste identity or to let

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.280
[Guest]: it go in a market system vis-a-vis a reservation system.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.480
[Guest]: So these are some basic things.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480
[Guest]: I mean, this is these are some basic examples of, you know, work that can be done in constitutional

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.560
[Amit Varma]: economics.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.920
[Guest]: And what about public choice?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.080
[Guest]: Public choice is much broader than this.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.720
[Guest]: It is basically the analysis of political decision making.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.680
[Guest]: So it's the economic analysis or the positive analysis of political decision making.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.280
[Guest]: So we go back to the assumption that we were talking about a moment ago, which is we assume,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.560
[Guest]: you know, about 50 years ago or 70 years ago in political theory, people would say the

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.040
[Guest]: executive branch believes this, the judicial branch believes this, right?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.240
[Guest]: So it's done very much as if the judicial branch is like this, you know, vague structural

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.680
[Guest]: thing, which is a different entity, not exactly made up of individuals.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.360
[Guest]: So the first thing public choice did is break it down to the individual decision making

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360
[Guest]: unit.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360
[Guest]: Right.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.560
[Guest]: So break it down to what are the incentives of a Supreme Court judge within the judicial

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.560
[Guest]: system, of a high court judge, of a judicial clerk, right?

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.440
[Guest]: So at each level, you can break it down to what are the incentives of the actors acting

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.440
[Guest]: within the judiciary.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:48.440
[Guest]: The second part of it was in terms of political decision making, the attention shifted from

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.520
[Guest]: intentions to incentives.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.760
[Guest]: So while we like to assume that everyone in office is very well meaning, what are actually

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.160
[Guest]: the incentives that these individuals confront in their daily work?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.840
[Guest]: So you have written a fair bit about this, about how bureaucrats are really interested

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.320
[Guest]: in sort of protecting their turf and increasing their budgets and increasing their authority

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320
[Guest]: within a system.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.320
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.740
[Guest]: So Gordon Tullock's bureaucracy was a foundational work in this realm.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.480
[Guest]: So these are sort of some of the things in public choice.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.240
[Guest]: The other aspect of public choice is voting theory.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.280
[Guest]: So earlier, the idea was that people are self-interested when they go to buy apples or oranges.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.480
[Guest]: But when they go to the voting booths, they suddenly become these very benevolent public

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.920
[Guest]: spirited creatures.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.360
[Guest]: And public choice introduced the idea that that's not true.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.760
[Guest]: You are the exact same individual who responds to incentives in the same way, whether you're

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.960
[Guest]: buying apples or whether you're going to vote in a voting booth.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:56.520
[Guest]: So that brings up all sorts of issues, which is, are the incentives in the political decision

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.640
[Guest]: making framework as robust as the incentives within market decision making or within a

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.120
[Guest]: firm or within a family?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.520
[Guest]: How do you think about voting identity within a collective?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.520
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.440
[Guest]: How do you think about voting in a primary system versus the final system?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.440
[Guest]: So just lots of voting theory questions were answered by public choice.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.080
[Guest]: In India, the most relevant would be we have a system called the first past the post.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.160
[Guest]: So whoever crosses the finish line first gets the parliamentary seat or gets the any legislative

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.320
[Guest]: seat.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.240
[Guest]: And that number need not be 51 percent.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:43.480
[Guest]: So imagine a highly fractionalized constituency where you have about seven or eight main contenders.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:50.800
[Guest]: We have a number of constituencies where the victor has received only about 25 percent

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.080
[Guest]: of the vote, sometimes 10 percent of the vote.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.120
[Guest]: And this is 10 percent of the 46 percent who showed up to vote of the adult population,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.960
[Guest]: which is allowed to vote.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.760
[Guest]: So really a fraction of the people can help someone win a parliamentary seat.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760
[Guest]: Right.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.960
[Guest]: So in the case of, you know, the UPA versus the NDA outcome of the last election, if you

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.880
[Guest]: notice their vote shares aren't that far apart.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880
[Guest]: Right.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.720
[Guest]: But, you know, under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, they barely got about 44 seats and

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.440
[Guest]: NDA managed to cross the finish line.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's interesting that in the 2014 national elections, BJP got pretty much the

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:38.360
[Amit Varma]: same vote share that they did in the subsequent Delhi election, where they only got 8 on 9

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.360
[Guest]: seats.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, how, how much of a difference those dynamics make?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.000
[Guest]: And much of this is about first past the post system.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.160
[Guest]: It is about how the constituency lines are drawn, right, how population is changing,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.480
[Guest]: how identities are changing, because we vote very much along the lines of religious linguistic

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.320
[Guest]: caste identities in India.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: So there is like just a tremendously rich literature in public choice talking about

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.480
[Guest]: these questions, you know, which which people can write about with respect to India also.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And not enough people in India know about it or write about it.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.440
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I keep saying that, you know, public choice theory is not like

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.000
[Amit Varma]: some arcane branch of economics, but it's something that should be essential knowledge

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.760
[Amit Varma]: for every Indian.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Because at its core, it's, you know, economics at its core is a study of human behavior.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And what public choice theory teaches you is that government is not some mythical benevolent

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.840
[Amit Varma]: beast that we have built up, which, you know, acts in a particular way, but it's composed

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.720
[Amit Varma]: of individuals at various different levels who have various different kinds of incentives

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.000
[Amit Varma]: available to them.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.960
[Amit Varma]: And they act according to those incentives, which is why, as I like to say, not every

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.840
[Amit Varma]: politician is a bad person.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.360
[Amit Varma]: But it is safe to assume that every politician is corrupt, because power corrupts.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.600
[Amit Varma]: But that's that's a subject for another episode entirely.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.240
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, we should do an episode on public choice sometime.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.240
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.620
[Amit Varma]: But let's get to the subject at hand, which is GST.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Now I've done two episodes in GST before this one with Devangshu Dutta, one with my frequent

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.760
[Amit Varma]: guest and our mutual friend Vivek Kaul.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:18.040
[Amit Varma]: With Devangshu I've done an episode before GST where he kind of spoke about how the concept

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.840
[Amit Varma]: of GST is great, but he is worried that the implementation will be flawed in exactly the

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.840
[Amit Varma]: ways that it turned out to be, you know, too many categories and too many exemptions.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And instead of being a good and simple tax, it's just one mindlessly complex beast that

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.880
[Amit Varma]: might even make things worse.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.800
[Amit Varma]: And Vivek pointed out concrete examples of some of this, for example, bringing up the

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.760
[Amit Varma]: point of whether KitKat is a chocolate or a biscuit.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And when you have so many categories and exemptions, you just raise the cost of doing business

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.560
[Amit Varma]: instead of bringing it down.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.320
[Amit Varma]: You might reduce friction in some areas, such as you know, different interstate taxes when

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.600
[Amit Varma]: a good crosses borders or whatever.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.520
[Amit Varma]: But you actually increase the complexities in some other ways.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I asked you to come on the show and talk about GST is that you did this

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.160
[Amit Varma]: excellent column from Mint called Simple Rules for a Complex World, which borrows this title

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.240
[Amit Varma]: from a book by Richard Epstein, which you refer to.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.360
[Amit Varma]: And I wanted you to elaborate on that a little bit, because that really lays bare very well

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.840
[Amit Varma]: what some of the problems with our current GST are.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.600
[Guest]: OK, so I'll start with the idea of the title and then expand on to GST.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.400
[Guest]: So Richard Epstein's book, and he gets his intuition originally from Frederick Hayek,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.680
[Guest]: is that as the level of complexity increases in society and the economy, what we actually

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.400
[Guest]: need are simpler rules to help us navigate through the very complex choices.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400
[Guest]: Right.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.560
[Guest]: So there are two ways people think about something.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.800
[Guest]: They think as the level of complexity increases, they should have more rules, more regulations,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:58.360
[Guest]: more sub regulations that adapt to that very specific situation and so on and so forth.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.680
[Guest]: And Richard Epstein, following Hayek, said not really, actually, because the level of

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.000
[Guest]: complexity in the economy is so high, it is almost impossible to make rules for that level

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.800
[Guest]: of complexity.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.800
[Guest]: So what we end up doing is somewhat, you know, some mid-level of complexity of regulation,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.880
[Guest]: which really hampers individual behavior, sets up poor incentives, makes it very difficult

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.440
[Guest]: to comply with that regulatory framework.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.640
[Guest]: So what we need is very, very simple, bright-lined rules, which are easy to understand, easy

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:37.440
[Guest]: to navigate, easy to resolve disputes over, so that people can actually go about spending

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.080
[Guest]: their time navigating the wonderful complex economy and the world we live in.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.760
[Guest]: So that's the idea of the book.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.640
[Guest]: Now coming to GST, I really enjoyed the episodes by Devanshu and Vivek.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:56.600
[Guest]: And I think my intuition about how GST has played out is very much in line with theirs.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.280
[Guest]: So just to give our readers some background, GST was supposed to be, I mean, when it was

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.000
[Guest]: originally announced, they said, you know, one country, one tax, right?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.600
[Guest]: That was the idea.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.920
[Guest]: And the reason that was the idea was India is a federal system.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.520
[Guest]: Every state and union territory had its own set of state taxes across different kinds

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.160
[Guest]: of goods and services.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:25.480
[Guest]: And one major problem in India was when you had interstate trade, that is, you know, if

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.400
[Guest]: you wanted to sell something that was produced in Maharashtra and take it to Gujarat and

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.760
[Guest]: sell it there, you would get stopped at all these different checkposts, right?

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.880
[Guest]: And the purpose of these checkposts was to pay for the differential in taxes between

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.400
[Guest]: those two states.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.320
[Guest]: So the idea was we unify the entire country under one tax system, and this way you have

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.240
[Guest]: far better seamless movement of goods and services.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.280
[Guest]: So in that sense, this idea was just a fantastic idea, because, you know, you've written about

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:02.120
[Guest]: this and many people have done studies on, you know, it takes 45 days to cross from West

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.680
[Guest]: Bengal to Gujarat in a truck full of, you know, goods, which basically means all your

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.600
[Guest]: perishables are destroyed, which means farmers can never really get a single unified market

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.040
[Guest]: and actually get a better price for their goods.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:21.280
[Amit Varma]: So there were a lot of problems for the regular guy, as in, if I may interject, there's a

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.320
[Amit Varma]: funny illustration of which this which comes to mind, which I think Mihir Sharma mentioned

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.720
[Amit Varma]: in his book, Restart, which is I forget the two cities involved.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.080
[Amit Varma]: But if you want to shift goods from Madras to Bangalore, Chennai to Bangalore or Chennai

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.240
[Amit Varma]: to Hyderabad, I forget which exact cities there are two of those three, then it's cheaper

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.040
[Amit Varma]: to do it via Paris indirectly.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.480
[Guest]: I'm not surprised.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.560
[Guest]: And you know, and that's mind boggling, it is mind boggling, because basically what that

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.440
[Guest]: means is the checkpoint is placing a very high compliance cost, or the differential

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.560
[Guest]: rates are so high, you'd rather go abroad, pay customs duty and bring it in.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the ports functions better.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.600
[Amit Varma]: It's more a function of the delays plus the bribes.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.600
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.760
[Guest]: So now, here there is, you know, I mean, Mihir makes very, very clever points.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.600
[Guest]: And I don't know if he was hinting at this kind of regulatory arbitrage, which is, you

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.960
[Guest]: know, it's easier to bribe the customs official, they're cheaper than the guy at the interstate

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.200
[Guest]: checkpoint could be.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.440
[Guest]: But you're absolutely right.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.240
[Guest]: I mean, these are the sorts of problems.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.200
[Guest]: And now, imagine this not for, you know, a move between two cities is a one time thing,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.600
[Guest]: maybe you move once a decade, right?

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.320
[Guest]: We're talking about this happening for farmers, for small manufacturers on a daily level.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.320
[Guest]: Right?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.200
[Guest]: Imagine what a pain in the ass it is for people who are producing perishables for people who

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.520
[Guest]: are in dairy business, right?

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.920
[Guest]: If you can't get your goods across the border quickly, exactly.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.080
[Guest]: So basically, India was a highly fragmented market.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.080
[Guest]: So you know, kudos to the various governments in the past who tried to do this, and to this

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.960
[Guest]: government, which finally managed to execute it.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.080
[Guest]: And in all fairness, the moment the GST was announced, you know, about 20 states or 22

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.200
[Guest]: states immediately lifted their border checkpoints, which was quite a remarkable result.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.440
[Guest]: And I'm not saying corruption went away overnight, but I'm saying a system that had posed so

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.840
[Guest]: many problems, it could be solved with this one short tax system, which is quite fascinating.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:24.560
[Guest]: Now having said that, the beauty of a GST system lies not just in its ability to unify

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.240
[Guest]: a territory under one umbrella, but also the way we would judge any other tax system, which

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.280
[Guest]: is, you know, is it simple?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280
[Guest]: Is it fair?

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.000
[Guest]: Is it efficient?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.880
[Guest]: And on these margins, as you have discussed with Vivek, and as Didi's intuition was correct,

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.420
[Guest]: the GST fails quite badly.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:49.200
[Guest]: So just to give you a sense of what is happening today with the GST, India has five different

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:56.400
[Guest]: GST rates, 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, right?

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.640
[Guest]: And that is just big categories.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.940
[Guest]: Now in addition to those rates, you can have a cess.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.160
[Guest]: So we have a cess on entertainment.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.520
[Guest]: We have a cess on luxury goods in some states.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:12.320
[Guest]: We have a cess on petrol and diesel, in addition to this GST rate that is imposed on them.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.960
[Guest]: In addition to that, there are some goods which are getting special rates, hint hint

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.580
[Guest]: Gujarat, right?

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:25.320
[Guest]: So gold is taxed at 3% GST, precious gemstones at 0.25% GST, right?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:31.120
[Guest]: So you have a system where even though it might be an improvement over the previous

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.520
[Guest]: system from a jurisdiction point of view, that is, you know, you unified the country

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.520
[Guest]: under one tax system, what you've essentially done is you have lots and lots of rates and

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520
[Guest]: classifications.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:48.280
[Guest]: And as would be the case in any tax system, which is moving from one kind of tax system

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.640
[Guest]: to another, there is a lot of confusion over what is the GST rate to be levied on a particular

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640
[Amit Varma]: good.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.640
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, before you move on, I'll just put these five rates into perspective.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.960
[Amit Varma]: In your article itself, which by the way, for the benefit of the listeners will be linked

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.000
[Amit Varma]: at the bottom of the podcast, according to your article, you cite the World Bank India

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.460
[Amit Varma]: Development Update 2018.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And you say that of the 115 countries with GST, 40 countries use a single rate, just

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.040
[Amit Varma]: one tax instead of these five, and 28 countries use two rates.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And we are in the company of Italy, Ghana, Pakistan and Luxembourg as the only countries

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.480
[Amit Varma]: with four or more rates.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:34.800
[Guest]: And you can imagine, I mean, other than Luxembourg, which can also be a regulatory nightmare,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.400
[Guest]: I am guessing you don't have any positive things to say about the economy of the other

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: three.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Right, right.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.640
[Guest]: So it's what we have chosen is in the spectrum of global GST frameworks, we have chosen the

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.640
[Guest]: most complex.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.240
[Guest]: Now, the defenders of the government say we didn't exactly choose it.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.360
[Guest]: This is how, you know, this is how the chips landed, because you had to make all these

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.400
[Guest]: deals and persuade all these different states to come under the umbrella.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.720
[Guest]: And I can appreciate that there is a complex negotiation at play.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.960
[Guest]: But having said that, the system we have today is just too complex.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:13.680
[Guest]: So, you know, Vivek's example of the, is KitKat a biscuit or a chocolate?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:19.600
[Guest]: It sounds cute and funny, but at the core of it, there's a really, really big problem,

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.400
[Guest]: which is, let's say we figure this out for KitKat.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.200
[Guest]: What about the next good and the next good after that?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:34.760
[Guest]: So I had a few examples in the article, which is things like, is Pepsi, Nimbu's pulp, right?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.560
[Guest]: Or is it categorized, pulp is categorized at a different level, 12% from fruit juice.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.720
[Guest]: 12% from fruit juice, which is categorized at a different 28%, 28%.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.800
[Guest]: And there's a big difference between 28% and 12% in terms of what a seller would want to

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.800
[Guest]: pay.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.760
[Guest]: Now, there are additional everyday problems related to this, which is things like every

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.880
[Guest]: single person.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.280
[Guest]: So the assumption is normally we raise this dispute, the GST council announces the rate

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.880
[Guest]: and then magically that information is just transmitted to everyone and everyone knows

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.080
[Guest]: it.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.520
[Guest]: But that's not true, right?

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.840
[Guest]: How many people are selling Pepsi in India, right?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.560
[Guest]: What is their level of information about the tax system?

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.400
[Guest]: How many of them have the time to go to the GST council website every day, check the notifications?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.880
[Guest]: So in the absence of this, what do they need to do?

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.680
[Guest]: They need to hire a lawyer or a chartered accountant who needs to go over every single

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.600
[Guest]: thing that they are selling or every single input that they are buying and help them work

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600
[Guest]: through this maze.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.800
[Guest]: That has become incredibly complex.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And you illustrated the complexity with one superb sentence in your piece, which I remember

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440
[Amit Varma]: quoting on Twitter.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440
[Amit Varma]: I was so struck by it.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Quote, one year into the GST regime, the HSN code book for GST classification contains

00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.640
[Amit Varma]: 18,306 entries and 438 pages, close quote.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640
[Guest]: Yes.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:08.160
[Guest]: So I have to put this quote in perspective, the HSN nomenclature is basically a nomenclature

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.480
[Guest]: that has been used for a very long time in India, both for, you know, all sorts of custom

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.600
[Guest]: duties and tariffs.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.440
[Guest]: And remember, every state was levying its own taxes, right?

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.300
[Guest]: So it's not like you didn't need a nomenclature before.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.920
[Guest]: So we've always had one, it used to be a six digit nomenclature for a very long time.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.560
[Guest]: Now it's an eight digit one.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.200
[Guest]: So the complexity and the subcategory problems have increased.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200
[Guest]: Okay.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.600
[Guest]: And some of this is introduced by the fact that, you know, earlier, you had kind of learned

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.640
[Guest]: or figured out the state tax system.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.740
[Guest]: And now most businessmen are learning a whole new tax system, which is never easy.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740
[Guest]: It's always hard.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.720
[Guest]: I have moved countries and I can tell you how painful it is to figure out the tax system

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.460
[Guest]: in each new jurisdiction.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.320
[Guest]: So there is a painful transition process.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:59.160
[Guest]: And having said all of that, imagine if you are just a regular kirana store owner, right?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:06.400
[Guest]: Who is selling, let's say, somewhere between 75 to 100 different types of products, right?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: You're selling everything from safety pins and chewing gums, to Pepsi, to bread, to,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.840
[Guest]: you know, your typical small kirana shop.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.560
[Guest]: This person, in addition to running a kirana shop, which is not exactly easy anywhere in

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:25.040
[Guest]: India, has to figure out the correct rate for each of these things, and has to backwards

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.640
[Guest]: and forwards comply, and has to file taxes every month.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.560
[Amit Varma]: And the inevitable consequence of this is that he becomes a hostage to the Inspector

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560
[Guest]: Raj.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.840
[Guest]: So either you're hostage to Inspector Raj, or you're hostage to the CA lawyer mafia,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840
[Guest]: right?

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840
[Guest]: Which the kirana guy probably can't afford.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840
[Guest]: So, I mean, there you go.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.560
[Guest]: Which the kirana guy either can't afford, or you know, you get a cheaper version or

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.400
[Guest]: someone in the family helps you out, but basically, it's like hiring one more person full time

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.240
[Guest]: for a kirana shop guy, just to figure it out.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.640
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, you live in Bombay, you've been to these kirana stores, right?

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.880
[Guest]: Let's assume the proprietor is well educated and understand the GST, has figured out, sat

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.600
[Guest]: with his chartered accountant and figured this out.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.800
[Guest]: That young boy who works there, who's 18-19 years old, and is barely literate, he also

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.980
[Guest]: needs to know what is the correct tax to levy, right?

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:22.280
[Guest]: So now imagine next time a kirana shop owner wants to employ someone, he can't just employ

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.320
[Guest]: some unskilled fellow, right?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:32.880
[Guest]: He needs to now have a higher level of education and skill to hand out, you know, Pepsi and

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.600
[Guest]: bread, because now there's a GST compliance issue.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.760
[Guest]: And customers ask, I have, you know, eaten at restaurants, where my dad has actually

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.040
[Guest]: asked people, what is this GST rate, why are we being taxed at this rate?

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.080
[Guest]: What is this?

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.840
[Guest]: People ask when they get a receipt, and they can't understand it.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.920
[Guest]: And they absolutely should.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920
[Guest]: And they should ask.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:59.120
[Guest]: So this is something that people, I think, people do understand, because the average

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.680
[Guest]: person is navigating this problem every day, the average businessman is really getting

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.760
[Guest]: battered by this kind of information and compliance requirement.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.160
[Guest]: But I think this idea is now only slowly penetrating to the governance system.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.320
[Guest]: I think now, people who are administering the GST system, they have begun to understand

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320
[Guest]: that this is a big problem.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.840
[Guest]: Now, let me tell you a couple of smaller things, which seems small, but very important.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:31.520
[Guest]: So you know, one example was this KitKat, a biscuit or is KitKat a chocolate, right?

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:37.080
[Guest]: Now, here is an example that actually went to the GST Council for clarification.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.600
[Guest]: Now, there are, you know, most offices have some kind of a food canteen or cafeteria,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600
[Guest]: right?

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.880
[Guest]: If you run a canteen, it is taxed at 5%.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.640
[Guest]: If you're using an outdoor caterer is 18%.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:55.680
[Guest]: The problem is, almost all the offices have a canteen, but the catering is done by a third

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680
[Guest]: party outside.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.640
[Guest]: Very few offices actually cook their own meal in house, right?

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.040
[Guest]: So this question actually went up to the GST Council, should it be taxed at 5% or 18%?

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.520
[Guest]: Now, multiply this, right?

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.440
[Guest]: Multiply this across all the categories, all that the GST Council is doing is releasing

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.440
[Guest]: a new notification every day on what is the correct classification.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.280
[Guest]: And now multiply this across, and you have a notification nightmare, right?

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.800
[Guest]: So this is ruled by notification.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.440
[Guest]: Every day, some new bit of information has to come out, and everyone has to know where

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.360
[Guest]: to look for that information and then adjust and pay that particular rate.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.200
[Guest]: So this has become a very big problem.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.680
[Guest]: Now there's a third part.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:48.440
[Guest]: Now let's say the GST Council says the correct rate is 5% not 18% or 18% not 5%.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.440
[Guest]: If someone disagrees with the classification, you take it to court, right?

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.880
[Guest]: And 13% difference in tax rate can mean a lot of money for some firms.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.280
[Guest]: So it's valuable for them to have a resolution to this question in the long run to save that

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.200
[Guest]: 13% in tax.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.280
[Guest]: Now you take it to a tax tribunal or worse, to the High Court and Supreme Court, and you

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:16.680
[Guest]: basically burden the judicial system by adding a whole set of disputes, which shouldn't exist

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.240
[Guest]: in the first place, right?

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.640
[Guest]: And for these reasons, I think the best way to go is to have a single rate.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.960
[Guest]: 40 countries have a single rate, they work pretty well.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.120
[Guest]: About 28 additional countries have two rates, which also work pretty well.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.680
[Guest]: So I think the first thing we need to do is, like I said, simple rules for a complex world,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.600
[Guest]: just collapse all these different rates to one single GST rate, right?

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.760
[Guest]: And for very basic goods for poor people, you can just say it's a zero rate.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.400
[Guest]: There is no GST levied on this.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.280
[Guest]: Everyone else will have a single GST rate that needs to be paid.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's the best way to go forward.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.200
[Amit Varma]: One GST rate to rule them all.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.240
[Amit Varma]: On that note, we'll take a quick break.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back, I want to raise a couple of the standard objections that people have

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.520
[Amit Varma]: to this one simple rate, and we'll continue the conversation.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.200
[Amit Varma]: A quick break coming up.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.160
[Unknown]: So it's been another great week at IBM podcast.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.440
[Unknown]: And if you aren't following us on social media, please make sure you do we're IBM podcast

[Unknown]: on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, all the major social media networks.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.320
[Unknown]: This week on the Pragati podcast, Pawan and Hamsini talk to economist Anupam Manohar about

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.400
[Unknown]: how India is tackling creating new jobs.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.040

[Unknown]: On Simplified in a Shorty, Shriketh, Chuck and Naren give interesting tidbits about the

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.920
[Unknown]: qualifying round of the 2018 World Cup.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.080
[Unknown]: On Cyrus Says This Week, Cyrus has a conversation with friend of the network Vivek Kaul about

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080

[Unknown]: On Keeping It Queer, Naveen talks to non-binary Instagram sensation Diane Rubello.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.280
[Unknown]: On Vartal Lab last week, Akash and Naveen exchanged some hilarious stories with Balraj

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.560
[Unknown]: Ghai, owner of the hotel Intercontinental and The Habitat.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.120
[Unknown]: And with that, let me get you on to your shows.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.640
[Amit Varma]: I am talking with Shruti Rajgopalan and she's just finished making a case for why we need

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:09.120
[Amit Varma]: simple rules for complex problems and our GST is mindlessly complicated instead of being

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.600
[Amit Varma]: the good and simple tax that it was hyped up to be.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.160
[Amit Varma]: And Shruti, before I continue, and I want to raise a couple of the standard objections

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.560
[Amit Varma]: people make to that, but before that, I just want to try and summarize your position and

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.800
[Amit Varma]: tell me if I missed anything.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Your position basically is that the complexity of the GST, where you have so many different

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:34.500
[Amit Varma]: rates for so many different categories, has the impact that compliance costs go up.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.880
[Amit Varma]: Compliance becomes extremely difficult and a lot of human labor of people in businesses

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and goes into figuring it out, or you hire CAs, which is a cost in itself.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And what this can do at the margins is that it can drive some businesses out of business

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.720
[Amit Varma]: entirely, and in other cases, it will just raise the cost of those businesses, therefore

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.640
[Amit Varma]: raising the cost for consumers as well, and therefore ending in what seems to be like

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.480
[Amit Varma]: a vicious circle or a negative sum game or whichever way you put it.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And to stop this negative ripple effect, where everybody suffers except for chartered accountants

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.560
[Amit Varma]: and lawyers, what you propose is that make it a good and simple tax, have one tax rate

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.240
[Amit Varma]: for everything, perhaps for certain goods have no tax rate at all, which are essential

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.640
[Amit Varma]: items for poor people, but otherwise just have one tax rate.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Have I summed it up correctly?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.080
[Guest]: And I just want to add one slightly broader point than the GST.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.320
[Guest]: We talked a lot about classification, right?

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.820
[Guest]: There are two ways to solve the classification nightmare.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.560
[Guest]: One is that the government just needs to classify things better, announce it better, and have

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.400
[Guest]: some mechanism by which people get this information quickly.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.600
[Guest]: So the compliance costs are reduced.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.920
[Guest]: That is one way of thinking.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.920
[Guest]: And there is a lot of focus on trying to make the government more efficient at it.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.200
[Guest]: The other way of thinking is the way you and I have been talking about, which is, let's

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:02.320
[Guest]: eliminate the need for a complex classification system in the first place, right?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.720
[Guest]: So if you collapse it to a single rate, everyone needs to pay the same rate, there is no need

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.960
[Guest]: for classification, you kill the complexity automatically, right?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.120
[Amit Varma]: So now the two sort of objections I want to raise are, to be clear, not my objections,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm entirely on board with you, but these are objections that came up on Twitter, after

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.920
[Amit Varma]: your excellent piece kind of went viral in a small way.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.420
[Amit Varma]: And I want to give you a chance to address these points that were made.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:34.520
[Amit Varma]: One point is that having multiple rates of GST is really not fair or progressive simply

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:42.360
[Amit Varma]: because to have the same rate for a small kirana store for small goods is not as you

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.160
[Amit Varma]: would for say, a guy who's buying a BMW is not fair.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Why shouldn't the guy buying the BMW pay more?

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.200
[Guest]: Well, so there are two parts to any kind of tax burden.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.280
[Guest]: One is actually the tax rate that is levied on the good, right, which is the 5% that you

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:04.080
[Guest]: have for certain goods in a kirana store versus 28% for luxury items and things like that.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.720
[Guest]: The second part of the tax burden is the compliance.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:14.720
[Guest]: And if you really think about it, the kirana store guy has a greater compliance burden

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.400
[Guest]: when there are lots of classifications versus the guy who's buying the BMW.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.600
[Guest]: Because he can probably afford a lawyer and a charted accountant, he probably has a few,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.600
[Guest]: right?

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.280
[Guest]: Same with this BMW showroom, they probably have an army of people helping them manage

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.600
[Guest]: the regulatory and the compliance requirements, whereas the small kirana store guy now has

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.240
[Guest]: this additional burden, right?

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: So what people are missing when they talk about progressive tax rates or a fair tax

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.440
[Guest]: rate for people who are using, you know, people of a certain income class who are selling

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.920
[Guest]: or consuming certain products versus people consuming luxury products is the classification

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:58.320
[Guest]: system imposes an enormous compliance burden, which by the way, doesn't fall equally on

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:05.560
[Guest]: everyone, it falls at a much greater proportion to the turnover on the little guy, right?

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.280
[Amit Varma]: So the point I'm making is, it's actually the other way around, it's a little guy who

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.280
[Amit Varma]: would benefit from a simple tax.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.640
[Guest]: So if you ask people, I mean, there are two demands being made, one that the tax rates

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640
[Guest]: are too high.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:23.080
[Guest]: And the second that it's too complex, virtually everyone is on board with simplifying the

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.760
[Guest]: tax system, including the little guy, then you can talk about, you know, when you have

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.040
[Guest]: a single rate, I think it's very important to have a debate about what that single rate

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040
[Guest]: should be.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.040
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.720
[Guest]: And I think the lower the better.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:42.400
[Guest]: So Singapore has a 7% GST, Australia has a 10% GST, we have some of the highest GST rates

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400
[Guest]: in the world.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.080
[Guest]: So ours need not be seven or 10%, right, we need, we need revenues to come in.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.240
[Guest]: So there is an argument to be made there that maybe that single rate can be a little bit

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.680
[Guest]: higher, it's not in single digits, maybe it's in the low to mid teens.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.320
[Guest]: But this, this argument that you know, the kirana guy is being treated unfairly because

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.240
[Guest]: by collapsing to a single rate, my answer is just the kirana guy is being treated unfairly

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.700
[Guest]: when you have multiplication of classification and complexity in rates also.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.040
[Guest]: So I don't think you're helping that.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the compliance costs are hitting the poor, the much more and therefore you want

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.440
[Amit Varma]: to reduce the compliance costs and what the single rate should be is not an argument you're

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.440
[Amit Varma]: making right now.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.080
[Amit Varma]: You're just saying that there should be a single rate.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.080
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.620
[Guest]: So, you know, there are many ways to figure out what that single rate should be depending

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.200
[Guest]: on the end goal.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.840
[Guest]: You know, you can have good projections for what that single rate will get you in terms

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.200
[Guest]: of revenue.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.240
[Guest]: So think about this, if people stop spending money on chartered accountants and lawyers

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.360
[Guest]: and approaching the GST council and tax tribunals, right, that money can either go towards business

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.640
[Guest]: or it can go towards the higher tax rate.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640
[Guest]: A penny saved is a penny earned.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.280
[Guest]: So if you save money on compliance, you can raise it either as revenue or it can go back

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.400
[Guest]: in the economy through productive businesses.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And the government therefore makes the same amount of money, if not more, either by the

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.000
[Amit Varma]: money saved on compliance coming back as higher taxes or preferably going back into the economy

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.720
[Amit Varma]: and just increasing the tax base and there being more business to begin with.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.760
[Guest]: And I think there is a very important argument to be made that I didn't make this argument

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.320
[Guest]: in the column, but right now a number of items are excluded from GST.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320
[Guest]: Right.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.560
[Guest]: The most important being real estate and alcohol.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:34.000
[Guest]: So I think it's very, very important to broaden the GST base and include all goods and services.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.880
[Guest]: That is going to result in a much higher, much better tax collection, as well as a much

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:47.640
[Guest]: simpler and fairer tax system across the board for everyone, minimizing all this kind of

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.640
[Guest]: regulatory arbitrage that people engage in when it comes to real estate and things like

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640
[Guest]: that.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:59.080
[Guest]: And I think a better argument to make when it comes to raising revenue and being fair,

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:05.920
[Guest]: you know, to the poorer groups in the economy is that you need to expand the tax base, not

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.800
[Guest]: necessarily have multiple tax systems.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's move on now to the second objection, which is the objection of revenue neutrality,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.520
[Amit Varma]: which basically, let me try to first sum up what the objection is, and you can tell me

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.600
[Amit Varma]: if I've summed it up correctly, and then you can continue addressing it.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Revenue neutrality basically means is that look, we move from one system to another system

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.240
[Amit Varma]: from hazard different taxes across states and so on to one GST with all these rates

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.020
[Amit Varma]: and exemptions, which applies to the whole country.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And at one level, revenue neutrality states that you achieve revenue neutrality when you

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.720
[Amit Varma]: get in as much money in this new system, that is the government takes in as much money in

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.160
[Amit Varma]: this new system as they were getting before GST.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And at another level, when you talk of revenue neutrality, it is a guarantee given by governments

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.880
[Amit Varma]: to states that the amount of revenue you guys make under GST that goes to you will be the

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.720
[Amit Varma]: same as you were making before GST, which is a guarantee they had to give to get the

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.480
[Amit Varma]: states to agree to GST in the first place.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And the objection that therefore people are raising is that if you have just one rate

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.240
[Amit Varma]: for everything, instead of these different rates, won't that affect revenue neutrality?

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.560
[Guest]: Have I summed that up correctly?

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.760
[Guest]: Absolutely, I couldn't have said it better.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:23.280
[Guest]: So Amit, you're absolutely right, there is a huge question of revenue neutrality.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.480
[Guest]: This has been something that's been looming large at the macro level since the inception

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480
[Guest]: of GST, right?

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.200
[Guest]: Like until you implement a new tax system, you don't know how much revenue it's going

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.200
[Guest]: to generate.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:42.080
[Guest]: And there was a really big fear that the already depleting coffers of many of the Indian states

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.920
[Guest]: will deplete further because they agreed to this unified tax system.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.960
[Guest]: Now there is some good news on that end, right?

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:55.520
[Guest]: So Arvind Subramaniam, our current economic advisor, our current outgoing economic advisor,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.480
[Guest]: just recently wrote a piece based on nine months of revenue collections.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.200
[Guest]: So until April this year, right?

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.840
[Guest]: On how in the first nine months, some months you've had, you know, a decrease in revenue

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.040
[Guest]: collections versus the same time last year, some months there has been an increase.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.240
[Guest]: But overall for the nine months, there has actually been an increase in revenue collections,

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.560
[Guest]: right?

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.360
[Guest]: So this is something that is quite remarkable and something unexpected.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:28.600
[Guest]: So there is actually a revenue growth of 11.9% compared to the pre-GST numbers.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:34.560
[Guest]: And this basically means he's made a great argument that there is a tax buoyancy of 1.2.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.040
[Guest]: So tax buoyancy is the responsiveness of tax growth to nominal GDP growth.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.340
[Guest]: So as the GDP grows, how much does your tax revenue grow?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.240
[Guest]: So that number is called tax buoyancy, that's 1.2%.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.680
[Guest]: So the chief economic advisor has actually given us some good news.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.280
[Guest]: Like we can really breathe a little more comfortably now that we are not just revenue neutral in

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.280
[Guest]: the first nine months, actually revenue plus.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.240
[Guest]: So that's one aspect, right?

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:06.520
[Guest]: So in that sense, the GST has been a success in that, you know, our revenue collection

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.840
[Guest]: system didn't just completely collapse when we shifted from system one to system two.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:16.280
[Guest]: The second part of revenue collection is most of the states are not doing as badly.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.960
[Guest]: The ones that were expected to do badly are not doing as badly in revenue collection as

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.020
[Guest]: was originally anticipated.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:27.880
[Guest]: So Arvind Subramaniam says that the payout that the central government will have to make

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.600
[Guest]: to the states is much smaller than what was feared or anticipated before.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:40.000
[Guest]: So in one sense, even the current extremely complex system we have seen is revenue neutral.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.560
[Guest]: Now coming to the original question that you asked, revenue neutrality is not determined

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.080
[Guest]: by how many different rates you have.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.920
[Guest]: It is determined by what is the revenue collection.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.240
[Guest]: So you can have revenue neutral, revenue plus or revenue minus, depending on what the rate

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.240
[Guest]: is.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:04.240
[Guest]: So let's say the single tax rate is 2%, right, and it's levied on everything.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.920
[Guest]: It's possible that at such a low tax rate, you are not revenue neutral, you're revenue

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.480
[Guest]: minus, right?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.800
[Guest]: But let's say the single tax rate is 18%.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.680
[Guest]: It is wholly possible that even under that single rate, you are revenue plus as opposed

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.040
[Guest]: to being revenue neutral.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.120
[Guest]: So the idea of revenue neutrality is the total of how much revenue you collect.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.560
[Guest]: Now that is obviously determined by your tax rate, right?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.280
[Guest]: There is something in economics, there's a Laffer curve, right, as tax rates increase,

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.960
[Guest]: first the revenue collection goes up, then it goes down.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.880
[Guest]: So you want to figure out where India is on this curve.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.240
[Guest]: With some goods, you're going to win some, with some goods, you're going to lose some.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.200
[Guest]: So you know, there are some goods like say tobacco, which are highly non-responsive to

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.500
[Guest]: increases in tax, right?

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.680
[Guest]: So in those cases, a high tax rate will actually get you more revenue.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.120
[Guest]: Some things like onions, you're going to lose if you impose a very high rate on it, the

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.840
[Guest]: revenue is actually going to go down.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.840
[Guest]: So you're going to win some, you're going to lose some with a single tax rate.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.400
[Guest]: But on the whole, it is wholly possible that if you have one single rate, and you find

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.880
[Guest]: the correct rate, you are not just revenue neutral, but you are revenue plus.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.640
[Amit Varma]: So to sum it up, your point is that as far as revenue neutrality is concerned, it won't

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.260
[Amit Varma]: be affected necessarily by merely simplifying the GST and having one tax.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.280
[Amit Varma]: What will affect is what that one tax is.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.160
[Amit Varma]: And that is a separate argument that you're not getting into now.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.920
[Amit Varma]: You're not saying whether one tax should be 18 or two, you're just saying we should have

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.360
[Amit Varma]: one tax and remove those compliance costs.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.120
[Amit Varma]: And then let us talk about what that one number should be.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:42.840
[Amit Varma]: And we can fix it at something that gives us confidence that revenue neutrality at least

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840
[Guest]: will be achieved.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.800
[Guest]: And you know, if you think about it, you know, all of us can appreciate that the government

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.920
[Guest]: is trying to do something quite extraordinary in terms of scale, right?

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.680
[Guest]: So there's going to be some trial and error in the system.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.480
[Guest]: I think we all can agree to that.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.640
[Guest]: So it is possible that you start with the rate and like Goldilocks, you need to move

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.280
[Guest]: higher or lower.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.280
[Guest]: And that's okay.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.160
[Guest]: I don't think that's a very big problem.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.360
[Guest]: But remember, that is going to be a trial and error with only one rate, which minimizes

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360
[Guest]: confusion.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.080
[Guest]: You know, you open the first page of the newspaper, it says GST Council has increased the rate

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.080
[Guest]: or decreased the rate.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And that's all you need to know.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.080
[Guest]: Right.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.560
[Guest]: So that trial and error process, if we concede that that's going to happen, it'll be simpler.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.880
[Guest]: The other part of it is, a lot of the revenue neutrality arguments are also dependent on

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880
[Guest]: the tax base.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.200
[Guest]: And we don't see enough writing on that in the current GST framework, that we actually

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.360
[Guest]: need to expand the base, we need to cover everything, we need to stop exempting things

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.320
[Guest]: like gold and gemstones at ridiculously low rates, right?

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.520
[Guest]: Gold is taxed at 3%, gemstones, diamonds are taxed at 0.25%.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.280
[Guest]: So we're making, you know, all this crazy exemptions.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:57.720
[Guest]: So there's a really important question of eliminating all these exemptions and increasing

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:06.760
[Guest]: the tax base to things like alcohol and property taxes, and then simplifying down to one tax

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.760
[Guest]: rate.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.360
[Guest]: And I don't think there is a very big problem of revenue neutrality.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.320
[Guest]: I think long run, India will generate more revenue under a system like that.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.200
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, just to go back to public choice, which we mentioned at the start of this episode,

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.440
[Amit Varma]: what typically happens when you have so many exemptions and so much discretion to people

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.240
[Amit Varma]: in authority is that you will have all these interest groups coming up and there is scope

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.100
[Amit Varma]: for corruption, which is almost inevitable, I would say.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.240
[Amit Varma]: And you will have your gemstone lobby and your alcohol lobby and all these different

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240
[Amit Varma]: lobbyings.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And then it just becomes that same old interplay between power and money.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.760
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:47.240
[Guest]: I think you and I could come up with very good ideas on why we have so many exemptions,

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.640
[Guest]: knowing all the public choice literature that we know.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:56.040
[Guest]: I think another question is, how do we persuade all these different groups to come under one

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040
[Guest]: umbrella?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040
[Guest]: Right.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.040
[Guest]: And I think we are very well poised in this moment, you know, normally for someone like

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.360
[Guest]: you and me, who are strong believers in federalism, it's quite frightening to have single party

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.560
[Guest]: rule in so many states, right?

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.760
[Guest]: Just from a point of view of concentration of power, it doesn't matter which party it

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.760
[Amit Varma]: is.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.840
[Guest]: Especially given that we have a fairly weak constitution in some ways.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.840
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:23.560
[Guest]: And so right now, we are in a very interesting moment, which has happened, you know, after

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:30.600
[Guest]: the great Nehruvian times, which is 21 states are under one party rule.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:37.860
[Guest]: So there is some case to be made that if there is anyone who can unify all these different

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.800
[Guest]: interests and bring them under one umbrella and persuade them, it is the current ruling

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.400
[Guest]: party and the current Prime Minister.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.040
[Guest]: I don't think that would be an unfair thing to say.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.480
[Guest]: So we are in a good, I mean, there are many bad things that come from concentration of

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.480
[Guest]: power.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.920
[Guest]: But it also provides an opportunity to overcome all this kind of interest group activity and

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920
[Guest]: capture.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.200
[Guest]: So I would really, I would hope that the current government capitalizes on that moment and

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.540
[Guest]: actually does that for the GST.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.520
[Amit Varma]: So I'm actually for the rest of this episode, I'm going to ask you only questions related

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.660
[Amit Varma]: to public choice theory, because I want to explore the sort of political economy of why

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.760
[Amit Varma]: the GST is what it is and how it can be reformed.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:24.400
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of incentives in play which could prompt people in power to make that

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.340
[Amit Varma]: move towards a single tax rate?

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.780
[Amit Varma]: And what are the kind of incentives in play which could make those in power resist such

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.780
[Guest]: a move?

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:38.700
[Guest]: So I'll give you a couple of examples right now, I think there is a very unified lobby,

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:43.140
[Guest]: you know, even if we break down the different goods and services in the economy to different

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:49.260
[Guest]: lobbies, I think they're all asking for exemptions and special privileges and things like that.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.220
[Guest]: But I think there is a lot of unity in that everyone wants this to be a simpler system.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.220
[Amit Varma]: No question.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.220
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:00.500
[Amit Varma]: Because once everybody can benefit, like normally what happens is that the benefits are concentrated

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.360
[Guest]: and the costs are dispersed.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.120
[Guest]: So in terms of compliance and complexity, I think there is a lot of unity virtually

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:14.140
[Guest]: every industry lobby that has been coming to both the GST Council and the government

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.460
[Guest]: have been persuading the government to create a simpler system.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.540
[Guest]: And both Mr. Jaitley, and you know, the current economic advisor, Mr. Subramanian, they have

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:28.580
[Guest]: all talked about how there is going to be some discussion and move towards simplifying

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:34.740
[Guest]: the current GST tax rate system, right, so collapse it down to fewer rates, eliminate

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.740
[Guest]: some of the exemptions.

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:41.220
[Guest]: So I think this is very much on everyone's mind, because all the industry lobbies have

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.540
[Guest]: been talking about this.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.740
[Guest]: What could mitigate that?

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.260
[Guest]: So what can mitigate that is some lobbies actually become strong, like we've seen a

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:53.460
[Guest]: very strong Gujarat lobby that has ended up with ridiculously low rates for gold and gemstones,

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.460
[Guest]: right?

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:59.620
[Guest]: Somebody says, okay, don't give us a simple rate, just give us a special rate.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.820
[Guest]: Right?

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.740
[Guest]: It's going to be too difficult to unify everyone and bring it under one tax rate and compliance

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.740
[Guest]: umbrella.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.020
[Guest]: Hume thoda special treatment de do, hum aapke khas hain.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.260
[Guest]: That is sort of the attitude.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.220
[Guest]: And we have seen that happening.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220
[Guest]: Right?

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:21.060
[Guest]: Basically, industries which don't have much power or much lobbying capacity at the state

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:26.540
[Guest]: and federal level, especially entertainment, right, different states put all kinds of stresses

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.900
[Guest]: on entertainment.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.140
[Guest]: It's very difficult for them to lobby or like spend money on lobbying instead of spending

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.460
[Guest]: money on making movies or making music.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.140
[Guest]: On the other hand, tobacco, alcohol, you know, some of these lobbies are just very well organized.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.100
[Guest]: So they will be very good at getting their special rates, right?

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.300
[Guest]: And to neutralize the effect of the special rates, some goods which are used by everyone,

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.620
[Guest]: which are not well organized, are going to have this cess and that cess in addition to

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.820
[Guest]: the highest 28% GST.

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:02.380
[Guest]: So this is, this is a problem of special interests, and in the short run, special interest trying

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:06.960
[Guest]: to capture whatever gains there are, when there is a lot of confusion and transition

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.340
[Guest]: in a new tax system.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.100
[Amit Varma]: And what is your sense of which side is stronger?

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, is it likely that we will simplify to the extent you want or because typically

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.740
[Amit Varma]: what happens in government is that regulation only gets deeper and more complex because

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:25.460
[Amit Varma]: of all the interest groups and the incentives involved, it rarely gets simpler.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.220
[Guest]: But you know, there is a huge incentive in this case, right?

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:35.380
[Guest]: If things get more complex, and we go back to our good old system of Parchi, you know,

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:40.180
[Guest]: there is a bit so you can't put India doesn't have the state capacity to throw everyone

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.000
[Guest]: in jail if they evade tax, right?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.420
[Guest]: If you have a highly complex system and very high tax rates, what's going to happen, people

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.500
[Guest]: will just stop paying.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.500
[Guest]: Then it's more beneficial.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:55.180
[Guest]: You know, I recently last time I was in India, I went with my mom to our tailor.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.540
[Guest]: She has two sets of books.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.020
[Guest]: One is GST compliant.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.080
[Guest]: The other one is all Parchi, start to finish Parchi.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:07.640
[Guest]: So all her inputs, people give a Parchi and then she gives us a Parchi, right?

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.860
[Guest]: So what is going to happen is if the compliance requirements are too high, or if the tax rates

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:18.060
[Guest]: are too high, people will just start evading and when people evade tax, no matter how beautiful

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.500
[Guest]: your GST system is, the government doesn't have revenue.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:26.940
[Guest]: So I think one major fear for the current government and any future government is we

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:32.620
[Guest]: can't mess up the system so much that there is a genuine loss in revenue.

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:37.540
[Guest]: I think there is some push towards simplifying the system to increase revenue.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:42.620
[Guest]: And remember, the more revenue you have, the greater power you have as a ruling party.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:47.820
[Amit Varma]: So out of sheer self interest, the evil force will be prompted to do a good thing.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.900
[Amit Varma]: Or not do a terribly bad thing.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.300
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I was I was being tongue in cheek there.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to twist your words out of context, because it gives me pleasure.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.820
[Amit Varma]: What Shruti has just called for is civil disobedience on a mass scale.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.220
[Amit Varma]: Don't pay your taxes until the GST gets reformed.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.900
[Amit Varma]: I won't even ask you if that's a fair summary or not, because it obviously is.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.900
[Guest]: And on that happy note, Shruti, thanks so much.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:15.340
[Guest]: I think, no, it's not a fair summary, but I will say I think all forms of protest are

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.340
[Amit Varma]: legitimate.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.340
[Guest]: I was kidding.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340
[Guest]: Right.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:24.300
[Guest]: No, but I think people can protest by saying we refuse to file, do what it is you wish,

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.260
[Guest]: because your system's really terrible.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:32.940
[Guest]: We have fantastic history in India of objecting to unfair taxes, starting with the salt tax.

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:33.940
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.460
[Guest]: That is a civil disobedience movement.

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:42.620
[Guest]: So I can very much get behind kirana shops who say this is just too complicated.

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.300
[Guest]: You have got to simplify this.

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.620
[Guest]: Otherwise, by all means, you know, shut our shops and throw us in jail.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.660
[Guest]: I think, in fact, I would in fact call for that.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.060
[Amit Varma]: I would love if we could organize like that.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:58.540
[Amit Varma]: What I keep reminding people is that the salt tax that Gandhi protested was a fraction of

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.900
[Amit Varma]: what the salt tax is today.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, where is our resistance to oppression?

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.100
[Amit Varma]: And on that note, Shruti, I mean, I learned a lot in this episode, and it's definitely

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.860
[Amit Varma]: taken us forward from the last two episodes, which I would nevertheless urge the listeners

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.300
[Amit Varma]: to check out as well.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.460

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.840
