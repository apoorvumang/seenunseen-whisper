00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: There is a lot that is wrong with the world, and it's important to put a number to it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, we are often suspicious of numbers.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.740
[Amit Varma]: They confuse us, and when they are big, they become abstractions that our brains are not

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.140
[Amit Varma]: designed to fathom.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And yet, if we want the whole truth, and not just a glimpse of it, we need numbers.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.080
[Amit Varma]: I may feel that gender and caste are India's biggest problems, and you may feel that here

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.960
[Amit Varma]: they are not so bad, but the only legit way for us to try and convince each other is through

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
[Amit Varma]: numbers.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
[Amit Varma]: My anecdote versus your anecdote gets us nowhere.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.820
[Amit Varma]: And no one knows this better than my guest on this episode, who shed light on important

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.920
[Amit Varma]: questions and important arguments about caste and gender.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.200
[Amit Varma]: Her work means that we cannot deny the problem exists, and we can use her data to tackle

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.920
[Amit Varma]: these problems better.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.040
[Amit Varma]: If things are wrong, and you want to set them right, you need the right numbers.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.240
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.720
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Ashwini Deshpande, the only economist in the world to have been on an

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: Amul hoarding.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini was born to a remarkable family.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.920
[Amit Varma]: You could make multiple web series on her aazobas and aajis, grandparents who tried

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.600
[Amit Varma]: to reform society and led by example.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.080
[Amit Varma]: Her dad was a famous playwright and academic, J.P. Deshpande, and her mom was a well-known

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.840
[Amit Varma]: women's rights activist.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini could have been a vocalist or a sitar player or a writer, but she took one for the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.240
[Amit Varma]: team, by which I mean all of us, and became an economist.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.680
[Amit Varma]: She spent decades doing path-breaking work in caste and gender, among other subjects.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.040
[Amit Varma]: She's a professor at the Ashoka University and lifetime president of the global Lata

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Mangeshkar fan club.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: Okay, fine, I made that last line up, but it's plausible as you'll find out.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.200
[Amit Varma]: We met a week before this recording at a conference in Goa, where she both sang Madanmohan songs

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: as well as gave a presentation on her academic work that blew us away.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.840
[Amit Varma]: This conversation also contains multitudes, and I'd urge you to see it as part of a larger

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.160
[Amit Varma]: interconnected conversation I've had on these subjects with various other guests.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the episode I released two weeks ago with the great Dalit scholar and activist

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Chandrabhan Prasad was actually recorded after this one, but there are threads that intermingle.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.400
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, recording this was a blast, so listen in.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.800
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.920
[Amit Varma]: An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.200
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
[Amit Varma]: interaction.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.560
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.440
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.600
[Amit Varma]: The course costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and is a monthly thing.

[Amit Varma]: That's indiauncut.com slash clearwriting.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.080
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God-given talent, just the willingness to work hard

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.640
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.560
[Guest]: It's so fabulous to be here.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for inviting me.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, and I'm sure it is also fabulous to be here.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.200
[Amit Varma]: So we've been talking about this for a long time.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And there's also excitement that I get in my DMs from Twitter, when is it out?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
[Amit Varma]: When is it out?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.720
[Amit Varma]: I haven't even recorded yet, because I posted this video of you singing this beautiful song,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.200
[Amit Varma]: I think by Madan Mohan, you know, at this conference we were at.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And there has been so much enthusiasm.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.120
[Amit Varma]: People have got in touch asking about commercial possibilities, and so on and so forth, concerts.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.360
[Amit Varma]: And I have been like, you know, at the Royal Alfred Hall, for example.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And I have been like, okay, you know, I'm her agent, I will take 80% commission, you

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.280
[Amit Varma]: know, and I'm game with it.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
[Guest]: So we can discuss.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.400
[Guest]: Alfred, you mean Albert, obviously, no, I deliberately said Alfred, because this is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.640
[Amit Varma]: what happens in India, no one understands satire.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.080
[Guest]: Oh, now you're on fact checking.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.240
[Guest]: No, really, sorry, I'm going to keep my teacher hat aside.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And no, no, I will ask you in this episode also to put the teacher hat on because at

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.200
[Amit Varma]: the conference where we were, you gave this excellent talk where I learned so much, you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.960
[Amit Varma]: know, I read your book also, which was delightful and a whole bunch of articles, not all of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: which are to do with your field of study.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.920
[Amit Varma]: So that was sort of great fun.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to go back to sort of talking about your childhood, there's a delightful piece

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book on caste, where right at the start, you speak about your paternal grandparents,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Asha Tai and Purushottam Narahardesh Pandey.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And I found that really interesting.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And I want to dig deeper into that.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about, you know, your memories of them, and you know, what were

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.720
[Guest]: they like, and so on?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.480
[Guest]: Well, they were absolutely remarkable individuals and actually their love story and true, I

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.240
[Guest]: mean, I'm using the word correctly in the sense that there was a love marriage back

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.400
[Guest]: in the day, their love story should be actually made into a movie or something.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.280
[Guest]: So my paternal grandfather, who we used to call Anna, Azoba is in Marathi, it's called,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280
[Guest]: you know, his grandfather.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.840
[Guest]: So Anna Azoba, and then as we became older, we just called him Anna because everybody

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.920
[Guest]: in the village called him Anna.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.200
[Guest]: Anna's father settled in this small town village called Rahimathpur, which is in Satara district

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200
[Guest]: of Western Maharashtra.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.000
[Guest]: So it's, I don't know, about 200 odd kilometers from Pune.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.600
[Guest]: And it's I mean, I'm obviously very fond of it, but otherwise, it's it's pretty nondescript

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.860
[Guest]: small town.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.720
[Guest]: It has a very interesting name.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.480
[Guest]: And it has a very interesting location.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.960
[Guest]: Anyway, by the time I was born, my grandparents were staying there.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.880
[Guest]: And till I was 25 years old, every single summer vacation, we used to spend in Maharashtra.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.160
[Guest]: And of that two month period, the biggest chunk of time was in Rahimathpur, where my

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.720
[Guest]: grandparents were there, my parents, of course, my father's siblings, you know, over the years,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.220
[Guest]: they got married, they had children, then as their families expanded.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.600
[Guest]: So basically, it was a large extended family gathering in Rahimathpur.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.160
[Guest]: And I, of course, adored my grandparents.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.800
[Guest]: And I got a sense that they were special as a child.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.240
[Guest]: But it was partly a sense that, you know, children feel for their grandparents, because

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.800
[Guest]: you always think that your parent or your grandparent is the best one in the world and

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.040
[Guest]: so on.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.600
[Guest]: But through my years, you know, through my growing up years, I started getting glimpses

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.480
[Guest]: into how exactly how special they were.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.680
[Guest]: And it's my lasting regret that I never actually one on one really talked to them about their

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680
[Guest]: lives.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.400
[Guest]: Now I'm piecing it together through things that other people have written.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.520
[Guest]: And let me tell you, since I've mentioned about their love story.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:22.480
[Guest]: So basically, my grandfather was a medical doctor, and he was active in the freedom movement.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: And he got married and gave birth to two sons, my father and another brother, my chacha.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.120
[Guest]: And during the third childbirth, either exactly during childbirth or shortly after, the third

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.840
[Guest]: child died and his wife died.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.520
[Guest]: So basically, he was a widower with two young boys, two very small boys, and active medical

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.320
[Guest]: professional, but also active in the politics in the, you know, anti British political struggle

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.600
[Guest]: of the time.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: And in one of these conventions, he met this young woman, about 14 or so years younger

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.360
[Guest]: than him, and very highly educated for, you know, remarkable for that time, city bred,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.020
[Guest]: she was from Sangli.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.960
[Guest]: And she was the daughter of this very well known playwright called Khadilkar.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.720
[Guest]: It's a very, it's a very culturally very important family in Maharashtra.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.120
[Guest]: So she was Khadilkar, she was Sindhu Khadilkar as it happened.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.840
[Guest]: And she saw this handsome, older, slightly older man, and she fell in love.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.640
[Guest]: And she proposed marriage to him.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.360
[Guest]: And she said, I want to marry you.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.480
[Guest]: So he said, absolutely not.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.760
[Guest]: We are not a match, we are our circumstances are not matched.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.040
[Guest]: And your parents will never agree, I will not agree because I don't I don't want to

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680
[Guest]: put you through this situation where you take care of two children already.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.640
[Guest]: And she said, No, absolutely, I'm not going to get married.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.800
[Guest]: But if I get married, it will be only to you.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.880
[Guest]: And so she persisted.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.000
[Guest]: And then my grandfather said, Okay, the condition under which if at all we marry, which, first

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.100
[Guest]: of all, is not going to happen.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.200
[Guest]: But if that happens, you have to tell your parents everything truthfully about my condition,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.360
[Guest]: and that I have not asked you to marry me, you know, and she must have said yes, so I'm

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.120
[Guest]: not exactly sure what she said.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.940
[Guest]: But basically, one day she landed up in Rehmatpur, all the way from Sangli into this small village.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.320
[Guest]: And she being a city bred, intelligent, highly educated woman.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.920
[Guest]: And by that time, my grandmother, my grandfather was there with his two sons, his father, who

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.680
[Guest]: by then had been paralyzed with a stroke.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.760
[Guest]: So he lived in a completely paralyzed state for 12 years.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.560
[Guest]: So there was a paralyzed father, there were two sons.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.440
[Guest]: And there was a chachi, sorry, a bua, some aunt of my of my dadaji, who was a child widow.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.360
[Guest]: And she was, you know, she lived with him basically with them and acid tongue, you know,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.760
[Guest]: and just, you know, very cutting, but, you know, old style widow with haircut and all

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.000
[Guest]: the rest of it.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.120
[Guest]: So that was the house.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.800
[Guest]: And my grandmother said, I'll take it, I want this, I want you basically.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.400
[Guest]: And they married.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:05.800
[Guest]: And that must have been I think, 1940 or 42, I'm not exactly sure, maybe 42, 41 or 42.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.640
[Guest]: And then she gave birth to three children who are, you know, my parents, stepchildren.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:18.120
[Guest]: But for the longest time, I didn't know that she was my father's stepmother.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:24.040
[Guest]: And because A, she was highly progressive, she never discriminated between her own born

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.400
[Guest]: children and the two earlier children.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.280
[Guest]: She never discriminated between the grandchildren.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.480
[Guest]: So my father was the eldest in his generation, and I'm his oldest daughter.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.860
[Guest]: So I'm the eldest in the cousin's generation.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.200
[Guest]: And from my grandmother's point of view, I was the oldest grandchild.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.800
[Guest]: And so therefore the most loved, by the time the other grandchildren came along, I was

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800
[Guest]: there.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.760
[Guest]: And it was years later that I discovered that, oh, sagi dadi nahi ho, whatever, I mean, of

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.600
[Guest]: course, it made no sense, because I used to call her mothiyai, which means elder mother.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.760
[Guest]: So that's how she was.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:04.320
[Guest]: And they were, both of them, Anna and mothiyai, were remarkably progressive.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: So one of the things I remember very clearly is that they had taken a position that we

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.720
[Guest]: will not attend any wedding in which dowry is exchanged.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.320
[Guest]: And I remember once my bua's closest friend, who was almost like a bua, I used to call

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.460
[Guest]: her bua, and she was always in and out of our house in Raimadpur.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.740
[Guest]: So she was going to get married, and obviously dowry was going to be exchanged at that wedding.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.500
[Guest]: And for Anna and mothiyai to not go to that wedding is almost like them not going to their

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.360
[Guest]: own daughter's wedding, but they didn't go.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.360
[Guest]: Because it was a principle stand that we have not exchanged dowry, nobody in our family

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.520
[Guest]: has exchanged dowry, and we will not go to a wedding where dowry has been exchanged.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.880
[Guest]: And my grandmother, after she moved to this small town, in the front part of the house,

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.840
[Guest]: she established a library, the first ever library in Raimadpur.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.240
[Guest]: She called it the Hind Vachanale, Vachanale is library, Hind is Hindustan, India.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.040
[Guest]: And I remember it because it was in the, you know, our house was like their vada, the old

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.880
[Guest]: style vada with the central courtyard, you enter, then there is a room at the front and

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.760
[Guest]: there's a room at the top and then you enter into a courtyard, and the rest of the house

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.720
[Guest]: is basically surrounding the courtyard.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.480
[Guest]: It's that old style, lovely house.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.880
[Guest]: And the front, on the ground floor was my grandfather's clinic, where he would just

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.800
[Guest]: get up in the morning, have breakfast, shower, and then go there and the whole day he would

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.080
[Guest]: and just come back for lunch, again go out.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.040
[Guest]: And on the first floor, above my grandfather's clinic was the Hind Vachanale, a library that

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.560
[Guest]: my grandmother built, I mean, assembled, not built as in not building the building, but

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.080
[Guest]: basically got books together.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:53.280
[Guest]: And she would go from house to house, encouraging women and children particularly, to come there

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.840
[Guest]: and read and to borrow books.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.400
[Guest]: And she, you know, she could cook, obviously, because all women, you know, there was no

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.600
[Guest]: choice, you had to learn to cook and housekeep, etc.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.800
[Guest]: But she had made it very clear that cooking and housekeeping were not going to be her

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.480
[Guest]: foremost occupations.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.160
[Guest]: So she was politically active, she was socially active, and I remember going with her to people's

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.360
[Guest]: homes and her giving this little, you know, okay, so what have you read?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.680
[Guest]: Tell me, what did you like about that story?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.480
[Guest]: Do you want to, it's been a long time that you've been sitting on this book, why haven't

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.720
[Guest]: you finished it, etc.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.880
[Guest]: And because I came from a family where books were read as, you know, that was a default.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.080
[Guest]: It was amazing for me to see this, and she was four feet, 10 inches, so very short, diminutive

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest]: woman with a very sweet, thin voice, getting the breakfast and all done and then just leaving

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.640
[Guest]: the house and going from house to house.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.920
[Guest]: And that time, I remember walking very far away, you know, on the outskirts of the village,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.720
[Guest]: and I would say, oh, this is, is this Rahimathpur still, are we still in Rahimathpur?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.080
[Guest]: Because this is really far.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.600
[Guest]: So she said, no, this is also Rahimathpur.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.880
[Guest]: And we would go to this hamlet, which was very poor, you know, markedly poorer than

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.200
[Guest]: obviously where we lived and from the rest of Rahimathpur.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.360
[Guest]: And somehow I never asked her what it was, but she would go into each home, just like

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.840
[Guest]: she used to go into other homes, and also encourage, also ask them to come to our home

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840
[Guest]: and enter the house.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.600
[Guest]: And, you know, and every time they came, she would give them something, you know, etc.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.320
[Guest]: The significance of all that escaped me.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.680
[Guest]: I had no idea.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.920
[Guest]: I just thought that they were just poorer than some others.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.880
[Guest]: It was only after she had passed away, and when I started working on cast, that the penny

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:46.520
[Guest]: dropped and I suddenly realized that what we had been going to was a Dalit basti, which

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.800
[Guest]: was on the outskirts.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.240
[Guest]: And the act of going into their homes and the act of her inviting them into our home

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.280
[Guest]: inside the house, including in the kitchen, giving them food was a very quiet, but extremely

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.120
[Guest]: revolutionary act, the significance of which I never understood.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.320
[Guest]: So they were much like my parents, they never preached, or they never said, Oh, look, this

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.560
[Guest]: is what we are doing.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.280
[Guest]: And this is the right thing to do.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.880
[Guest]: And this is what you must do, etc., none of that.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.480
[Guest]: But how actions leave a sort of impact even, and it lasts for years after they've gone.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.680
[Guest]: And every now and then suddenly a memory strikes me of something that she used to do or my

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.640
[Guest]: grandfather used to do.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.880
[Guest]: And I would say, Oh, this is what they were doing, you know, but as a kid, I didn't didn't

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880
[Guest]: know it.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.960
[Guest]: I had no idea at that time that this is what we were doing, you know, with her.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.520
[Amit Varma]: Such a beautiful resonance story.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.080
[Amit Varma]: And I, you know, the line, this is also Rehmatpur, would be such a lovely title for a story or

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.520
[Amit Varma]: a book or whatever.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also just very struck by that image of medical clinic in the ground floor, and

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.440
[Amit Varma]: then a library just above that.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.600
[Amit Varma]: It's like you have medicine for the body and medicine for the soul, and they're both kind

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.880
[Amit Varma]: of there.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.440
[Amit Varma]: So here's sort of I have a few related questions to, you know, justice.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And the first of them is this, that you mentioned about how you never realized it at the time

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.840
[Amit Varma]: that the penny dropped much later.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And one theme that I have been I have sometimes brought up on my shows as well, is do we talk

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.560
[Amit Varma]: to elder people from our family, whether it's our parents or grandparents, enough, or are

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.160
[Amit Varma]: we trapped within the bounds of whatever the relationship has been laid out as where somebody

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.320
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, like fathers and sons will typically never really talk or exchange emotional content

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.200
[Amit Varma]: or we won't really talk to our grandfathers in that way and talk about their lives and

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.440
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder if, you know, just from from the, you know, and something for the listeners

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.840
[Amit Varma]: to think about as well, that maybe there is something in doing a little bit more of that,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.680
[Amit Varma]: and seeing them not just in terms of the role that they have in our lives, but as sort of

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680
[Amit Varma]: individuals.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, before my father passed, I remember I sat with him and just spoke about his life

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.160
[Amit Varma]: and I recorded two, three hours of that, so it's like a small oral history that is there

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.360
[Amit Varma]: with me, which is almost like a window into another person, you know, where you don't

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.040
[Amit Varma]: see someone as your father, you just seem as an individual kind of growing up.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And in any case, I have a fascination for these oral histories and life stories, as

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.640
[Amit Varma]: you can tell from my podcast.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.640
[Amit Varma]: So looking back, obviously, you know, if they were still around, you would have sat and

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.280
[Amit Varma]: spoken to them or whatever.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But do you feel that is something that we should do more of, that when we go through

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.320
[Amit Varma]: life, we get circumscribed in these kinds of roles, whether they are familial relationships,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.440
[Amit Varma]: or whether they are caste barriers, or gender barriers, or whatever.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.280
[Amit Varma]: And we think of people in terms of roles and not as, you know, three dimensional people

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.760
[Amit Varma]: with interesting, fascinating lives.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you've thought about?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.720
[Guest]: No, I agree with you that, of course, we should do that.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.960
[Guest]: But I have to say one thing about just my particular, the father side of the family

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.280
[Guest]: is that the issue was never that we didn't talk.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.640
[Guest]: In fact, the Deshpande side of the family and my mother's side, you know, sometimes

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.120
[Guest]: they make fun of this, which is that it's a bit too, it talks too much, and it's a bit

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120
[Guest]: too democratic.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: You know, especially with my parents and my brother and I, the four of us that that nuclear

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.200
[Guest]: family, we would constantly be arguing, discussing this, that and the other etc.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:24.520
[Guest]: I guess, I have been incredibly lucky to certainly in my grandparents' generation of having such

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.960
[Guest]: incredible grandparents.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:32.480
[Guest]: And I'm not just talking about my paternal grandfather, Anna and his wife, but his brothers

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.040
[Guest]: and their wives, you know, that they have all have so many aspects to their personality

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.400
[Guest]: that I'm discovering them literally now, you know, long after they're gone.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.760
[Guest]: So for example, last year, Nayanjot Lahiri, who's my colleague at Ashoka, a well known

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: historian of ancient India, wrote this book on my Anna's brother, my grandfather's brother,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.240
[Guest]: who also has to call Azoba, they're all Azobas.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.800
[Guest]: Of course, you know, again, adored him, you know, was very, very close to him.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.480
[Guest]: He was an archaeologist and he was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.160
[Guest]: that I knew because he lived in Delhi, unlike Anna who lived in Rahimathpur.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.840
[Guest]: So I saw this Azoba much more often because just because they were in Delhi.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.800
[Guest]: And I knew that he was in the Archaeological Survey because often from school, if we had

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.720
[Guest]: to go to their house, you know, we would get picked up, dropped to his office.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.880
[Guest]: I've spent many afternoons after school in the Archaeological Survey office, which is

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.880
[Guest]: to be next to the National Museum then, I don't know where it is now.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:39.280
[Guest]: And I knew that he was a very sort of important archaeologist because the books on archaeology

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.760
[Guest]: in his house, he would travel a lot, people would come to see him, etc, etc.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:49.560
[Guest]: And so I knew, obviously, that he had achieved a fair amount in his life.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.800
[Guest]: And but of all the brothers, he was in some sense, he was a laddu.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.560
[Guest]: I mean, he was the sweetest, cutest, most adorable.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560
[Guest]: I mean, they were all adorable.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.680
[Guest]: But even in that adorable, a set of very adorable people, he was, I guess, the most adorable

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.640
[Guest]: of them all and very soft spoken.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:16.880
[Guest]: And so one day Nainjot stopped me in the corridor and she said, are you, do you know M N Deshpande?

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: So I said, yes, he's my father's uncle, he's my grand uncle.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.240
[Guest]: And she said, oh, so do you know his family?

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.240
[Guest]: So I said, of course, they are my chachas and, you know, my father's first, I'm very,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.240
[Guest]: very close to them.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.920
[Guest]: Like, they are my family in Delhi from the Deshpande side.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.840
[Guest]: And she said, I want to write a book about him.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.240
[Guest]: So I said, oh, how nice, etc.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.120
[Guest]: I thought, you know, because he's a well-known archaeologist, so I wasn't surprised.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.960
[Guest]: And then she proceeded to tell me two episodes about his life that showed him in a light

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.560
[Guest]: that I could not imagine him being.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.640
[Guest]: So one of them was, both of them actually, were how he stood up to Mrs. Gandhi at the

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:03.400
[Guest]: peak of her power in India and stopped a demolition or an extension of an archaeological protected

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.800
[Guest]: site where one of them was, in fact, Birla was involved in, Birla and Mrs. Gandhi.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.840
[Guest]: So he stood up to the collective might of Birla and Mrs. Gandhi and stopped that extension,

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.840
[Guest]: which is a story if I'd heard about Anna, I would have believed it.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:24.880
[Guest]: Anna was, you know, but about Azoba was in Delhi, he was, I could not imagine him, you

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.840
[Guest]: know, taking this very strong stand and just not budging.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.480
[Guest]: And he did it in his quiet way and he got it done.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.080
[Guest]: And then she told me other stories, and then she wrote this book.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.600
[Guest]: And through that book, I learned so much about him.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:45.480
[Guest]: For example, from Rahimathpur, this young man went to do a BA in Ardhamagadhi.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.400
[Guest]: I mean, how did he, so Nayan Jyot kept asking me, how did he think of this language?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.000
[Guest]: How did he get interested in archaeology?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.080
[Guest]: But unfortunately, anyone who could have answered that question, they're all gone.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.360
[Guest]: So nobody knows.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.400
[Guest]: And so through Nayan Jyot's book, through her, which is now in the public domain, I

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.240
[Guest]: learned so much about my grand uncle.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.000
[Guest]: So in our family, the problem has not been that we haven't been close, there have been

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.120
[Guest]: the traditional barriers of authority and, you know, that prevent conversation.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.960
[Guest]: In fact, if anything, we talk too much to each other.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.120
[Guest]: But I guess everybody has been so remarkable in their own ways and very self effacing.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.760
[Guest]: So there are things that they did or do, and we just don't find out, we don't know until

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.400
[Guest]: some other person and they never promoted themselves.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.480
[Guest]: So a lot of facts are known about other archaeologists of his generation.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.120
[Guest]: But until this book came along, nobody knew about all these things that my grand uncle

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.560
[Guest]: had done.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.480
[Guest]: And Nayan Jyot said, it's amazing, there is no book about him, and I'm going to write

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.480
[Guest]: this book.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.640
[Guest]: And she didn't know that I was related to him.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.100
[Guest]: So obviously, it wasn't like she was doing it for a friend's uncle or whatever.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.960
[Guest]: That was not the motivation.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.840
[Guest]: But I guess so just about the Deshpande's, I think the problem is that there are too

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.720
[Guest]: many achievements, not achievements, I wouldn't say, but there are too many aspects to everybody's

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720
[Guest]: personality.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.280
[Guest]: And it's really hard to keep track of who's doing what.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:16.800
[Guest]: And with my parents, I feel that regret every single day, that I learn about something or

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.920
[Guest]: the other about my mother or my father, and I said, Oh, gosh, I never talked to them about

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920
[Amit Varma]: these.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.280
[Amit Varma]: I love the way Nayan Jyot comes to you and asks you, do you know M N Deshpande, you should

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.080
[Amit Varma]: just have replied, that yes, of course, all Deshpande's are related to each other.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.480
[Unknown]: Do you know Bappi Lahiri?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm just kidding.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And I also have a great title for an incredible web series.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'm quite serious about this.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.960
[Amit Varma]: This could be a heck of a show, The Azobaz.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, like the Sopranos.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960
[Guest]: Like the Sopranos.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, what a series.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.560
[Guest]: I should tell my brother, I should put this because actually, my brother has been more

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.840
[Guest]: systematic about documenting history.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:59.520
[Guest]: So I think when my father's mother, she unfortunately passed away young, she was only 67.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.880
[Guest]: So she died in 1990.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.120
[Guest]: But my grandfather died much later.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.360
[Guest]: And there was a time when my brother decided that, okay, now is the time that I need to

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.140
[Guest]: go with my camera to Rehmatpur and get Anna to record.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.240
[Guest]: So he has actually done a little bit of the oral history project with some members of

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240
[Guest]: the family.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.480
[Guest]: So he's recorded some things with my mother, some with Anna, some with my father.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.960
[Guest]: I guess we all have to put it together.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.800
[Guest]: But he's been more, I guess, by the time we became adults, when we suddenly realized,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.320
[Guest]: oh, we have these remarkable people in our family who are not just adorable and, you

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.560
[Guest]: know, just lovely, because we love them.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.960
[Guest]: It's not just that they're more than that.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.920
[Guest]: They've done, you know, they have significant contributions.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.080
[Guest]: He became aware of that.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.080
[Guest]: And he did record.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.040
[Guest]: In fact, my father's, I reposted an essay that my father had done about Rehmatpur recently

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.560
[Guest]: on Twitter on his birthday, birth anniversary.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560
[Guest]: So I can share that.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.560
[Guest]: It's a lovely, lovely essay about Rehmatpur.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560
[Guest]: You can post that.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.560
[Guest]: It came out in Himal, the journal.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.400
[Amit Varma]: I'll link that from the show notes and more power to your brother, I mean, and the idea

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.000
[Amit Varma]: is that one should not think of oral histories just in terms of extraordinary people.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.060
[Amit Varma]: One should think of just doing oral histories in general with anybody, you know, and anybody

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060
[Amit Varma]: can do this.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.520
[Amit Varma]: Anybody can just sit down with somebody in their family who's kind of old or somebody

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.880
[Amit Varma]: they know and just kind of record because it's like ways of life just pass by.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.480
[Amit Varma]: And you look in the history books and the great books of nonfiction, and you read about

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.640
[Amit Varma]: extraordinary people, but the textures of everyday life and the lives of ordinary people,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.600
[Amit Varma]: I think are also sort of worth capturing.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.360
[Amit Varma]: My other question that comes from that is, of course, your grandparents were outliers.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:47.280
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, I think it's not entirely unusual that they would be from Maharashtra.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.160
[Amit Varma]: Like I definitely expect to be more likely that they are from Maharashtra than many other

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160
[Amit Varma]: states.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.420
[Amit Varma]: And part of the reason and you've also alluded to this in the past is that there is a history

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.640
[Amit Varma]: of different kinds of reform movements in Maharashtra coming right from the Bhakti movement

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.480
[Amit Varma]: and so on, where people have examined caste, people have examined gender, and all of that.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.560
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that, because in a sense, that's also part of your heritage

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560
[Amit Varma]: growing up.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.320
[Amit Varma]: It is also part of the air you breathe, and I'm sure it's shaped you as well in different

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.320
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.240
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you would have an idea of who the specific inspirations for your grandparents may have

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.900
[Amit Varma]: been like, obviously, the Fulets come to mind, you know, seems the most obvious sort of analogue.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.840
[Amit Varma]: But you know, who were the kind of heroes that those people would have had back in those,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, pre-independence days or early days?

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.280
[Guest]: I think for my, I maybe I don't know, honestly, that's the short answer.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.200
[Guest]: But the long answer is probably Gandhiji for my grandparents, because I think they were

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.940
[Guest]: extremely inspired by Gandhi and the nationalist movement.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:58.360
[Guest]: They were a part of this larger Congress, you know, coalition, but they were socialists.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:05.080
[Guest]: So all my, in fact, all the three Asobhas and their wives were socialists, and in fact,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.360
[Guest]: there was this sort of a political cultural organization called Rashtra Seva Dal, which

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.320
[Guest]: all my bhuvas were members of.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.720
[Guest]: And it was a, they would dance and they would do plays and things like that.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:24.140
[Guest]: So there's always been music and dance and acting in the Deshpande soil of my family.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.480
[Guest]: And my father actually broke away from all that when he left Rahimathpur and when he

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.240
[Guest]: came to, went to Baroda first, and then came to Delhi through his, you know, pursuing his

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.760
[Guest]: higher education.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.200
[Guest]: And he got introduced to Marx I, and he delved deeper into A Phule, etc, you know, that part

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.640
[Guest]: of the Maharashtrian heritage, and the Santa Kavita, the whole bhakti literature.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.440
[Guest]: So he was quite an expert, by the way, on that, even though that was not his profession.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.160
[Guest]: And one of his sisters was also a very well-known actor.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.680
[Guest]: So my father had written this commentary on piecing together the Santa Kavita, the Abhangas

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.840
[Guest]: that are very progressive, very radical, take a very anti-caste, gender egalitarian view.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.120
[Guest]: And my aunt has produced that.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.360
[Guest]: So it's a lovely program.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.280
[Guest]: And if it's anywhere online, I'll send you the link for that of Santa Kavita.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:20.160
[Guest]: And so in my father's house, I've seen these volumes, and my father was a Sanskritist,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.080
[Guest]: he knew Sanskrit fluently.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.280
[Guest]: So he read all the texts in the original Sanskrit or Marathi, whichever the language was, but

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.120
[Guest]: he was very, very influenced by the bhakti poetry.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.040
[Guest]: So I think the influence of bhakti, Phule's thought, etc, is more in my father.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.720
[Guest]: And in fact, he ended up writing this play called Satya Shodhak, which turned out to

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.040
[Guest]: be a hit for many reasons, I'll tell you later.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.240
[Guest]: So my introduction to Phule, etc, came through my father.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.080
[Guest]: But through my grandparents, all the Azobas and the Ajjis, it was mainly Gandhi.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.560
[Guest]: And then later on, you know, JP, Lohia, etc, that stage.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.840
[Guest]: And my father's first play, my father was, apart from being a professor in JNU, he was

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.840
[Guest]: also a playwright.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.200
[Guest]: My father's first play, Udvasta Dharmashala, I guess is one of his most, the most well-known

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200
[Guest]: play.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.720
[Guest]: He shows a young professor, and this was written in 1973, so it predates the emergency.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.620
[Guest]: People think it's about the emergency, but it's not.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:19.160
[Guest]: And it's a young professor who's being interrogated by the university committee for making, you

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.840
[Guest]: know, communist or whatever, it's like a McCarthy-ish scenario being adapted to the Indian situation.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.040
[Guest]: And the young professor is a young Marxist, and his father's passed away in the play,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.600
[Guest]: and the uncles are socialists.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.320
[Guest]: So when the professor goes back to, you know, for the funeral or collect books or something,

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.200
[Guest]: the uncles throw him out saying, oh, you opposed your father, you never went down the socialist

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.360
[Guest]: path and you took this other path, etc.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.920
[Guest]: So people read echoes of some autobiographical thing, but my grandfather and my father never

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.320
[Guest]: quarreled and there was never, in that sense, a disagreement.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.640
[Guest]: They were always on the best of terms.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.320
[Guest]: So that's, those are my father's influences.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.980
[Guest]: But I want to just touch to the point that you made earlier about how people are heroes

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.640
[Guest]: in their ordinary lives.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.760
[Guest]: And I want to talk a little bit about my mother's mother.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:12.640
[Guest]: So my mother came from not an extraordinarily radical or progressive family, just a regular

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.040
[Guest]: middle class family, and when she was eight years old, her father and her eldest brother,

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:25.080
[Guest]: the two earning members of the family, died within six months of each other.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: And her own mother was not very well educated, she had education only up to class three.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.480
[Guest]: So all of a sudden, there was this young widow who was 40 years old, with four small children,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.800
[Guest]: youngest being eight years old, that was my mother, no source of income.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.200
[Guest]: So it was a calamity, and of course, relatives stepped in and friends stepped in, etc.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.360
[Guest]: But my grandmother was remarkable.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.560
[Guest]: And she said that I'm not going to bring up my children under terms and conditions set

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560
[Guest]: by others.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.040
[Guest]: You know, I want to be independent, I want my children to be independent.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.480
[Guest]: And she was very skilled at pretty much everything she did.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.200
[Guest]: So she was very skilled at, you know, sewing, like she was a good seamstress, but she had

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.760
[Guest]: never taken tailoring classes or anything like that, you know, she just learned.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.320
[Guest]: So she took tailoring classes, took a loan, took tailoring classes, and then started stitching

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.940
[Guest]: clothes for a living.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:20.360
[Guest]: And my oldest aunt enrolled in nursing college, and there she was to be given three saris

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.920
[Guest]: as uniforms.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.680
[Guest]: She kept two, and she would send one sari back to her mother.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.160
[Guest]: And my grandmother would cut that sari up and make frocks for my mother and the other

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160
[Guest]: sister.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.920
[Guest]: I mean, that's how they survived.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.000
[Guest]: And it's a heroic tale.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.880
[Guest]: And again, I knew it kind of at the background, but as I grew older, and my dad, my mother's

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.680
[Guest]: mother, I always saw her in white, you know, she was always dressed in white, and she was

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.560
[Guest]: a beautiful woman, but she never wore a bindi, she never wore any colored clothes, etc.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.360
[Guest]: And I knew that she did, nobody asked her to do it, but that's just how she was.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.400
[Guest]: And I remember one long conversation with her in Bombay before she passed away, and

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:05.440
[Guest]: she told me the story of her life and how difficult it was to be a widow at 40.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.640
[Guest]: And you know, how she stood by her principles, and she brought up her children the way she

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640
[Guest]: wanted.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640
[Guest]: I mean, of course, it was very hard.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.960
[Guest]: She had to make a few compromises, the children had to, you know, it was not easy at all.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.960
[Guest]: But to the best of her ability, she raised her children.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.880
[Guest]: So that's another story of a very heroic life.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.120
[Guest]: But you know, in a sort of more in an everyday context, but how people can be heroes, you

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.280
[Guest]: know, in an everyday context.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.800
[Guest]: So that's, that's the other side.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:39.680
[Guest]: And that I think, I've seen in my mother, I've seen in her sisters, you know, very strong,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.840
[Guest]: you know, iron willed women would give anybody a run for their money.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: And they, you know, that's, that's how they were, but they were not, you know, they were

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.920
[Guest]: not sort of leftists or anything like that, you know, that that was not there.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.200
[Guest]: My mother eventually became, but not my aunts.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.600
[Guest]: But they were remarkable, you know, just regardless of whatever ideology they followed.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, now I'm thinking that they could be like, you know, if Netflix does Aajobas,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.440
[Amit Varma]: Hotstar could do Aajis.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.800
[Amit Varma]: So two competing shows, and I think I'd actually watch Aajis more, you know, and you mentioned

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.440
[Amit Varma]: that your grandparents were in the Rashtriya Seva Dal, and I'm thinking had they been in

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.600
[Amit Varma]: something called the Lok Seva Dal, then you could have proudly said that all my grandparents

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.600
[Amit Varma]: were on LSD.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.000
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that, you know, getting that out of the way, tell me more about your mom, for

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.920
[Amit Varma]: example, because, you know, she was an activist, she was involved in the women's movement.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.520
[Amit Varma]: You've spoken about how she won every battle in her life, except her last.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about her and what was your relationship with her and so on.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.680
[Guest]: So she became an activist, people remember her as an activist, but actually, that is

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.040
[Guest]: just the last phase of her life.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.200
[Guest]: And I have always said, although, I mean, I've said it to him, I don't know, but I always

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:58.800
[Guest]: like to say that she had much more to her personality than the period of activism that

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.920
[Guest]: that defined, I would say, I don't know, she died when she was 72.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.760
[Guest]: So maybe the last 20-25 years that defined her, which is a long enough period.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.880
[Guest]: And it's really amazing when you think about her age, when she got into this all this activism.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.560
[Guest]: So that's the other remarkable thing.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.880
[Guest]: But she was this very strong-willed, rebellious young woman.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:28.560
[Guest]: And my grandma, that Ajji has told me stories about growing up, how strong-willed and she

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.400
[Guest]: was, when I was growing up, she and I clashed a lot because she was perfect in every way.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.040
[Guest]: And her point was, why can't you be that way?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.720
[Guest]: You know, and my point was, no, you are perfect, I'm not.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.520
[Guest]: And just let's agree to disagree on that question.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.280
[Guest]: No matter how mothers are, you know, so her point is, well, you can do one, two, three,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.720
[Guest]: but why can't you do four, five, six?

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.680
[Guest]: And I'd say, well, you do one, two, three, four, five, six, I'm happy doing one, two,

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680
[Guest]: three, let me be.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.280
[Guest]: So we would clash a lot.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.920
[Guest]: And you know, as you probably realize, between my parents and us, they always had this very

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:07.960
[Guest]: open atmosphere of, you can say anything to us, and we will say, but it was all very civil.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.480
[Guest]: And it was never preachy, it was they never talked down to us.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.200
[Guest]: So we could question them, just as they would tell us to do things, and they had to justify

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.720
[Guest]: every single instruction that they gave us.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.440
[Guest]: So it wasn't like, do this, because I'm telling you to do it, do it, because these are the

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.280
[Guest]: benefits of doing it, and so on.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.160
[Guest]: So my mother was a tough, toughie.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.880
[Guest]: She was really, really tough.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.000
[Guest]: And she was very disciplined herself.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.320
[Guest]: So she would expect that discipline from other people.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.680
[Guest]: And as a child growing up, that's never, you know, one always clashes with parents when

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.560
[Guest]: you're asked to clean your room or whatever, whatever.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.640
[Guest]: So but she was remarkable.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.800
[Guest]: I mean, so she married this man, theirs was also a love marriage.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.720
[Guest]: So I mean, for me, when I hear the term love marriage, it's very odd, because most marriages

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.720
[Guest]: in my family, starting with my grandparents, have been love marriage.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.720
[Guest]: So very few have been arranged.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.160
[Guest]: So in our family, when there's an arranged marriage, we say, oh, that's an arranged match.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.160
[Guest]: You know, it's unusual.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.680
[Guest]: A step into the unknown, a bold step.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.880
[Guest]: Or somebody is not, some woman is not working, as in not every, all women work all the time.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.840
[Guest]: Obviously, I know that, and you know that, but by working, I mean, not working for pay

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.320
[Guest]: or not going outside the house.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.520
[Guest]: When somebody doesn't do that, it becomes unusual.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:22.880
[Guest]: Oh, she's, she's not doing anything else, because every woman in my family does a million

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.080
[Guest]: things.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:30.120
[Guest]: And so my mother went to Baroda for her undergrad, because those days, Baroda was of course,

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.800
[Guest]: MSU was very good.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.880
[Guest]: And in Maharashtra, it was quite common for young people to go to Baroda, and my father

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:41.200
[Guest]: was also there, but they didn't meet, I mean, they kind of met, but not really met kind

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200
[Guest]: of a thing.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.520
[Guest]: That was not, that was not where their love story started.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.400
[Guest]: And then she joined the Home Guards.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.560
[Guest]: And so she learned to ride a truck, she learned to ride a fire engine.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.040
[Guest]: She's rescued people from, you know, that crane that goes up to the top floor of a building

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.640
[Guest]: and rescues children from a building on fire.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640
[Guest]: She's done that.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.640
[Guest]: Wow.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
[Guest]: She could ride a horse.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.720
[Guest]: She was a fabulous swimmer.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.240
[Guest]: And she could cook and clean and keep house and stitch and knit, and I don't know what

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240
[Amit Varma]: else.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.920
[Guest]: Yaar yeh Forrest Gump wali story ho gayi.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.080
[Guest]: Matlab, you know, and she would say, you know, I'm going to teach you stitching.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.600
[Guest]: I said, No, I'm never going to touch a needle and a thread.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.600
[Guest]: She said, but I can do that.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.600
[Guest]: And I can do this.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.400
[Guest]: I said, you do that and this and whatever else you want to do.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.200
[Guest]: I'm just going to do two, three things.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.280
[Guest]: So anyway, so she was in the Home Guards and she got posted to Delhi as a part of a Home

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280
[Guest]: Guards.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.360
[Guest]: She was a working woman.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.440
[Guest]: And her uncle, who was a widower, was in the government at that time.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.720
[Guest]: So he was a part of the early bureaucrats, you know, post-independence.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: And they had a house on Wellesley Road, which is now called Zakir Hussain Marg.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: And he was a widower.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Guest]: His son was studying somewhere.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Guest]: Anyway, so he used to live alone.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.960
[Guest]: So she used to just live there because it was just convenient to be there.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.080
[Guest]: And my father had come to Delhi for his MA.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.180
[Guest]: And that's how they met through a common friend, etc.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.040
[Guest]: So they met and they fell in love.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.800
[Guest]: And then my father went to Hong Kong because he was a China specialist.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.260
[Guest]: He was, you know, his bread and butter job was a professor of China studies in JNU.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.620
[Guest]: So at that time, mainland China was not open for foreign researchers.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.480
[Guest]: So they went to Hong Kong.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.080
[Guest]: And I was almost born in Hong Kong because I was going to be born.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.940
[Guest]: And then my mother's family put pressure, no, first child, first child, you must always

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.760
[Guest]: come back to the mother's house, etc, etc.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.480
[Guest]: My mother was, I think, quite happy to give birth to me there.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.560
[Guest]: So she came back and then I was born, then my brother was born, etc.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.460
[Guest]: And then JNU didn't exist as an institution then.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: So in 1970, JNU got established.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.280
[Guest]: And there was a School of International Studies, which was an independent organization that

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.620
[Guest]: got co-opted into JNU, lock, stock and barrel.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.300
[Guest]: And everybody who was in SIS went to JNU, so did my father.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.880
[Guest]: And we moved to JNU campus, I don't know if you've had an occasion to see it, which was

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.320
[Guest]: at that time completely the outskirts of the city.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: So everything that you see around the JNU campus now didn't exist.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.700
[Guest]: There was no bus service, there was no cars, nobody had a car.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:18.560
[Guest]: And there were 36 families living in this 1000 acre forest area, completely disconnected

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560
[Guest]: from anywhere else.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.480
[Guest]: There were just two JNU buses that connected to the city once in the morning, once in the

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480
[Guest]: evening bus.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: So it was like living on an island in some sort.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.440
[Guest]: And then my mother realized it was going to be very difficult for her to manage doing

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.640
[Guest]: a job and children and you know, living in that remote place, etc.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.760
[Guest]: So she stopped working outside for a living, but she did many other things.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:49.760
[Guest]: She learned Braille and started translating books in children's books in Braille for blind

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.760
[Guest]: children.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.960
[Guest]: So she used to work on a voluntary basis with the blind school, which is near Oberoi Hotel

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.040
[Guest]: here in Delhi.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.600
[Guest]: So then she learned macrame and I don't know any skill that she didn't have.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.120
[Guest]: She learned that while we were growing up and she was in JNU.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.400
[Guest]: And then she declared one day that she was going to enroll for this five year BAMA course

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.780
[Guest]: learning French.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.020
[Guest]: She told us and my father, we used to have this sort of family.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.120
[Guest]: So the rule was everybody must have dinner together, always.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.120
[Guest]: And there was no TV in the house.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.480
[Guest]: So you know, we had to talk to each other.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.600
[Guest]: And there was this All India Radio used to play a national program of classical music

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.960
[Guest]: that used to be playing on the background.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.040
[Guest]: And we would have dinner and all these conversations and all the fights and everything used to

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.640
[Guest]: take place over dinner.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.160
[Guest]: And she declared that she was going to join French.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:45.440
[Guest]: And so we said, aren't you very old and to a child, the parents are always very old.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.680
[Guest]: So she said, I don't care.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.680
[Guest]: And she was like that.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.960
[Guest]: She didn't care.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.880
[Guest]: And she joined this integrated BAMA program.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.200
[Guest]: So JNU has these five year integrated language programs.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.040
[Guest]: So you join after school and you do three years of, if you do three years, you get a

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.040
[Guest]: BA degree.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.560
[Guest]: If you do full five years, you get an integrated BAMA degree.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:12.660
[Guest]: And because she didn't know French, she joined the first year and her classmates were obviously

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.360
[Guest]: stayed out of school.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.840
[Guest]: And she was this mother of two children, you know, we were not teenagers yet, but I wasn't

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.840
[Guest]: a teenager yet.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.120
[Guest]: Still, I mean, you know, I must have been 11 or 12, whatever I was.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.240
[Guest]: And so the classmates were much younger than her, but she was not self-conscious at all.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:38.120
[Guest]: And she did this five year French course, you know, and in between my father got a fellowship

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120
[Guest]: to go to Germany.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.640
[Guest]: So we all, family, Boria Bistra, all of us, we went off to Germany and we went to school

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: there and my mother had broken her, but she learned German there.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.800
[Guest]: So she was quite a linguist, you know, apart from Gujarati.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.200
[Guest]: Marathi, Hindi and English that she already knew.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.240
[Guest]: She was fluent in French and she picked up German when we were there.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.200
[Guest]: And even my father was quite, was quite a linguist.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.760
[Guest]: So they were both, you know, so anyway, we spent time in Germany and we came back.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:12.080
[Guest]: She finished her French masters and then she started doing live translations, you know,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.080
[Guest]: interpretations rather.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.440
[Guest]: So when your heads of state come and there's this voice that comes through that, she was

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.760
[Guest]: one of those voices.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:25.440
[Guest]: And as a part of that, in the 1982 NAM summit, when Fidel Castro had come to India and Indira

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:33.720
[Guest]: Gandhi was the prime minister, she got a job there as an interpreter for the French team.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.800
[Guest]: And while she was inside Vigyan Bhavan, because it was all very highly security controlled

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:43.360
[Guest]: and all that, she found out that Mrs. Gandhi was going to be a press conference, which

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.000
[Guest]: was only allowed for members with a press card.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.280
[Guest]: And obviously she didn't have a press card, but I don't know how she faked her way and

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:55.520
[Guest]: she entered that hall and she asked Mrs. Gandhi a very uncomfortable question, which at the

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.520
[Guest]: moment I can't remember.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.240
[Guest]: It was something to do with something that Mrs. Gandhi had done, you know, some authoritarian

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.900
[Guest]: move, till people found out that she was not a journalist.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:12.000
[Guest]: But in that large Vigyan Bhavan hall, so she was a gutsy woman like I haven't seen, you

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
[Guest]: know.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.520
[Guest]: So this is all her pre-activist phase, by the way.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.960
[Guest]: So her pre-activist, and of course she was, you know, she taught us swimming, she was

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.880
[Guest]: cycling, swimming, everything, she used to drive the car.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:29.320
[Guest]: I mean, we didn't have a car then, but eventually when we got a car, she was the driver.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.200
[Guest]: And in fact, in the ration card, Parivar Ka Mukhiya was my mother, my father said, okay,

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.660
[Guest]: you just, you know, and my father was a perfect antidote to her in that sense.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:43.080
[Guest]: He was the most laid back, just sitting in a chair, drawing circles in the air kind of

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.120
[Guest]: a guy.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.560
[Guest]: And she was the doer and the mover and the shaker and so very remarkable personalities,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.720
[Guest]: but very opposed to each other.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.960
[Guest]: But you know, both with tremendous influence in their own ways.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.480
[Guest]: But when I see parents of today, young people who, you know, with small children, or our

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.440
[Guest]: students who were kids, whatever, 15 years ago, 16 years ago, there's one thing I realized

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.380
[Guest]: is that our parents never shielded us from anything.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:17.560
[Guest]: It was never the case that don't read this book, or don't watch this movie, or nobody

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.160
[Guest]: should say anything that will hurt my child.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.920
[Guest]: You know, nowadays, when I see parents, it's a very controlled environment that their children

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920
[Guest]: are in.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.840
[Guest]: And so when they come to university, when they hear things that they've never heard

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:37.440
[Guest]: before, like some very, you know, obscurantist or regressive view or something like that,

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.640
[Guest]: they almost explode because their parents have protected them so much and our parents

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.600
[Guest]: have never protected us.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.280
[Guest]: They never told us, you know, believe in religion or don't believe, eat this or don't eat this,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.840
[Guest]: listen to this music or don't listen to that music.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.120
[Guest]: The only thing they told us is that you make your choices and you're responsible for the

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.120
[Guest]: consequences.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.880
[Guest]: So if it's bad, it's bad.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.720
[Guest]: I mean, if the consequence is bad, you have to learn to deal with it, because you made

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.520
[Guest]: that choice.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.720
[Guest]: You know, so my brother and I, we can't blame other people because we have always been told

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.720
[Guest]: that whatever is happening to you, maybe other people played a role sometime, but at the

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.320
[Guest]: end of the day, it's your life, you have to sort it out, you know, just get up and get

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.920
[Guest]: on with it kind of a thing.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:25.120
[Guest]: So very tough in that way, in a way that I'm not as a parent, because I feel like they

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.320
[Guest]: were, I guess, a little too tough, you know, just throw children at the deep end of the

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.660
[Guest]: pool and let them swim kind of a thing.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.720
[Guest]: So I tend to be a little more protective towards my daughter, or I used to be, now she's an

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.400
[Guest]: adult in her own right.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.920
[Guest]: But it taught us things, taught us to be independent, taught us to realize that, you know, at the

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.040
[Guest]: end of the day, it's your life.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.120
[Guest]: If it's going well, it's great.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.200
[Guest]: If it's not, then you need to figure out how to fix it, you know.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.960
[Amit Varma]: So those are lessons.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.960
[Amit Varma]: So inspiring.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my parents also had a love marriage, but my mother did not do most of these things

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.960
[Unknown]: that you mentioned.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.360
[Amit Varma]: Is there a, I'm just thinking of this whole, you know, this press conferencing of her breaking

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.040
[Amit Varma]: in and asking a question to Indira Gandhi.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Was it captured on camera?

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.920
[Guest]: Is there a YouTube clip of it?

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.920
[Guest]: No.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.200
[Guest]: So there were lots of things from that time that should be somewhere.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.040
[Guest]: So for example, another, you know, anecdote from my childhood is because my father was

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040
[Guest]: a playwright.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:29.360
[Guest]: I mean, he became a playwright eventually, but, you know, back in 72, 73, he was in JNU.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.320
[Guest]: I mean, JNU had just gotten established, so he was in SIS and so therefore in JNU.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:40.080
[Guest]: But writing, he had started to work on a play, but he was obviously must have been inclined

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.520
[Guest]: towards that field.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.240
[Guest]: And so he had a lot of friends in the artistic world.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.880
[Guest]: And so when we were really small children, all the names that today we think of as big

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.280
[Guest]: names in the artistic circuit for us, they were so and so maushi, so and so kaka, so

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.480
[Guest]: and so, you know, kaku and so on.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.520
[Guest]: So for example, Sai Paranspe was Sai Maushi.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.800
[Guest]: And those days we used to live in Lajpat Nagar 4 because JNU campus hadn't been built.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.280
[Guest]: And Sai Paranspe used to live in Lajpat Nagar 2, which was across the ring road.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.360
[Guest]: And there were two of us and Sai Maushi also had two children and her daughter is also

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.480
[Guest]: Ashwini and so am I.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:23.760
[Guest]: So that Ashwini started to be called Vini because to distinguish between the two Ashwinis.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.360
[Guest]: And she used to be married to Arun Joglekar at that time.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.080
[Guest]: So Arun kaka, Sai Maushi and Vini and Gautam was their son.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.240
[Guest]: They were in and then there were us, there was us.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.840
[Guest]: And so we were in each other's like the children were in each other's homes all the time.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.320
[Guest]: And Sai Paranspe was in the Doordarshan at that time.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.560
[Guest]: I don't know exactly what position she held, but she definitely was in charge of the children's

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560
[Guest]: programming.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.800
[Guest]: But Chokha Karekram used to come in the evening, so she was in charge of that.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:59.800
[Guest]: And Vini and I were used as the default, like default performance as it were.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:06.440
[Guest]: So whenever she, she kept shooting us, you know, walking to the market, playing, playing

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.360
[Guest]: with dolls, doing this, doing that, etc. etc.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.680
[Guest]: She would just say ki acha chalo abhi shooting hai, abhi yahan se wahan tak bijao.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.440
[Guest]: And then I remember, in fact, one thing that I very vividly remember is she had done this

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.680
[Guest]: film with my parents and me going to the zoo.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.760
[Guest]: And apparently I was a very well behaved child.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.920
[Guest]: That's what people say.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.360
[Guest]: But she wanted to film a badly behaved child.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.080
[Guest]: And so she taught me about how to create a tantrum, throw a tantrum when we went to some

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080
[Guest]: particular cage.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.360
[Guest]: So we had to rehearse that.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.400
[Guest]: And it was tough because I didn't behave like that as a child at that time.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.680
[Guest]: But she taught me, etc.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.000
[Guest]: And then I remember doing many takes, my parents walking with me up to that cage.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.480
[Guest]: And then I'm like, oh, I want ice cream or whatever it was I was asked to do.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.840
[Guest]: And so all those films, I don't know where they are.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.600
[Unknown]: Somebody has got to find them and put them on YouTube.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.920
[Amit Varma]: This is the renowned economist Ashwini Deshpande throwing a tantrum at a cage.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.720
[Guest]: In fact, I met Sai Paranth many years ago, you know, as an adult.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.080
[Guest]: And I asked her, I said, what happened to all those films that you made with Winnie

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.080
[Guest]: and me?

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.960
[Guest]: And she said, yeah, I know how we lose.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.080
[Guest]: I mean, she also didn't know where those films were.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And earlier you mentioned your mom driving and reminds me of something that happened

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.000
[Amit Varma]: in the early 90s when Thelma and Louise was going to be released in Saudi Arabia.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, women were at that time banned from driving there.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.200
[Amit Varma]: I believe that law has just been lifted.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.680
[Amit Varma]: So when films would come, they would cut all scenes of women driving, which is why Thelma

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.960
[Amit Varma]: and Louise ended up at four minutes.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.280
[Amit Varma]: This might well be apocryphal.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me now, what were you like as a kid growing up?

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.020
[Amit Varma]: Like you've given me a really nice sense of the environment at home, where you have these

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.960
[Amit Varma]: independent people around you who are not talking down to you or preaching or being

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960
[Amit Varma]: paternalistic.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.560
[Amit Varma]: You can, you know, talk to them as equals, you can do all of that.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.960
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, there are these other strands, like in the sense, I'm guessing that there

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.320
[Amit Varma]: must be a respect for scholarship and academia because of, you know, who your dad was and

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.060
[Amit Varma]: what he did, and also your mom learning all these things.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you know, and in every typical Maharashtrian household, perhaps,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.240
[Amit Varma]: but yours, there must also be this respect for the arts and learning and all that.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, you know, both your parents were sort of creators in different ways.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that environment in which you grew up and how that shaped you

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.880
[Amit Varma]: and what were you like as a kid?

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.480
[Guest]: So in terms of the artistic connection, it was a very strong one.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.200
[Guest]: I mean, my father eventually became a playwright, but he must was already starting to work on

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.300
[Guest]: his plays.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.640
[Guest]: His sister, my bua, one of my buas, was at that time a student at the National School

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.640
[Amit Varma]: of Drama.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.640
[Guest]: I don't get Sulbha Deshpande?

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.640
[Amit Varma]: No, Jyoti Deshpande.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640
[Amit Varma]: Jyoti Deshpande.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640
[Amit Varma]: She's now called Jyoti Subhash.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.920
[Guest]: That's a married, married, and her daughter, in fact, is now making waves, Amruta Subhash,

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.920
[Amit Varma]: who was...

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I've heard of her.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.920
[Guest]: So Amruta is my cousin.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920
[Unknown]: Wow.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.600
[Guest]: So Amruta's mother, Jyoti, who at that time was Jyoti Deshpande, was a student at NSD.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.640
[Guest]: And she was the classmate of Nasir and Om.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.680
[Guest]: And they were best buddies.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680
[Guest]: So they would always...

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680
[Guest]: And that's the other thing.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.400
[Guest]: I mean, they would always come to our house because they were in the hostel.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.760
[Guest]: They were tired of hostel food.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.920
[Guest]: And they would call my father, bhai sahab and bhabhi.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.880
[Guest]: And so they would go in, bhai sahab, bhabhi, bhook lagi hai.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.320
[Guest]: And my mother would always dish out, you know, there's some amazing food for them, etc.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.400
[Guest]: And of course, at that time, they were not at all well known.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:32.420
[Guest]: And Om Puri, both of them had faces that were not traditionally suited to what a Hindi film

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.440
[Guest]: hero should look like.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.760
[Amit Varma]: So did you ever think ki yeh kaise actor banenge?

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.520
[Guest]: No, I had seen them in plays.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.560
[Guest]: Because that was the other thing, because my abua was used to act.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.000
[Guest]: So Ibrahim Alkazi was the director of NSD at that time.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.640
[Guest]: And so Rohini Hattangadi, I think was one bad senior, Jaidev Hattangadi was one bad

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.120
[Guest]: senior, there was Manohar Singh, there was Sai Paranspe.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:57.560
[Guest]: So all these theatre people, and my father, by the way, also was a very good actor.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:04.640
[Guest]: So in fact, Sai Paranspe did this remarkably funny play called Ek Tamasha Achcha Khasa,

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.560
[Guest]: in which she took the Tamasha form, and made a political satire about the state of the

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.360
[Guest]: country at that time.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.520
[Guest]: And my father played the Bhondu Maharaja in that.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.720
[Guest]: She played the Maharani, Sai Paranspe played the Maharani.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.920
[Guest]: And Arun Joglakar was the cunning Mantri, who's basically running the show.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.560
[Guest]: And it was hilarious.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.560
[Guest]: And so there was a time when I remember the dialogue.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:36.260
[Guest]: When Ghashiram Kotwal was being done in Marathi in Maharashtra, and Rajendra Nath produced

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.640
[Guest]: it in Hindi in Delhi.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.400
[Guest]: And my father was one of the Brahmins, you know, I don't know if you've seen Ghashiram

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.400
[Guest]: Kotwal, but the wall of Brahmins that's at the back, so he was one of those.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.840
[Guest]: So we as kids, and my mother and Jyoti, my aunt, because all the women had to wear nine

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.760
[Guest]: yard sarees, so they were part of production, you know, doing the costumes and everything.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:01.600
[Guest]: And so, unbelievable number of afternoons after school was spent in this Ghashiram rehearsal,

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.560
[Guest]: you know, in the green room.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.600
[Guest]: And even the other kids in school used to say, you know, don't your parents, aren't

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.560
[Guest]: they worried about homework and things like that?

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.880
[Guest]: I said, pata nahi, I mean, we just get picked up and we are taken to the rehearsal because

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.320
[Guest]: both my parents were then, there was no, we were not rich enough to have nannies or babysitters

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.720
[Guest]: or maids or anything like that.

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.640
[Guest]: So we went wherever our parents went.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:27.840
[Guest]: And so it was this bordering on bohemian kind of a childhood with all these, you know, theatre

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.840
[Guest]: walas.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.880
[Guest]: And then, of course, my father's play started, then Dr. Lagu acted in it, Sriram Lagu acted

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.720
[Guest]: in the Marathi production.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:40.440
[Guest]: So then Dr. Lagu, his family, and then, you know, various Amol Palikar, etc, etc, just

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.920
[Guest]: people who later on we realized were, you know, just this very, very creative people.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.560
[Guest]: And my mother also was a very good actor.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.160
[Guest]: So she had used to act in college plays and all, but through my father, she also got an

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.160
[Guest]: avenue for acting.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.240
[Guest]: And even on her side, you know, there are, they are not, they didn't make, nobody made

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.040
[Guest]: a career, but her, my cousins and all her nieces, they are, you know, they've acted

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.440
[Guest]: in school, college plays and, or society plays and things like that.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.420
[Guest]: So there is that creative streak there.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.200
[Guest]: But my father's side is the sort of most pronounced.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:15.160
[Guest]: So my father is a playwright, my bua Jyoti is an incredibly gifted actor, you should

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.680
[Guest]: watch some of her work if you can.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.920
[Guest]: For personal reasons, then she quit acting and she went to Maharashtra and she married

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:27.240
[Guest]: her, the man that she was, she was, she had decided to marry, that was Subhash, her husband.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.640
[Guest]: And so then she, Jyoti, Amrita is her, is her daughter.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.560
[Guest]: So and, but even my other buas who didn't make a career of the arts, they are incredibly

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.120
[Guest]: artistically gifted.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.520
[Guest]: They can all sing, they can all dance.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.160
[Guest]: And they are now in their 70s, but if they start dancing, you should see, oh man, they

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.560
[Guest]: can, they can give the youngsters a run for their money.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.560
[Guest]: So there's a very, very strong artistic environment.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.240
[Guest]: Jyoti, my aunt, is a very good singer.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.680
[Guest]: Amrita is a fantastic singer.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:04.120
[Guest]: My grandmother, that's Moti, the Rahimatpur grandmother, she could sing really well.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:09.240
[Guest]: So yeah, there's a very, very strong artistic sort of influence.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.880
[Guest]: I guess I'm the outlier in that sense.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:16.360
[Guest]: I mean, I have not done anything in the field of the arts, in a way that many members of

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.920
[Guest]: my family have.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:25.160
[Amit Varma]: This was true until last week, when my tweet with you singing got some 84,000 retweets

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:30.920
[Amit Varma]: or whatever it is, and perhaps this is, you know, a late start to a well-deserved artistic

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.920
[Amit Varma]: career.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.360
[Amit Varma]: No, I linked to the tweet, you can see the 84,000 retweets.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.560
[Amit Varma]: So Twitter keeps bringing these numbers down, I don't know why.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.480
[Amit Varma]: But clearly, you were also drawn to films and music and singing and all of that.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.480
[Amit Varma]: So how was that?

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:48.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also fascinated by another side of your father that you have mentioned elsewhere,

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.920
[Amit Varma]: but we haven't touched upon yet here.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'll ask you to touch upon that is how he was deeply into cinema.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And according to him, there were four kinds of cinema.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.480
[Guest]: So I really want to know more about this.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.840
[Guest]: So he was a really chilled out guy, as they say today.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.640
[Guest]: I mean, literally, it's possible that you enter a room and you don't notice that he's

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.200
[Guest]: sitting there.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.440
[Guest]: And you think that he's doing nothing.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.600
[Guest]: But actually, he's thinking about the piece that he's going to write.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.720
[Guest]: And bombs could explode in his vicinity, but he would just sit sitting in his chair.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.160
[Guest]: Sometimes he would say, Baba, what are you doing?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.080
[Guest]: Do something, you know, I've said that to him often.

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:32.800
[Guest]: And so he would laugh and say, yeah, you know, and all of us, including me are so hyper,

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.640
[Guest]: oh, I need my room and I need my study and I'm shutting the door and don't come in and

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.840
[Guest]: da da da.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.440
[Guest]: And he would just literally like the way I'm sitting now, you can see you do this.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.480
[Guest]: And then he would start making circles in the air.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.620
[Guest]: And then he would do then he would get up, walk a little bit and he would have some imaginary

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.200
[Guest]: argument with somebody and then come back.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.960
[Guest]: And then suddenly he would get up, find a surface, it could be a table, it could be

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.960
[Guest]: anything.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:03.040
[Guest]: Take a piece of paper and write literally without crossing a single word.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:12.680
[Guest]: I don't know, 1500, 2000 words at a stretch, beautiful, clean, elegant writing.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.360
[Guest]: So all this while that we thought he was just doing nothing randomly, he was formulating

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360
[Guest]: his argument.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.400
[Guest]: But it was crystal clear.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.020
[Guest]: And you know, his writing is in the public domain, so you can read it for the absolutely

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:29.640
[Guest]: brilliant clarity that that his mind possessed.

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.640
[Guest]: What was your question?

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.960
[Guest]: I got carried away talking about my father.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.800
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm very happy to, you know, you can go in any direction you want.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.240
[Guest]: But I'd asked you about the four different kinds of cinema and his love for movies.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.400
[Guest]: So yeah, so that's what it was.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:48.200
[Guest]: So he, when we were growing up, Hindi cinema was not something that educated families watched.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.840
[Guest]: This is post liberalization phenomenon where now everybody can, you know, watches Bollywood

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.840
[Guest]: and whatever.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:58.000
[Guest]: Our time, most of the people that we knew were not allowed to watch Hindi cinema.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.120
[Guest]: The only things films ever allowed was Guddi or Jagriti or, you know, with good message,

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.160
[Guest]: you know, Desh Bhakti Ka or Bhai Ke Pyar Ka or things like that.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.760
[Guest]: Certainly no sexy songs or anything like that.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.960
[Guest]: And but he would watch because he would say that popular cinema is the pulse of the people.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.240
[Guest]: This is what people are thinking.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.000
[Guest]: And the way Hindi cinema understands the pulse of the people, no other medium can.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.200
[Guest]: And so, for example, when Jai Santoshi Ma became a runway hit, he wanted to see it.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.480
[Guest]: And at that time, the rest of the family drew a line saying, not Jai Santoshi Ma, please,

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.480
[Guest]: we are not watching.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.960
[Guest]: And he said, no, Ashwini, I think we have to watch Jai Santoshi Ma.

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:43.800
[Guest]: So he and I, because we had heard stories of people going with thalis and doing puja

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.640
[Guest]: to the screen.

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.480
[Guest]: I mean, it was a cult movie, you know, of its time.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.240
[Guest]: And he said, we don't have to participate in that in that sentiment, but we need to

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.040
[Guest]: understand what that sentiment is about.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.960
[Guest]: You know, so till his dying day, literally, he would wanted to watch movies in the theater,

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.960
[Guest]: not on the TV, because he said, when you see audience interacting with the movie, then

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.600
[Guest]: you realize the magic that it was having.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:14.040
[Guest]: And one of the last films I saw with him was English Vinglish in the theater in Pune.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.400
[Guest]: And it was, I said, oh, should I get a, you know, DVD, should we watch it?

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.480
[Guest]: And he said, no, no, no, let's go to the theater.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.400
[Guest]: So we went.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.000
[Guest]: And that was Sridevi's comeback film, as you know.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.120
[Guest]: And when she first enters, when you first see her on the screen, you see her back.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.200
[Guest]: And then she turns around.

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.440
[Guest]: And the audience went into raptures, I mean, the kind of whistles and the clapping that

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:43.280
[Guest]: you saw, I saw then, I had only seen in Amitabh Bachchan movie and Shah Rukh Khan.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.760
[Guest]: And so then Baba said, see, would you have been able to see this if you had watched this

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.680
[Guest]: movie at home?

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.760
[Guest]: This is the influence that Sridevi has.

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:57.120
[Guest]: This is why she's the India's first and only female superstar, etc, etc.

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.160
[Guest]: So his point was that there is nothing called a good film or a bad film.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.320
[Guest]: Films are either entertain, make you, you know, make you enjoy them.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.440
[Guest]: So for him, enjoyment was the key.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.760
[Guest]: And so he classified films into four categories.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.320
[Guest]: He said the good, good films, which are like the Rays and the, you know, the masterpieces,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.960
[Guest]: world cinema type, you know.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.360
[Guest]: Then there are the good, bad films.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.280
[Guest]: So these are commercial potboilers, Dun Dinon Ke Liye Main, Manmohan Desai, Sholay would

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.960
[Guest]: be the best, I guess, good, bad film ever in India.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.080
[Guest]: And then there are the bad, good films, which he hated, which is the films with the message,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.600
[Guest]: arty films, you know, where there's no dialogue for 15 minutes.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.440
[Guest]: It's this, you know, this one flower, you keep focusing on that and nothing is happening.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.960
[Guest]: And his point is, you know, I spent two hours in the theatre, what did I get out of it?

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.960
[Guest]: What did I learn out of this?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.280
[Guest]: You know, you can't bore your audience out of the theatres.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.840
[Guest]: So that's what he called, or the preachy ones, you know, message about, you know, secularism

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.520
[Guest]: or something, some progressive thought, but just boring at the end of the day.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.120
[Guest]: So those were, in his view, the bad, good films.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.120
[Guest]: And then there were the bad, bad, the C grade, B grade type, which are just bad, I mean,

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.960
[Guest]: in every possible way.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.080
[Guest]: So he said, you must always watch the good, good.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.900
[Guest]: And you must always watch the good, bad.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.480
[Guest]: And you obviously will never know in advance what is what.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:26.320
[Guest]: So you could end up being, it could be a bad, bad, but that's a risk you have to take.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.520
[Guest]: So watch all films, how will you know otherwise, what it is?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.000
[Guest]: And I remember, and those days were not days of multiplex, so there were four shows, 12-3,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.480
[Guest]: 3-6, 6-9, 9-12.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.560
[Guest]: And because we used to live in JNU, it was very far and our school was Sardar Patel,

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.040
[Guest]: which was very far.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.640
[Guest]: So 9-12 at night was the only show which was possible for us, given that we didn't have

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.840
[Guest]: a car.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.920
[Guest]: We live very far away from, you know, movie theatres, etc.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.880
[Guest]: And there was this Priya movie theatre, which was about a 20 to 30 minute walk from our

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.800
[Guest]: house.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:06.600
[Guest]: So a very common routine in the Deshpande JNU household was have an early dinner and

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:15.040
[Guest]: walk, go to Priya, there was a Nirula's parlor, buy ice cream, then go to and watch 9-12,

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.360
[Guest]: come back home at 12-30 or whatever.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.520
[Guest]: But there was no escape from school the next day.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.480
[Guest]: So it could not ever be excused that if I watch a 9-12 movie tomorrow, I won't go to

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480
[Guest]: school today.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480
[Guest]: That was not the thing.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.640
[Guest]: So my parents would say, are you willing to get up tomorrow and go to school?

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640
[Guest]: Yes.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.960
[Guest]: And then I remember once going to school and telling my classmates, you know, we saw Kurbani

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
[Guest]: last night at 9-12.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:41.840
[Guest]: Kurbani is of course, Zeenat Aman with her very explicit and just very sensuous portrayal.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.320
[Guest]: And my friends said, who did you go with?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320
[Guest]: Didn't your parents object?

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.440
[Guest]: I said, we went with our parents.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.600
[Guest]: You know, but they were never ones for shielding us.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.120
[Guest]: You know, their point is, you make up your minds about how you're going to view these

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.760
[Guest]: things and how you're going to process the information that you get.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.000
[Guest]: You must have the ability to separate the good from the bad, the influences you want

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.080
[Guest]: to imbibe.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.100
[Guest]: And often my father, you know, people would say, you know, how do you allow your children

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.100
[Guest]: to watch all this?

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:15.040
[Guest]: And so his point is, well, I'm hoping that they will grow up to be sensible, but supposing

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.380
[Guest]: they don't grow up to be sensible, then that's what it is.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.480
[Guest]: And that will happen even if I suppress, you know, they will find ways of supposing they

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.880
[Guest]: turn out to be bigoted or just, you know, have very views that I don't agree with.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.280
[Guest]: But that might happen anyway.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.760
[Guest]: So by stopping them from reading this book or watching this movie, et cetera, I'm not

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.920
[Guest]: gaining, I mean, I'm not preventing that thing from happening.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.720
[Guest]: Whereas this way, you know, and it was the same for everything, for, you know, alcohol,

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.040
[Guest]: because he knew that there would come a time when we would grow up and we would taste alcohol.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.240
[Guest]: I mean, that's, it's never the case that that's never going to happen, right?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.800
[Guest]: So how do you deal with that transition, you know?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.400
[Guest]: So they were very down to earth in that, in that manner.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.040
[Guest]: So there was very, I mean, not that we shared every single, you know, gory detail from our

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.800
[Guest]: lives with them, obviously not because they were parents, but there were no fundamental

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.560
[Guest]: secrets between us and them.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.960
[Guest]: I mean, not because they'll judge us, no.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.740
[Guest]: I mean, it's not cool to tell your parents everything.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.680
[Guest]: So that way we didn't tell them everything, but there was no fear that, Oh my God, if

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.320
[Guest]: I tell this to Baba or I, they'll say, Oh my God, how did you do this?

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.160
[Guest]: Or you drank a glass of wine?

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160
[Guest]: How could you, et cetera?

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.800
[Guest]: You know, there was never such, there was no fear like that, girlfriends, boyfriends,

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.920
[Guest]: their point was, you know, all your friends are welcome, whether you're romantically involved

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.320
[Guest]: or not openly.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.200
[Amit Varma]: So lovely.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.360
[Amit Varma]: And I love the distinction of good, good films, good, bad films, bad, good films, and bad,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360
[Amit Varma]: bad films.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they can sometimes be a confusion between good, bad and bad, bad.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560
[Unknown]: I mean, what is bad?

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Bad?

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.200
[Amit Varma]: Like I recorded an episode a couple of days back.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.120
[Amit Varma]: I don't know when it will release in relation to your, this one, but with Jai Arjun Singh

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.960
[Amit Varma]: and Subrat Mohanty and Subrat gave this delightful story about how he arrived at the motto for

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: his life.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And he told me about how he watched a B Subhash film once, Babbar Subhash, and it's a film

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.040
[Unknown]: called Dance Dance.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.120
[Amit Varma]: So basically in it, there are these two dancers, they go to Amrish Puri, Amrish Puri spots

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.760
[Amit Varma]: them somewhere gets a fancy for the woman and invites a couple home and basically murders

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:28.960
[Amit Varma]: them and their children, who later later grow up to be Mithun Chakravorty and Smita Patil.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.200
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, so apparently at one point, these children still played by child actors before

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.280
[Amit Varma]: they grow up to be whoever are at a beach and the boy is really starving and he's like,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.040
[Amit Varma]: and she puts his head on his lap and they don't have food to eat and this is Juhu Beach.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.360
[Amit Varma]: And she starts singing to him, something to that effect, I'll link the song from the show

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360
[Amit Varma]: notes.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.480
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually one guy comes and like he's a halwa wala, but there is and I've never

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.720
[Amit Varma]: seen a halwa wala on Juhu Beach, of course.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:02.080
[Amit Varma]: But the twist is that to get the halwa, he has to dance, there is something like that.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.960
[Amit Varma]: So this little girl tells a little boy this immortal line, ki zindagi mein ek baat yaad

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:14.200
[Amit Varma]: rakhna, ki agar halwa khana hai toh naachno parega, dance, dance, which Shubhrat adopted

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.880
[Amit Varma]: as a motto for his life and to me represents this profound human truth.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'm thinking I haven't even seen Dance Dance, but I have made up my mind ki boss,

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.880
[Guest]: this is a good bad film.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.240
[Guest]: And so you know, I may have mentioned this earlier to you, like for example, Govinda,

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240
[Amit Varma]: I love him.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.240
[Amit Varma]: I love Govinda.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240
[Guest]: Oh my goodness.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.240
[Guest]: And then, you know, especially his later output, the first one, you know, Raja Bhaiya and all

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:42.240
[Guest]: thoda bahut, there were issues with that, but the later ones with all these number ones,

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:48.000
[Guest]: you know, and when he teams up with David Dhawan, David Dhawan and Qadar Khan, Qadar

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.160
[Guest]: Khan and Nargis aur uske bete ka naam kya hai?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Monish Bell.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
[Guest]: Nahi, nahi.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160
[Guest]: Nargis aur uske bete ka naam kya hai?

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160
[Guest]: Nargis ke bete ka naam.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Nargis and Sanjay Dutt, Sanjay Dutt.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.480
[Guest]: So Sanjay Dutt, hero number one, jodi number one, hero number one mein Sanjay Dutt nahi

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.480
[Guest]: hai shaad.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480
[Guest]: I mean, ek aur ek gyaara.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:12.200
[Guest]: I mean, ek aur ek gyaara, I know every single joke, but I can watch it endless number of

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.280
[Guest]: times and laugh at the same time.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.240
[Guest]: So that's what my father used to say that, look, and he also used to watch and used to

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.840
[Guest]: say, how do you, how is it that we laugh so much?

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.880
[Guest]: Because just because it's just the situational humor and Govinda is a master at that.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.240
[Guest]: So you are not, you have to appreciate in terms of the genre that they represent.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.160
[Guest]: So he used to always say that, for example, when we go to see Spider-Man or Star Wars,

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.160
[Guest]: do we really think it's a realistic representation of human life?

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.280
[Guest]: Obviously not.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.720
[Guest]: But you suspend disbelief when you go into a Spider-Man movie and you watch it and analyze

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.840
[Guest]: it in terms of its, on its own terms.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.320
[Guest]: And he used to get very annoyed by Indian intellectuals who would happily go to a Star

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.040
[Guest]: Wars or a Spider-Man movie, but would make fun of Hindi movies to say they're not realistic.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.240
[Guest]: He said, hai bhaiya, wahan toh jaa ke dekhte ho, tumhukon wo Oscar bhi mil jaate hain.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240
[Guest]: That also you applaud.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.040
[Guest]: Toh wahan kaunsa realism hai, right?

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:12.320
[Guest]: And so the point is that, his point was that analyze every art production in terms of its

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.520
[Guest]: own genre, rather than comparing it to a genre, which, which, which is wrong, which is the

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520
[Guest]: wrong thing to do.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520
[Guest]: You know?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.520
[Guest]: So like, for example, his own play, Udhvastu Dharamshala, it's a political play and it's

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.760
[Guest]: one of the first political plays in India.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.760
[Guest]: That's why it's considered so important.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:34.080
[Guest]: It's a very wordy, difficult, not difficult, but it's, it's heavy, you know, it, you, it

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.080
[Guest]: shakes you up.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.680
[Guest]: It, you, you have to absorb it.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.640
[Guest]: Now, his point is that if you compare my play to, you know, these potboilers that you see

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.280
[Guest]: in Maharashtra theater every evening, where ha ha ha, laugh a minute, you know, double

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280
[Guest]: meaning jokes, etc.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280
[Guest]: He said, you can't compare the two.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.400
[Unknown]: I'm not going for that audience also.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.420
[Guest]: So if you're analyzing, you can dislike Udhvastu Dharamshala, that's, that's fine.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.040
[Guest]: But then dislike it on its own terms.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.880
[Guest]: I mean, say why it's not good in terms of what it's claiming to be, right?

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.280
[Guest]: And so he had the very healthy respect or a healthy disrespect, whichever way you look

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.960
[Guest]: at it, for everything.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.760
[Guest]: And he, and it extended to food, it extended to everything.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.240
[Guest]: So his point is try everything.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And that's a category error I've committed in my childhood, perhaps my pre-adult years

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.900
[Amit Varma]: where in my mind, something was really cool and something was not cool, though I'm pleased

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: to report that by the time I hit my 20s, I just started loving Govinda as well.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, I was just going with the flow and so on, incredible, or private private, I have

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.480
[Amit Varma]: appropriated that song to my own purposes, as it were.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think even, you know, somebody like Baba Saigal is incredibly underrated.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.840
[Amit Varma]: He's almost like the Govinda of indie pop in terms of, you know, Dil Ki Gaddi, Pyaar

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.720
[Amit Varma]: Da Junction, Dabba Khaali Re.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720
[Amit Varma]: It's like mind blowing.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Even the little things he does today on YouTube extremely underrated, because we have this

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.880
[Amit Varma]: hierarchy of art in our heads.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And I always tell my writing students that never be ashamed of reading anything.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Anything you read has done something good to capture your attention.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And there are lessons to be learned and you don't never feel ashamed of reading a book.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.800
[Amit Varma]: So on that note, and on that lesson from your father, which I find so profound that you

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.560
[Amit Varma]: have to engage with popular art, not just respecting it and seeing it on its own terms,

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.720
[Amit Varma]: but also understanding that it's a reflection of society.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.840
[Amit Varma]: And what I find when I talk to many people on the show who have a similar background

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.760
[Amit Varma]: to us is that we, of course, have elite privileged backgrounds, right?

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.800
[Amit Varma]: And the danger is that we grow up, as I certainly did, in these little bubbles.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.200
[Amit Varma]: And you think the bubble is a world, right?

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.560
[Amit Varma]: And outside you have views from windows of exotic things and things happening outside.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.400
[Amit Varma]: But you think the bubble is a world and you don't really engage adequately.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.560
[Amit Varma]: We are extremely lucky to be located in the place we are because there is such richness

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.840
[Amit Varma]: and diversity of languages and cultures and food and all of those things.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.000
[Amit Varma]: But we are content in our bubbles.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And it can take a long time, I think, till all the different layers of blindness that

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.000
[Amit Varma]: you have peel off one by one.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.920
[Amit Varma]: And I think one great way of getting outside that bubble and engaging with the world outside

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.920
[Amit Varma]: is through popular culture, like your dad said, is through, you know, sitting in the

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.860
[Amit Varma]: stalls when Sridevi turns around and everybody goes nuts.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.840
[Amit Varma]: Or people throwing coins at the screen when Rashnikant comes or whatever, so on and so

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840
[Amit Varma]: forth.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:28.320
[Amit Varma]: So how much, like, were you ever, like, in hindsight, looking back, do you ever feel

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.240
[Amit Varma]: that there was that element of that bubble?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Or do you feel that you were fortunate in a way to engage outside that bubble because

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.200
[Amit Varma]: your parents encouraged you to do so and so on and so forth?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And if you are to look at the journey of your life, do you, you know, can you identify things

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:51.320
[Amit Varma]: that were perhaps unseen to you at 15, which at 35, you saw very clearly, not just in the

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.040
[Amit Varma]: personal anecdote domain of, you know, your grandmother going to, you know, a place which

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.040
[Amit Varma]: is also Rehmatpur, but, you know, in general?

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.960
[Guest]: So the answer to the bubble question is actually yes and no.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:09.560
[Guest]: So in addition to the influences from within the family, which were multiple and of multiple

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:15.600
[Guest]: kinds, and I mean, family and friends of my father's of, he lived in this very eclectic,

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.720
[Guest]: just, you know, quite a remarkable circle of acquaintances.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:26.440
[Guest]: We growing up on the JNU campus that time was a bubble of a different kind.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:32.880
[Guest]: So inside the bubble, there was an amazing amount of freedom and intermingling and intermixing

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.000
[Guest]: of a kind that you don't see today's middle class children, I mean, those who are at the

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.280
[Guest]: same, in the same class background as us.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.160
[Guest]: So there were 36 families, as I mentioned, there were three hostels and the JNU had acquired

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.920
[Guest]: this land of 1000 acres, the rest of it was this jungle.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.480
[Guest]: And these third, because there was no transportation, there was, you know, I think one or two people

01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:00.120
[Guest]: had cars entirely on the campus, you know, one or two people had television sets and

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.320
[Guest]: so on.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:07.400
[Guest]: And so the whole inhabited part of the campus was our home, extended home.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:13.200
[Guest]: So my, the door to our house, for example, my parents' house was never locked.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.720
[Guest]: Because it was just, kaun aayega, yahi toh log hai saare.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:22.320
[Guest]: And you know, Wednesday evenings and Sunday evenings were Chitrahar, so you had one professor

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.520
[Guest]: who had a TV, had no escape because these, all of us, the gaggle of school kids would

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.200
[Guest]: just descend on his house ki hum toh dekhenge.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.920
[Guest]: And isme there were, you know, people from different parts of the country, there were

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.800
[Guest]: Hindus, there were Muslims, there was a Parsi family, and Christians, of course, caste diversity

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.160
[Guest]: itni nahi thi, baad mein jaake thodi baad, but not much really.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.280
[Guest]: But there was, there was diversity along many different dimensions.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:57.200
[Guest]: And it never, it was very natural for us to go to Zia and Asad's house for Eid, and them

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.880
[Guest]: coming to our house for Ganesh Chaturthi, it was, it was just not even, you couldn't

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.760
[Guest]: even think that there was an issue about that.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.800
[Guest]: It was just two festivals, the Indians, so it in a very, it was a bubble.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:13.040
[Guest]: Now I realize that life outside was not like that at all.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.880
[Guest]: But it was the best bubble to be living in, you know, but it's not the same kind of bubble

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.640
[Guest]: that today's middle class children have, which is very constricted by caste, class, you know,

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.640
[Guest]: whatever linguistic group that you belong to, you know, religion, so you just meet literally

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.160
[Guest]: people just like your type.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:35.240
[Guest]: So we actually interacted with a larger variety within the class background, because if you

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.240
[Guest]: had a professor in JNU, that already just sort of puts you in a bracket.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:48.460
[Guest]: But within that band, that band itself was diverse along many other dimensions.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.600
[Guest]: And we got these influences without thinking about it.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.480
[Guest]: So I'll give you an example, for example, in those political views, you know, everybody

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.760
[Guest]: thinks of JNU as this lefty, lefty place, but there was Professor ML Sondhi, who was

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760
[Guest]: in the Jan Sangh.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.520
[Guest]: In fact, he was the only MP, I think, of the Jan Sangh at that time.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.800
[Guest]: His children used to go to the same school as us.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.080
[Guest]: They were friends, Shivaji and Vivekanand.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.680
[Guest]: Mrs. Sondhi was, you know, Professor Sondhi, I don't remember very well, but Mrs. Sondhi,

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.560
[Guest]: I still meet, so I remember her very well.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
[Guest]: She's into classical music.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.880
[Guest]: So we often meet at concerts and all that.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.640
[Guest]: Never once did my father say, don't play with the children of the Sondhis because he's RSS

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.640
[Guest]: Jan Sangh.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.200
[Guest]: Never did once the Sondhis say, don't play with GPD's children because they are, you

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:40.160
[Guest]: know, this socialist lefty, whatever, anti-RSS, anti, you know, they have different worldviews.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160
[Guest]: Never.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.040
[Guest]: It was never an issue, you know.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.920
[Guest]: So the parents of the children that we grew up with, they had different political ideologies,

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.200
[Guest]: had different orientations, but that never was an issue.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.720
[Guest]: Not just with my, not with my parents, with no parents.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.160
[Guest]: So there was this remarkable freedom to interact with each other.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.880
[Guest]: So only when you grow up later on, you know, then you realize that, oh, so-and-so was this,

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.960
[Guest]: so-and-so was that, but that was never an issue.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:13.000
[Guest]: Whereas today, I can't imagine, you know, children of two families belonging to such

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.160
[Guest]: diverse political opinions, children being friends and being allowed to, you know, be

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.080
[Guest]: in and out of each other's homes.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.160
[Guest]: But it's a legacy of that time.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.800
[Guest]: So even now when I meet Mrs. Sondhi, it's almost like, you know, she's motherly towards

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.840
[Guest]: me because she's seen me, I'm the same age as her children, and it's lovely, you know.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.480
[Guest]: But that's the legacy of JNU of that time.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.160
[Guest]: I mean, I always say that I have three mothers, you know, and now I have one, two of them,

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.400
[Guest]: my own mother and the second mother also passed away recently.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.120
[Guest]: But all these three women, one was my biological mother, but the other two women were almost

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.120
[Guest]: like mothers to me on the campus, and they really were like mothers, you know.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.200
[Guest]: But collectively, the three gave me a motherhood, which was possible only, and all three are

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.560
[Guest]: very different from each other.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:04.800
[Guest]: But that collective motherhood or the collective fatherhood that I enjoyed certainly was special.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.040
[Guest]: So yes, it was a bubble, but not the kind of bubble that we see, not the kind of bubble

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040
[Guest]: that we see.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.080
[Guest]: I realized it was a bubble because when I moved out to the real world, when I left JNU,

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.680
[Guest]: I said, oh, the real world looks like this.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.800
[Guest]: People are so categorized into backgrounds and you know, who will talk to whom, who do

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.620
[Guest]: you interact with, etc, etc.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.440
[Guest]: In the JNU of that time, this was not an issue.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:35.160
[Amit Varma]: So to go back to the earlier question, tell me more about yourself growing up in this

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:39.360
[Amit Varma]: period, in the sense you're surrounded by these influences, this kind of environment.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the importance of music in your life.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.720
[Amit Varma]: For example, you mentioned how, you know, one of the things that you and Mrs. Sondhi

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.800
[Amit Varma]: shared in common was classical music.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.480
[Amit Varma]: You have written many, many pieces on music, which I will link from the show notes.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.120
[Amit Varma]: You have gotten into a famous defense of Lata Mangeshkarji, which somehow became a part

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.220
[Amit Varma]: of an academic debate, which we will also talk about later.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:06.040
[Amit Varma]: But just going back to the young Ashwini, you know, what kind of role did music play

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040
[Amit Varma]: in your life?

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And from there, what was sort of your conception of yourself?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.840
[Amit Varma]: Because if you're an artistic kid, like you're into music, you've written about both Malik

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Arjun Mansoor, and you've read Ashok Da Ranade, you've written about Lata and Asha and so

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560
[Amit Varma]: on.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.320
[Amit Varma]: You're into all these different kinds of music, both in a sense of experiencing them and thinking

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.060
[Amit Varma]: about them and so on.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.840
[Amit Varma]: And your father being a playwright and all of that, and you being a pretty mean writer

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.360
[Amit Varma]: yourself, if in the context of what you've studied, one would imagine that you would

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.080
[Amit Varma]: have been drawn towards being an artist also being a creator also like that.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.440
[Amit Varma]: So how did you sort of, what role did these play in your life?

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.080
[Amit Varma]: And how did you evolve in the directions that you did?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.880
[Guest]: So music has always been a very important part of my life.

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:55.280
[Guest]: It's a pity that I didn't pursue, now it's one of my biggest regrets about my life.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.400
[Guest]: I don't have too many, but this is definitely one, which is that I should have pursued music

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.820
[Guest]: more seriously.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.800
[Guest]: My parents were tone deaf, they couldn't sing to save their lives, but they were very much

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800
[Guest]: into music.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.840
[Guest]: So the music was always playing in the house.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:19.000
[Guest]: And my aunts are amazing singers, so they would sing, so there was always music.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.840
[Guest]: And my mother tried very hard to get me to learn.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.680
[Guest]: And I did learn in fits and starts, but just as she was rebellious, I was rebellious too.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.880
[Guest]: So every time she would put me in, get me to start on music, I would find some excuse

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.960
[Guest]: to leave it because the discipline of it, the discipline that it required, I didn't

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.200
[Guest]: have that, I guess.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.960
[Guest]: I've also learned the sitar, by the way, I learned the sitar for four years.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.360
[Guest]: But again, that just when it, when, you know, the thing is that with any art form, initially

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.520
[Guest]: it's a lot of fun.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:57.000
[Guest]: Then comes a point where it starts to become difficult, actually, as you become more comfortable

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
[Guest]: with it.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
[Guest]: That's when it gets more difficult.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.200
[Guest]: Because as long as you're not very comfortable, it's like you just learn a few things, etc.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.320
[Guest]: And at that transition point, you have to commit to regularly practice.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:15.640
[Guest]: And I've given up so many things just at that transition point, because I just found excuses.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:19.760
[Guest]: I mean, in my head, they were always very valid excuses, but now I recognize them for

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:27.000
[Guest]: what they were basically just excuses saying, I don't have the time for this.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.880
[Guest]: And every time I gave up, and I gave up many times, my mother would, and I would have this

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.760
[Guest]: huge argument.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.440
[Guest]: And she would say, you're wasting a talent, and all of this, and you'll regret it one

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.440
[Guest]: day.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440
[Guest]: And I said, Okay, I'll regret it when I regret it.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.000
[Guest]: I'm not regretting it now, etc, etc.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.200
[Guest]: And of course, I regret it now.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:56.000
[Guest]: So I should have learned music systematically, and developed, not to perform, not that way,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.920
[Guest]: but just developed a musical ability, which unfortunately, I don't have.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.880
[Guest]: And I regret that for sure.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:07.360
[Guest]: But having said that music gives me so much joy that actually, I've resumed learning,

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:14.000
[Guest]: but it's more just for me to, you know, just for me to enjoy, there's no competition, there's

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.800
[Guest]: no performance, there's nothing, it's just something I really enjoy.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.880
[Guest]: And the thing is that when I was growing up, the only thing I ever wanted to be was a medical

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.840
[Guest]: doctor.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.720
[Guest]: I was not into social sciences.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.760
[Guest]: I didn't read any nonfiction.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.560
[Guest]: I read either fiction, or my school books, you know, and I had no other career choice

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.720
[Guest]: other than being a medical doctor.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720
[Guest]: That's it.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.080
[Guest]: So, so my point was also what's the point of learning and spending so much time on music,

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.400
[Guest]: because eventually, when I become a doctor, I'm not going to have time to pursue and then

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.960
[Guest]: my father would say no, but Dr. Lagu, see, he's a medical doctor, but he's an actor.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.800
[Guest]: And Maharashtra, in fact, has a lot of qualified medical doctors who are very, you know, in

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.920
[Guest]: fact, has a tradition of medical doctors in theatre.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.200
[Guest]: And also, my namesake, Ashwini Viredesh Pandey, is a scientist and she has a PhD.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.320
[Guest]: So and they would say that no, you could still be a medical doctor and still, you know, excel

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.400
[Guest]: at music.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.440
[Guest]: And I, it's just one of these foolish things you do as a child.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.160
[Guest]: But you know, everybody has to learn, make their own mistakes and no point in my telling

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.200
[Guest]: other people that, oh, because I made this mistake, you should not because everybody

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.880
[Guest]: has to make, sometimes we make the same mistake through generations and but yeah, that so

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.680
[Guest]: music has been very important is writing on music was completely serendipity.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:37.360
[Guest]: I still don't think that I'm an expert on anything, but I've just enjoyed writing these

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.560
[Guest]: pieces a lot.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.400
[Guest]: And it's just more my enjoyment that shows through in the pieces, rather than any scholarly

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400
[Guest]: erudition.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.760
[Guest]: I don't claim any erudition at all in these in these matters.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:58.120
[Guest]: But now in my old age, I have actually realized the virtue of being consistent with music.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:03.040
[Guest]: And I, you know, I travel a lot and you know, there are long gaps, etc.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:09.360
[Guest]: But to the best of my ability, I learn a little bit here and there and you know, so I'm trying

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.200
[Guest]: to develop it as a, if not very regular, but at least as a consistent passion.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200
[Guest]: And that's what it will remain.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.680
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini ji, I have to take strong exception to your using the phrase now in my old age.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.760
[Amit Varma]: You are the same age as Shah Rukh Khan.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.960
[Guest]: He would never use language like that.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960
[Guest]: He would not.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And also you have berated me at least three, four times in the past because I called you

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini ji and because I called you ma'am and you said ki yeh sab mat use karo.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.120
[Amit Varma]: So to hear you say words like this is like I am now deeply disillusioned and this cognitive

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.120
[Guest]: dissonance is happening.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.120
[Guest]: Not at all disillusioned.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.960
[Amit Varma]: And I have to say that I, I really want to see you write more about music because I loved

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.960
[Amit Varma]: some of your writing on it.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.200
[Amit Varma]: I want to read out this first part of your piece on Malik Arjun Mansoor, where you write

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.840
[Amit Varma]: quote Malik Arjun Mansoor is a man who resides in music.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:03.600
[Amit Varma]: His postal address is Mithun J Bangalodharwar, but he actually inhabits a world of music.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:08.420
[Amit Varma]: In the morning, he lives in Todi Asawari, afternoons are spent in the shadows of Sarang.

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:12.840
[Amit Varma]: He sits under the canopy of Puriya Marwa in the evening and he spends the nights in the

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.520
[Amit Varma]: palaces of Yaman Bhoop Bageshri.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.520
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520
[Guest]: It's so beautiful.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
[Guest]: But these are not my words.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520
[Amit Varma]: This is, this is my translation.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520
[Amit Varma]: I didn't realize this.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520
[Amit Varma]: This is Pula Deshpande.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.520
[Guest]: Yeah, but which in the original Marathi is beautiful.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:31.640
[Guest]: And so the challenge was for me, I, this was a challenging piece for me because Pula Deshpande

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:38.320
[Guest]: in those who know, who've read him in Marathi know how he's a master at words, you know,

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.820
[Guest]: and to convey that impression in any other language is hard.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:49.600
[Guest]: So this piece, actually, I spent time and even though these are not my words in Marathi,

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.680
[Guest]: but to how do I say it in English that it conveys exactly the same feeling that Pula

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.840
[Guest]: did in the Marathi was challenging.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.720
[Amit Varma]: So I will take a little bit of the compliment, 10% of the compliment.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.040
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I loved all your writing on music, so many pieces that I read, you were kind

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.400
[Amit Varma]: enough to send me those links and, and I linked them all from the show notes.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:15.920
[Amit Varma]: So do admit this now appears to be a bit of a faux pas, but these are lovely lines anyway.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And often the act of translation is just an act of recreation, in a sense, you capture

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.680
[Amit Varma]: the essence of what somebody said, recreate it.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.680
[Amit Varma]: It's not a word by word translation.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not a word by word by word never works across.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.600
[Guest]: And so in fact, after I did this, I was so because Pula is such an icon in Maharashtra.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.440
[Guest]: I was really afraid and Malik Mansoorji is another one.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.800
[Guest]: And so after I've translated it, I sent the English one to my father and I said, don't

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.240
[Guest]: read the Marathi, read the English and tell me whether it sounds like Pula writing in

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.720
[Guest]: English.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720
[Guest]: And he read it.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.800
[Unknown]: And he said, yes, it does.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.060
[Unknown]: So I said, beautiful.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.060
[Guest]: Then I sent him the Marathi.

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.940
[Guest]: I said, now you read the Marathi.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.640
[Guest]: So then he said, you've done a good job.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.620
[Guest]: So I was so happy, because it wasn't, you know, you can't translate Pula word by word.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.620
[Guest]: It's impossible.

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So there's a Malik Arjun Mansoor story from one of my previous episodes, episode 250 was

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.960
[Amit Varma]: done with a good friend of mine called Naren Shenoy.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.480
[Amit Varma]: So Naren is very much into Malik Arjun Mansoor.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:17.280
[Amit Varma]: And he told the story of how when he was sort of that one day, you know, back in the early

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.880
[Amit Varma]: days of the internet, he was googling something for about Malik Arjun Mansoor and finding

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.920
[Amit Varma]: some music of his and you know how when you kind of Google something back in those days,

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.920
[Amit Varma]: a pop up would come and all of that.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.600
[Amit Varma]: So basically, he did some research on Malik Arjun Mansoor.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.920
[Amit Varma]: And then he went downstairs with his wife for dinner, and then she comes up to the room

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:35.920
[Amit Varma]: and goes to the computer.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.560
[Amit Varma]: And there is a pop up which is saying, browse naked pictures of Malik Arjun Mansoor.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:48.640
[Unknown]: Tells you something about algorithms of those times.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.440
[Amit Varma]: So I have a tangential question.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.760
[Amit Varma]: And here I'm kind of thinking aloud about the process of the arts of learning the arts.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:00.040
[Amit Varma]: And you spoke about how when you start learning music, it's a lot of fun till you reach that

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.840
[Amit Varma]: stage where there is a tremendous amount of discipline.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm actually speculating that once you're past that, and you get to a certain level

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.960
[Amit Varma]: of mastery, the fun begins again and all of that.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.040
[Amit Varma]: So is it a little bit like a U-shaped, you've mentioned U-shaped curves in other contexts

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.320
[Amit Varma]: of employment and education, and we'll come to that later.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.360
[Amit Varma]: But is this also do you think a U-shaped curve of a sort that in the beginning of your education,

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.320
[Amit Varma]: when you know very little, it's a lot of fun, the middle part is really tough, but to make

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.680
[Amit Varma]: it fun again, you have to put in the yards.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:32.240
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't know about the U-shape because I never got to the other side, but

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.140
[Guest]: I can imagine that it's a U-shape.

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:41.640
[Guest]: But what I will say to you know, that if there is even an iota of some kind of a natural

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:48.000
[Guest]: talent, like, you know, people sing in tune, or they can draw or they can write or anything

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.280
[Guest]: else which need not be your career, but I think it's tremendous to have that as a part

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.440
[Guest]: of your life, which always stays with you.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.960
[Guest]: And I haven't given too many lessons to my daughter, but this is the one lesson I always

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:09.160
[Guest]: tell her that you must have something which you can pursue without being dependent on

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.880
[Guest]: anyone else.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.760
[Guest]: And that way, you will always have something that you look forward to, always, always,

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:24.200
[Guest]: you know, and music for me has been that thing, which, no matter what else is happening, and

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.920
[Guest]: you know, life goes through ups and downs, as it does for everyone.

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.120
[Guest]: But the music has been this one constant source.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.600
[Guest]: And this whole thing about music therapy, etc, I'd learned later that there is a thing

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.320
[Guest]: called music therapy.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.760
[Guest]: But because I had music as a companion always in different ways, it ended up playing that

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.840
[Guest]: role in, you know, when through different episodes in my life, but it's really very

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.840
[Guest]: important.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.160
[Guest]: So I feel that if anyone has any talent in any dimension, I'm not saying I have talent,

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.240
[Guest]: but I'm just saying that even if there's an iota of talent, one should sort of hang on

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.880
[Guest]: to it and develop it in some way.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.440
[Guest]: Not thinking of making a career because that can also lead to disappointments.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.680
[Guest]: But sort of keep working at it, keep it as a second wheel that runs your life.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.840
[Amit Varma]: And I love that caveat of yours, not thinking of making it a career, because I think too

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.280
[Amit Varma]: often we are socialized to think of the things we do in instrumental terms.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, if something doesn't appear to be instrumental, it seems like a waste.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.680
[Amit Varma]: But I would just say that there have to be things that you do just for their own sake,

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.880
[Guest]: you know, absolutely.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.360
[Guest]: Just for their own sake and just for your own sake, and especially for women, I mean,

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.080
[Guest]: you know, this is one of the things that I think women I mean, I'm now digressing a little

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:45.640
[Guest]: bit into my research areas, but women are always ridden with guilt when they take time

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.640
[Guest]: to do something which is exclusively for themselves, you know, and everybody's socialized that

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640
[Guest]: way.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.680
[Guest]: So the guilt might be very high, it might be very low.

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.080
[Guest]: And sometimes you there are women, I realized, will never get to do it because of the pressures.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.560
[Guest]: I've been fortunate always to have not had that those kinds of pressures.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:10.800
[Guest]: But you know, once a week, my music class is just time, but just for me, you know, and

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.680
[Guest]: I think I'm really fortunate to be able to carve out that time, but I think it's such

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:20.520
[Guest]: an important time and it's such an important activity for just to keep your sanity, to

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:25.600
[Guest]: get perspective on life to sort of calm down and say, okay, you know, it's life is going

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600
[Guest]: on.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.800
[Guest]: Otherwise, the rest of it is all you know, you know, there's some deadline, something

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.920
[Guest]: is happening, some race here, something, you know, one is constantly, and these days the

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.320
[Guest]: distractions have increased, I think I'm constantly distracted between phone is pinging, bell

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:44.760
[Guest]: is ringing, you know, email is coming, something or the other, in the middle of that, you know,

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:50.440
[Guest]: time sort of stops, so I think it's nice to sort of rein life back in.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.560
[Guest]: And I'm not just saying music could be, it could be painting, it could be writing, it

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.560
[Guest]: could be a sport, it could be anything that we might be good at, you know.

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.680
[Guest]: And I think we should definitely, all women, but all people, I think.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but it's a great point that is so much harder for women, because you're expected

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.080
[Amit Varma]: to always look after the men in your life and look after the house.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:15.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you almost feel guilty if you if you have like all pleasures, in a sense,

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.800
[Unknown]: can can be guilty pleasures.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's a danger for women, certainly sparked by something you just mentioned.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Here's another question.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.400
[Amit Varma]: You spoke about all the distractions around you and how it's important for you to carve

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.400
[Amit Varma]: out that me time, and I think of how, when we were growing up, we didn't have so many

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:38.280
[Amit Varma]: distractions, smartphones, TV, but it's not like there's a lot on TV, there's one channel,

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.960
[Amit Varma]: we, you know, some of us fortunate enough to have books around, but you're not going

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.200
[Amit Varma]: to be reading all the time, that there was a lot of enforced me time, that there was

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:55.000
[Amit Varma]: a potential to develop a certain kind of introspection to develop a certain kind of life.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And today, the rhythm of life is so choppy.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we are always looking at our smartphones.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:08.280
[Amit Varma]: And even there, it is not as if we are consuming content in a slow, deliberate way.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.560
[Amit Varma]: But it's, you know, you're either scrolling up or swiping left to right.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And just the rhythm of life, and therefore, perhaps the rhythm of how we think is choppy,

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.680
[Amit Varma]: choppy, choppy, choppy all the time.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, you have taught people from the generation before this, to this generation,

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.640
[Amit Varma]: you've been a mother yourself, and of course, you've been a kid yourself, because otherwise

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.640
[Amit Varma]: you wouldn't be here.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.360
[Amit Varma]: So, so, you know, is this something that you think makes a difference, not just in an old

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:41.200
[Amit Varma]: people lamenting about, you know, these life these days has become like this, young people

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200
[Amit Varma]: are like this.

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:47.960
[Amit Varma]: But do you think that this changing of the texture of life, you know, can shape a person

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:53.440
[Amit Varma]: in a different way, and therefore, it's incumbent upon all of us, even people of our age, who

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:58.840
[Amit Varma]: are like, I am certainly, you know, fighting distractions and failing so often, that even

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:04.080
[Amit Varma]: for us, that we need to take that step back, think about what, you know, the rhythms and

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.680
[Amit Varma]: textures of our life are, and think about what we need to do differently.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.400
[Amit Varma]: So what are what are your thoughts on this?

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.400
[Guest]: No, no, absolutely.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.920
[Guest]: And again, it's not a question of nostalgia, I think in many ways, the young people today

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:21.480
[Guest]: are smarter, they are able to assimilate information, they are very clear about their boundaries,

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.800
[Guest]: they are very articulate about what they want and what they don't want.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.520
[Guest]: I think as children, we ended up doing a lot of things that we didn't particularly care

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.560
[Guest]: about, but only because one just had to do it, there was no choice.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:36.320
[Guest]: So when I see my daughter's daughter, for example, being, you know, assertive in terms

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.720
[Guest]: of what she'll do, what she won't, her articulation, you know, I mean, that level of articulation

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.880
[Guest]: I still don't forget about when I was her age.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.760
[Guest]: So in many ways, that's, that's amazing.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.680
[Guest]: And that's, that's, that's really good.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.960
[Guest]: But the distraction part of it is very serious.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:57.720
[Guest]: For example, I have switched off notifications for Twitter, Facebook, everything.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.160
[Guest]: So now I check it only when I check it.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.040
[Guest]: And people get really upset saying, oh, but I tweeted and I gave, sent you a direct message,

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.040
[Guest]: you didn't see it.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.640
[Guest]: I said, well, I didn't, because that's a step that I've taken.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.400
[Guest]: In my family, we try to enforce this to the extent possible, no devices on the, at the

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.000
[Guest]: dining table.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
[Guest]: That doesn't always happen.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
[Guest]: Sometimes, you know, somebody is expecting a call or something, the phone is always there.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.840
[Guest]: The one thing that I have to say during the pandemic, I gave up, is watching dinner without

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.840
[Guest]: a screen.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.960
[Guest]: Earlier, we used to eat at the dining table.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.400
[Guest]: Once the pandemic came, we would just pick up our plates, sit in, because we have TV

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.780
[Guest]: in only one room, because we've decided to, that's the TV room.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:38.160
[Guest]: So that the act of watching TV is a deliberate act where you have to get up and move to a

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.160
[Guest]: room.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.360
[Guest]: So no other room has any television.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.840
[Guest]: And that's something that we've decided as a policy to do.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.840
[Guest]: Of course, we can always watch on our phones or whatever, but we most, we don't do that

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.840
[Guest]: so much.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.840
[Guest]: But in the, during when the pandemic started, we said, okay, no, we are going to watch,

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.840
[Guest]: you know, it's just, we were sitting at the home the whole day.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.240
[Guest]: So evenings, it was just easier to pick up your plate, serve yourself and go into the

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.680
[Guest]: TV room and watch from there.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.280
[Guest]: And I have to say, we, we've got used to that now.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.040
[Guest]: It's now dinner time, we are watching Netflix or whatever, you know, OTT something.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.920
[Guest]: And I have to say the content is so good.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.920
[Guest]: It is so good.

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.640
[Guest]: It is so good.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.160
[Guest]: And because I don't watch anything during the day, I have now justified it by saying

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.200
[Guest]: that, look, I mean, this is my only time to watch OTT.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.200
[Guest]: So I watch at night.

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:31.080
[Guest]: I mean, you know, one, that's just, I guess one, one changes with age, but the kind of

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:38.000
[Guest]: free time, unfocused time that we had as children is not going to come back at all, ever.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.240
[Guest]: And obviously, as a person, at a personal level, I feel that's unfortunate, but I'm

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.280
[Guest]: sure that there are many good things that, that children today are doing that we didn't

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280
[Guest]: do as children.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.520
[Guest]: So I'm not going to characterize it in black and white, but I do keep talking to my daughter

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.520
[Guest]: about the need to disengage from the screen and how much she listens to me or whatever

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:59.420
[Guest]: that I don't know, but I do keep saying it.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And does she look at you while you're saying it or she's looking into a phone?

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.720
[Guest]: No, that's a rule.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.600
[Guest]: So if I see her looking at the phone, I stop talking and I say, I'm not going to talk to

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.600
[Guest]: you.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.600
[Guest]: She, she's good.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.000
[Guest]: She realizes now that, so she can't bring her laptop to the dining table, for example,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.400
[Guest]: not allowed.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.920
[Guest]: So once in a while, when she goes to send an email, she asks me, can I just please bring

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.920
[Guest]: it for five minutes?

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.440
[Guest]: I need to send this email very urgently.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.600
[Guest]: And she has to send it and then she has to send it back.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.800
[Guest]: So often I say, okay, then finish your email and then come because I don't want to see

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.280
[Guest]: the laptop at the dining table.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.720
[Guest]: So the, I mean, these, these things are not black and white.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:36.560
[Guest]: It's not so strict, but at least these are small attempts that, that one makes.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.480
[Guest]: I mean, I go to restaurants and you go to this fancy restaurant, paying through your

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.120
[Guest]: nose and families are just on their phones the entire time.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.640
[Guest]: And I feel like, why did you come here?

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.920
[Guest]: And not in India, of course it's bad, but in Europe, you should see it's in the US,

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:57.800
[Guest]: it's a million times more, I mean, it's very rare to find somebody at a bus stop or at

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.640
[Guest]: the train station, just staring into space.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned earlier, you spoke about, you know, being in a bubble, but being fortunate

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.680
[Amit Varma]: to be in that particular bubble.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And you spoke about how, you know, it was a texture of your life that you're going for

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.920
[Amit Varma]: Eid to your friend's house, you're coming for Ganesh Chaturthi or whatever to your house.

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a completely normal thing.

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And that got me to thinking about, again, one of the themes I keep coming back to during

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:30.080
[Amit Varma]: the show, the distinction sort of between the abstract and the concrete in our lives.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And by and large, what I see is that when we engage with the concrete world, when we

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.720
[Amit Varma]: are mindful to it, I think there is a quality of experience that is important and also quality

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.880
[Amit Varma]: of empathy that that brings about that I am meeting friends who are different from me

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:50.400
[Amit Varma]: and I'm looking them in the eye and we are sharing stories with each other and there's

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.160
[Amit Varma]: no electronic device there and it is concrete.

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And I think two ways in which the abstract has impinged upon this.

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:02.800
[Amit Varma]: And one is, of course, the age old way of the danger of abstract concepts like nationalism

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:08.440
[Amit Varma]: and purity and the other and, you know, historical grievances from the past, which are for all

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:13.280
[Amit Varma]: practical purposes, abstractions as well in this current time, and all of these impinge

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.480
[Amit Varma]: upon us and by, yeah, and when we start thinking in terms of those abstractions that, oh, he's

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.240
[Amit Varma]: a Muslim or he's a Dalit or he's Savannah or whatever, that at some level we rob them

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.080
[Amit Varma]: of their humanity and that becomes a problem.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.440
[Amit Varma]: So this is one level in which those abstractions become a problem.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.080
[Amit Varma]: And another level in which they become a problem is the thing that you mentioned that when

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.880
[Amit Varma]: you were kids, you would meet for dinner every day, you, your brother, your parents would

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.560
[Amit Varma]: all meet and you would talk to each other.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And of course, there were no smartphones in this day.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.080
[Amit Varma]: And today you might have enforced the rule in your house.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.280
[Amit Varma]: But in general, it's tough, like, you know, I was at a cafe the other day and I didn't

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.280
[Amit Varma]: look into my phone.

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.960
[Amit Varma]: I was just looking around and I felt people looked at me like I'm a psychopath.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.960
[Unknown]: Yes.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960
[Amit Varma]: What is he doing?

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.960
[Guest]: Why isn't he?

01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Where is his screen?

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, did something terrible happen and he doesn't have a screen?

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And so even when we are with people in the concrete, we are in the abstract worlds that

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.120
[Amit Varma]: we are engrossed in, in our smartphones.

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And I just feel that this is dangerous, like, look, net net, I'm not a Luddite, I love technology.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.260
[Amit Varma]: It has transformed my life in unbelievable ways.

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And given me so many more friends through these abstract interactions that begin like

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.400
[Amit Varma]: that and then we meet.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And I love that, you know, you and I are sitting here today because of all this technology

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.920
[Amit Varma]: has enabled this, right.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.480
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you know, I think about this dehumanization.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder if that is a cause for the polarization that we increasingly see around us in our

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.240
[Amit Varma]: discourse.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:50.480
[Amit Varma]: Because if we more and more stop thinking of other people as real complex people, you

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:55.040
[Amit Varma]: know, with complicated stories, and instead think of them as categories of people.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I begin to think that if I disagree with you, that means that you're evil.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.960
[Amit Varma]: It's not just a disagreement.

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And we see so much of this toxic polarization on social media from all sides.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.840
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on this, especially because you teach young people, you know,

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.480
[Amit Varma]: in a university, which is a liberal arts university, and some have even complained that Ashoka

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.480
[Amit Varma]: is so woke.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.080
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, I don't know what the truth of that is.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm always happy to give the benefit of the doubt to people and not go in for easy stereotyping.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.040
[Amit Varma]: But what's your sort of...

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.480
[Guest]: No, I mean, it's absolutely, I agree with you completely.

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.720
[Guest]: And that's what I tell, I mean, try to convey to students.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.240
[Guest]: Children don't really listen to parents.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.560
[Guest]: But at least my hope is that somewhere something sticks.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.680
[Guest]: And the reason I feel a little optimistic and the reason I think that yes, something

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.920
[Guest]: sticks because one of the courses I teach is statistics.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.080
[Guest]: So that's, of course, statistics, and that's more technical.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:00.600
[Guest]: But the other course I teach is what is called economics of discrimination.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.280
[Guest]: And I give a lot of real life examples.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.160
[Guest]: And I see a lot of resistance to what I'm saying in the classroom.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:14.120
[Guest]: But every year from some batch of students that I've taught at the Delhi School or at

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:18.640
[Guest]: Ashoka, some student will write saying, Hi, Professor, I was watching this movie and I

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.800
[Guest]: thought of you because, remember, you said this in class, and this is what that movie

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.560
[Guest]: showed or this incident happened in my life.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.840
[Guest]: And remember, you had mentioned this about women, and this is what I saw.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.040
[Guest]: And suddenly, it resonates, you know.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:39.000
[Guest]: So I think that it's important to keep talking, you know, to younger people without sounding

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.840
[Guest]: like a Luddite or whatever.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:50.400
[Guest]: But it's also true that in general, the spaces where you can have open conversations, which

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.380
[Guest]: outline nuances, those spaces are shrinking, I feel.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.960
[Guest]: And it's not the left or the right or whatever issue.

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.880
[Guest]: It's like you have to take black and white positions on everything, you know, and human

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.120
[Guest]: beings are complex, none of us are black and all white, you know.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.400
[Guest]: Just the other day, I was watching Choti Si Baat again, after so many years, and of course,

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.800
[Guest]: what strikes you is the pre-liberalization, India, etc, etc, all of that.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.280
[Guest]: But Vidya Sinha is a working woman in Bombay.

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.320
[Guest]: You know, we never find out about her family, because that's irrelevant to the story.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.840
[Guest]: So she's a working woman who's taking a decision about whether to marry Amol Palakir, eventually

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.680
[Guest]: they marry, of course, but her courtship with Amol Palakir.

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.440
[Guest]: And she goes in a bus, she reads a book, every time she sits in the bus, she opens a book

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.200
[Guest]: and starts reading, right?

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.360
[Guest]: She plays table tennis for her office, with Asrani, mixed doubles.

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.360
[Guest]: And she goes for chess championships, Asrani is playing, etc.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.360
[Guest]: I'd forgotten these little details.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.560
[Guest]: And then for lunch, they meet in the Samovar cafe and all of that.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.440
[Guest]: So in a very easygoing manner, she's always in a saree, she's not this Zeena Damaan Parveen

01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.720
[Guest]: Babi, westernized kind of a heroine, etc, but at the same time, because Amol Palakir

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:06.960
[Guest]: is so diffident, he goes to a life coach who's Ashok Kumar, who teaches how to patao a girl

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.960
[Guest]: basically.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.120
[Guest]: Now, obviously, that part of the movie today, it will be cancelled immediately, because

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.800
[Guest]: how can you patao a girl and all of that.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.480
[Guest]: And I realized, I appreciate that point of view.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.680
[Guest]: But if today we were to cancel Choti Si Baat, because in that the character goes to Ashok

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.640
[Guest]: Kumar to learn these confidence building tricks, that would be a real pity.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:31.880
[Guest]: You know, because the film in many ways, the portrayal of Vidya Sinha is far more progressive

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:38.240
[Guest]: than the way in which you see even today in all this, you know, liberalized cinema, where

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.120
[Guest]: women are supposed to be, they are very well dressed and all the rest of it.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.060
[Guest]: But where do you see characters like this just getting into a bus and opening a book

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:49.680
[Guest]: and reading, you know, and also struck by the ease with which it was done in the film.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.000
[Guest]: Her family is not important.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.720
[Guest]: She's telling her office mate that, oh, you know, there's this boy who follows me, he's

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.720
[Guest]: cute.

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.760
[Guest]: I think he wants me, but he's diffident.

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.280
[Guest]: And he thinks I don't know, but actually I know it's all very, very amazing and actually

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.600
[Guest]: quite progressive.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.440
[Guest]: But it has this element of the life coach and how do you characterize Choti Si Baat?

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.440
[Guest]: In today's day and age, cancel, you know, that that would be the thing.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.440
[Guest]: I don't think so.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.440
[Guest]: I don't agree.

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think this tendency to pass judgment on things, definitive judgments is so toxic.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I understand the incentive.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.600
[Amit Varma]: You go online, you want a sense of community and belonging and being respected, you join

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.600
[Amit Varma]: a tribe.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.200
[Unknown]: How do you raise your status in that tribe?

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.200
[Unknown]: You do it by signaling your virtue.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.200
[Unknown]: How do you do that?

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.680
[Amit Varma]: One of the ways is to purity tests on other people in your tribe.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:41.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other way is just attacking the other side, never engaging with arguments, but attacking

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.560
[Amit Varma]: people.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think this whole like, I would urge my listeners that every time you pass judgment

01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:52.820
[Amit Varma]: on something, think about the intrinsic motivation of that, because by passing judgment on that,

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.240
[Amit Varma]: you are elevating yourself to a higher level, whether that's a higher ascetic level or a

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.080
[Amit Varma]: moral level or whatever.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.280
[Amit Varma]: It's an act of self aggrandizement.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, this doesn't mean that we don't condemn something that should be condemned.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.560
[Amit Varma]: Like in terms of values, you see someone behaving really badly.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.560
[Unknown]: Sure.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560
[Amit Varma]: Of course, it's your duty to condemn it, right?

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.840
[Amit Varma]: It's your duty to speak out against injustice and all the wrong that you see in the world.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.680
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes we take it too far.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And I certainly think and you've written a great article about this as well, which I'll

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.680
[Amit Varma]: link from the show notes.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.140
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes we take it too far, like when you're condemning a film for something that

01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.920
[Amit Varma]: happened at a particular point in time.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:35.560
[Amit Varma]: And the point is one movies are art is meant to depict the world as it is not an idealized

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.660
[Amit Varma]: version of the world as it should be.

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:41.760
[Amit Varma]: So to conflate the two, I think is immature and dangerous.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:47.360
[Amit Varma]: And I think you also, when you do that, you deprive yourself of the joy of a lot of art,

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.720
[Amit Varma]: because you're viewing it just through like one ideological lens, and one political lens.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.800
[Amit Varma]: And you're not sort of, you know, appreciating all the complexities within any good work

01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800
[Amit Varma]: of art.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And I don't remember Chhoti Si Baat, I must have seen it a decade ago, perhaps.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.160
[Amit Varma]: But everything that you're saying makes me think that yeah, this is a film I would, you

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.680
[Amit Varma]: know, love to see again, and there must be so much in it.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.680
[Amit Varma]: Just the casual act of a woman opening a book in a bus, like typically, a lot of Bollywood

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:17.480
[Amit Varma]: people would edit that out, because there'll be nothing happening in that scene.

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:22.680
[Amit Varma]: But just a conscious choice of keeping that scene in, to show something about the character

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.680
[Amit Varma]: says something to me.

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I had forgotten a lot of this when I saw it again.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:30.520
[Guest]: And of course, that came back because I'd seen it a couple of times.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:36.280
[Guest]: No, and you know, going back to the sort of the actors in my family, and they say that

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:41.600
[Guest]: the challenge of being an actor is to be able to portray roles that are not like yourself.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.840
[Guest]: You know, if we only played the extensions of our own personalities on screen, then what

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.880
[Guest]: is there to acting?

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:52.680
[Guest]: And the reason that they are such good actors is because they're able to portray a variety

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.280
[Guest]: of characters that are very different from the way they are as individuals.

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.720
[Guest]: And what would you do about creativity if you just model people like clones, you know,

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.160
[Guest]: of in some idealized world?

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.440
[Guest]: And even on that, there's no agreement.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:08.920
[Guest]: I mean, what you think is ideal, I may not agree with you on that question, right?

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:11.560
[Guest]: So I find this, I find the lack of nuance.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.680
[Guest]: And we see that in academic circles as well, which is, you know, everything is black and

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.200
[Guest]: white and or should be if not, if it isn't.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:26.760
[Guest]: And I don't understand the disinclination to engage with nuance, because I guess engaging

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.680
[Guest]: with nuance makes it harder.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.680
[Guest]: Because then you have to acknowledge all facets, you have to say, okay, this is a multifaceted

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.680
[Guest]: problem.

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.480
[Guest]: You know, there's a whole debate on women's labor force participation, for example, it's

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:42.160
[Guest]: extremely multifaceted, it's very difficult to give this one explanation that fits all

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.160
[Guest]: sizes at all times, yet, you know, people are, you know, that's what they like to do.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.320
[Guest]: Because it makes for bite, you know, news bites type of news.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.520
[Guest]: It's a very tricky terrain, it's like a slope, slope, because it's like that line from that

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.240
[Guest]: Rajkumar says, and I think Vakta or something,

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:07.280
[Guest]: You know, because the minute you start virtue singling and attacking other people, tomorrow

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.640
[Guest]: you will get attacked for something that you will say.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.440
[Guest]: So it's a never ending thing, because people are just waiting for an opportunity to get

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.560
[Guest]: back at you, you know, so it's just best to, I mean, I believe in data very much.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.120
[Guest]: So even my pieces on film, etc, you will see it's all backed by data.

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.320
[Guest]: Even the Lata piece is all, you know, examples, I mean, my point is, you're making an argument,

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.320
[Guest]: give me examples.

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.720
[Guest]: I'll listen to you if you give me examples.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.360
[Guest]: But if you're making an ideological statement without any examples, not interested.

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.200
[Guest]: Same is true of women's labor force participation or caste discrimination or affirmative action

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.720
[Guest]: or any problem, you know.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:49.200
[Guest]: If you make assertions without data or examples, then what are you saying?

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:53.560
[Amit Varma]: Then you belong on Twitter, you don't belong on Twitter.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.200
[Amit Varma]: On that delightful note, let's take a quick commercial break.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:59.240
[Amit Varma]: But you the listener, kindly do not check Twitter during this break.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Kindly keep listening.

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.240
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.960
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.240
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:28.200
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.240
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.960
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

[Amit Varma]: woman as it were.

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.680
[Amit Varma]: You've described your father as a Renaissance man.

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.400
[Amit Varma]: So that's where it comes from.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.400
[Amit Varma]: And so many other things.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.640

[Amit Varma]: your work and how you got to your work.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.960
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned earlier that you wanted to be like a medical doctor.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And but and baha se aap academics mein aagayi and became another kind of doctor entirely.

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120
[Guest]: So tell us about it.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.680
[Guest]: Pehli baat toh yeh ki, you know, dil ko behlane ke liye gaale bhi ek khayal achcha hai.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.640
[Guest]: Ki mai yeh bhi hoon, wo bhi hoon, apne khayalon mein toh, khayali pulao pakana badi achchi

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:51.640
[Guest]: baat hoti hai.

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.640
[Amit Varma]: I'll encourage everybody to do that.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Are you a daydreamer?

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640
[Amit Varma]: So what kind of daydreams do you have?

01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:03.480
[Guest]: I cannot talk about that on air, but yeah, you know, I yeah, so but it's nice.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480
[Guest]: It's always nice.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.680
[Guest]: You know, I get these emails that are meant for Ashwini Bire Deshpande, the classical

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:14.120
[Guest]: singer and often they are, oh, your concert last night was phenomenal.

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.760
[Guest]: And I just believe it's about me.

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.760
[Guest]: It makes me so happy.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.260
[Guest]: You know, so bas that's the kind of email I would love to receive.

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.440
[Guest]: So I think ki mere liye likha hoga zarur.

[Amit Varma]: Aur Ashwini ji ko bhi messages aate honge that thank you so much for, you know, your

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520
[Guest]: book on caste.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.960
[Guest]: I learned so much about the economics of discrimination.

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:36.480
[Guest]: I will tell you one story and then I'll answer earlier question, which is that all all my

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.960
[Guest]: life I've been receiving mails about her.

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.960
[Guest]: And whenever it's about logistics or some, you know, kahan, auditorium, yeh wo details,

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.280
[Guest]: I write back to them saying, you have reached the wrong person, please write.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:50.240
[Guest]: So that because I don't want the any mess up in her programs.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:54.120
[Guest]: And whenever it's a random praise about the concert, I take it, I accept the praise about

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:56.600
[Guest]: my wonderful concert.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:02.280
[Guest]: But last year, during the pandemic, the Hindustan Times was trying to get in touch with me to

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.000
[Guest]: get me to write an article on women's labor force participation.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.120
[Guest]: So I got a call and I think I must have been on Zoom or something and I didn't answer it.

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.160
[Guest]: So I called back and the person, the journalist said, who's this?

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:16.560
[Guest]: I said, Ashwini Deshpande, I believe I got a call from you.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.440
[Guest]: So they said, oh, but we've already talked.

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:22.880
[Guest]: So I said, no, because I was on a, on a Zoom call.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.760
[Guest]: They said, but you, you, you know, we wanted an article from you about women's labor force

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:29.980
[Guest]: participation and you agreed.

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:34.800
[Guest]: So I said, no, I don't, I didn't have that conversation with anyone.

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.040
[Guest]: And so I said, okay, whatever it is fine.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:40.780
[Guest]: I mean, I don't understand what's, it didn't occur to me at that time what might have happened.

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.120
[Guest]: And I said, okay, maybe this is a mistake.

01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.840
[Guest]: So bye.

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.760
[Guest]: And so I disconnected and about half an hour later, I got a call from the same journalist

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.040
[Guest]: saying, I'm so sorry, there's been a mistake.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.000
[Guest]: So apparently they got through to Ashwini Bhire Deshpande and they asked her to write

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.760
[Guest]: about women and work and all that.

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:05.160
[Guest]: And because she's a professional working woman, in addition to being a fabulous artist, she

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:10.000
[Guest]: said, oh, but I don't know whether I can write an article on women and work and all that.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.840
[Guest]: And she thought maybe they've been, they've asked her to write because she's a scientist

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.840
[Guest]: at BRC, et cetera.

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.840
[Guest]: And she's okay.

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.840
[Guest]: Let me try.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.840
[Unknown]: Who wrote it?

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840
[Amit Varma]: I wrote it.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:28.560
[Guest]: The fact that she was mistaken for me was a high point in my life because I really look

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.560
[Guest]: up to her.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.560
[Amit Varma]: We are kind of the same age.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.920
[Guest]: Did they call her back and tell her that, sorry, ma'am, wrong Ashwini.

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.080
[Guest]: But in the end, I wrote that article.

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.640
[Amit Varma]: It was for women's day last year.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.160
[Amit Varma]: Have you met her?

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:45.200
[Guest]: I have met her as in, the thing is that not only do we share a name, first name, first

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.360
[Guest]: names of our parents are identical.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:52.960
[Guest]: And apparently there's some connection between my mother's side of the family and her family,

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:56.000
[Guest]: some complicated relationship I'd forgotten right now.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.880
[Guest]: But one of the times that we went to a concert, my mother and I went up and my mother introduced

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:02.200
[Guest]: herself saying, I'm so-and-so, et cetera, et cetera.

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.000
[Guest]: And she immediately knew who my mother was.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.160
[Guest]: And then I was introduced and I said, oh, my name is also Ashwini and she said, oh,

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.160
[Guest]: yes.

01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.160
[Guest]: So, yes, I've met her in that.

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.200
[Amit Varma]: So her parents are also called Kalindi and Govind.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.160
[Guest]: Well, Govind and actually my mother's story of my mother's name Kalindi is a separate

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:19.520
[Guest]: one, maybe another time.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.840
[Guest]: But my mother was when she was born, she was named Manik.

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:25.200
[Guest]: So her parents are named Manik and Govind.

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.120
[Amit Varma]: So Manik Bide, the well-known singer is her mother.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.120
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:32.120
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.120
[Guest]: Yes.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.880
[Guest]: So getting back to your academic journey, I wish we could talk about your journey to

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:41.720
[Amit Varma]: becoming a, you know, this is a moment in the episode where both of us should discover

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:46.080
[Amit Varma]: with a shock that I invited the wrong Ashwini and I thought I was talking to that one.

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.360
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about when you gave your first concert and there should be that shock of recognition

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:58.480
[Guest]: on both our faces that, oh, my God, sorry, I called you by mistake, I'm sorry, I didn't

01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480
[Guest]: call you.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.480
[Guest]: Yes, but you also tell me what to do.

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:12.680
[Guest]: No, you know, I told you earlier about how I dropped out of music lessons, dance lessons.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.360
[Guest]: So my mother, you know, was ever an optimist.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.680
[Guest]: And so my despite the numerous times I dropped out of classes, she always believed that the

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.840
[Guest]: next time it will be for keeps.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:27.040
[Guest]: So she enrolled me in vocal music classes, Kathak classes, Sitar classes, and I kept

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.240
[Guest]: dropping out at different times.

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.680
[Guest]: Because at the time when it gets really difficult, that's the point I lose in.

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:35.320
[Guest]: I mean, I say, okay, I don't have the time to do this.

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.800
[Guest]: So I, when I moved to class 11, of course, I took science.

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.400
[Guest]: And all my classmates who were going for engineering or medicine, that was what everybody in my

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.840
[Guest]: class was doing.

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.440
[Guest]: They enrolled for these after school lessons, you know, these coaching classes, such Deva

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.120
[Guest]: medical or Evo.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.000
[Guest]: So basically, after school, you go straight to coaching class.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.680
[Guest]: And by the time you get home, it's about 8-8.30 at night.

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.920
[Guest]: So I said, do I have to spend two years like this?

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:06.880
[Guest]: So everyone said, yeah, otherwise you can't crack the entrance exam.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.400
[Guest]: And if you want to get into any decent medical college, you have to do this.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.180
[Guest]: So I said, I can't do it.

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.280
[Guest]: So I went for one or two days.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.280
[Guest]: And it's madness.

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.840
[Guest]: You know, there are these tiny rooms full of sweaty students.

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.480
[Guest]: And some boring person who is just giving you questions, you know, like, basically.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.000
[Guest]: So I said, there's no way.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.500
[Guest]: This is not happening.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:35.160
[Guest]: So I told my parents, I said, if this is the condition for medical exams, I don't want

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.160
[Guest]: to take it.

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:41.760
[Guest]: So my parents said, you only decided to take it, we didn't ask you to do it, but then figure

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.760
[Guest]: out what you want to do.

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.280
[Guest]: I mean, you are free to choose.

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.320
[Guest]: So in between, I had some dreams of becoming a pure scientist, like a research scientist.

01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.840
[Guest]: So I, in my 11th and 12th class projects, I took up some projects which were, so I wanted

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.640
[Guest]: to be a biology.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.960
[Guest]: So I went to Pusa Institute, I developed a project on mutation, etc, etc.

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.800
[Guest]: So I was interested in genetics.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:03.880
[Guest]: So I thought that that's what I'll do.

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:11.880
[Guest]: Then by the time it came to applying for colleges, everyone said, oh, but you know, BSc biology

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:16.440
[Guest]: karke kya karogi and you know, it's, there's no value of this degree, etc, etc.

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:20.720
[Guest]: So I mean, basically, I was not hearing good things about doing a BSc in biology.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.920
[Guest]: So I said, then what do I do?

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.160
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not doing medicine, I'm not going to do BSc in biology.

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.240
[Guest]: What what am I going to do with because I had, I had no social science background, you

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:36.520
[Guest]: know, the only thing I studied was fiction, or I would do my science work or whatever.

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.240
[Guest]: So I said, Okay, what is the subject that I can do where I can put all this mathematics

01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.600
[Guest]: and everything to use economics.

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.800
[Guest]: So I got into econ by default.

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.240
[Guest]: So I've been a little bit on the margins, I got into econ as default, then even the

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:55.280
[Guest]: kind of economics has do is, you know, not, I haven't had a career path, like many of

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.400
[Guest]: the other economists who've been on your show, where you go abroad, you do a PhD in a good

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:05.560
[Guest]: university, you get into a, you know, good department, you go this very high level, heavy

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.680
[Guest]: level publishing, that route, etc.

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.360
[Guest]: So I haven't really, my career trajectory has not been that.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:18.400
[Guest]: So it's a series of accidents that have basically, that I've landed up where I've landed up.

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:24.400
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, when you started doing econ as a subject, and I think what happens sometimes,

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:29.320
[Amit Varma]: where you fall in love with the subject while studying it, is that first you start studying

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.560
[Amit Varma]: it as a subject, ki textbooks mein yeh saare chapters hai, yeh subjects hai, yeh seekho,

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.560
[Amit Varma]: woh seekho.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:40.880
[Amit Varma]: But then, hopefully, you know, there comes that moment where it starts to connect itself

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.080
[Amit Varma]: to the real world.

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:47.520
[Amit Varma]: And where you can, like what I, I didn't study economics, but what, what made me fall in

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.800
[Amit Varma]: love with economics was when I realised that this is not about numbers and finance and

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:56.080
[Amit Varma]: economy and all of that, it's about human behaviour, you're studying, you're studying

01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.600
[Amit Varma]: the effects of scarcity, you're studying incentives, you're studying the why people do what they

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.600
[Amit Varma]: do.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And that just applies to everything.

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.600
[Amit Varma]: And I think that, that that was like a magical transformation for me to realise that, you

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:14.400
[Amit Varma]: know, economics gives me the frames and the tools to understand life, you know.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.480
[Amit Varma]: So was there a moment like that for you, like how did that process happen, where it goes

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:26.320
[Amit Varma]: from being a dry subject that you're studying for a degree to something that just shapes

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.400
[Amit Varma]: the way you look at the world?

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.120
[Guest]: Very much later.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:37.200
[Guest]: And I, I don't think very much like a mainstream traditional economist in any case, just at

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:38.200
[Guest]: a personal level.

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.760
[Guest]: So I have always been a little bit on the margin.

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:46.440
[Guest]: So I, I did, you know, you take exams, you learn, you study for the exams, you sort of,

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.360
[Guest]: you do whatever you do in the exam.

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.280
[Guest]: So that's one part of the story.

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:56.360
[Guest]: My PhD was not on any of this, you know, discrimination, caste, gender, social identity, nothing, none

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:57.360
[Guest]: of this.

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:01.480
[Guest]: I barely knew the contours of, not that I know a lot now, but I know a little bit more

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.360
[Guest]: than I knew at that time, which was zero.

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.600
[Guest]: And I, my PhD was on international debt and specifically looking at the debt crisis of

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.640
[Guest]: the 1970s.

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:16.640
[Guest]: And it had very little data, there was a tiny section with some data, but more or less,

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.640
[Guest]: it was theory.

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.920
[Guest]: So it was models and et cetera.

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.520
[Guest]: So while of course it was about people and all that, but it didn't directly connect with

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.200
[Guest]: people in, in this very organic way or a real way.

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.160
[Guest]: And I thought that's what I'll do.

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.280
[Guest]: I'll just keep writing papers of, you know, that kind, et cetera.

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:39.760
[Guest]: And then after I finished my PhD, I started sending out my chapters to journals.

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.720
[Guest]: And I had a book contract from OUP to write a book, extending my thesis to look at the

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:48.800
[Guest]: Mexican debt crisis, which has, which had just, there was another wave of the Mexican

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:52.840
[Guest]: debt default and the negotiations and all that, the details of which I miss are escaping

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.920
[Guest]: me now, but that was that.

02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:02.600
[Guest]: And again, another accident happened, which is that one of my papers that I had submitted

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:10.680
[Guest]: to a journal, one of the referees of that paper was an American economist who got in

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:16.160
[Guest]: touch with me to say that I should not be telling you this, but I'm a referee at this

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.400
[Guest]: journal for this paper that you've sent.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.360
[Guest]: And I really like it, et cetera, et cetera.

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.080
[Guest]: And he sent me an email and I obviously had cited his work.

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.080
[Guest]: So email was very new.

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.080
[Guest]: There was no Google.

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.200
[Guest]: So I couldn't Google this person to, you know, see what, what he looked like or whatever.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.880
[Guest]: And I was completely taken aback, obviously thrilled that to hear from someone who had

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.600
[Guest]: cited at a very young age, I mean, that's, that was just a real high.

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.040
[Guest]: And we started chatting over email.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.100
[Guest]: And then he said to me, would you like to come to the US for a postdoc?

02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:51.720
[Guest]: Of course, I didn't even know what a postdoc was at that time, because even now in India,

02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:55.560
[Guest]: postdocs are not very common, but at that time I had zero clue about any of this.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.560
[Guest]: And I said, what does it mean?

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.480
[Guest]: So he told me it will be a two year fellowship, no teaching, et cetera.

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.920
[Guest]: And long story short, I landed up there with my book contract and I said, you know, I don't

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.480
[Guest]: have to teach, so I can do all this.

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.160
[Guest]: And then we would talk every now and then he would talk about, oh, so what do you think

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.640
[Guest]: about the caste system in India?

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.280
[Guest]: You know, have you looked at gaps between caste groups and all that?

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:17.320
[Guest]: And I kept saying, I said, no, that's sociology.

02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:19.280
[Guest]: That's not economics.

02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.640
[Guest]: Economists in India don't look at all this.

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.100
[Guest]: And Delhi school at that time was, you know, one of the centers where very path breaking

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.980
[Guest]: work on Indian poverty was coming out.

02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:30.700
[Guest]: But none of it was differentiated by social identity.

02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:34.600
[Guest]: So we talked about the poor and the non-poor or the rich and the poor, but not by whether

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.160
[Guest]: they were male, female, this or that caste or anything.

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:42.720
[Guest]: And he said, no, economists, and of course, after I went there, I discovered that he was

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.720
[Guest]: African American, which I didn't know.

02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:49.200
[Guest]: And he said, no, I work on racial inequalities and economists in the U.S. work on racial

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200
[Guest]: inequalities.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:53.640
[Guest]: It's a very legitimate field of inquiry.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:55.040
[Guest]: And I said, well, not in India.

02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.360
[Guest]: Nobody works on, no economist works on caste in India.

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.520
[Guest]: And I said, there's no data anyway.

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.360
[Guest]: So what, you know, what are we talking about here?

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.960
[Guest]: And so there's this data set called National Family Health Survey, NFHS, which is now in

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.960
[Guest]: its fifth round.

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:15.120
[Guest]: At that time, the second round had come out and he said, you can use this data.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.960
[Guest]: Of course, I'd never actually used household survey data.

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.340
[Guest]: I'd only studied about it in a textbook.

02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:25.920
[Guest]: And studying about a regression in a textbook is a completely different cup of tea from

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:31.960
[Guest]: figuring out how to run anything on the computer, in which I had zero skills at that time.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:36.920
[Guest]: But I couldn't admit to him that I had never used household survey data.

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.640
[Guest]: So I said, yeah, sure, I can look at it.

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:44.560
[Guest]: And then I got another student to help and I said, you know, I need to learn some of

02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:47.640
[Guest]: these packages because I've never used them.

02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:52.440
[Guest]: So he taught me one, actually a rather difficult package at that time, not Stata, which I use

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.440
[Guest]: now.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.560
[Guest]: So I picked up some things and I eventually I wrote, and then I kept calling my father

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.400
[Guest]: every week, send me readings, send me this, I don't know what the caste system is, I need

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:08.140
[Guest]: to understand it detailed, you know, knowing about it in a sort of rough way is one thing,

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:11.120
[Guest]: but to study any social category seriously.

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.620
[Guest]: So I did a lot of work that is not by economists at all, you know, and so my father really

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:19.600
[Guest]: helped me sending references.

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.280
[Guest]: And I wrote my first paper, which I thought would be, just people will say, okay, fine,

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.720
[Guest]: we knew all this already.

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.040
[Guest]: So what's new about this paper?

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.480
[Guest]: I thought that's the kind of reception it will get.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.680
[Guest]: But it got the opposite reception.

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.680
[Guest]: People said, oh, this is new.

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.680
[Amit Varma]: We didn't know this, etc.

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:36.920
[Amit Varma]: What was the paper on?

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:43.640
[Guest]: It was just, so basically, the National Family Health Survey data has no income or consumption

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.480
[Guest]: data or wages.

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:49.000
[Guest]: So anything that economists would say, okay, I want to look at incomes, I want to look

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.920
[Guest]: at wages, but it has data on occupation, education, land ownership, etc.

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:59.840
[Guest]: So I created an index, like a human development index, and literally the same formula, and

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:03.640
[Guest]: I just called it the caste development index.

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:06.520
[Guest]: And so I thought it was a very simple paper.

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:13.140
[Guest]: And using the CDI, I showed the gap between the upper caste and the Dalits, all India

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:16.080
[Guest]: and across states and in each dimension.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:20.360
[Guest]: So I took five variables for the caste development index.

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:23.400
[Guest]: And of course, you can look at the aggregate index, but you can look at each of those variables

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.400
[Guest]: as well.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.320
[Guest]: And basically, I showed that in each of those components, there was a gap between the upper

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.600
[Guest]: caste in every state of the country and the Dalits, and I quantified that gap.

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:36.440
[Guest]: That's all the paper was.

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:43.680
[Guest]: But it was a surprise to people to see this at the national level, in the context of the

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:47.880
[Guest]: argument that the caste system is, you know, the hierarchies are narrowing, castes are

02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.460
[Guest]: basically vote blocks.

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:54.160
[Guest]: So Dalits are no longer as badly off, economically speaking, as people believe them to be, because

02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:58.340
[Guest]: political parties are vying for their votes, all the narrative about either a complete

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:02.760
[Guest]: upturning of the caste hierarchy, or certainly, of course, this was one point in time.

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:05.920
[Guest]: So we couldn't say anything about flattening or not, that work I've done later.

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:12.160
[Guest]: And this was just taking a snapshot in five indicators of well-being, what are the gaps

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:16.980
[Guest]: looking like between upper caste and Dalits.

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:23.820
[Guest]: And I really didn't think that anybody would read that paper or would find it interesting.

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:29.840
[Guest]: So very gingerly, I sent it to four or five people, fully expecting to be told that, okay,

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:32.780
[Guest]: fine, you know, pat on the back and now go back to doing your work.

02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:37.080
[Guest]: So I thought I'll go back to my Mexico book, and, you know, this was just to mainly to

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:41.000
[Guest]: not have to keep on having that same argument with my mentor.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.980
[Guest]: And then he loved the paper, and as did some others, and I presented it at a few places.

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:51.000
[Guest]: And I was a little surprised by the reaction it got.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.440
[Guest]: And I said, how could people not know this already?

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.640
[Guest]: I mean, why is this not common knowledge?

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:59.600
[Guest]: It seemed very intuitive to me.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.380
[Guest]: And so I wrote that paper, and I sent it to a journal, got published.

02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:07.200
[Guest]: Then somebody said, oh, I'm doing a book, can you just now look at gender also?

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.840
[Guest]: I said, oh, come on, give me a break.

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:12.560
[Guest]: I just did one paper with caste, now you want me to look at male, female also?

02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.880
[Guest]: And then Sandy said, well, why not?

02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:18.000
[Guest]: You have the data, just do male, female, and just do the same index again and show the

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
[Guest]: gaps between.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.840
[Guest]: So I did four categories, upper caste men, upper caste women, Dalit men, and Dalit women.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:26.200
[Guest]: And that shows a very interesting hierarchies.

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:30.960
[Guest]: That's how I started thinking about gender, because between for men, upper caste men are

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.940
[Guest]: better off than Dalit men, across all dimensions.

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:40.080
[Guest]: But for women, on material indicators, upper caste women are better off.

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:46.560
[Guest]: But this data set also has a whole lot of mobility and freedom of choice questions.

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.440
[Guest]: And there, at that time, upper caste women were not necessarily better off compared to

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.680
[Guest]: Dalit women.

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:59.720
[Guest]: So then I wrote a paper about the trade-off, you know, that women face, but not men.

02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:03.240
[Guest]: And then I linked a lot to the Brahmanical patriarchy, literature, I read Uma Chakravorty,

02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:05.440
[Guest]: I read a lot of things.

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:08.480
[Guest]: Then my mother sent me readings, my father sent me readings, you know, then it just one

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:11.120
[Guest]: thing led to the other kind of a thing, it started.

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:15.460
[Guest]: And the two years that I spent in the US just went, just reading.

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.320
[Guest]: And because I was not teaching, I had more time.

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:22.360
[Guest]: And I wrote a few papers, and then I never wrote that book.

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:25.360
[Guest]: And when I came back, I thought, okay, maybe I'll write the book.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:28.680
[Guest]: But by the time I came back, I was pretty sure that that's not going to happen.

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:33.160
[Guest]: Because then I introduced this course called economics of discrimination in the Delhi School,

02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.480
[Guest]: which was interestingly opposed both by my colleagues in the economics department, and

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.480
[Guest]: sociologists.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:42.600
[Guest]: Because some of my colleagues felt this is not economics.

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:47.000
[Guest]: And sociologists felt economists have no business talking about caste.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.600
[Guest]: And what is this reducing caste disparity to a number, you know, 26% don't have land

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.560
[Guest]: or 32% or whatever, reducing and what is this category called schedule caste, there's so

02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.440
[Guest]: much heterogeneity within.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:01.880
[Guest]: So by aggregating, you are, you know, essentializing, etc, etc.

02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:02.880
[Guest]: So I learned new words.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.600
[Guest]: I said, Okay, fine, I'm not arguing that there's no heterogeneity, yet, on the aggregate, this

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:14.680
[Guest]: category of groups has markedly lower outcomes than that category of individuals.

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:19.680
[Guest]: That's all I'm saying, not to deny heterogeneity within each of these categories.

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:22.040
[Guest]: And that's something that tells us something.

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:26.760
[Guest]: So that's how the this agenda started, and I never went back to international debt.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:31.080
[Guest]: And now it's literally I finished one paper, and while I'm doing that, there are five others

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.040
[Guest]: that have already started, which is, I know, not a good way of working.

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.080
[Guest]: But it's just questions that people are sometimes, it could be a random, something somebody posts

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.560
[Guest]: on Twitter, and give me an idea saying, Oh, this is interesting, I should, I can look

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:48.520
[Guest]: at this or something like that, you know, so it's the world is giving you ideas, basically.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.520
[Guest]: And conversations give you like, today, I might come up with, you know, think of you

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:56.160
[Guest]: might ask me something, and that can get me set me thinking about something.

02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:02.000
[Guest]: So then, that's, now I do work, which I think relates to the lives of people.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.840
[Guest]: But it's come very late in my career, but I'm really enjoying it.

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.320
[Guest]: I mean, I think this is the best part of my academic career.

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, earlier in the episode, I was thinking that maybe through the course of

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:19.040
[Amit Varma]: this episode, I should persuade Ashwini Ji or rather Ashwini as you're a young person

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:23.600
[Amit Varma]: to sort of write more about music and, you know, go back to that love.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.840
[Amit Varma]: But now just seeing the excitement on your face, you know, I can I can see how much this

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.120
[Amit Varma]: work kind of means to you and I totally get that.

02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.800
[Amit Varma]: When you did that first paper, is it that you thought that it is obvious because everybody

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:39.840
[Amit Varma]: of course knows the conclusion that upper castes are much better off than lower castes.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:45.920
[Amit Varma]: But the learning from that, and I'm just thinking aloud here is that these numbers matter quantifying

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.360
[Amit Varma]: this stuff matters because not just you get a snapshot of how things are at a particular

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.440
[Amit Varma]: point in time, which may even seem obvious, but over time when you have different data

02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:01.360
[Amit Varma]: sets from different years and different points, you can actually see social movement and you

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.120
[Amit Varma]: can actually have a sense of what is working and what is not and the direction that we

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:07.320
[Amit Varma]: are going in.

02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, these numbers sort of matter and that therefore, in a sense, these numbers

02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:17.640
[Amit Varma]: come to life, like a mistake that non that that people who sort of don't engage with

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.640
[Amit Varma]: numbers and and our brains are not wired to tackle big numbers, they just kind of blank

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.400
[Amit Varma]: out and it's just abstract.

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:27.240
[Amit Varma]: And a mistake that people often make when they think about economics is that, yeah,

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:32.840
[Amit Varma]: tk numbers, I am market up or down, I graph and what is the connection with the real world.

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.200
[Amit Varma]: But what all of your work does, especially because it is in these two areas, caste and

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:44.520
[Amit Varma]: gender is that it illuminates so much that affects real people in the real world.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And we can see this all around us.

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.440
[Amit Varma]: So is that a correct characterization?

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.720
[Guest]: I think that I think that numbers are very important because, you know, all of us are

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:57.760
[Guest]: intelligent and can make assertions.

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:02.320
[Guest]: All of us see the life world around us and we can make conclusions based upon what we

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.120
[Guest]: see around us.

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:10.720
[Guest]: But now that I teach statistics, the importance of correct sampling is more obvious to me

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:15.600
[Guest]: than it ever was before, because I am teaching statistics to 18 year olds.

02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:21.560
[Guest]: And therefore, how you sample is supremely important to the conclusions you're going

02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.040
[Guest]: to get.

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.800
[Guest]: You know, I mean, just to illustrate as a very lay person, you know, to a very lay person,

02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:31.320
[Guest]: supposing you have a salad with multiple layers of things like cheese and lettuce and whatever,

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.040
[Guest]: tomatoes and pieces of chicken or whatever.

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.920
[Unknown]: Bacon at the very top.

02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.840
[Guest]: And you don't mix it, right?

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:41.800
[Guest]: And you take a bite out of it.

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:46.040
[Guest]: Now, depending on how deep your fork has gone in, you will taste only the layers that have

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:48.860
[Guest]: that are in your mouth and you can draw a conclusion about that.

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:54.320
[Guest]: That won't be a wrong conclusion based on what you ate, but it is a wrong conclusion

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:55.900
[Guest]: about the salad bowl.

02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:01.440
[Guest]: So anything that you say about the top two layers would be an incorrect representation

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.320
[Guest]: of the salad bowl if it is not well mixed.

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:10.680
[Guest]: And if your spoonful is not picking up elements of all the layers that are in the salad bowl,

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:11.680
[Guest]: right?

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.600
[Guest]: So when you sample, I mean, obviously, whenever we draw conclusions from data, we are not

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:21.840
[Guest]: taking a census of 1.6 billion people, otherwise we'll never get any conclusions done.

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.760
[Guest]: That is why the importance of correct sampling cannot be overemphasized.

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:30.520
[Guest]: Otherwise, there are impressions and those impressions are fine.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:34.440
[Guest]: You know, I go out in the street and I see somebody doing something and based upon that

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:39.360
[Guest]: one person, I'll say something, you know, oh, this person is very hardworking or not

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.280
[Guest]: or whatever it might be, right?

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:47.200
[Guest]: Now that is my impression based upon the street outside the studio, which is a valid impression

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.120
[Guest]: of the street outside the studio.

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.680
[Guest]: But if I said that my visual impression of the street outside the studio says something

02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.360
[Guest]: about the population of Delhi or India, that would be a wrong conclusion.

02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:03.160
[Guest]: And now that I teach statistics and basic statistical methods, I always knew this theoretically

02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:06.040
[Guest]: and obviously, you know, that's what I've been working on.

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:11.160
[Guest]: But trying to explain this to 18 year olds, 19 year olds has brought a clarity in my own

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:19.480
[Guest]: thinking about the importance of sampling that I cannot convey to everybody strongly

02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:20.480
[Guest]: enough.

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:25.800
[Guest]: And that's what really bothers me when I see conclusions that are based upon incorrect

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:28.360
[Guest]: sampling, right?

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.800
[Guest]: And it's not just about choosing a sample, it's about the way you ask a question.

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:32.800
[Guest]: Is it a leading question?

02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:35.560
[Guest]: I mean, that even in law, you know, you're not allowed to are leading.

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.760
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is that when we are drawing conclusions about anything, there

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:45.880
[Guest]: is a certain rigor, there's a certain scientific method, just because it's economics or sociology

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:53.320
[Guest]: or anthropology doesn't mean the scientific method can be disregarded, right?

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:56.880
[Guest]: And so when you do all these things, then the numbers make sense.

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.880
[Guest]: So I'll qualify.

02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:58.880
[Amit Varma]: Numbers make a lot of sense.

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.240
[Amit Varma]: But you have to use them well.

02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:04.600
[Guest]: You have to generate them well and use them well, of course.

02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:10.480
[Guest]: But first, the generation of the numbers, how is the data coming the way it's coming?

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.880
[Guest]: That is a very important step.

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:19.000
[Guest]: And we often don't pay enough attention as much attention to this fact of generating

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.520
[Guest]: numbers the right way, as we should be doing.

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:27.440
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, I think that if you take a picture of the street outside the studio, it doesn't

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:30.040
[Amit Varma]: even tell you much about the street outside the studio.

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.320
[Amit Varma]: That's a picture at one point in time and things are so dynamic, it's changing, you

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.920
[Amit Varma]: are standing in one particular place looking from one particular angle.

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:43.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, I used to be a professional poker player for five years between 2010 and 2015.

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:47.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that poker taught me, and this is more sort of amplified in poker

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:48.880
[Amit Varma]: than anything else.

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And poker, of course, is a game of skill.

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.420
[Amit Varma]: But the quantum of luck is extremely high.

02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:58.280
[Amit Varma]: So the skill expresses itself only through a large sample size, right?

02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.560
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so it's so for us, a realistic sample size had to be really large.

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.080
[Amit Varma]: You could not tell if somebody had mastered a particular form of the game, by looking

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:12.520
[Amit Varma]: at say 1000 hands or 2000 hands, you needed a couple of million hands at least before

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.600
[Amit Varma]: you could safely say that this guy knows what he's doing, right, right, it was that big.

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.400
[Amit Varma]: So sometimes, you know, I look at like I look at nutrition studies, Pachas Logo Keto diet

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:27.840
[Amit Varma]: the Pachas Koe diet the and my mental, you know, I have to adjust my biases about sample

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:31.000
[Amit Varma]: size, because I'm just thinking key are yet to kuch bhi nahi hai.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.480
[Amit Varma]: But obviously, for different fields.

02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:39.320
[Amit Varma]: So another question you mentioned that in the social sciences, you know, that how you

02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:44.320
[Amit Varma]: generate these numbers matters and the method matters and all that are, I was chatting with

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.560
[Amit Varma]: my mutual friend Shruti Rajgopalan once about experiments in the social sciences and the

02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:52.640
[Amit Varma]: kind of conclusions that we can draw from them.

02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.720
[Amit Varma]: And she made a very good point and she was citing someone I forget who, but the point

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.820
[Amit Varma]: was essentially that let us say that you want to run an experiment on whether dropping a

02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:07.920
[Amit Varma]: coin into a particular amount of water will raise will displace a little water and raise

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:10.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, the level of the water or whatever.

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, in a scientific experiment, what you would do is you would have a lab with controlled

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.280
[Amit Varma]: conditions and you would have a beaker of water and you would measure everything and

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:21.580
[Amit Varma]: you would put a coin in there and then you would measure the level again.

02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:25.600
[Amit Varma]: And the answer you would get is conclusive and you can establish causation and all of

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.600
[Amit Varma]: that.

02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:31.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, what happens in the social sciences is you're effectively dropping the coin in a

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:37.280
[Amit Varma]: massive swimming pool full of hundreds of people jumping in and out and there's a storm

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:42.080
[Amit Varma]: overhead and it's raining and that's the result you get and how you know, the water could

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:46.640
[Amit Varma]: go up, it could go down, you can make all kinds of theories about coins and water and

02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:49.400
[Amit Varma]: it gets incredibly messy, right?

02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:55.880
[Amit Varma]: So that is something that I sometimes think about that what I see in the social sciences

02:17:55.880 --> 02:18:02.120
[Amit Varma]: is that the conclusion that people arrive at seems to be determined by the ideologies

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.360
[Amit Varma]: or the prisms that they bring to the table.

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:09.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, where you stand depends on where you sit as that old sort of saying goes.

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:16.720
[Amit Varma]: So how do you and this is obviously really broad and you know, the science in the social

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:21.280
[Amit Varma]: sciences has progressed a lot and these are dangers that every serious social scientist

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.280
[Amit Varma]: is kind of aware of.

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:26.880
[Amit Varma]: How do you tackle for something like this?

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:27.960
[Guest]: It's hard.

02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:31.240
[Guest]: It definitely is hard because as you say, you know, there are what we call confounding

02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.780
[Guest]: factors because many other things are simultaneously changing.

02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:41.280
[Guest]: So getting at causation in an isolated way is hard and the randomized control trial methodology

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.400
[Guest]: is precisely trying to do that.

02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.440
[Guest]: But there are other issues with randomized control trials, which is A, just the difficulty

02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:48.440
[Guest]: of doing it.

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:51.760
[Guest]: B, big picture questions can't be tackled by because you're just wearing one little

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.480
[Guest]: thing and checking the impact.

02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.640
[Guest]: I'm not going into that debate because that's very well known.

02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.040
[Guest]: So the quest for getting the right causation continues, right?

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:06.520
[Guest]: And I don't think there's a magic answer as yet.

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:10.320
[Guest]: But I think as social scientists, we must be aware always of pitfalls.

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:16.480
[Guest]: We must always and I think humility helps here, which that's a very important part.

02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:21.800
[Guest]: I think of being this should be an important part of is that I may not be seeing the whole

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.960
[Guest]: picture and that may be out there.

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:26.800
[Guest]: So the willingness to learn, the willingness to engage with nuance, you know, the other

02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:32.720
[Guest]: thing that that's apart from the fact how data is generated is, as we were talking about

02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.760
[Guest]: earlier on, you know, related to social media, which is unwillingness to engage with nuance,

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:38.760
[Guest]: you know.

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.560
[Guest]: So for example, I'll give you an example in the context of the Indian labor force, female

02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:46.040
[Guest]: labor force participation debate, which is there are two problems.

02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:48.400
[Guest]: One is labor force participation rate is falling.

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.080
[Guest]: The other is violence against women in public spaces.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.840
[Guest]: Now the numbers are increasing, which is always, there's always a question mark about violence

02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:00.640
[Guest]: numbers, which is, is it better reporting or is it incident, like are women empowered

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:03.680
[Guest]: enough to report or is it actual incidents going up?

02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:07.440
[Guest]: And at the end of the day, there's no firm answer to this, however, whatever it is, but

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.960
[Guest]: the numbers at least are rising.

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:14.320
[Guest]: Now both these are very serious problems, but that doesn't mean automatically that they

02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:15.480
[Guest]: are related.

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:20.240
[Guest]: You know, so my, my student Jitendra Singh and I, we looked at 146 countries and we got

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:25.840
[Guest]: data on violence against women in public spaces and their female labor force participation

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:31.560
[Guest]: rates and violence against women is a problem everywhere, but we don't find a systematic

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:38.300
[Guest]: relationship between FLFP and, and violence against women in public spaces or violence

02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.300
[Guest]: against women.

02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:43.360
[Guest]: And the one obvious reason for that is that a lot of violence against women takes place

02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:44.360
[Guest]: at home.

02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:47.560
[Guest]: You know, people say women are afraid to go out and work because they don't want to be

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:53.640
[Guest]: molested, which assumes that at home they will not be molested.

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:58.400
[Guest]: I have, and my co-authors have field, you know, field trip after field trip, women telling

02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:03.160
[Guest]: us we want to leave the home, we don't want to be locked up, you know, inside our home

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:08.480
[Guest]: with the husband or father-in-law or whoever, even mother-in-law sometime, which may or

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:12.120
[Guest]: may not be physical violence, but it's certainly abuse, you know?

02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:17.840
[Guest]: So if you don't look at violence inside the home, you will always think, oh, it's only

02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:20.240
[Guest]: violence outside the home, which is of course a serious problem.

02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:24.760
[Guest]: There's no denying that that's an issue, but does it automatically translate into female

02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:27.720
[Guest]: labor force participation rates lowering?

02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:28.720
[Guest]: Not clear.

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:32.120
[Guest]: But if you've already made up your mind that that's an issue, bas katham, you know?

02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:39.320
[Guest]: So I think that there is no harm in acknowledging that the problem is harder to pin down than

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:42.760
[Guest]: this one, this or any other simple explanation for that matter.

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:45.640
[Guest]: You can take, I mean, you can replace violence against women with something else.

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:47.880
[Guest]: Again, there'll be a similar issue.

02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:53.120
[Guest]: So as social scientists, we have to be aware of, if you're working with data, which I think

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:57.480
[Guest]: everybody should, but if you're working with data, how that data is generated, how it is

02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:04.360
[Guest]: used, how best to establish causality and learn from evidence from other disciplines

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:09.520
[Guest]: in a, for economists, I would say, learn from evidence from other disciplines in a humble

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.520
[Guest]: way.

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:16.240
[Guest]: So today, for example, economists have discovered social norms, which other disciplines have

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.840
[Guest]: always known.

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:21.720
[Guest]: But now the pendulum has shrunk to the other side, which is when you talk about female

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:25.200
[Guest]: labor force participation rate, no economic factor can possibly explain it.

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.920
[Guest]: It only has to be social norms.

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:28.800
[Guest]: Are kyun bhai?

02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:33.080
[Guest]: Social norms ki baat karo, toh why can't we simple demand supply factors?

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:37.520
[Guest]: Why aren't Indian women affected by that?

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.800
[Guest]: You know, they are as rational human beings as any other human beings on the planet, you

02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:43.800
[Guest]: know?

02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:48.840
[Guest]: So it's great that economists have broadened their view, you know, horizon, but an incorrect

02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:54.960
[Guest]: reading of social norms is actually dangerous to the analysis of the problem into which

02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:01.600
[Guest]: many traditional economic factors must enter, I think, you know, so, but, you know, academic

02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.480
[Guest]: disciplines are vast.

02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.880
[Guest]: And there have always been, not just now, there have always been different points of

02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:13.520
[Guest]: view, controversial conclusions, people disagreeing with each other on the same thing, you know,

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:15.800
[Amit Varma]: I think that's healthy.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And within, you know, you mentioned humility, being open to nuance, and especially being

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:27.160
[Amit Varma]: open to the notion that a fashionable explanation, or the conventional explanation may be wrong.

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:31.680
[Amit Varma]: Just look at the data, make sure the data is as good and as generated with as much intellectual

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:34.440
[Amit Varma]: honesty as you can manage, and then see where it takes you.

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, is there a problem in academia also, that there are these fashions in academia,

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:46.520
[Amit Varma]: there are these conventions, people think in certain ideological ways through certain

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:47.600
[Amit Varma]: prisms.

02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the temptation for a young academic looking to move up within the profession

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:56.120
[Amit Varma]: is to conform to those or at least not be too much of an outlier.

02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:57.120
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.120
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.120
[Guest]: Right.

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:04.360
[Guest]: Not just ideological, but even methods, you know, so methods become fashionable.

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:09.000
[Guest]: You know, so if a particular method is fashionable, everybody wants to just join the bandwagon,

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.440
[Guest]: because then you feel, oh, my paper is more likely to be published, because if I do this

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:17.680
[Guest]: or that, or if I work on this field or that, you know, so fields become fashionable, methods

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:23.760
[Guest]: become fashionable, ideologies become fashionable, you know, and the, I guess, because I'm being

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:28.600
[Guest]: a little bit of an outlier, almost in every field, it hasn't bothered me personally that

02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:29.600
[Guest]: much.

02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:34.680
[Guest]: Because I think this is, again, a legacy of my father, where he belonged and didn't belong

02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:39.200
[Guest]: to any one, any one field or ideology, you know.

02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:44.040
[Guest]: So the right wing thought of him as too leftist, the left wing thought of him as not left enough,

02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:46.560
[Guest]: you know, so and so thought of him as not this way, not that way.

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:49.760
[Guest]: So he sort of didn't really belong to any club.

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:54.080
[Guest]: And I, when I think about myself, I sort of feel that way, a little bit, which is, I'm

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:56.120
[Guest]: a little bit of an outlier, you know, on this.

02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:00.880
[Guest]: So I haven't gone on this high track publishing, you know, that career path or whatever.

02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.920
[Guest]: So I'm a little unencumbered by this.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:06.560
[Guest]: Of course, it has its own downsides, and it has its own risks.

02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:09.400
[Guest]: But you know, I enjoy doing what I do.

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.560
[Guest]: And I'm, you know, from my mother, I've learned not to be self conscious, you know, you do

02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:16.680
[Guest]: what you what you believe in doing kind of a thing.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:17.680
[Guest]: But it's hard.

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.960
[Guest]: It's really hard for, because I see young people now, they're so career oriented, literally

02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:24.640
[Guest]: from the day they joined the PhD program.

02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:30.560
[Guest]: So who you will sit with in a at a conference table, you know, they will, and I don't blame

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:31.560
[Guest]: them.

02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:35.320
[Guest]: Because that's the way you know, it's like, you go to a conference, you suss out who's

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:36.640
[Guest]: there, you know, etc, etc.

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.400
[Guest]: You choose sessions you choose, you know, and it may be happening unconsciously, not

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.480
[Guest]: that people are planning it that way actively.

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:50.400
[Guest]: But building networks doing you know, sort of it's fine, you know, I feel like I'm, I've

02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:51.560
[Guest]: escaped all that.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.640
[Guest]: And now I'm on the other side of 50.

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:55.880
[Guest]: So you know, now it doesn't matter anyway.

02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:02.080
[Guest]: But it's like, I feel like I've done what I what has excited me.

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.320
[Guest]: And as a result, it's, it's a body of work.

02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:09.320
[Guest]: You know, I wouldn't say, you know, there's this one paper that I did, which has been

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:13.120
[Guest]: in AER or Econometrica, and it's changed the way the discipline has worked.

02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:14.800
[Guest]: Obviously not, nothing like that.

02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:16.340
[Guest]: But it's a body of work.

02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:19.760
[Guest]: And I feel that that body of work I have enjoyed doing, whether it's made any difference to

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.760
[Guest]: anyone is not for me to say, but I have enjoyed doing it.

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:29.080
[Guest]: And it's sort of coming together, you know, in this way of role of social identity, when

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:34.200
[Guest]: you move away from an individual to a group, you know, how does that work in an economic

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:35.200
[Guest]: setting?

02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:40.760
[Guest]: So it's that larger field and I, you know, and so affirmative, all of that falls in the

02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:44.200
[Guest]: same sort of broad, these are complicated issues.

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:45.880
[Guest]: These are controversial issues.

02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:46.880
[Guest]: There are no clear answers.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:47.880
[Guest]: I don't have clear answers.

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.000
[Guest]: But I think that these are exciting problems.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:58.120
[Guest]: And precisely because they are nuanced, I enjoy doing it because I, I like the challenge

02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:59.740
[Guest]: of nuance.

02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:02.840
[Guest]: You know, when you when you are unable to say something with certainty that this is

02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:08.200
[Guest]: it, I found a, you know, magical solution to this problem, which I guess from a careerist

02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:13.000
[Guest]: point of view is not the greatest thing, but it's fine.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you know, what you say about both your father and yourself that you never belonged

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.520
[Amit Varma]: in this or that is resonant with me as well, because I've always kind of felt that in any

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:26.280
[Amit Varma]: domain that I've been in, I'm not mainstream and the elites don't want me at the table.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:30.400
[Amit Varma]: But now I feel now that it makes two of us, maybe the horror we do belong somewhere.

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.880
[Unknown]: It's a club of two.

02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:34.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to resist that and say no, no.

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:40.760
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one of my dear friends, Ajay Shah, often talks about, laments about, laments

02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.800
[Amit Varma]: the fact that a lot of economists, and I think this would apply to people in any academic

02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:52.800
[Amit Varma]: field, especially in the humanities, a lot of economists start playing that academic

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.640
[Amit Varma]: game where they get trapped in what is essentially an academic circle jerk, and that's my term,

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.680
[Amit Varma]: not his, where, you know, they are signaling to each other, writing for each other and

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:05.000
[Amit Varma]: it's a circular game, they have to publish so much, these are the journals where they

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.760
[Amit Varma]: publish, you know, he got tenure, he became a professor, and it's this whole game and

02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:12.360
[Amit Varma]: they don't engage enough with the real world.

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:18.120
[Amit Varma]: And as someone who has engaged a lot with the real world in policy domains, and so on,

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:23.480
[Amit Varma]: Ajay's lament is that I wish there were more brilliant people who actually did this, you

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:28.880
[Amit Varma]: know, he sort of talks about so much talent being wasted, because you're trapped inside

02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.800
[Amit Varma]: this little game, and you're not really kind of engaging with the real world.

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, you've also bucked the trend of being there, like just a very fact that

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.960
[Amit Varma]: you taught the economics of discrimination in the early 2000s.

02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:44.720
[Amit Varma]: Whenever you started the course, the economists aren't doing that the sociologists don't want

02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:47.320
[Amit Varma]: you to teach that everybody is like, what the hell?

02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:49.880
[Amit Varma]: So you're clearly you know, you're kind of bucking that trend.

02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:55.520
[Amit Varma]: So one, do you think that, you know, this is a problem with academia that people can

02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:00.840
[Amit Varma]: become the prisoners of domains that they can enter these silos, silos of specialization

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.880
[Amit Varma]: and kind of get trapped in that and just play that game all their lives.

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.480
[Amit Varma]: And if you were to advise sort of young people, maybe young academics, maybe people thinking

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:14.400
[Amit Varma]: of a scholarly career, you know, what would you say?

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.960
[Guest]: I think all careers have their own compulsions, you know, I wouldn't say only academics has

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:22.800
[Guest]: it, you know, I mean, you're training to be a cricket player, you know, you have to, there

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:26.560
[Guest]: are certain ropes you have to, you have to learn, you have to climb, you know, things

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.400
[Guest]: like that.

02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:32.920
[Guest]: So succeeding in a career has its own demands.

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:38.560
[Guest]: And I wouldn't blame anyone for following the dictates of that demand.

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:43.840
[Guest]: You know, I mean, if you have to publish in quality journals, you have to publish in quality

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:44.840
[Guest]: journals.

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:45.840
[Guest]: I mean, that's the requirement of the profession.

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but the point is, cricketers are judged on how well they score in front of packed

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.360
[Amit Varma]: stadiums, right?

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:56.800
[Guest]: So they're not performing in the nets in front of a committee of experts.

02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:58.240
[Guest]: So cricket was a bad example.

02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:05.800
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to say is that what it takes to succeed in a particular field, you

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:13.080
[Guest]: broadly know that, and then you have to follow some of those, the sort of the set pathways.

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:19.280
[Guest]: And breaking free is, you know, from a career point, unless you just change careers, or

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:21.920
[Guest]: you are, you know, it's also a question of privilege.

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:26.600
[Guest]: I mean, the thing is that if you have inherited money, you have legacy, you know, you can

02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:30.800
[Guest]: say, okay, I'm going to just discover myself and, you know, one year, I'll just play jazz

02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:31.800
[Guest]: music.

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:35.800
[Guest]: Another year, I'm just going to, you know, make films on my iPhone or whatever.

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:38.320
[Guest]: But that's because somebody is paying for my bread and butter.

02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:40.380
[Guest]: Now, that's a very, very privileged position.

02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:44.120
[Guest]: But if you have to earn a bread and butter, and if you have to publish in an academic

02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:48.240
[Guest]: institution, then there are certain demands that that institution places, whether those

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:50.920
[Guest]: demands are valid or not is in a different conversation.

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:55.160
[Guest]: But as long as there are some rules of the game, in order to succeed at that game, you

02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:56.840
[Guest]: have to follow the rules of the game.

02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:01.680
[Guest]: You can always be in the policy world, you know, but there you can make the other point,

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:09.240
[Guest]: which is that the policy world also needs to engage with high quality evidence, right?

02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:11.280
[Guest]: And so how do you make the two meet?

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:15.720
[Guest]: And for very young researchers, it'll be hard, I think, those who are in academics, those

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:21.240
[Guest]: who won't go into policy, etc, that's a different story, but I guess, there comes a time for

02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:26.120
[Guest]: many economists, when especially, you know, 50 plus, that you willy nilly starting it,

02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:28.320
[Guest]: some people do it more actively, some people do it less.

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:34.240
[Guest]: But if you're working on issues that are policy, amenable to policy implications, or actionable

02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:39.920
[Guest]: policy, then you start sort of engaging with the policy world as well.

02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:44.420
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel about the inevitable trade off that we're all confronted with, between

02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:45.840
[Amit Varma]: breadth and depth?

02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Like on the one hand, there is a temptation to pick one subject, and just go really deep

02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:51.200
[Amit Varma]: into that.

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And there is enormous value in that, because you might end up going deeper than anyone

02:31:54.920 --> 02:32:00.680
[Amit Varma]: else has gone, and, you know, completely figure out that subject really deeply.

02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:04.880
[Amit Varma]: The danger in that, of course, is you could pick an obscure subject, like, you know, cereal

02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:07.520
[Amit Varma]: prices in Mexico in 1830.

02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:12.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it has no resonance, it doesn't, there's nothing there.

02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:17.720
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, there is a temptation to go broad, that apply frameworks from, say,

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:22.240
[Amit Varma]: different disciplines, or even within your own discipline, just keep it broad, build

02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:27.380
[Amit Varma]: broad narratives, or try to come up with grand theories that explain things and all of that.

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And both of these have the danger, the danger in going too deep is that you're not seeing

02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:32.560
[Amit Varma]: enough of the big picture.

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:39.240
[Amit Varma]: The danger in only trying for the big picture can mean that you, you get everything wrong,

02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:42.680
[Amit Varma]: because you don't get any of the detail as any specialist could tell you.

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:47.880
[Amit Varma]: So how does one sort of manage that trade off, because they're both appealing, and you

02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:52.760
[Amit Varma]: could argue that you actually can appeal to more people and get in television studios

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:58.600
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, by just taking the broad kind of view, you know, and, I mean, at some

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:03.480
[Amit Varma]: point, you need to be broad at some point, you need to be deep, how do you manage these

02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:04.480
[Guest]: tensions?

02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:10.240
[Guest]: It's hard, but I think on balance, if I had to give a very short answer, my view would

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:15.720
[Guest]: be that whatever it is that you say, shouldn't be wrong.

02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:19.520
[Guest]: So if by being broad, you're saying wrong things, I'll say don't be broad.

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:23.720
[Amit Varma]: If by going deep, you're saying wrong things, don't go deep.

02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:27.840
[Amit Varma]: I guess without a specific example in my mind, sometimes you can go broad not by being wrong,

02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:29.720
[Guest]: but by not being nuanced enough.

02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:30.720
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:31.720
[Guest]: So that's what I'm saying.

02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:35.440
[Guest]: If somebody like you take a very popular author, like best selling author, like Harari, you

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:36.440
[Guest]: all know Harari.

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:40.960
[Guest]: Now, we've all read his books, I mean, I haven't read all of them, but I've read some things,

02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:43.600
[Guest]: and very impressive, very, very nicely written, etc.

02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:45.800
[Guest]: There's millions of copies all over the world.

02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:49.760
[Guest]: Now I recently read an article, which is a critique of Harari and how he's glossed over

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:52.880
[Guest]: some of the nuance to the point of getting it wrong.

02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:56.560
[Guest]: So one of the dangers of glossing over nuance is that you could end up saying the wrong

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.960
[Guest]: thing.

02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:04.920
[Guest]: So I guess my short answer to this would be to not achieve for such a big picture that

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:07.240
[Guest]: you're just getting everything wrong.

02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:11.600
[Guest]: So have a sense of the context, but then go deep into it.

02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:16.960
[Guest]: You know, so for example, if you're studying, I don't know, the caste system in India, right?

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.240
[Guest]: Now when I started, I literally, you know, I knew some things from my personal life,

02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:22.240
[Guest]: etc.

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:26.520
[Guest]: But I hadn't studied the caste system because social science was never my domain, you know,

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.120
[Guest]: I'd always been a science student.

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:32.080
[Guest]: And I never read nonfiction in social science, because that was never my, I didn't, I didn't

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:34.540
[Guest]: think that I was going to go down that way.

02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:41.120
[Guest]: And so knowing about personal episodes of caste and one's own brush with the caste system

02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:44.960
[Guest]: in different ways, a totally different thing from knowing what the hell this whole thing

02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:46.080
[Guest]: is about.

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:51.560
[Guest]: And so I found the broader readings, books that my father suggested to me at that time,

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:52.560
[Guest]: extremely useful.

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:57.120
[Guest]: None of it is in the papers that I've written, but reading those was extremely useful for

02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.720
[Guest]: me to just situate the whole thing.

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:03.960
[Guest]: And even now, every now and then, I really miss my father, because every now and then

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:07.680
[Guest]: I literally want to call him up and say, Baba, I want a reading on this particular aspect.

02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:10.080
[Guest]: And of course, he's not there any longer.

02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:13.800
[Guest]: So I have to just Google and find things on my own.

02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:18.920
[Guest]: But again, you know, the point that I said about humility is important is because if

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:24.080
[Guest]: I had begun by thinking that, okay, I'm, you know, God's gift to humanity on the caste

02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:25.080
[Guest]: question.

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:28.160
[Guest]: And I'm going to unveil answers that no scholar before me has ever done.

02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:34.200
[Guest]: And you know, I'm this very smart person who's now going to tell everybody else, okay, here's

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:36.400
[Guest]: what you guys don't know about caste and I'm telling you this.

02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:42.040
[Guest]: If I had gone into it with that approach, I don't think it would have worked at all.

02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:46.400
[Guest]: I was bound to get, I mean, not that I know a lot now, but I'm still learning and literally

02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:47.760
[Guest]: I learn every day.

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:55.680
[Guest]: And because I see myself as a student of this field rather than as an expert, it always

02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:00.320
[Guest]: helps me because when I read something new, I say, oh, right, this is it.

02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.960
[Guest]: You know, and in this, you know, this is the history, something like that, you know.

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.820
[Guest]: And that adds up to then finally start becoming a big picture.

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.280
[Guest]: So you go in depth.

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:14.800
[Guest]: In order to go in depth, you learn little bits every time.

02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:17.040
[Guest]: And then it adds up to a big picture.

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:20.920
[Guest]: So I would say if you're working on something for the first time, maybe take the depth approach

02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:27.720
[Guest]: first, do a little bit of in-depth pieces, then sit back and say, okay, I've done five

02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:29.400
[Guest]: deep dives.

02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:31.720
[Guest]: How is this picture adding up?

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.400
[Guest]: Which part, how many pieces of the jigsaw have I connected?

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:37.700
[Guest]: Not all, but some.

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:42.100
[Guest]: So now a little bit of the picture is emerging rather than saying, okay, now I'm just looking

02:36:42.100 --> 02:36:46.160
[Guest]: at you guys from the sky and I can just see the whole picture.

02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:47.360
[Guest]: I think that's the problem.

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:54.320
[Guest]: And many people fall prey to that, to that tendency, which is that I am looking at you

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:58.600
[Guest]: from the sky and I can see something that you can't because you are in the picture.

02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.920
[Guest]: I'm on top, I'm taking an aerial view and I see everything.

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.080
[Guest]: And so I'm explaining it to you now, something that you can't see, that's where things start

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:08.080
[Guest]: to go wrong.

02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:13.100
[Amit Varma]: And I think there's this human danger also of look, how do we understand the world by

02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:15.760
[Amit Varma]: telling stories about the world to ourselves?

02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And this is tempting and, you know, it leads to a certain amount of comfort if we can tell

02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:23.500
[Amit Varma]: a story about something that explains it to us.

02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:28.280
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of stories tend to be stories that are too simple and often stories that are

02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:29.860
[Amit Varma]: wrong like religion.

02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:35.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so I completely agree with you that it makes sense to go for depth, some

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:36.680
[Amit Varma]: depth before breadth.

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:41.080
[Amit Varma]: The other, I love your jigsaw puzzle metaphor and the other one that I bring in is that

02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:45.120
[Amit Varma]: when you paint a picture by joining dots, and the thing is, if you don't have enough

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.680
[Amit Varma]: dots, exactly, then you know, a horse can appear to be a chair, right?

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.520
[Amit Varma]: You need enough dots to have a sense of what you're painting a picture of and the more

02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.880
[Amit Varma]: dots you have, the more accurate they will be.

02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And the question for a scholar also will be what if you're trying to paint a picture of

02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.880
[Amit Varma]: 10 different things, and you don't feel like you have the, you know, can fill enough dots

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:05.160
[Amit Varma]: in each of them.

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And there's there's a term called Gelman amnesia, have you heard of it?

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:09.520
[Amit Varma]: No.

02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:14.360
[Amit Varma]: So it's named after the physicist Murray Gelman, who once made the observation that when you

02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:19.640
[Amit Varma]: read a newspaper, and there's an article on a subject that you know a lot about, you read

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:22.960
[Amit Varma]: that article, and you realize it's full of shit, right, they got it wrong.

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:26.200
[Amit Varma]: But when you read everything else in the newspaper about things that you don't know anything

02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:28.420
[Amit Varma]: about, you assume that it is correct.

02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:31.360
[Amit Varma]: So that's Gelman amnesia, you forget that they got that wrong.

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:36.560
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that with scholars who are too broad, it can seem like this, that when somebody

02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.440
[Amit Varma]: like a Harari, and he was actually the name I had in mind before you mentioned that when

02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:44.760
[Amit Varma]: someone like a Harari tells these beautiful stories that explain everything, I'm like,

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.480
[Amit Varma]: yeah, man, it explains everything.

02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:52.640
[Amit Varma]: But if he happens to write about a subject I know, I'll be like, wait a minute, yeah.

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.080
[Amit Varma]: So okay, so a final question about sort of academics and the academic journey before

02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:00.560
[Amit Varma]: we dive into both caste and gender, which I want to do, because your work is both so

02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.520
[Amit Varma]: detailed and so important.

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:08.520
[Amit Varma]: One of my guests, I forget who was, you know, use a metaphor of the Indian civil services

02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.360
[Amit Varma]: to talk about how there will be people who you know, for those who don't know, you give

02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:14.880
[Amit Varma]: the UPSC exam.

02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And depending on your rank, you get, you know, Foreign Service or IAS or IPS and the lower

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.320
[Amit Varma]: services and this guest, I think it was, you know, Mahima Vashisht in a recent episode

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:28.200
[Amit Varma]: who's been a civil servant, made the point about how so many of us seniors in one of

02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:34.560
[Amit Varma]: the lesser civil services, so to say, would have this resentment, ki yaar, agar mujhe

02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:39.680
[Amit Varma]: UPSC mein doh mark zyada milte is subject mein, toh aaj main London mein Indian Foreign

02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:41.640
[Amit Varma]: Services mein hota.

02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And the tragedy and the injustice of that system is that an exam you give sometime in

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:50.920
[Amit Varma]: your early 20s determines where you land up at age 59.

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Right?

02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.480
[Amit Varma]: So it is almost like that one event just sort of changes everything.

02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:04.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, in an academic sense, it strikes me that a lot of what happens is also sort of happenstance

02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:05.200
[Amit Varma]: like that.

02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.360
[Amit Varma]: Like which universe, which foreign university do you happen to go through?

02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:12.840
[Amit Varma]: Do you happen to make it to a foreign university in the first place?

02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:14.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, who is your advisor there?

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Some people can get lucky to get a good PhD advisor, some get a bad one, where do you

02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:20.960
[Amit Varma]: subsequently work?

02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And anywhere along the journey, it can fall apart.

02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.800
[Amit Varma]: And often it strikes me that this starting point can be something incredibly unfair.

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:33.280
[Amit Varma]: This starting point can be ki theek hai, you know, your parents weren't well, you had to

02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:38.120
[Amit Varma]: be in India to look after them, aap abroad jaani paay, financial circumstances nahi the,

02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:43.800
[Amit Varma]: aapne yahi pe kuch kar liya locally, or no matter how brilliant you were, you are always

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:49.200
[Amit Varma]: looked upon as lower on the ladder than somebody who had the benefit of a better education.

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:50.520
[Amit Varma]: That's one aspect of it.

02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.600
[Amit Varma]: Another aspect of it is that you could be an Indian scholar, who knows a subject in

02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:01.160
[Amit Varma]: great detail, whose work has rigor, nuance, everything, but somebody from some foreigner

02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:06.520
[Amit Varma]: from a foreign university will come and turn their orientalist gaze on your subject and

02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:11.240
[Amit Varma]: mouth wake general generalities and you know, say banal things, sometimes you're wrong,

02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:13.800
[Amit Varma]: sometimes you're right with what's a big deal.

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And, and they get all the media attention and the book deals and everything and you

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.360
[Unknown]: are like, what the fuck, you know, I've worked all my life on this shit.

02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:25.640
[Amit Varma]: So what do you sort of feel about this?

02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Because I meet a lot of brilliant academics who are not big names, who are not there on

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.440
[Amit Varma]: the ladder, right?

02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And I and vice versa, right?

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:37.800
[Amit Varma]: So what do you feel about this?

02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And how, you know, how does one then deal with that resentment?

02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Or how does one come to terms with ki theek hai jo hai so hai?

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:48.920
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:59.440
[Guest]: So I didn't go abroad for my PhD for personal reasons, and there is a, I got, I got a super

02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:03.960
[Guest]: fantastic advisor in the form of Kaushik Basu, who was at that time at the Delhi school.

02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:05.840
[Guest]: So I really enjoyed my PhD with him.

02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:09.440
[Guest]: So no regrets at all on that front at all.

02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:10.440
[Guest]: Zero regrets.

02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:11.440
[Guest]: However,

02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:12.440
[Guest]: So my question was generally,

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:22.480
[Guest]: So the American system, because of the rigors of coursework, you know, every PhD student

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:25.040
[Guest]: has to do two years of coursework.

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.360
[Guest]: So it just puts you through the grinder in a way that Indian institutions don't do, right?

02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:36.020
[Guest]: And so you come out on the other side of the grinder in this process form, which is a disadvantage

02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:39.680
[Guest]: for those of us who did our PhD in India, because we were not put through that kind

02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:40.680
[Guest]: of a grinder.

02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:44.040
[Guest]: I got lucky because I had a fantastic advisor, and it was really nice.

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:51.080
[Guest]: And it's absolutely true that in India, not having a foreign degree is a big disadvantage,

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:53.280
[Guest]: you know, within your colleagues and just in the circuit.

02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:56.860
[Guest]: And even within the US, there are, you know, whether you're in the top 10 universities

02:42:56.860 --> 02:42:57.860
[Guest]: or not, etc.

02:42:57.860 --> 02:42:58.940
[Guest]: There are all of these issues.

02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:02.720
[Guest]: But certainly, if you've done your PhD from India versus somebody who's done it from the

02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:06.040
[Guest]: UK or the USA, there, you know, there is an issue.

02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:10.760
[Guest]: And at the time when I was a student at the Delhi School, you know, about eight to 10

02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.000
[Guest]: people out of hundred class of 150 used to get first divisions.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.080
[Guest]: So first division was the big thing, by the way, those days.

02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:21.060
[Guest]: And in my batch, it was eight, eight of us who got a first division and seven went abroad

02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:25.640
[Guest]: and I didn't go, you know, so that's how much of an outlier I was even then.

02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:30.640
[Guest]: And so it's a struggle and there are, it's hard, there are and I'm sure that others who

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.000
[Guest]: are in my situation also have faced them at different points, there are frustrations,

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.920
[Guest]: you get upset sometimes that, oh, you know, somebody just walks away with the limelight

02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:41.440
[Guest]: and all that, all that.

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.600
[Guest]: But again, you know, as you've discovered in your conversations with me, I'm a little

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:47.880
[Guest]: chilled out in these matters.

02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:51.960
[Guest]: So there can be a temporary irritation, but it passes very soon.

02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:57.840
[Guest]: But I have to mention that by the time I came to Ashoka, you know, it's been very different.

02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:04.800
[Guest]: Ashoka is really, is very respectful towards the body of work, you know, and I've received

02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:09.560
[Guest]: huge amounts of love and, you know, support within Ashoka, so from everyone.

02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:12.640
[Guest]: And so I feel really happy about that.

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:17.840
[Guest]: But it's not, there is a disadvantage and this thing of, you know, I will tell you what

02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:22.040
[Guest]: you're missing in two sentences or three sentences, this tendency is there.

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.400
[Guest]: This will, I don't think you can, you know, there is a, there are many hierarchies.

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:32.320
[Guest]: So within India, there are hierarchies of class and urban location and English education

02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:37.480
[Guest]: versus not caste, of course, you know, but then there are international hierarchies,

02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:38.480
[Guest]: right?

02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:43.680
[Guest]: Where race plays a factor, where academic location plays a factor, right?

02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:49.560
[Guest]: So obviously Harvard in the US will rank number one in any of this hierarchy and so on.

02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:51.280
[Guest]: So and things like that, right?

02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:56.200
[Guest]: So institutions have brand names and they really make a difference.

02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.240
[Guest]: So an affiliation with a very top branded university department will open doors in a

02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.000
[Guest]: way that a lower branded university department, it won't.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.800
[Guest]: So once you step outside India, you realize that there are these other hierarchies that

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:11.400
[Guest]: play it well.

02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:17.560
[Guest]: But that's life, you know, there's no point in lamenting them and just feeling, you know,

02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.480
[Guest]: say, oh, and there's also, I don't think these hierarchies should be used as an excuse to

02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:25.680
[Guest]: say, oh, the reason I'm really not publishing is because there are all these hierarchies

02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:26.680
[Guest]: and I can't work.

02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:30.960
[Guest]: No, sorry, there are hierarchies, that's the world, that's the real world, deal with it,

02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:31.960
[Guest]: you know.

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:34.320
[Guest]: So I will keep publishing, I will keep writing.

02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:37.440
[Guest]: If somebody else saying, oh, she didn't go abroad for a PhD, so I don't think her work

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:38.440
[Guest]: is good.

02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:39.440
[Guest]: That's fine.

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:40.440
[Guest]: They are entitled to their opinion.

02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:43.040
[Guest]: But I would say engage with my work, not where I got my degree from.

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:47.240
[Guest]: If there's anything wrong with my work, point that out, I'm happy to engage.

02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:53.680
[Guest]: But don't, you know, pedigree is, I mean, it's very funny, we lament about the caste

02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:56.280
[Guest]: system in India, but we are very pedigree conscious.

02:45:56.280 --> 02:46:07.480
[Guest]: So that's, you know, what data does it make, do the work, don't look at my CV and say,

02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:14.080
[Guest]: oh, she did her PhD from D school, oh, that's bad, you know, why?

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:19.200
[Guest]: So one has to, I mean, what I'll say to younger people is that if you are working in a good

02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:23.600
[Guest]: Indian institution, doing your PhD, you know, steel yourself against these tendencies because

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:25.280
[Guest]: they are there.

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:31.480
[Guest]: But discrimination is a fact of life, you know, sometimes we are on the side of, sometimes

02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:36.800
[Guest]: our social identities protect us from that discrimination, which is when we feel great.

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:41.000
[Guest]: But there are sometimes our social identities, in another context, we become the victims

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:42.200
[Guest]: of discrimination.

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:46.600
[Guest]: But then we have to figure out, you know, we can't make that as an excuse as academics

02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:50.840
[Guest]: to say, okay, I'm not going to publish anymore because somebody said that, oh, our Indian

02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:54.160
[Guest]: degrees are not good enough, no, why?

02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:57.880
[Guest]: That has never deterred me from doing what I think is right.

02:46:57.880 --> 02:46:59.920
[Guest]: And I don't think it should deter anyone else too.

02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the lessons I learned from poker was don't sweat what you can't control.

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:04.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:08.180
[Amit Varma]: You know, what you can't control is what you do, what you can't control is the process,

02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:11.600
[Amit Varma]: what you can't control is the attitude you bring to your work.

02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:13.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's what really matters.

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Don't sweat the rest of it.

02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:20.200
[Guest]: I mean, there have been many situations where, you know, for example, I've gone to an institution

02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.840
[Guest]: and asked for data and I've been told, no, you can't get this data.

02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:28.120
[Guest]: And the next thing I know is some researcher from X, Y, Z university with the right color

02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:29.840
[Guest]: of the skin has got that data.

02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:37.080
[Guest]: I said, what man, when I wrote you a proper letter, what happened, you know, you know,

02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:39.080
[Guest]: anger comes, it definitely comes.

02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:43.560
[Guest]: But then, you know, it's one of those things, I mean, life is unfair sometimes.

02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:44.560
[Guest]: So how do you deal with that?

02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:47.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, how do you deal with that unfairness?

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Talking about the unfairness of life, let's, you know, move to the subject of something

02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:55.280
[Amit Varma]: that you've studied deeply for decades, almost, I don't know if one could call it decades

02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:56.280
[Unknown]: in the plural.

02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:03.680
[Guest]: But yeah, I guess you started with caste in the late 90s, so decades here, 98, 98, decades.

02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:10.340
[Amit Varma]: So what were the big questions about caste that animated you when you started working

02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:11.340
[Amit Varma]: on it?

02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:13.480
[Amit Varma]: And you've already described your first paper and all that.

02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And how did those questions evolve and change?

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:24.920
[Guest]: So the only question that started this whole journey was, I mean, the question was phrased

02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:29.880
[Guest]: in the sense of have the gaps between Dalits and Apakas narrowed?

02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:33.740
[Guest]: Of course, the first paper was not about narrowing, because it was one point in time.

02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:37.640
[Guest]: But the question was, are they significant?

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.960
[Guest]: Are they across different indicators?

02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:43.480
[Guest]: And are they across states?

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:44.480
[Guest]: That was the first question.

02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:50.360
[Guest]: Basically, it was like taking stock of the material disparities between Apakas and Dalits.

02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:52.520
[Guest]: That was what the question was about.

02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:57.880
[Guest]: Because there's been a lot of sociological, ethnographic, village study kind of literature

02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:02.560
[Guest]: that talked about power that comes from being used as vote banks, you know, dominant caste

02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.520
[Guest]: that may not necessarily be the Apakas, you know, middle caste being dominant caste, you

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.560
[Guest]: know, some caste that got classified as OBCs.

02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.640
[Guest]: But even some Dalit caste, for example, could become dominant caste in their villages.

02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:17.080
[Guest]: And there's a lot of churning.

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:21.640
[Guest]: Then there was the 72nd and 73rd, 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment, where local

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:23.880
[Guest]: bodies were given, you know, reservation, etc.

02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:29.520
[Guest]: So all of that is sort of churning, there's been a churning and there is a rise in representation

02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:36.400
[Guest]: of Dalits at the local panchayat level, state election, reserve constituencies, chief ministers

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:39.840
[Guest]: of states or important ministers in different governments, etc.

02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:47.880
[Guest]: All of that might have led to, you know, sort of narrow gaps or insignificant gaps or that

02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.720
[Guest]: the persistent disparity may not be a picture of India at that time.

02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.520
[Guest]: And so what the first paper did was just said, no, it is, right?

02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:57.800
[Guest]: Now why is it?

02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:00.720
[Guest]: Why is it that despite all of these things, these things didn't change, etc.

02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:04.360
[Guest]: Then that started the journey, right?

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:08.440
[Guest]: And then I had to read about dominant caste, I had to read about, you know, what is OBC.

02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:13.120
[Guest]: So I remember a discussion with my father where I said, I don't understand the controversy

02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.360
[Guest]: about the OBC reservation.

02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.360
[Guest]: Why is it that some, you know, people object to some castes being included, but not to

02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:19.360
[Guest]: other castes?

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:20.360
[Guest]: What is this whole thing?

02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:24.480
[Guest]: So he patiently explained to me the difference between Varna and Jati, which I had read about,

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.560
[Guest]: but I had not internalized it.

02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:31.440
[Guest]: And I didn't understand the connection between that distinction and the OBC reservation controversy,

02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.160
[Guest]: which she then, you know, verbally explained to me, then he gave me references to read.

02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:40.400
[Guest]: And that sort of started the thing, and then with my co-author, Rajesh Ramachandran, who

02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:43.840
[Guest]: used to be my student in Delhi school, but kept in touch, and now we have many papers

02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:44.840
[Guest]: together.

02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:49.240
[Guest]: So we've developed this sort of agenda where we've looked at change over time, we've looked

02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:54.080
[Guest]: at early childhood, we've looked at education, we've looked at stunting, etc, etc.

02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:57.680
[Guest]: So you know, we just, we finish one paper and we start the next, you know.

02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:03.520
[Guest]: So now we have a result that talks about the effect of untouchability, which is illegal,

02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:08.080
[Guest]: but prevalent on early childhood outcomes for Dalit children.

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:14.360
[Guest]: And so it's like an onion that the more you peel, you know, you discover new things about

02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:15.360
[Guest]: the system.

02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:21.600
[Guest]: And with this early childhood and untouchability research, I have realized, I think, for the

02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:26.320
[Guest]: first time with clarity, why the gaps are persistent.

02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:31.040
[Guest]: Because if the disparity is starting at early childhood, then by the time these children

02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:35.080
[Guest]: become adults, you know, it's the same system that's getting perpetuated.

02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:40.880
[Guest]: So another argument made about the caste system is that it's a hangover of the past, or it

02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:42.240
[Guest]: is a rural phenomenon.

02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:43.240
[Guest]: In urban India, how do you know?

02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:45.600
[Guest]: Aapki caste, meri caste, kya pata kisi ko?

02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:47.920
[Guest]: So urban India mein caste disparity nahi hota.

02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:52.160
[Guest]: Yeh purane zamane mein discrimination hota tha, ussi ka hangover we are seeing today,

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.160
[Guest]: you know.

02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:57.040
[Guest]: So all of these questions you can actually examine empirically, and you realize that

02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:02.600
[Guest]: it's being perpetuated, the discrimination based upon caste identity is salient and discrimination

02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:06.200
[Guest]: based upon that continues today.

02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:11.720
[Amit Varma]: So take me through some of these questions, for example, the question of past discrimination

02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and versus present discrimination.

02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:15.240
[Amit Varma]: How do you disentangle that?

02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:19.240
[Amit Varma]: For example, an argument was made, which you've kind of busted through the various studies,

02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:23.120
[Amit Varma]: and we can go into the weeds of some of that, you know, arguments are sometimes made ki

02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:28.120
[Amit Varma]: hai, you know, labor market mein discrimination nahi hai, kyuki maybe there is discrimination

02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:32.600
[Amit Varma]: earlier, which happens because of, you know, people are born in poor families, or they

02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:35.280
[Amit Varma]: don't get the same kind of education and all that.

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:39.080
[Amit Varma]: So they are distinctly unequal by the time they reach the labor market.

02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:40.520
[Amit Varma]: But labor markets are different.

02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And your study showed that no, that is really not the case at all.

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Labor markets also discriminate.

02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.080
[Amit Varma]: For example, I'm just taking like one of the big questions that you've asked.

02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:56.200
[Amit Varma]: So take me through, you know, how you then start disentangling all the other possible

02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:01.400
[Amit Varma]: causes for you know, all the other possible explanations for income disparities at the

02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:02.400
[Amit Varma]: labor market.

02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:05.960
[Amit Varma]: And how do you then arrive at the fact that yes, discrimination has taken place does take

02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:06.960
[Amit Varma]: place.

02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:08.680
[Amit Varma]: And these are the kind of mechanics of it.

02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:12.780
[Amit Varma]: So take me through some of these studies, because I found it really fascinating.

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:18.160
[Guest]: So there is absolutely no doubt that in if you look at the early childhood and pre labor

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:22.600
[Guest]: market conditions between upper caste and Dalits on average, there are huge gaps.

02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:28.320
[Guest]: So by the time individuals enter the labor market, they are already very different in

02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:30.400
[Guest]: terms of the skill set in terms of abilities.

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:35.960
[Guest]: And all that has got to do with social capital, with the background, networks, etc, etc, right?

02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:39.520
[Guest]: Now, the question is, does the labor market perpetuate that discrimination or not?

02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:43.640
[Guest]: So a very simple study, which is not authored by me, but it was a part of the project that

02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:46.360
[Guest]: I was a part of, I did a college to work study.

02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:51.840
[Guest]: And this particular study, it's a very famous paper in the AER done for the US by Marianne

02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:56.880
[Guest]: Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, which the title of that paper is called are Emily and

02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:03.040
[Guest]: Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal, Lakisha and Jamal, all right.

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:08.600
[Guest]: What they do is they send resumes to employers, these are called correspondence studies.

02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:15.120
[Guest]: And that those resumes control for everything, not just academics course, but extracurriculars

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:16.120
[Guest]: as well.

02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:20.880
[Guest]: All the, you know, debating, confidence, kind of all the signals that employers look for.

02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:21.880
[Guest]: The only difference.

02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:23.640
[Guest]: So these are matched resumes.

02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:25.560
[Guest]: The only difference is the names are different.

02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:30.120
[Guest]: So black sounding names and white sounding names, and the callback that white sounding

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:35.520
[Guest]: names get are far higher than the callbacks than black sounding names get.

02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:36.520
[Guest]: Okay.

02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:41.760
[Guest]: Diva Pager, a sociologist in the US who died tragically young, she did an even more remarkable

02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:46.920
[Guest]: study where she said, okay, the reason that blacks might be getting lower callbacks is

02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:50.720
[Guest]: because there's a stigma of criminality, you know, because incarceration rates for African

02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:53.720
[Guest]: Americans are far higher than those for whites.

02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:58.120
[Guest]: So employers might be reluctant to hire blacks because it's, it's a thing in their mind that,

02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:01.240
[Guest]: you know, we don't want anybody with a criminal background, etc.

02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:06.080
[Guest]: So in her study, she gave the, these are all experimental subjects.

02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:13.040
[Guest]: So she gave the white person a criminal record, that white job applicant has actually served

02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:19.760
[Guest]: time in jail, a convicted felon, and the black applicant is not a convicted felon.

02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:25.040
[Guest]: So she attached the, because these are fake resumes, so she attached the stigma of criminality

02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:27.080
[Guest]: to whites.

02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:31.880
[Guest]: And her experiment shows that attaching the stigma of criminality to whites lowers the

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:37.600
[Guest]: callback for whites compared to when they were not shown as being felons.

02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:42.800
[Guest]: But a white with a criminal record is still likely to get higher callbacks compared to

02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.760
[Guest]: black with no criminal record.

02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:49.960
[Guest]: If this doesn't show discrimination, because this controls for everything, this controls

02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:51.120
[Amit Varma]: for everything, right.

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.440
[Guest]: And there are studies that have been done of this kind for India as well.

02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:59.280
[Guest]: And we did a project for paper, Delhi and Chennai, yeah, and you see the same thing.

02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:04.560
[Guest]: So you can say, and this is before the interview, so you're not even judging based upon looking

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:07.200
[Guest]: at the person and forming some impressions, right.

02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:14.440
[Guest]: So stereotypes and the association of, you know, the negative stereotypes about Dalits,

02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:18.480
[Guest]: the stigma of incompetence, that does play a role, right.

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:20.600
[Guest]: And so how do you disentangle?

02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:23.280
[Guest]: So one state way to do is to correspond in studies.

02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:26.160
[Guest]: The other when you're looking at data, you of course, you control for all the ability

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:30.960
[Guest]: related indicators, and then you see whether there's an extra wage penalty.

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:31.960
[Guest]: What you call decomposition.

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:32.960
[Guest]: Decomposition.

02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:38.200
[Guest]: So you can, there's a method where you can add in all the variables that will explain

02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:42.740
[Guest]: the wage gap and see whether the wage gap gets artificially eliminated.

02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:47.000
[Guest]: And if it doesn't, then that is due, that's an unexplained part of the wage gap.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:52.000
[Guest]: Now, you can argue whether it's all discrimination or not, and the jury is open on that one.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.080
[Guest]: But certainly a part of it is discriminatory.

02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:56.960
[Guest]: And that's the point where I'm saying is look elsewhere.

02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.360
[Guest]: So you have an unobserved wage gap, which is your data is showing you.

02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:01.360
[Guest]: Now read accounts.

02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:06.720
[Guest]: You know, so a question that I often get asked in interviews is, how long are we going to

02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:07.840
[Guest]: have this reservation system?

02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:08.840
[Guest]: It's time to end it.

02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:16.280
[Guest]: You know, and my answer is, let's go for one month where there is no story of caste atrocities

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:18.920
[Guest]: reported from anywhere in the country.

02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:24.440
[Guest]: The day we have one month free of caste atrocities, let's end reservation then.

02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:30.520
[Amit Varma]: So I found these studies interesting because the Delhi study, for example, sent fake resumes,

02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:31.520
[Amit Varma]: looked at English newspapers.

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:35.960
[Amit Varma]: So you're already controlling for English and you send fake resumes with stereotypical

02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:38.680
[Amit Varma]: last names to a whole bunch of employers.

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:42.440
[Amit Varma]: And the conclusion was that Dalits are two third less likely as upper class people to

02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:43.440
[Amit Varma]: get a call back.

02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everybody would assume that they were less likely, but two thirds less likely is

02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:49.880
[Amit Varma]: a good way to kind of quantify it and understand the problem.

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.560
[Amit Varma]: And the Chennai study was fascinating because it also looked at gender and it found that

02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:00.280
[Amit Varma]: low caste females were the least likely of all to get a call back, which is, of course,

02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:02.120
[Amit Varma]: not surprising either.

02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:06.880
[Amit Varma]: What I found also interesting was that when you, you know, use the decomposition techniques,

02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:09.760
[Amit Varma]: you're also thinking of endowment differences.

02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:14.840
[Amit Varma]: Now endowment differences, of course, is that because of discrimination of the past or because

02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.320
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, what their backgrounds might have been, Dalits are more likely to be poor,

02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:24.520
[Amit Varma]: more likely to have a worse education and so on and so forth, they end up in the job

02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:29.640
[Amit Varma]: market with, you know, that disadvantage built in and that's the endowment difference.

02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:34.120
[Amit Varma]: And you point out that that's actually narrowing in urban populations.

02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:38.180
[Amit Varma]: And you're honest enough to say that it may be affirmative action, which is responsible,

02:58:38.180 --> 02:58:42.920
[Amit Varma]: but it may not be because it's again, the swimming pool thing, we can't really tell.

02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Has it been your experience that, like, here's the thing, as far as the rural-urban divide

02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:53.720
[Amit Varma]: is concerned, Ambedkar, of course, famously said, what is a village but a sink of localism,

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:57.280
[Amit Varma]: a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism, stop quote.

02:58:57.280 --> 02:59:02.840
[Amit Varma]: And one would assume from various different directions, that caste would be a far bigger

02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:05.320
[Amit Varma]: problem in rural areas and in urban areas.

02:59:05.320 --> 02:59:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And one reason for that would just be that the incentives are different in urban areas.

02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:13.680
[Amit Varma]: You want to be part of wider economic networks, there is more competition.

02:59:13.680 --> 02:59:18.480
[Amit Varma]: So perhaps you can't, you know, the cost of discrimination goes up, and so on and so forth.

02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:22.840
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, if affirmative action was working, you'd expect to see a result of that

02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:26.440
[Amit Varma]: in, you know, in being less of a factor in urban areas as well.

02:59:26.440 --> 02:59:33.320
[Amit Varma]: So is it generally true that whatever the causes might be, that in general, urban areas

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:36.960
[Amit Varma]: are slightly better or, you know, what's the scene there?

02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:38.160
[Guest]: It's hard to say.

02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:44.520
[Guest]: So one is, you know, one difference between rural and urban is that it's harder to identify

02:59:44.520 --> 02:59:50.200
[Guest]: caste on casual interaction in urban compared to rural because not all last names are caste

02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:51.200
[Guest]: indicative.

02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:55.600
[Guest]: Also, you take the bit metros, you know, people are coming from different parts of the country

02:59:55.600 --> 03:00:01.720
[Guest]: and people don't easily recognize the caste names, even if they were indicative of caste.

03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:05.840
[Guest]: But my paper with Catherine Newman, where we do this college to work tracking study,

03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:10.200
[Guest]: we track students for two years, every six months, we were interviewing them.

03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:16.640
[Guest]: And we asked them what, how their job interviews went, particularly in the private sector where

03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:17.960
[Guest]: there's no reservation.

03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:22.760
[Guest]: So there's no place on the form or anything that you are required to declare your caste.

03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:27.600
[Guest]: And almost every student that we talked to said that the one of the first questions,

03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:32.980
[Guest]: if not the first question that they were asked was, what is your family background?

03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:38.480
[Guest]: When I first started transcribing interviews and sending them to Catherine for reading,

03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:40.920
[Guest]: she called me from the US and said, there must be a mistake.

03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:41.920
[Guest]: So I said, no, why?

03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.240
[Guest]: She said, listen to it again.

03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:44.240
[Guest]: So I said, I was there.

03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:45.560
[Guest]: What do you mean, listen to it again?

03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:46.560
[Guest]: But I will.

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:47.560
[Guest]: And so I listened to it again.

03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:50.320
[Guest]: And there was no mistake because I was, you know, there in the interview.

03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:54.640
[Guest]: So she said that in the United States, this question could never be asked because it is

03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:57.040
[Guest]: about individual merit and ability.

03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:00.280
[Guest]: The family background is irrelevant, right?

03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:04.560
[Guest]: But in India, it is a very common assumption to think that the family is a crucible of

03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:07.000
[Guest]: merit, of individual merit.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:12.480
[Guest]: So you immediately conflate family circumstances with the individual's merit.

03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:14.080
[Guest]: That is not only caste.

03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:19.000
[Guest]: We are not saying that in the paper, but caste plays a very big role in it, right?

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:24.280
[Guest]: And so in an urban setting where you think caste might not matter, first, this is one

03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:29.680
[Guest]: mechanism through which employers try to gauge where you're situated.

03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:35.360
[Guest]: The second thing is when they see some obvious class markers, which they believe, we don't

03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:36.360
[Guest]: know where this person is.

03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:39.320
[Guest]: So they'll say, what is your view about the reservation policy?

03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:41.720
[Guest]: Now this policy doesn't apply to the private sector.

03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:45.860
[Guest]: They have no business asking this question because there could be my views about anything.

03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:48.920
[Guest]: What do I feel about Shah Rukh Khan or, you know, Hrithik Roshan for that matter?

03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:50.400
[Amit Varma]: That's irrelevant to the job interview.

03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Which would be a good question.

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.560
[Guest]: Ask someone what do you feel about Shah Rukh Khan?

03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:56.960
[Guest]: If they say they like Shah Rukh Khan, okay, reject.

03:01:56.960 --> 03:01:59.000
[Guest]: Accepted in my book.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.080
[Guest]: But and the minute they found somebody defending the reservation policy, they took that as

03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.280
[Guest]: a confirmation of their suspicion that this person was Dalit.

03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:10.960
[Guest]: And sometimes they just asked openly, what is your caste?

03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.380
[Guest]: Now we asked our respondents, how did you react to this question when you were asked

03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:16.720
[Guest]: about the family background?

03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:18.840
[Guest]: What do you think they were trying to get at?

03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:23.960
[Guest]: And the amazing thing is that our upper caste respondents and our Dalit respondents responded

03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:25.960
[Guest]: in completely opposite ways.

03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:30.640
[Guest]: Upper caste respondents said it was just a breaking the ice kind of a question.

03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:31.640
[Guest]: What's there?

03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:32.640
[Guest]: I mean, it's fine.

03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:33.640
[Guest]: It's just like you, how you start.

03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:36.200
[Guest]: You talk about the weather or something like that.

03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:39.920
[Guest]: Because they had family backgrounds that they were proud of.

03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:45.100
[Guest]: Whereas every Dalit respondent in our study said, no, this was a trick question.

03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:49.000
[Guest]: It was a question that they were using to catch us.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.200
[Guest]: This is about the people who went to job interviews.

03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:55.320
[Guest]: Now a lot of private sector jobs in India are not advertised.

03:02:55.320 --> 03:02:57.080
[Guest]: They are through networks.

03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:00.920
[Guest]: And I have another study for Delhi, which a paper, it's not published yet, but I did

03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:02.840
[Guest]: some fieldwork in Delhi.

03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.760
[Guest]: And there we found that, I mean, we mapped, you know, who do you get the job information

03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:08.760
[Guest]: from, et cetera, et cetera.

03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:14.280
[Guest]: And you find that Dalit students have very smaller and poorer quality networks in terms

03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:16.080
[Guest]: of who they're likely to know.

03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:17.080
[Guest]: Right.

03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:22.800
[Guest]: So even if you have the same education, even if you're equally bright, your ability to

03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:28.600
[Guest]: even find out about positions in the private sector are heavily circumscribed by your caste

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:29.840
[Guest]: background.

03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:32.800
[Guest]: So in urban India, it plays out differently, but it does play out.

03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:36.840
[Guest]: And shadi and all, toh toh open hai, toh puchenge puchenge.

03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:40.640
[Guest]: Even my students, when they say, oh, caste is ended, there's no caste, et cetera, I say,

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:41.640
[Guest]: how are you going to get married?

03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:43.400
[Guest]: Wo toh caste pe hoga.

03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:47.400
[Guest]: You know, so they don't see any contradiction in that, in that, in those two statements.

03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:54.400
[Guest]: But my point is that in rural India, it gets replicated in a particular way through knowledge,

03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:56.400
[Guest]: through caste-based occupations.

03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:00.280
[Guest]: Urban India, proportion of caste-based occupations is low, non-caste-based is higher.

03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:03.240
[Guest]: And in principle, every occupation is open to everybody.

03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:08.640
[Guest]: But there is a very strong overlap of status and caste, not caste-based occupation.

03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:12.720
[Guest]: Because how many Brahmins are you going to find in Delhi who are priests in temples?

03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:13.720
[Guest]: Right.

03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:16.160
[Guest]: So obviously they're not doing their caste-based occupation.

03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:22.280
[Guest]: But if you see very privileged occupations, which caste groups are occupying those?

03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:24.120
[Guest]: How much has been the churning?

03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:26.720
[Guest]: How much has the deck reshuffled?

03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:30.440
[Guest]: That's the question we should ask about cities.

03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:34.400
[Guest]: Because sociologists, what they do is they say, oh, you know, the link between caste-based

03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:37.640
[Guest]: occupations and birth is broken in urban India.

03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:42.240
[Guest]: Yes, of course, because caste-based occupations, think about the occupations that are listed

03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:43.520
[Guest]: in the caste system.

03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:46.320
[Guest]: Think about a modern economy.

03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:52.440
[Guest]: You are trying to superimpose a modern occupational structure on the caste-based, the birth-based

03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:56.600
[Guest]: occupations that were determined thousands of years ago.

03:04:56.600 --> 03:04:58.420
[Guest]: There is bound to be a break, right?

03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:00.000
[Guest]: But we have to reframe the question.

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:06.040
[Guest]: We have to talk about now status, privilege and caste rather than caste-based occupation

03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:07.040
[Guest]: and caste.

03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:09.400
[Guest]: That's not the right question to ask anymore, I don't think.

03:05:09.400 --> 03:05:13.880
[Amit Varma]: And also, even on the sort of priests in temples questions, I mean, you are right that there

03:05:13.880 --> 03:05:18.280
[Amit Varma]: are not many Brahmins in Delhi who are priests in temples, but I think all the priests in

03:05:18.280 --> 03:05:19.280
[Guest]: Delhi are surely Brahmins.

03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:20.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

03:05:20.280 --> 03:05:21.280
[Guest]: So that also...

03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:24.800
[Guest]: In the grammar of caste, I exactly say that, which is, ask it the other way around.

03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:27.640
[Amit Varma]: How many non-Brahmins are priests in temples?

03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:05:28.640 --> 03:05:31.640
[Amit Varma]: So, the bit about family networks is true.

03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:36.040
[Amit Varma]: It's so unseen that people are getting jobs through different networks and those networks

03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:40.400
[Amit Varma]: will often be based around whatever community you're born into and so on and so forth.

03:05:40.400 --> 03:05:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And that added layer is important.

03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:46.680
[Amit Varma]: What you just pointed out about how upper caste people in interviews, they won't even

03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:50.800
[Amit Varma]: think askance if somebody asks them, what's your caste, or even what's your last name?

03:05:50.800 --> 03:05:55.000
[Amit Varma]: A question like, what's your last name means absolutely nothing to me.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:56.560
[Amit Varma]: I will just say my last name.

03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:05:57.560 --> 03:06:01.840
[Amit Varma]: But if you are Dalit, it means a world because there is that added layer, which is unseen

03:06:01.840 --> 03:06:04.360
[Amit Varma]: for most other people.

03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:09.200
[Amit Varma]: So here's, you know, like one of the really influential early books in the economics of

03:06:09.200 --> 03:06:13.000
[Amit Varma]: discrimination was, of course, a book, The Economics of Description by Gary Becker in

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.000
[Amit Varma]: 1957.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:18.360
[Amit Varma]: I'll briefly summarize for the listeners the point that he makes, which is an influential

03:06:18.360 --> 03:06:21.200
[Amit Varma]: point and one that makes a lot of sense.

03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:26.760
[Amit Varma]: It is that the cost of discrimination is not just borne by the person discriminated against,

03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:28.840
[Amit Varma]: but also by the discriminator.

03:06:28.840 --> 03:06:36.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, let us say that you are a company which pays Brahmins 10 rupees and Dalits 8 rupees

03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:37.280
[Amit Varma]: to hire them.

03:06:37.280 --> 03:06:42.240
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you discriminate, somebody who doesn't discriminate, because of the market

03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:45.680
[Amit Varma]: value of labor is actually getting cheaper labor.

03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:49.760
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, is I would argue even getting a better workforce because today we know there

03:06:49.760 --> 03:06:54.360
[Amit Varma]: are studies which showed that the best indicator of good decision making is neither intelligence

03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:56.760
[Amit Varma]: nor education, but diversity in the room.

03:06:56.760 --> 03:07:01.320
[Amit Varma]: So diversity is a quality to aspire for, for its own sake, which is not something which

03:07:01.320 --> 03:07:03.680
[Amit Varma]: there would have been studies in 1957 on.

03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:09.700
[Amit Varma]: So whoever is discriminating is therefore also suffering the cost of that.

03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:15.160
[Amit Varma]: So if, and this is a big if, if you have a competitive marketplace where there is competition,

03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:19.600
[Amit Varma]: then anyone who discriminates automatically is at a disadvantage.

03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:21.900
[Amit Varma]: Now this doesn't mean that nobody will discriminate.

03:07:21.900 --> 03:07:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Some people might want to do what I think in the literature is called taste based discrimination,

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:30.340
[Amit Varma]: where they decide that they want to discriminate anyway, because their personal values are

03:07:30.340 --> 03:07:35.680
[Amit Varma]: like that or whatever, but they bear a cost for it, which is very much as it should be.

03:07:35.680 --> 03:07:41.240
[Amit Varma]: But the theory there would be that as you have a more flourishing economy, larger economic

03:07:41.240 --> 03:07:46.880
[Amit Varma]: networks, as you would in cities, for example, and more competition, then you would have

03:07:46.880 --> 03:07:53.120
[Amit Varma]: caste based discrimination or indeed discrimination of any kind go down, because that discrimination

03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:55.400
[Amit Varma]: is sort of expensive.

03:07:55.400 --> 03:08:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, obviously, in India, this hasn't played out fully yet, because our markets are still

03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:04.040
[Amit Varma]: not as open as should be, you don't have those levels of competition.

03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:09.000
[Amit Varma]: We do have, you know, caste based discrimination, I would argue would be less in the cities

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:13.880
[Amit Varma]: and in villages, but we haven't solved come anywhere close to solving the problem.

03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:17.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a muddy swimming pool, for example.

03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:24.720
[Amit Varma]: So how does one sort of what was your engagement, for example, with Becker's work?

03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And did you feel that in a sense, it's really because you can't disentangle all the different

03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:31.560
[Amit Varma]: things that are happening?

03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:37.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, how useful was it to use, you know, as a frame or as one possible frame in terms

03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:40.520
[Amit Varma]: of looking at what is happening in our cities?

03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:46.100
[Guest]: So Becker talks about discrimination that exists in the marketplace, which is different

03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:48.200
[Guest]: from a like or a dislike.

03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:52.320
[Guest]: So his point is that when does a dislike become discrimination, which is when you're willing

03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:54.120
[Guest]: to pay a price for it.

03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:59.600
[Guest]: So you're willing to take a cut in your income to have the ability to discriminate.

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:03.240
[Guest]: So that's the point that you were making, which is discriminating is discrimination

03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:06.160
[Guest]: is costly to the discriminator as well.

03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:10.280
[Guest]: And I find that element of Becker's theory very powerful.

03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:15.120
[Guest]: And you know, the other theory I teach is by Kenneth Arrow, which is statistical discrimination

03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:19.600
[Guest]: and both Arrow and Becker, you know, of the economists of that time with very few two

03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:24.840
[Guest]: three equations, they beautifully summarize, which today's authors might take, you know,

03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:27.360
[Guest]: very fancy looking many, many equations, etc.

03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:31.960
[Guest]: So I find both the theories very illuminating and insightful.

03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:37.840
[Guest]: However, I don't think anywhere in the world, with the increase in the spread of markets

03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:39.320
[Guest]: has discrimination come down.

03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:44.400
[Guest]: So I think it's, it boils down to the question of how do we make sure that discrimination

03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:45.400
[Guest]: is really costly?

03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:53.040
[Guest]: I mean, it must make a real, we have to have incentives such that it should be very difficult

03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.040
[Guest]: or it should be very costly for a person to exercise discrimination in the marketplace.

03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:02.360
[Guest]: Likes and dislikes, you cannot control, people will always have them, right?

03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:08.280
[Guest]: But in certain settings, discrimination is more costly than in other settings, right?

03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:13.400
[Guest]: So, for example, one of the things in India is that we don't have a broad based anti-discrimination

03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:14.400
[Guest]: law.

03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:20.040
[Guest]: We have the Prevention of Atrocities Act against SCSD that addresses an important part of the

03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:26.960
[Guest]: problem, which is hate crimes, which are targeted against certain communities for who they are.

03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:31.880
[Guest]: But the burden of proof is very high under that act.

03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:36.880
[Guest]: And also the whole system needs to be, sort of militates against a conviction because

03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:41.240
[Guest]: the police will not register a report, etc, etc, the whole thing.

03:10:41.240 --> 03:10:45.880
[Guest]: So while it's an important act, it doesn't cover microaggressions, it doesn't cover daily

03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:50.560
[Guest]: acts of discrimination, it doesn't, it's not a broad based anti-discriminatory law.

03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:53.760
[Guest]: And so there is, I mean, our legal system, that's another problem.

03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:57.680
[Guest]: But my point is that even as, just even in principle, there is no anti-discrimination

03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:03.760
[Guest]: law, whether it's about caste or gender or disability or anything else for that matter.

03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:08.480
[Guest]: So there is no legal framework that makes discrimination costly, right?

03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:13.120
[Guest]: Even in the United States, the person that I mentioned earlier, Sandy Darity, William

03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:18.840
[Guest]: Darity Jr., who's a Duke, he has been campaigning in the US along with others.

03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:25.600
[Guest]: Look at what he calls ADOS, American Descendants of Slavery, not of slaves, not that individuals

03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:31.960
[Guest]: have to be descendants of slaves, but African Americans today are descendants of the system

03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:32.960
[Guest]: of slavery.

03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:33.960
[Guest]: That's his point.

03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:38.480
[Guest]: And he has, you know, he has a lot of statistics about how, you know, whether you take the

03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:40.840
[Guest]: median wealth gap, education, et cetera, et cetera.

03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:45.400
[Guest]: And it's not about education, as many economists argue in the US context, which is that Blacks

03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:47.920
[Guest]: are less educated, that explains everything, no.

03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:52.400
[Guest]: So even Whites with no college education earn more than Blacks with college education, for

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:54.040
[Guest]: example, et cetera, et cetera.

03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:55.260
[Guest]: So he has a whole bunch of things.

03:11:55.260 --> 03:12:03.720
[Guest]: So his point is that what can be done in the US to address the wealth gap between Whites

03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:10.360
[Guest]: and American Descendants of Slavery, ADOS community.

03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:14.600
[Guest]: And so, you know, my point is that maybe the market won't fix this problem in itself, you

03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:15.600
[Guest]: know.

03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:19.340
[Guest]: And what the best interventions are, you know, that question is open, we can all discuss

03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:20.340
[Guest]: and debate it.

03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:24.840
[Guest]: Reservations is a very tiny, tiny, tiny little tool which is chipping away at one tiny part

03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:25.960
[Guest]: of the problem.

03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:29.080
[Guest]: But given in the absence of anything else, I think it should stay.

03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:34.320
[Guest]: But I think we should continue to debate about what is it that's going to make a dent.

03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:38.720
[Guest]: But prior to that comes the recognition.

03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:44.640
[Guest]: As long as we deny that the problem is big, we are never going to get at the solutions.

03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:49.960
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of points to what you said, as far as the question of market solving discrimination

03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:56.120
[Amit Varma]: in the way that Becker suggested would happen, I would say that, you know, nothing is a panacea,

03:12:56.120 --> 03:12:57.120
[Amit Varma]: right?

03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:00.400
[Amit Varma]: You can have discrimination, and it's the same swimming pool problem that in places

03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:05.240
[Amit Varma]: where you have flourishing competitive marketplaces, but discrimination still exists.

03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:08.560
[Amit Varma]: You don't know the counterfactual, what if the markets were less free?

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:11.160
[Amit Varma]: Would there have been, you know, more or less discrimination?

03:13:11.160 --> 03:13:12.160
[Amit Varma]: We don't know that.

03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.440
[Amit Varma]: So it just becomes a question of what, you know, what prism you're going with when you

03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:17.380
[Amit Varma]: address a subject like that.

03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:23.680
[Amit Varma]: And the other sort of position I have a bias, I have a preference that I have is just of

03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:30.280
[Amit Varma]: being extremely wary of coercive state solutions for I just think that an anti discrimination

03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:35.520
[Amit Varma]: law would just be, you know, would just be posturing, it would, you know, the intention

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:40.040
[Amit Varma]: would be great, the outcome would be absolutely nothing, wherever, you know, the state has

03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:44.440
[Amit Varma]: tried to, like, I think a lot of social problems need to be solved by society.

03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:48.720
[Amit Varma]: And the state should, of course, step in when the rights of people are being infringed.

03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:53.480
[Amit Varma]: But when you try to do social engineering through state coercion, I'm not sure it works.

03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:58.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, we had a, you know, everybody agrees that there should be maternity leave.

03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:01.520
[Amit Varma]: But when you had that recent maternity leave act, it hurt women more than it helped them

03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:06.040
[Amit Varma]: because employment went down, and are linked to pieces that kind of showed at which I had

03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:09.520
[Amit Varma]: commissioned for Pragati by Devika Kher and Suman Joshi.

03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:16.360
[Amit Varma]: And the so I'm sort of wary of coercive approaches kind of by the state, I think these are deep,

03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:21.560
[Amit Varma]: deep social problems, which at some point, you know, and like you said, it's muddy, we

03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:23.680
[Amit Varma]: don't know what the solutions are.

03:14:23.680 --> 03:14:29.560
[Amit Varma]: But just to sort of underscore, like I found what you've written about arrow and arrows

03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:34.840
[Amit Varma]: work on statistical discrimination, also to be illuminative of the way social pressures

03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:37.860
[Amit Varma]: work out to make a situation worse.

03:14:37.860 --> 03:14:39.720
[Amit Varma]: So I'll quickly sum that up for my listeners.

03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:43.600
[Amit Varma]: And you can tell me if I've missed a nuance or made a mistake.

03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:48.640
[Amit Varma]: And he basically talks about how, you know, there can be these self fulfilling prophecies

03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:53.800
[Amit Varma]: in play, where if you're a Dalit, or a woman, you just assume that certain professions are

03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:55.640
[Amit Varma]: close to you, right?

03:14:55.640 --> 03:14:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And because you assume that they are close to you, because of social prejudices, which

03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:05.160
[Amit Varma]: are obviously there, you don't pursue those fields, and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:06.160
[Amit Varma]: and a vicious circle.

03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:10.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, in the case of gender, you could say that women are socialized to believe key

03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:13.440
[Amit Varma]: up humanities, parole languages, parole stem matkaro.

03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you have less women going in for that, though, increasingly, thankfully,

03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:21.000
[Amit Varma]: in recent times, more and more, but otherwise, you have less women going in for that.

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.800
[Amit Varma]: So which is it becomes an example of self fulfilling prophecy and the kind of statistical

03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:28.000
[Amit Varma]: discrimination which arrow talks about.

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And this can also result in disparities in the labor market, which are not happening

03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:36.560
[Amit Varma]: directly because of discrimination at the time.

03:15:36.560 --> 03:15:40.280
[Amit Varma]: But it's just a way that whole game is played out.

03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:48.120
[Guest]: So first I'll push back, I completely agree on the state not being, should not be able

03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:51.880
[Guest]: to exercise coercive power, absolutely, no doubt about that.

03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:57.360
[Guest]: But I'll push back a little bit about the role of legislation that's coming from the

03:15:57.360 --> 03:15:58.360
[Guest]: top.

03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:03.280
[Guest]: So for example, in the constituent assembly debates, Ambedkar was of the view that the

03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:08.340
[Guest]: approach suggested by Gandhi, which is a change of heart, be, you know, abolish untouchability

03:16:08.340 --> 03:16:13.400
[Guest]: by doing the work that so clean your own toilets, intermarry, etc.

03:16:13.400 --> 03:16:17.040
[Guest]: That relies too much on the individual initiative.

03:16:17.040 --> 03:16:20.340
[Guest]: And that's never going to happen, because he felt that untouchability was an integral

03:16:20.340 --> 03:16:24.680
[Guest]: part of the caste system, whereas Gandhi thought that untouchability is a part of the caste

03:16:24.680 --> 03:16:27.840
[Guest]: system, that's not good, but the rest of the caste system is fine.

03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:32.040
[Guest]: And Ambedkar questioned that and his point is that unless you make it mandatory, it's

03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:34.000
[Guest]: not going to happen.

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:39.040
[Guest]: And today, the reason that India has a Dalit, whatever the magnitude of that, and obviously

03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:42.960
[Guest]: not enough, but today, the reason that India has a Dalit middle class that's vocal, that's

03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:48.600
[Guest]: active, we see all these autobiographies coming out, we, you know, it's not by no means enough.

03:16:48.600 --> 03:16:51.320
[Guest]: And the problem is much larger than that.

03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:56.000
[Guest]: But this has happened because of the compulsory affirmative action.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:01.880
[Guest]: In Scandinavia, the fact that you now see women in government and in corporate boardrooms,

03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:07.400
[Guest]: it's completely normal to see women now, as ministers, as important spokesperson, it has

03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:09.760
[Guest]: come because of a gender quota.

03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:13.440
[Guest]: So my point is that I'm not saying that the state has to step in and solve every problem

03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:14.640
[Guest]: because it can't.

03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:19.520
[Guest]: And also there's a problem of endogeneity, the state machinery that is supposed to implement

03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:24.840
[Guest]: reservations, for example, is itself very, the personnel are themselves very, very caste

03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:25.920
[Guest]: conscious.

03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:31.920
[Guest]: So they find all ways of scuttling that program and, you know, jeopardizing the, and so that's

03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:32.920
[Guest]: always an issue.

03:17:32.920 --> 03:17:35.600
[Guest]: So what do you do when the problem is endogenous to the state, right?

03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:37.720
[Guest]: So that's always an issue.

03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:44.760
[Guest]: But sometimes when the problem is very deep rooted and unlikely to be solved by individual

03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:52.080
[Guest]: change of heart, I feel there's a case to be made for a top down legislative kind of

03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:58.200
[Guest]: a measure with the full checks and balances put in about coercion not being used, etc.

03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:03.520
[Guest]: The main problem is that this endogeneity of the state shows up here is that reservation

03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:08.800
[Guest]: is there, you have to do it constitution, nobody checks, people couldn't be bothered

03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:12.320
[Guest]: about whether it's working, whether there's, you know, I've tried to collect data on this

03:18:12.320 --> 03:18:16.960
[Guest]: question, you will not believe that there's no website anywhere in the government, all

03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:21.640
[Guest]: the websites that just tells you the progress of SCST seats reserved through different ministries,

03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:23.600
[Guest]: through different bodies, over time.

03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:28.040
[Guest]: I've tried to collect data from here, there, everywhere, so I have an incomplete database.

03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:31.680
[Guest]: But if it's such an important policy, why isn't there data on this?

03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:36.880
[Guest]: Do we know whether there's 22.5% reservation at the national level?

03:18:36.880 --> 03:18:41.640
[Guest]: And I did this paper on Indian railways, where we collected data from the railways, there

03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:48.160
[Guest]: we discovered that if you look at over time and across zones, we don't have 22.5% reservation

03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:52.600
[Guest]: in all the four levels of Indian railway services.

03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:56.680
[Guest]: But is there is that an issue is, you know, are we solving that problem anywhere?

03:18:56.680 --> 03:18:58.840
[Guest]: I don't think I don't hear any discussion about it.

03:18:58.840 --> 03:19:02.840
[Guest]: Whereas if you go to the Safai Karmacharis and the lowest level, it's much higher than

03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:03.840
[Guest]: 22.5%.

03:19:03.840 --> 03:19:08.520
[Guest]: So if you look at only Safai Karmacharis, which is a separate category of workers, it's

03:19:08.520 --> 03:19:11.240
[Guest]: about 90% is SC.

03:19:11.240 --> 03:19:16.040
[Guest]: I don't see any march on the street today to say abolish inequality in jobs for Safai

03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:17.360
[Guest]: Karmacharis.

03:19:17.360 --> 03:19:18.840
[Guest]: All castes must be equally represented.

03:19:18.840 --> 03:19:19.840
[Guest]: Why not?

03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:24.480
[Guest]: You know, so, I mean, we have to think of how deep rooted and structural these problems

03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:25.760
[Guest]: are.

03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:34.120
[Guest]: And then think about whether individual initiative will change this or even if you talk the language

03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:37.120
[Guest]: of incentives, what is it that will shift incentives?

03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:38.560
[Guest]: That's the question that I'm asking.

03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:42.080
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not a legal expert, so I don't know how the what the contours of the anti

03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:44.200
[Guest]: discriminatory law are going to be.

03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:48.320
[Guest]: And maybe that's that I think it's needed anyway, regardless of anything else, whether

03:19:48.320 --> 03:19:50.080
[Guest]: that will solve the problem or not.

03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:51.520
[Guest]: Okay, maybe not.

03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:57.720
[Guest]: But how would you change the incentives such that people find it costly to discriminate

03:19:57.720 --> 03:19:58.960
[Guest]: along these?

03:19:58.960 --> 03:20:00.840
[Guest]: It's an open question.

03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:03.240
[Guest]: And I, you know, I would encourage everybody to think about it.

03:20:03.240 --> 03:20:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:20:04.240 --> 03:20:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, on the Gandhi-Ambedkar debates as they were, I completely I agree with both

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:10.720
[Amit Varma]: of them in different aspects of the problem.

03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:15.320
[Amit Varma]: I completely agree with Ambedkar about the toxicity of caste.

03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:19.480
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, caste is not the only thing wrong with Hinduism, but there is just a lot that

03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:20.480
[Amit Varma]: is toxic.

03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:21.520
[Amit Varma]: So there I'm completely with him.

03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:25.520
[Amit Varma]: I think a lot of the things that Gandhi said on caste were just virtue signaling and waffling

03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:28.240
[Amit Varma]: and you know, not going far enough, honestly.

03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:32.780
[Amit Varma]: However, where I am more sympathetic towards Gandhi, and this is of course, with the benefit

03:20:32.780 --> 03:20:39.080
[Amit Varma]: of hindsight, is on the means adopted to get there where Gandhi's point was that real social

03:20:39.080 --> 03:20:42.320
[Amit Varma]: change comes from the bottom up, and that's where it's long lasting.

03:20:42.320 --> 03:20:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And if you do something top down, you know, it'll just be on the surface.

03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:50.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think Ambedkar realized this when he spoke of the constitution being just a top

03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:57.160
[Amit Varma]: soil, you know, and at the ground underneath, as we saw from his court and villages earlier,

03:20:57.160 --> 03:20:58.160
[Amit Varma]: it's just so messy.

03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:00.080
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, there was nothing he could do.

03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:04.460
[Amit Varma]: This was the best that he could do at the time, social change can take decades.

03:21:04.460 --> 03:21:06.000
[Amit Varma]: So I understand where that's coming from.

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:09.280
[Amit Varma]: And honestly, when I'm when I spoke of a top down intervention, I wasn't even thinking

03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:14.240
[Amit Varma]: of affirmative action, I was thinking of more like anti discrimination law, which in my

03:21:14.240 --> 03:21:19.560
[Amit Varma]: mind in practice on the ground would achieve nothing, it might even create perverse incentives

03:21:19.560 --> 03:21:20.960
[Amit Varma]: of different types.

03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And it would just give activists the satisfaction of being able to say ki ha humne kuch kiya.

03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:29.880
[Amit Varma]: It's really in the category in my mind of saying that we must do something, this is

03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:31.400
[Amit Varma]: something, therefore, let's do it.

03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:34.400
[Guest]: You know, so I'm going to be a bit cynical about state led.

03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:43.480
[Guest]: I mean, I'm just saying that we need to collectively think about what is it that will make it costly

03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:45.400
[Guest]: for people to discriminate?

03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:46.400
[Guest]: Let's stop there.

03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:47.400
[Guest]: I mean, I think that's the real question.

03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:48.720
[Guest]: I agree with you.

03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:52.680
[Guest]: And so I think that's the question that we but before we do that, we have to recognize

03:21:52.680 --> 03:21:59.200
[Guest]: and admit that discrimination is a current contemporary problem.

03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:02.520
[Guest]: So there's not that much agreement on it, not as much as you.

03:22:02.520 --> 03:22:06.680
[Guest]: So I'll tell you about another paper of mine, which I did with Dean Spears, where we looked

03:22:06.680 --> 03:22:08.000
[Guest]: at charitable giving.

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:15.640
[Guest]: Now, in social psychology, there is a phenomenon called the identified victim effect, which

03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:20.160
[Guest]: is you know, when you get these charity ke liye donations, they always show you a picture

03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:25.480
[Guest]: of a little girl or something and will give you a name that Sarita in Muzaffarpur, Bihar

03:22:25.480 --> 03:22:29.760
[Guest]: is you know, can't go to school, please donate for education, etc.

03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:35.000
[Guest]: And in social psychology literature, experiment after experiment in a variety of cultural

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:41.960
[Guest]: settings has found that an identified victim, which is you put a name and a face always

03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:45.680
[Guest]: gets greater charity than a statistical cause.

03:22:45.680 --> 03:22:50.240
[Guest]: You could just translate all this to say, so many million girls in Bihar are lacking

03:22:50.240 --> 03:22:54.160
[Guest]: education, please donate to a charity which is working for their cause, as it was to Sarita

03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:55.160
[Guest]: in Bihar.

03:22:55.160 --> 03:23:01.240
[Guest]: So Sarita in Bihar ad will get more charitable donations than a generic charity.

03:23:01.240 --> 03:23:09.240
[Guest]: So what we did was we took, we did three experiments, upper caste Hindus, Dalit Hindus, OBCs and

03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:15.960
[Guest]: Muslims, and then we had a named ad and a statistical ad, right?

03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:24.480
[Guest]: And we found that for all other categories, the named ad got higher donations than the

03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:29.320
[Guest]: statistical ad, which proves the identified victim effect.

03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:32.560
[Guest]: But for Dalits, it was opposite.

03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:39.160
[Guest]: So the charity, the generic, the statistical charity got more donation than a named Dalit

03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:40.600
[Guest]: victim.

03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:44.600
[Guest]: So when we first sent it with just one experiment to the referee, they said, how do you know

03:23:44.600 --> 03:23:47.440
[Guest]: that people are recognizing this as a Dalit name?

03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:50.280
[Guest]: It could just be some name that they picked up.

03:23:50.280 --> 03:23:51.880
[Guest]: And we had four names for each category.

03:23:51.880 --> 03:23:53.360
[Guest]: So it wasn't linked to any one name.

03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:55.760
[Guest]: It was all four names aggregated.

03:23:55.760 --> 03:24:01.520
[Guest]: Then we did a two-stage experiment where we first gave names and said, tick, write the

03:24:01.520 --> 03:24:02.720
[Guest]: caste you think they belong to.

03:24:02.720 --> 03:24:08.520
[Guest]: And then we, for every category, we gave 20 names and we booked the five most recognized

03:24:08.520 --> 03:24:09.520
[Guest]: names.

03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:13.680
[Guest]: And then using those names, we ran the experiment again and the result went through.

03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:18.020
[Guest]: And this links with a larger literature in the social psychology field, which believes,

03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:23.240
[Guest]: and we are seeing some of it play out today in India's context, where some victims are

03:24:23.240 --> 03:24:31.400
[Guest]: seen as deserving of sympathy and other victims are seen as deserving the fate that they got.

03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:37.240
[Guest]: In other words, they generate disgust or they generate anger.

03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:41.340
[Guest]: So certain victims get a lot of sympathy for their situation.

03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:46.220
[Guest]: Another person in exactly the same situation, even worse, will not get that sympathy.

03:24:46.220 --> 03:24:49.840
[Guest]: And that depends on which group that person belongs to, you know.

03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:55.120
[Guest]: So is the group worthy of sympathy or not?

03:24:55.120 --> 03:24:58.840
[Guest]: And that is what that paper is about, you know, and we are seeing that being played

03:24:58.840 --> 03:24:59.840
[Amit Varma]: out.

03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:00.840
[Amit Varma]: I completely agree with you.

03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:03.040
[Amit Varma]: And maybe it's just a selection bias of the circles that I move in.

03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:07.280
[Amit Varma]: But I can't think of anyone who really denies that there is a caste problem in India, right?

03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:08.720
[Amit Varma]: It is our deepest problem.

03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:11.840
[Guest]: I mean, even for example.

03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:17.440
[Guest]: Nobody denies it, but is it just something, you know, there was big gaps in the past and

03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:19.240
[Guest]: we are sort of narrowing and getting better.

03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:23.920
[Guest]: And so eventually, it's just a question of when we achieve convergence, or is it that

03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.960
[Guest]: there's divergence going on right now?

03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:27.820
[Amit Varma]: On that, there is dis.

03:25:27.820 --> 03:25:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Because my sense is that the modern bigots, which we see around us, are actually happy

03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:34.400
[Amit Varma]: to boast about caste discrimination.

03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:39.660
[Amit Varma]: For example, when, you know, Bilqis Bano's rapist and the killers of a family were released,

03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:44.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, there was a BJP MP or MLA or whatever, saying those things on air about how they

03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:45.720
[Amit Varma]: are Brahmins.

03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:46.720
[Unknown]: So they can't be bad.

03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:49.400
[Amit Varma]: So they kind of seem to wear the casteism on their sleeve.

03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:54.120
[Guest]: So, you know, I'm talking about academic circles, yeah, fair enough.

03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:58.760
[Amit Varma]: And just to sort of get back, I completely agree that, you know, that people who decry

03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:02.640
[Amit Varma]: some solutions have to then come up with the solutions.

03:26:02.640 --> 03:26:07.120
[Amit Varma]: My is that, you know, just looking through history, that coercive state solutions don't

03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:08.120
[Amit Varma]: often do much.

03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:12.520
[Amit Varma]: And I think the incentives have to change and they have to change from within society.

03:26:12.520 --> 03:26:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And I think if we had a faster growing economy, more urbanization, the incentives would change

03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:22.440
[Amit Varma]: in the direction that I think Becker broadly says that they would.

03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:25.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, it's a swimming pool problem, you know, is it happening because of this

03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:26.520
[Amit Varma]: or that?

03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:30.600
[Amit Varma]: So my final question on this on this subject, before we go on to talking about gender, Thomas

03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Saville, who's, of course, African American economist, written many great books, which

03:26:34.320 --> 03:26:39.280
[Amit Varma]: I love wrote this influential book in early 2000s, affirmative action around the world,

03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:43.160
[Amit Varma]: where he looked at affirmative action in a number of different cities.

03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:48.480
[Amit Varma]: And what he essentially concluded was that in the city in the countries that he looked

03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:54.880
[Amit Varma]: at, he couldn't find any beneficial effect of it on the groups under question, obviously,

03:26:54.880 --> 03:26:59.920
[Amit Varma]: individuals who receive affirmative action will benefit, but on the groups themselves,

03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:02.760
[Amit Varma]: he couldn't find any long term sort of impact.

03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And one could argue that this is again, the swimming pool problem, like how do you disentangle

03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:10.000
[Amit Varma]: there are no counterfactuals, all of that, I understand that.

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:15.640
[Amit Varma]: And a couple of the points he made about it was that, among many points, and a couple

03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:20.160
[Amit Varma]: of the points he made was that number one, the benefits, of course, went to those who

03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:23.800
[Amit Varma]: were more relatively more privileged among the groups in question.

03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:26.080
[Amit Varma]: So that's a creamy layer argument.

03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:29.160
[Amit Varma]: And the other point was one of group polarization.

03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And in your book itself, I'll quote this para by you, where at one point, you write, quote,

03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:40.800
[Amit Varma]: what is often loosely called a quota mentality can be interpreted to engender a certain brand

03:27:40.800 --> 03:27:46.320
[Amit Varma]: of identity politics, which draws sustenance from the existence of caste based fissures.

03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:50.760
[Amit Varma]: The proponents of this brand of identity politics, for example, the current chief minister of

03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:56.320
[Amit Varma]: UP and leader of the Bhajan Samajpati Mayawati would much rather keep caste divisions alive,

03:27:56.320 --> 03:27:58.360
[Amit Varma]: as it justifies their existence.

03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Because then become a tool for mobilizing their constituency, rather than an instrument

03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:05.000
[Amit Varma]: of genuine empowerment of Dalits.

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:10.080
[Amit Varma]: This brand of identity politics is therefore inimical to the idea of annihilation of caste.

03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:14.720
[Amit Varma]: And though the leadership might use Ambedkar's iconic value to further his case, his actual

03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:20.120
[Amit Varma]: practices are antithetical to Ambedkar's vision and goal of a casteless society, stop

03:28:20.120 --> 03:28:21.120
[Amit Varma]: quote.

03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:22.720
[Amit Varma]: And this was written, I think, in 2010.

03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:27.520
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, when you're referring to UPCM and all that, it's sort of from that time.

03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:34.040
[Amit Varma]: But this is the other criticism that is sometimes made against reservations and it's twofold.

03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And one is that it's sort of that while the Constitution says that we will treat everyone

03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:45.000
[Amit Varma]: equally, this solidifies these differences of identity and can that be a good thing?

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Can that lead to more polarization?

03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:53.840
[Amit Varma]: And the second is that reservations can then become a political tool, which are, you know,

03:28:53.840 --> 03:28:58.400
[Amit Varma]: used for political purposes where the original function is kind of forgotten.

03:28:58.400 --> 03:29:02.760
[Amit Varma]: And you yourself have pointed out that many of the OBCs have mobilized it like the Jats

03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:07.600
[Amit Varma]: of Haryana, the Marathas of Maharashtra, the Patels of Gujarat are actually relatively

03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:08.600
[Amit Varma]: well to do.

03:29:08.600 --> 03:29:12.080
[Amit Varma]: And it could be argued that they don't need affirmative action at all.

03:29:12.080 --> 03:29:16.760
[Amit Varma]: Certainly they might, you know, so how does one kind of look at these?

03:29:16.760 --> 03:29:21.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these are doubt the para I quoted, of course, is something that, you know, you

03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:26.440
[Amit Varma]: were in a sense sort of summarizing a certain approach to it, but your overall conclusion

03:29:26.440 --> 03:29:30.920
[Amit Varma]: was that quotas are needed, you know, they may make little difference, but they do make

03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:31.920
[Amit Varma]: a difference.

03:29:31.920 --> 03:29:34.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, what's your feeling on all of this?

03:29:34.880 --> 03:29:36.720
[Guest]: Let me start with the second question.

03:29:36.720 --> 03:29:42.920
[Guest]: So just FYI, the Marathas, Jats and Patels have not yet been included in the OBC category

03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:48.360
[Guest]: and our paper, one of my papers with Rajesh, we look at the justification of that demand

03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:50.440
[Guest]: and we find no justification in that.

03:29:50.440 --> 03:29:56.180
[Guest]: So first of all, I would make a big distinction between OBCs and SCs, administratively speaking,

03:29:56.180 --> 03:30:01.360
[Guest]: because even in terms of the stigmatization that comes from untouchability, OBCs have

03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:03.080
[Guest]: not faced that stigma.

03:30:03.080 --> 03:30:05.720
[Guest]: So socioeconomic deprivation is just one thing.

03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:09.480
[Guest]: I don't think reservation should be used to solve that problem.

03:30:09.480 --> 03:30:13.080
[Guest]: Socioeconomic deprivation of any section of the population is bad and we have to find

03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:14.080
[Guest]: other solutions for it.

03:30:14.080 --> 03:30:17.760
[Guest]: And growth, of course, is one of the mechanisms, but we can think of other things as well.

03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:21.640
[Guest]: So I think the OBC problem and the SC problem, first of all, have to be separated and I've

03:30:21.640 --> 03:30:24.960
[Guest]: said that the entire time.

03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:32.440
[Guest]: For Dalits, the issue is the stigma of untouchability and unfortunately, untouchability pervades

03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:38.360
[Guest]: the mindset of people, even today, just recently the Rajasthan teacher boy drinking water,

03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:40.760
[Guest]: that episode happened every day, there's something or the other.

03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:41.760
[Guest]: Right.

03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:46.400
[Guest]: So I think that Dalits and OBC reservation, I do not, I've never seen that in the same

03:30:46.400 --> 03:30:47.440
[Guest]: bracket.

03:30:47.440 --> 03:30:51.640
[Guest]: And I think that the problem is that reservation as a tool has become overextended.

03:30:51.640 --> 03:30:54.720
[Guest]: So anybody who has socioeconomic deprivation, give reservation.

03:30:54.720 --> 03:30:55.720
[Guest]: That's not a solution.

03:30:55.720 --> 03:30:56.720
[Guest]: I don't think.

03:30:56.720 --> 03:31:03.440
[Guest]: I think reservations was intended to be used for a group that suffers historical stigma

03:31:03.440 --> 03:31:05.980
[Guest]: due to birth in a particular caste.

03:31:05.980 --> 03:31:09.120
[Guest]: And I still think that should be the focus of reservations.

03:31:09.120 --> 03:31:10.120
[Guest]: So one thing.

03:31:10.120 --> 03:31:13.280
[Guest]: The second thing about solidifying caste identities is look at the counterfactual.

03:31:13.280 --> 03:31:17.200
[Guest]: There are many, many, many, many arenas where reservation has played no role.

03:31:17.200 --> 03:31:20.680
[Guest]: You look at the entire private sector, you look at the MSME sector, you look at any type

03:31:20.680 --> 03:31:21.680
[Guest]: of job.

03:31:21.680 --> 03:31:22.680
[Guest]: Okay.

03:31:22.680 --> 03:31:27.320
[Guest]: Now, if we were to find evidence that, forget about government jobs where reservation matters

03:31:27.320 --> 03:31:31.080
[Guest]: or government education where reservation matters, look at everything else.

03:31:31.080 --> 03:31:35.720
[Guest]: What is the evidence on the convergence or divergence between upper caste and Dalits

03:31:35.720 --> 03:31:39.220
[Guest]: and I'm not bringing OBC into the picture, just upper caste and Dalits.

03:31:39.220 --> 03:31:43.760
[Guest]: Has it been reducing in areas where reservation doesn't matter, because that's the only counterfactual

03:31:43.760 --> 03:31:44.760
[Guest]: I can think of.

03:31:44.760 --> 03:31:48.880
[Guest]: There is a swimming pool problem here, but there is one section where there's reservation,

03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:50.240
[Guest]: one there isn't.

03:31:50.240 --> 03:31:51.960
[Guest]: So do we see two opposite trends?

03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:53.000
[Guest]: In fact, the opposite.

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:58.720
[Guest]: If anything, the small, tiny part of our economy where there is reservation has lower gaps

03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:03.320
[Guest]: between upper caste and Dalits than the arena where there's no reservation.

03:32:03.320 --> 03:32:07.640
[Guest]: The creamy layer question, that's a question that's often asked.

03:32:07.640 --> 03:32:11.920
[Guest]: Anybody who goes into higher education in India is in the creamy layer of any caste.

03:32:11.920 --> 03:32:12.920
[Guest]: Okay.

03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:16.960
[Guest]: We can never make that argument about anyone else, right?

03:32:16.960 --> 03:32:21.040
[Guest]: Saying that, oh, so many generations preceding this person have gotten into college admissions,

03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:22.760
[Guest]: so maybe this person should not get priority.

03:32:22.760 --> 03:32:24.480
[Guest]: Do we make that argument anywhere?

03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:25.480
[Guest]: Nowhere.

03:32:25.480 --> 03:32:30.120
[Guest]: In fact, you know, so if we are advantaged because of our social capital, inherited legacy

03:32:30.120 --> 03:32:35.280
[Guest]: of just many, many, many generations who are educated, who have access to knowledge, access

03:32:35.280 --> 03:32:37.840
[Guest]: to books, it's a way of life.

03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:43.200
[Guest]: We are not particularly bothered about inequality there, or we never make this argument that

03:32:43.200 --> 03:32:48.560
[Guest]: a particular benefit should be toned down or withheld because poor Brahmins need to

03:32:48.560 --> 03:32:50.400
[Guest]: go or poor upper caste need to get in.

03:32:50.400 --> 03:32:52.720
[Guest]: We'll never make that argument about upper caste.

03:32:52.720 --> 03:33:00.040
[Guest]: So I just don't understand where, by stricture, Dalits were denied education for centuries,

03:33:00.040 --> 03:33:01.040
[Guest]: you know.

03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:05.760
[Guest]: And so the generation of Dalit families that have education, you know, goes back three,

03:33:05.760 --> 03:33:08.320
[Guest]: maximum four in Kerala, maybe.

03:33:08.320 --> 03:33:13.080
[Guest]: You're comparing that to literally an unending chain of, you know, educational privilege.

03:33:13.080 --> 03:33:18.080
[Guest]: So I think that there is a little bit of, and so in my view, reservation should be targeted

03:33:18.080 --> 03:33:19.080
[Guest]: towards the most needy.

03:33:19.080 --> 03:33:21.880
[Guest]: In my book, that's Dalits.

03:33:21.880 --> 03:33:23.880
[Guest]: Identity politics is a different question.

03:33:23.880 --> 03:33:26.240
[Guest]: We can talk about that later, but I'm not an expert on that question.

03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:32.000
[Guest]: I'm not a political scientist, but that's a slightly separate question from an objective

03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:33.600
[Guest]: reality and what you do.

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:36.680
[Guest]: It's like a racetrack, you know, think of a circular racetrack.

03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:42.560
[Guest]: If an accident of birth puts you in the outermost ring of the circular racetrack and an accident

03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:46.120
[Guest]: of birth puts me in the innermost ring and we are both given the same time to win the

03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:49.000
[Guest]: race and we have similar abilities, who's winning?

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:50.760
[Guest]: I'll win always.

03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:54.280
[Guest]: Just because I happen to be born, I happen to be placed by an accident of birth on the

03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:55.280
[Guest]: innermost ring.

03:33:55.280 --> 03:33:57.500
[Guest]: I have the shortest distance to run.

03:33:57.500 --> 03:34:03.040
[Guest]: In sports, we very easily adjust for that by giving the outermost person an advantage.

03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:06.200
[Guest]: Just a little bit of an advantage in the beginning.

03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:10.180
[Guest]: So I think equality of opportunity, I'm not talking about equality of outcomes.

03:34:10.180 --> 03:34:14.360
[Guest]: I think my focus is on equality of opportunity.

03:34:14.360 --> 03:34:18.720
[Guest]: Outcomes will be unequal and you know, as long as they are not unequal on account of

03:34:18.720 --> 03:34:22.200
[Guest]: birth, I think that's really the question we need to think about.

03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:25.800
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you entirely on the importance of equality of opportunity.

03:34:25.800 --> 03:34:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And I think we'd both agree that caste is really the most toxic thing about our society.

03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:35.400
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we're going to talk about gender next, so that definitely kind of competes

03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:36.400
[Amit Varma]: with it.

03:34:36.400 --> 03:34:41.020
[Amit Varma]: So what I'd urge everyone listening to do is, no matter what you feel the possible solutions

03:34:41.020 --> 03:34:45.200
[Amit Varma]: for this problem are, as long as you accept that this is a problem, you need to know the

03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:48.720
[Amit Varma]: extent of the problem and the contours of the problem and the nuances of the problem

03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:53.920
[Amit Varma]: and the best way of doing that is by engaging with the literature on it and you are absolutely

03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:57.720
[Amit Varma]: the pioneer on that, obviously, so please read Ashwini Deshpande's books and many, many

03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:03.400
[Amit Varma]: papers, which, you know, cast so much illumination on this, because we need to sort of understand

03:35:03.400 --> 03:35:07.760
[Amit Varma]: the extent of the problem till we can argue from our ivory towers, what should we do?

03:35:07.760 --> 03:35:12.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about gender now, you know, so, you know, for many years, you did this pioneering

03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:13.800
[Amit Varma]: work on caste.

03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, part of doing this work also showed you that added layer of gender as you've

03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:23.600
[Amit Varma]: pointed out that, you know, yeah, Dalits get the worst of it, but female Dalits are even

03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:25.440
[Amit Varma]: worse off, you know.

03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So at what point did your attention shift to gender as a subject to study?

03:35:30.880 --> 03:35:34.400
[Amit Varma]: And now, of course, you've written about it, you have serious insights, I link to talks

03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:37.400
[Amit Varma]: you've given on the subject on YouTube, also from the show notes.

03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:39.240
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that.

03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:44.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so I don't, I mean, I did those couple of, maybe two or three, I can't remember,

03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:48.900
[Guest]: but I did a few early papers were looking at caste, gender, etc, etc.

03:35:48.900 --> 03:35:57.560
[Guest]: But it wasn't any systematic set of work, and I think, from about 2013-14, two, three

03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:02.820
[Guest]: things came together in, you know, as is the case, I guess, with my life, purely accidentally,

03:36:02.820 --> 03:36:04.400
[Guest]: you know, things happen.

03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:09.140
[Guest]: One of those was, you know, Vijendra Rao, known as Biju Rao, who's in the World Bank,

03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:15.600
[Guest]: he approached me and asked if I would be interested in doing an evaluation of the World Bank supported

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:19.080
[Guest]: program in Maharashtra on the self-help groups.

03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:23.160
[Guest]: And I just said yes, because I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to visit

03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:25.640
[Guest]: rural Maharashtra other than Rahimathpur.

03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:27.040
[Guest]: And you know, my father was alive at that time.

03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:29.440
[Guest]: So I thought, oh, it'll be very nice for me to just visit him.

03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:33.640
[Guest]: Every time I go to Maharashtra, I can just visit my father, also just to bring, to establish

03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:34.640
[Guest]: a better connection.

03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:36.200
[Guest]: So I agreed.

03:36:36.200 --> 03:36:42.240
[Guest]: And we chose 10, I mean, Biju was not a part of that study, but I chose 10 poorest districts

03:36:42.240 --> 03:36:45.800
[Guest]: in Maharashtra, which, of course, was not really in Western Maharashtra.

03:36:45.800 --> 03:36:50.240
[Guest]: Most of it was eastern and there's Nandurbar and all that, again, a part of Maharashtra

03:36:50.240 --> 03:36:51.240
[Guest]: that never been to.

03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:54.920
[Guest]: In fact, I went to Garchiroli, which is a Naxal, you know, where the Naxalite problem

03:36:54.920 --> 03:36:56.660
[Guest]: is particularly severe.

03:36:56.660 --> 03:36:59.000
[Guest]: So that was a sort of Naxalite territory.

03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:03.840
[Guest]: So it just gave me an entry point into a completely different world that I had not encountered

03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:04.840
[Guest]: before.

03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:06.040
[Guest]: And so I was excited by that.

03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:13.240
[Guest]: So that fieldwork, we sampled 10,000 households across 10 poorest districts in Maharashtra.

03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:18.520
[Guest]: And that's got me thinking about livelihoods, women, you know, getting together.

03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:25.240
[Guest]: These are very poor women who organize themselves in self-help groups and meet once a week and

03:37:25.240 --> 03:37:29.080
[Guest]: save small amounts till they become bigger and there's a village organization, then they

03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:31.080
[Guest]: get some money from the government, etc.

03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:33.360
[Guest]: And then they can form federations, etc.

03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:34.360
[Guest]: So the whole structure.

03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:42.080
[Guest]: When I went into it, I was very skeptical about this program and I felt like the government

03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:47.240
[Guest]: is not giving them jobs or jobs are not getting generated in rural India.

03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:50.520
[Guest]: And this is just a little, you know, you do something and you get these women together

03:37:50.520 --> 03:37:54.200
[Guest]: and it's just, it's not a very effective program.

03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:55.920
[Guest]: That was my understanding.

03:37:55.920 --> 03:38:00.320
[Guest]: And I thought that the mobilization also was just formal and it didn't have any substantive

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:02.340
[Guest]: effect on women's lives.

03:38:02.340 --> 03:38:06.200
[Guest]: But I went, that was my prior, of course, I didn't say that to anyone.

03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:08.760
[Guest]: It wasn't just in my thought.

03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:14.680
[Guest]: And what I saw on the field completely changed my view about it.

03:38:14.680 --> 03:38:19.440
[Guest]: I mean, it is, it was, I mean, there were points where I had tears in my eyes looking

03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:26.000
[Guest]: at the conditions of these women, but their resolve to meet once a week and save 10 rupees

03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:32.120
[Guest]: per week, which 2013, I mean, 10 rupees is a small amount for us anytime, but for them,

03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:34.320
[Guest]: it was a fairly substantial amount.

03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:37.400
[Guest]: And often they would say, I would say, where do you save these 10 rupees from?

03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:41.800
[Guest]: And they would say, we cut down milk in our tea, not for the husband, but for themselves

03:38:41.800 --> 03:38:44.400
[Guest]: to save these 10 rupees.

03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:48.980
[Guest]: And the data, you know, I have another paper about can weak ties create social capital?

03:38:48.980 --> 03:38:51.680
[Guest]: Because these are non-kinship based groups.

03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:55.360
[Guest]: These are women that you don't know otherwise, and you're engaging with them.

03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:58.160
[Guest]: Anyway, there's a whole thing on the SOG movement, etc.

03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:03.480
[Guest]: And while in our sample, we didn't find a huge effect on livelihoods.

03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.480
[Guest]: But it showed me something about the willingness of women to leave their homes, to go out to

03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:13.320
[Guest]: meet other women, to engage with the village officials, their propensity to engage with

03:39:13.320 --> 03:39:17.720
[Guest]: the gram panchayat, to ask for the ration shop to be opened if it was not open.

03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:24.240
[Guest]: I mean, their overall collective action propensity is markedly in better if they are members

03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:26.620
[Guest]: of SOGs compared to when they are not.

03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:30.520
[Guest]: And we've done a bunch of things to, you know, eliminate all these swimming pool issues,

03:39:30.520 --> 03:39:31.520
[Guest]: etc, etc.

03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:34.660
[Guest]: And our sample is big enough that we have the power to do that.

03:39:34.660 --> 03:39:40.560
[Guest]: And that really got me thinking, looking at the social norms issue very differently.

03:39:40.560 --> 03:39:44.520
[Guest]: You know, these are women that they don't have to mobilize in these SOGs.

03:39:44.520 --> 03:39:47.640
[Guest]: It's not making an immediate difference to their livelihoods.

03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:52.760
[Guest]: But it is a, I think, a problem with jobs creation, which is that there aren't avenues

03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:55.140
[Guest]: of employment in rural India.

03:39:55.140 --> 03:40:01.880
[Guest]: These are women burdened by domestic work, yet they want to find the time, that one time,

03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:02.880
[Guest]: you know.

03:40:02.880 --> 03:40:05.240
[Guest]: This whole assumption that women don't want to leave their homes, I don't know where it's

03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:08.560
[Guest]: coming from, but it's become such a pervasive assumption.

03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:12.280
[Guest]: I just, I've never seen it, never, ever.

03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:15.480
[Guest]: Women want to leave their homes, honestly, believe me.

03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:17.560
[Guest]: Anyway, so this sort of got me thinking.

03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:20.520
[Guest]: And then, of course, there was this paper that happened.

03:40:20.520 --> 03:40:23.920
[Guest]: And then there was Professor Naila Kabir, she's at LSE.

03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:28.880
[Guest]: She asked me if I would partner with her on a paper on West Bengal, because she's an expert.

03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:31.080
[Guest]: She was, she's originally Bangladeshi.

03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:33.120
[Guest]: And so she's done a bunch of work on Bangladesh.

03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:37.440
[Guest]: And so we thought, if you look at the West Bengal-Bangladesh comparison, it will give

03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:43.240
[Guest]: us a nice insights into, because the cultural factors are counterintuitive there.

03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:48.360
[Guest]: Because Bangladesh is Islamic, and West Bengal is majority not Islamic.

03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:53.920
[Guest]: And the sort of a very popular but erroneous view in this literature is that Islam is a

03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:55.720
[Guest]: constraint to female labor force participation.

03:40:55.720 --> 03:40:58.960
[Guest]: But if that were the case, then Bangladesh should have been lower than West Bengal.

03:40:58.960 --> 03:40:59.960
[Guest]: But we don't find that.

03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:04.680
[Guest]: In fact, not just labor force participation, but fertility rates, adoption of contraceptives

03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:07.680
[Guest]: is higher in Bangladesh than in West Bengal.

03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:12.160
[Guest]: So talk about, you know, cultural stereotypes, completely playing out differently, actually

03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:14.280
[Guest]: in the real world anyway.

03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:20.080
[Guest]: So because I'd done this fieldwork in Maharashtra, you know, sort of suddenly encountered questions

03:41:20.080 --> 03:41:24.840
[Guest]: that I had not encountered before, in my mind, I agreed and we applied, you know, she was

03:41:24.840 --> 03:41:29.480
[Guest]: applying for funding, and I became a co-applicant, we got funding, and we did fieldwork in West

03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:30.480
[Guest]: Bengal.

03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:33.560
[Guest]: And so there's a quantitative component to it, which I have worked on.

03:41:33.560 --> 03:41:37.360
[Guest]: And there's a qualitative component to it, which Naila is working on, because she does

03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:42.200
[Guest]: more qualitative work, which are interviews with women trying to understand the role of

03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:45.980
[Guest]: constraints and the role of, you know, what is it that's preventing them from working?

03:41:45.980 --> 03:41:47.920
[Guest]: Is it just that there's not work available?

03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:48.920
[Guest]: Is it domestic chores?

03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:54.760
[Guest]: At least in the quantitative section, we find that it's really the disproportionate burden

03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:58.960
[Guest]: of women being responsible for domestic work.

03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:05.080
[Guest]: This not childcare, it's cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, things like that.

03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:07.480
[Guest]: And, you know, I know that you have international listeners.

03:42:07.480 --> 03:42:11.200
[Guest]: So I just want to say one thing, which is that one big difference between South Asia

03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:16.460
[Guest]: and other countries in the world, is that these tasks are done in South Asian homes

03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:19.640
[Guest]: every day and several times a day.

03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:24.640
[Guest]: In most South Asian homes, fresh meals or hot meals are cooked at least twice, if not

03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.280
[Guest]: thrice.

03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:30.560
[Guest]: Because our homes are not air-conditioned and insulated, we clean our homes every day.

03:42:30.560 --> 03:42:34.520
[Guest]: Clothes get washed every day, because we don't have washing machines, we don't store dirty

03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:35.520
[Guest]: clothes.

03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:38.840
[Guest]: Many people are too poor to have those many clothes that they can go without for a week

03:42:38.840 --> 03:42:39.840
[Guest]: without.

03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:44.880
[Guest]: So, washing clothes gets done every day, dishes get done every day, several times a day, cooking

03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:47.200
[Guest]: gets done every day, cleaning gets done every day.

03:42:47.200 --> 03:42:52.720
[Guest]: These are tasks that in the West, either don't get done every day or don't get frequently

03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:53.720
[Guest]: done in a day.

03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:57.000
[Guest]: And there are dishwashers, washing machines, etc., etc.

03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:02.960
[Guest]: And so these elements add a particularly heavy level of domestic chores to women in South

03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:05.740
[Guest]: Asia that you don't find in other parts.

03:43:05.740 --> 03:43:09.560
[Guest]: And the cultural norm that is a real victim is not Islam, not veiling.

03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:12.200
[Guest]: We asked about the practice of veiling, parda.

03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:13.200
[Guest]: It isn't that.

03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:19.120
[Guest]: It is the disproportionate responsibility of being responsible for domestic chores,

03:43:19.120 --> 03:43:20.240
[Guest]: which is women.

03:43:20.240 --> 03:43:24.640
[Guest]: And that is a real supply-side constraint that needs to be fixed.

03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:31.440
[Guest]: The demand-side constraint is that in rural India, the rate of job creation is very low.

03:43:31.440 --> 03:43:38.320
[Guest]: The agricultural technology has displaced female labor more than male labor in agriculture.

03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:42.560
[Guest]: And whenever there's a shock, like a drought, my colleague, Kanika Mahajan, has a paper

03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:43.560
[Guest]: on drought.

03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:44.560
[Guest]: I have a paper on demonetization.

03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:47.720
[Guest]: I have another paper on COVID, right?

03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:52.920
[Guest]: Whenever there's a shock, unanticipated external shock, an exogenous shock, it hurts female

03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:56.480
[Guest]: employment more than it does male, right?

03:43:56.480 --> 03:44:02.400
[Guest]: So I think we have to contextualize the role of cultural norms and the role of just plain

03:44:02.400 --> 03:44:03.960
[Guest]: demand supply-side factors.

03:44:03.960 --> 03:44:06.400
[Guest]: Now, you can say everything is cultural norms.

03:44:06.400 --> 03:44:08.640
[Guest]: If it is labor market discrimination, that's also cultural norms.

03:44:08.640 --> 03:44:14.440
[Guest]: If you take that view, then every society is governed by regressive cultural norms,

03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:17.360
[Guest]: which is an argument, obviously, nobody makes, right?

03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:21.400
[Guest]: So I think that there is something called economic discrimination, and I think India

03:44:21.400 --> 03:44:22.640
[Guest]: has it too.

03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:27.600
[Guest]: Indian women are just as ready to move out of their homes as other women are elsewhere

03:44:27.600 --> 03:44:29.200
[Guest]: in the world.

03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:30.760
[Guest]: What is it that's tying them down?

03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:31.760
[Guest]: Two things.

03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:37.240
[Guest]: Get enough jobs in rural India, and B, domestic chores.

03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:41.920
[Guest]: So this is the twin work, twin problem that we have to solve.

03:44:41.920 --> 03:44:46.720
[Guest]: Childcare or elderly care, even I've looked at the Time News survey data in 2019, for

03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:52.440
[Guest]: rural women, that is not the major constraint, because of the way children are brought up

03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:57.380
[Guest]: in rural India, they're not individually supervised in a way that you think in a sort of a Western

03:44:57.380 --> 03:44:59.680
[Guest]: nuclear family setup, all right?

03:44:59.680 --> 03:45:04.560
[Guest]: And the decline in female labor force participation rates has been in rural India.

03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:08.520
[Guest]: Urban India has always been low, but it's stagnant, hasn't changed.

03:45:08.520 --> 03:45:15.360
[Guest]: Final point on this is that many of us have argued that the proportion of women in economically

03:45:15.360 --> 03:45:20.600
[Guest]: active work has not declined, but the amount of work they're doing has declined, and that

03:45:20.600 --> 03:45:23.460
[Guest]: gets picked up in the measurement issue.

03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:27.000
[Guest]: And there's a researcher called Nicholas Lee, who's at Ryerson University in Canada, he's

03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:31.560
[Guest]: analyzed the Time News survey data for 2019.

03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:35.800
[Guest]: And the pilot survey, which was done in 1998, there are six states there, he's looked at

03:45:35.800 --> 03:45:40.960
[Guest]: the same six states in 2019, and he finds exactly the same thing, that the proportion

03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:47.400
[Guest]: of women who are economically active is the same, but the hours they work have declined

03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:51.900
[Guest]: drastically in 2019, compared to 98.

03:45:51.900 --> 03:45:57.200
[Guest]: And finally, my paper with my student Jeetendra Singh, we use longitudinal data, and we show

03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:03.760
[Guest]: that literally every four months, women are entering and exiting employment over frequent

03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:04.760
[Guest]: intervals.

03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:09.220
[Guest]: Four month intervals are too short for social norms to change.

03:46:09.220 --> 03:46:12.680
[Guest]: So they suddenly don't become favorable and women go out, suddenly become unfavorable,

03:46:12.680 --> 03:46:13.680
[Guest]: women come in.

03:46:13.680 --> 03:46:14.680
[Guest]: That can't be it.

03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:17.240
[Guest]: And we've accounted for all of the explanations.

03:46:17.240 --> 03:46:20.280
[Guest]: So when you put, these are the dots, Amit, that we were talking about earlier.

03:46:20.280 --> 03:46:25.600
[Guest]: Now, when you put all these dots and start joining them, the picture that emerges is

03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:32.000
[Guest]: that, yes, there is a problem of domestic chores, but that can be solved.

03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:38.600
[Guest]: Other countries in the world have provided for providing these services out of the home,

03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:43.840
[Guest]: whether it's childcare, whether it's free good canteens, China, set up canteens at every

03:46:43.840 --> 03:46:48.520
[Guest]: workplace so that women and men didn't have to cook at home in the morning before going

03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:49.520
[Guest]: to work.

03:46:49.520 --> 03:46:53.920
[Guest]: There can be a number of initiatives that can be done, even in rural India, that can

03:46:53.920 --> 03:46:56.400
[Guest]: solve for these issues.

03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:01.120
[Guest]: You know, provided we again realize that it's, it's solvable, actionable policies, and not

03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:04.280
[Guest]: mindsets that are keeping women out of the labor force.

03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful.

03:47:05.280 --> 03:47:07.700
[Amit Varma]: I want to double click into a bunch of these.

03:47:07.700 --> 03:47:12.840
[Amit Varma]: But before that, elaborate a bit on one nuance, which you have pointed out in your writing

03:47:12.840 --> 03:47:17.560
[Amit Varma]: and in the talks that you've given, which is that we need to think of the low level

03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:23.120
[Amit Varma]: of women working in the workforce and the decline as two separate issues.

03:47:23.120 --> 03:47:27.480
[Amit Varma]: So just elaborate on what that difference is and why that difference is important in

03:47:27.480 --> 03:47:28.920
[Guest]: thinking about the issue.

03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:29.920
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:35.400
[Guest]: So the low level, I think, is related to the domestic chores issue and the fact two things.

03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:36.400
[Guest]: One is domestic chores.

03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:42.280
[Guest]: The other thing that I didn't mention is that rural India has family owned enterprises that

03:47:42.280 --> 03:47:44.360
[Guest]: give livelihood that generate livelihoods.

03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:49.800
[Guest]: It can be farming, fishing, orchards, basket making, gourd making, achar making, selling

03:47:49.800 --> 03:47:50.800
[Guest]: them in the thing.

03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:57.160
[Guest]: Now, all of these enterprises run on the backs of free labor provided by the women in the

03:47:57.160 --> 03:47:59.120
[Guest]: household, including children.

03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:00.120
[Guest]: Right.

03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:07.760
[Guest]: Now, these women do not distinguish between their work on the economic enterprise and

03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:10.200
[Guest]: their work, which is in the purely domestic sphere.

03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:12.960
[Guest]: For them, it's all housework.

03:48:12.960 --> 03:48:18.680
[Guest]: And they are not seen as workers on the economic enterprise, neither by their families, nor

03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:23.280
[Guest]: by the enumerator who comes and is asking about, you know, who's working in this household,

03:48:23.280 --> 03:48:24.280
[Guest]: etc.

03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:28.200
[Guest]: And so this slips through the cracks of the statistical system because they don't get

03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:29.240
[Guest]: recognized as workers.

03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:32.640
[Guest]: They don't have any share in the earnings of the family enterprise.

03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:35.840
[Guest]: And they can't go to a bank and say, oh, you know, we have this family enterprise and I'm

03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:36.840
[Guest]: going to...

03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:41.760
[Guest]: Whereas the husband can go because he's recognized as an owner and worker of that family enterprise.

03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:47.360
[Guest]: And so while recognizing them as workers doesn't mean that they will get automatically an equal

03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:53.080
[Guest]: share or in the income or, you know, increase their save in decision making, but that's

03:48:53.080 --> 03:48:54.520
[Guest]: a first step.

03:48:54.520 --> 03:49:00.200
[Guest]: So that's a low level argument, which is the A measurement, which is that there are these

03:49:00.200 --> 03:49:03.640
[Guest]: women who are active on economic work, not getting counted.

03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:04.640
[Guest]: Right.

03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:05.640
[Guest]: So that's the low level argument.

03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:10.560
[Guest]: The other is domestic chores, which is if hypothetically work was available, you can't

03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:14.000
[Guest]: access it because of this overwhelming responsibility of domestic chores.

03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:15.560
[Guest]: So that's a level argument.

03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:16.960
[Guest]: The decline.

03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:27.200
[Guest]: That's where the technology change, the fact that men migrate out to cities, the women

03:49:27.200 --> 03:49:32.080
[Guest]: are doing the predominantly the agricultural work or whatever the family enterprise is,

03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:37.800
[Guest]: but they're working fewer hours in other type of work that gets counted because work is

03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:43.040
[Guest]: fractured and not available on a long term basis, like a contracting work, for example,

03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:47.360
[Guest]: they might work 10 days instead of 30, which is what is needed to show up in the data as

03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:48.640
[Guest]: as a worker.

03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:49.640
[Guest]: Right.

03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:56.040
[Guest]: And that if you look at the NSS data from 2004, it's very clear decline for men also

03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:59.920
[Guest]: a little bit, but for women, you know, strikingly more.

03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:04.560
[Guest]: So I think that while overall it's the same problem, I mean, it's not two separate problems,

03:50:04.560 --> 03:50:09.280
[Guest]: but when we analyze them, we have to look at the reasons for the low level, differentially

03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:13.720
[Guest]: from the reasons for just the other day, there's another paper that actually I'll be presenting

03:50:13.720 --> 03:50:19.000
[Guest]: next week, a new paper, which where we looked at SHG membership mobilization, which is increasing

03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:22.720
[Guest]: and labor force participation rate, which is decreasing and how the two are connected.

03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:26.680
[Guest]: So that paper I'm presenting for the first time next week.

03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:31.960
[Guest]: And for that paper to put a graph in that paper, I was looking at LFPRs in 2000s.

03:50:31.960 --> 03:50:34.960
[Guest]: India was at about 40 some percent there.

03:50:34.960 --> 03:50:36.640
[Guest]: You know, Italy was at about 50 percent.

03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:38.160
[Guest]: So not a big gap.

03:50:38.160 --> 03:50:42.200
[Guest]: But after 2000s, India has gone down and Italy has gone up.

03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:47.360
[Guest]: Turkey, not that much difference in 2000 between India and, you know, so the level effect,

03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:50.400
[Guest]: but the trajectory has been in the opposite direction.

03:50:50.400 --> 03:50:55.400
[Guest]: So if you look at 2000s, India was low, but not so dramatically low, you know, so again,

03:50:55.400 --> 03:50:59.520
[Guest]: the social norm story will miss that, that element, because if it were the they're so

03:50:59.520 --> 03:51:05.320
[Guest]: dramatically different, why did we have India so much closer to some of the European countries?

03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:09.200
[Guest]: Admittedly, not to Scandinavia and all that true.

03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:10.560
[Guest]: But you know, so that's the thing.

03:51:10.560 --> 03:51:15.240
[Guest]: And so we have to analyze the decline, because obviously, something is happening in the last

03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:18.440
[Guest]: 15 years, that's led to the decline and that we should fix that.

03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:22.300
[Guest]: And then we have to go back to the problem of increasing the levels too, right?

03:51:22.300 --> 03:51:27.520
[Guest]: Because even at its peak, it was like 30 or 40 percent, which is not a great LFPR figure,

03:51:27.520 --> 03:51:28.520
[Guest]: right?

03:51:28.520 --> 03:51:33.200
[Guest]: So if we start working on the decline first, maybe we'll, you know, come to a point where

03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:34.960
[Guest]: we can think of the level effect.

03:51:34.960 --> 03:51:41.680
[Amit Varma]: See, I think this is an exact example of how an economist can use data in a bad way.

03:51:41.680 --> 03:51:46.800
[Amit Varma]: Now a bad economist could take the data point you just gave and conclude that what has happened

03:51:46.800 --> 03:51:51.840
[Amit Varma]: is that women from India have gone to Italy and started working there, which explains

03:51:51.840 --> 03:51:52.840
[Unknown]: the divergence.

03:51:52.840 --> 03:52:02.040
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I've done episodes on sort of a female labor force participation with Namita

03:52:02.040 --> 03:52:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Bhandare, Vishrayana Bhattacharya earlier in the year, and an extremely popular episode.

03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:08.240
[Amit Varma]: I'll link them from the show notes.

03:52:08.240 --> 03:52:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what you said about, you know, women working in family owned enterprises

03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:17.120
[Amit Varma]: and that not being recognized is resonant because a recent guest of mine on the show,

03:52:17.120 --> 03:52:19.640
[Amit Varma]: Vinay Singhal, he grew up in a village in Haryana.

03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And he speaks about how his father used to run this kirana store and a little business,

03:52:24.280 --> 03:52:28.800
[Amit Varma]: I think distributing grain or whatever, and his mother would cook for all the workers.

03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:33.160
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, she would never be recognized as part of the business, never get kind of

03:52:33.160 --> 03:52:34.160
[Amit Varma]: paid for it.

03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:37.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, she's not getting, you know, recognized for all the unpaid work she

03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:38.640
[Amit Varma]: does even.

03:52:38.640 --> 03:52:40.760
[Amit Varma]: But that's kind of how it is.

03:52:40.760 --> 03:52:41.800
[Amit Varma]: I won't.

03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:45.360
[Amit Varma]: Another fascinating phenomenon that you've written about, which I'll ask you to elaborate

03:52:45.360 --> 03:52:50.160
[Amit Varma]: upon is what we discussed earlier, the U-shaped relationship between education and employment

03:52:50.160 --> 03:52:51.400
[Amit Varma]: and the implications of that.

03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that.

03:52:53.440 --> 03:52:58.960
[Guest]: So I think overall, if you look at from the 2000s, education levels of Indian women have

03:52:58.960 --> 03:53:01.280
[Guest]: drastically risen.

03:53:01.280 --> 03:53:03.280
[Guest]: And not just in primary, secondary, but also tertiary.

03:53:03.280 --> 03:53:07.080
[Guest]: So for example, in colleges where we, you know, the spaces that we inhabit, it's not

03:53:07.080 --> 03:53:15.120
[Guest]: at all unusual to find a 50-50 or even a 60-40 classroom where 60% is female and 40% is male,

03:53:15.120 --> 03:53:18.160
[Guest]: including in subjects like economics and STEM, etc.

03:53:18.160 --> 03:53:23.700
[Guest]: So in India, actually, women's enrollment in tertiary education has dramatically increased.

03:53:23.700 --> 03:53:31.040
[Guest]: And male-female education gaps in terms of levels of education have dramatically decreased.

03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:37.640
[Guest]: The problem is that the highly educated women, which is, you know, PG and above, or illiterate

03:53:37.640 --> 03:53:42.880
[Guest]: women, the two ends of the spectrum, they work, you know, illiterate women, partly it's

03:53:42.880 --> 03:53:44.000
[Guest]: obviously a class issue.

03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:48.760
[Guest]: So they will work whatever informal work, daily wage work, whatever it is, their income

03:53:48.760 --> 03:53:51.000
[Guest]: is, you know, every day is a question of survival.

03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:52.000
[Guest]: So you have to work.

03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:54.400
[Guest]: So you'll do something to get by.

03:53:54.400 --> 03:53:58.360
[Guest]: Highly educated women, there is a market, you know, and highly educated women, labor

03:53:58.360 --> 03:54:01.840
[Guest]: force participation is also high, which is by the way, contradicts that famous income

03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:05.120
[Guest]: effect argument in which economists make.

03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:10.080
[Guest]: So but the middle level, some of it could be that they're still in school, but even

03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:15.600
[Guest]: when you take women 20 and above, which is unlikely that they're going to be in school,

03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:23.080
[Guest]: the issue is that job opportunities for girls who finish class eight or 10 or 12, even when

03:54:23.080 --> 03:54:26.720
[Guest]: you think about it in cities, there aren't those kinds of job opportunities, you know,

03:54:26.720 --> 03:54:29.760
[Guest]: so think about, say, a mobile repair shop.

03:54:29.760 --> 03:54:32.360
[Guest]: Have you ever seen a woman sitting in a mobile repair shop and doing it?

03:54:32.360 --> 03:54:33.360
[Guest]: But why not?

03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:34.880
[Guest]: You know, why couldn't she do it?

03:54:34.880 --> 03:54:40.400
[Guest]: Nowadays, I find this, I think DLF, one of the courier companies, uses women to deliver

03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:42.560
[Guest]: packages to homes.

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:44.920
[Guest]: And why is it that city women can't do that?

03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:45.920
[Guest]: They can, right?

03:54:45.920 --> 03:54:47.520
[Guest]: And obviously, DLF has taken a view.

03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:54.400
[Guest]: Drivers, they can be a whole bunch of other jobs that middle level education, women with

03:54:54.400 --> 03:55:01.680
[Guest]: middle level education can reasonably do, provided we fix the infrastructure, right?

03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:05.440
[Guest]: So recently, I used this company called BlueSmart to go to the airport.

03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:08.360
[Guest]: And there was a female driver, and I was very intrigued, so I talked to her a lot about

03:55:08.360 --> 03:55:09.360
[Guest]: it.

03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:13.040
[Guest]: And so she was saying that in Delhi, it's very difficult to get toilets to stop in the

03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:19.340
[Guest]: middle for the women in public to go to, you know, because in Gurgaon, they're non-existent.

03:55:19.340 --> 03:55:23.880
[Guest]: In Delhi, at least some petrol pumps have female toilets, Noida apparently is very good.

03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:27.480
[Guest]: So literally every kilometer, she says that we can find, you know, toilets for women.

03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:31.720
[Guest]: Now, that would be already a big disincentive, discouragement for female drivers.

03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:35.600
[Guest]: I mean, you're on the road the whole day, you know, you need a space where you can use

03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:36.600
[Guest]: the washroom, right?

03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:37.600
[Guest]: Things like that.

03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:44.320
[Guest]: So it needs a mindset to draw women into occupations that can be done with this middle level of

03:55:44.320 --> 03:55:45.760
[Guest]: education.

03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:50.520
[Guest]: And recently, I've got, you know, biggish grant from the Gates Foundation to precisely

03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:55.080
[Guest]: pilot with the private sector to work out initiatives that A, pull women into the labor

03:55:55.080 --> 03:56:01.440
[Guest]: force, but also allow them to become self-employed entrepreneurs, not just in the traditional

03:56:01.440 --> 03:56:06.820
[Guest]: beauty parlor, tailor, cook sector, but other things as well, because women are getting

03:56:06.820 --> 03:56:09.560
[Guest]: more and more educated and they can do other things.

03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:12.620
[Guest]: It's partly a question of mindset, partly a question of networks.

03:56:12.620 --> 03:56:16.240
[Guest]: And I don't know what this, how much we'll be able to do, but we are partnering with

03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:21.400
[Guest]: big private sector employers to see what solutions can be found, because we, I do definitely

03:56:21.400 --> 03:56:25.080
[Guest]: believe that the problem is solvable and I do believe that it's a demand side problem

03:56:25.080 --> 03:56:29.240
[Guest]: more than, I think, okay, let me rephrase that.

03:56:29.240 --> 03:56:33.200
[Guest]: I think that if you make big changes on the demand side, supply side will adjust itself.

03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:37.560
[Guest]: I don't think, you know, talking about the mindset thing that we talked about earlier,

03:56:37.560 --> 03:56:42.560
[Guest]: if you wait for mindsets to change inside families without any changes in the external

03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:44.660
[Guest]: economic conditions, that's not going to happen.

03:56:44.660 --> 03:56:49.060
[Guest]: So as opportunities become available, women start leaving the house, families will have

03:56:49.060 --> 03:56:52.680
[Guest]: to adjust, you know, to that situation as they did everywhere else.

03:56:52.680 --> 03:56:57.560
[Guest]: I mean, even developed countries today, take Britain, for example, it didn't have the labor

03:56:57.560 --> 03:57:00.420
[Guest]: force participation rate of women that it has today.

03:57:00.420 --> 03:57:04.780
[Guest]: It didn't have that in the, you know, early decades of the 20th century.

03:57:04.780 --> 03:57:09.100
[Guest]: Women did stay at home and they were, you know, homemakers, caregivers, etc, etc.

03:57:09.100 --> 03:57:13.760
[Guest]: But family dynamics changed as women exited.

03:57:13.760 --> 03:57:17.880
[Guest]: That's the causation, not that first family dynamics changed, then women exited.

03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:19.460
[Guest]: It hasn't happened in history.

03:57:19.460 --> 03:57:21.860
[Guest]: And I think I'm pretty sure India will be the same.

03:57:21.860 --> 03:57:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And just to clarify for the listener who may not be familiar with some of these terms,

03:57:25.840 --> 03:57:28.160
[Amit Varma]: what do you mean by supply side issues?

03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Are things like marriage, motherhood, yes, maybe there are those conservative norms.

03:57:33.400 --> 03:57:38.400
[Guest]: So these are all supply side means anything that affects women's supply of their own labor

03:57:38.400 --> 03:57:39.400
[Guest]: to the market.

03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:57:40.400 --> 03:57:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And your point is that no women want to go out and work, right, partly because of how

03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:49.800
[Unknown]: their homes are, and, you know, they've got aspirations and which human being doesn't.

03:57:49.800 --> 03:57:54.680
[Amit Varma]: So it's you solve the demand side, you kind of solve the, you know, the big side of that

03:57:54.680 --> 03:57:55.680
[Amit Varma]: problem.

03:57:55.680 --> 03:58:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So here's another question long back with three women guests, I had done an episode

03:58:00.480 --> 03:58:06.840
[Amit Varma]: called metrics of empowerment, where the question I threw at them was that if we are to kind

03:58:06.840 --> 03:58:12.200
[Amit Varma]: of get a sense of how far women are progressing or have progressed, what are those metrics

03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:13.560
[Amit Varma]: of empowerment?

03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And these ranged from serious ones, like I put forth and I'd written a column on it many

03:58:18.560 --> 03:58:23.960
[Amit Varma]: years back, which got me a lot of flack, where I said that rising divorce rates are fantastic,

03:58:23.960 --> 03:58:27.800
[Amit Varma]: because they indicate that more and more women are getting empowered to get out of toxic

03:58:27.800 --> 03:58:28.800
[Amit Varma]: relationships.

03:58:28.800 --> 03:58:32.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, and I don't remember, you know, my guests were Devika, Hamsini, Nidhi, I don't

03:58:32.760 --> 03:58:37.200
[Amit Varma]: remember what specific metrics they came up with, I think one of them was an increase

03:58:37.200 --> 03:58:43.320
[Unknown]: in men using grocery apps, you know, so things like a little out of the box and all that.

03:58:43.320 --> 03:58:48.400
[Amit Varma]: So if I can, and I can't honestly think of anyone better than you to answer this, because

03:58:48.400 --> 03:58:52.800
[Amit Varma]: you are both an expert in this subject, as well as someone who thinks out of the box.

03:58:52.800 --> 03:58:57.360
[Amit Varma]: So what are some sort of conventional and unconventional metrics that you can look at

03:58:57.360 --> 03:59:03.240
[Guest]: to say, this is a good sign, you know, this is a very contested area about how do you

03:59:03.240 --> 03:59:04.600
[Guest]: measure empowerment.

03:59:04.600 --> 03:59:07.600
[Guest]: And my first point that I'll make is that it's a process.

03:59:07.600 --> 03:59:11.920
[Guest]: It's not a, it's not a goalpost that you've reached, you know.

03:59:11.920 --> 03:59:17.040
[Guest]: So I think the first mindset is that it's an ongoing process, and it's an ongoing process

03:59:17.040 --> 03:59:18.640
[Guest]: everywhere in the world.

03:59:18.640 --> 03:59:22.520
[Guest]: You there are some, there's progress on some indicators, there's not so much as much progress

03:59:22.520 --> 03:59:24.040
[Guest]: on other indicators.

03:59:24.040 --> 03:59:29.560
[Guest]: So first things first, you know, a very simple and which I always ask in my interviews in

03:59:29.560 --> 03:59:34.240
[Guest]: my fieldwork is, do you own a smartphone which you use yourself?

03:59:34.240 --> 03:59:38.240
[Guest]: It's not like there's a smartphone in the house, which occasionally I get to use, no.

03:59:38.240 --> 03:59:42.080
[Guest]: Earlier, I used to ask, do you wear a watch, but nowadays, no one wears a watch.

03:59:42.080 --> 03:59:46.440
[Guest]: But earlier, wearing a watch was, I thought, a very nice way of, because if the woman is

03:59:46.440 --> 03:59:50.320
[Guest]: wearing a watch, that means there's something time bound that she needs to pay attention

03:59:50.320 --> 03:59:55.160
[Guest]: to, you know, and domestic work is not time bound in the same way.

03:59:55.160 --> 03:59:56.640
[Guest]: It is, I mean, roughly speaking, time bound.

03:59:56.640 --> 03:59:58.640
[Guest]: For a husband, a husband needs his food on time.

03:59:58.640 --> 04:00:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes, but not so much, like 10 o'clock, I mean, come on, it's not that much, the watch is

04:00:01.640 --> 04:00:02.640
[Amit Varma]: always at home.

04:00:02.640 --> 04:00:03.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm kidding, man.

04:00:03.640 --> 04:00:08.360
[Guest]: But if she's wearing a watch, that means she's either catching a bus or she's going somewhere

04:00:08.360 --> 04:00:12.760
[Guest]: and she needs to be back at a particular time, you know, this indicates some involvement

04:00:12.760 --> 04:00:18.200
[Guest]: in an activity that she needs to keep track of, so that, because you have to do the housework,

04:00:18.200 --> 04:00:21.400
[Guest]: whether you work outside or not, you have to do the housework, right?

04:00:21.400 --> 04:00:22.720
[Guest]: So that's one good question.

04:00:22.720 --> 04:00:25.960
[Guest]: The smartphone one is another one.

04:00:25.960 --> 04:00:27.080
[Guest]: This grocery shopping one is nice.

04:00:27.080 --> 04:00:28.080
[Guest]: I like that thing.

04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:32.400
[Guest]: But you know, all these empowerment questions also I find, in fact, I was just talking to

04:00:32.400 --> 04:00:38.040
[Guest]: two very young researchers the other day, and one of the questions that all these questionnaires

04:00:38.040 --> 04:00:43.400
[Guest]: have is, do you go to, and then there is a list of places, and then answers are alone

04:00:43.400 --> 04:00:45.960
[Guest]: with husband, etc, etc.

04:00:45.960 --> 04:00:50.280
[Guest]: And one of them, when they change it to the Indian format, they ask, do you go to the

04:00:50.280 --> 04:00:54.960
[Guest]: village fair, something, something, something, and then alone, right?

04:00:54.960 --> 04:00:56.600
[Guest]: And most women say no to that.

04:00:56.600 --> 04:01:01.920
[Guest]: And my point is that women don't want to go alone to that, not because they're afraid.

04:01:01.920 --> 04:01:08.000
[Guest]: The whole activity is a social activity, going to a fair, buying bangles, sitting on a swing,

04:01:08.000 --> 04:01:12.160
[Guest]: applying henna, all of these are social activities, and women look forward to that.

04:01:12.160 --> 04:01:13.160
[Amit Varma]: You can go with a friend.

04:01:13.160 --> 04:01:14.480
[Guest]: You can go with a friend.

04:01:14.480 --> 04:01:21.480
[Guest]: So in the West, in a way that going alone is seen as empowerment, it can be, and in

04:01:21.480 --> 04:01:28.120
[Guest]: certain contexts it is, but doing a leisure activity with other people in South Asia is

04:01:28.120 --> 04:01:31.200
[Guest]: not lack of empowerment.

04:01:31.200 --> 04:01:35.480
[Guest]: In fact, one of the things we saw in the SHG groups also, women love the fact, you know,

04:01:35.480 --> 04:01:40.240
[Guest]: I have so many videos of them singing and just, you know, that one hour that they spend

04:01:40.240 --> 04:01:43.920
[Guest]: together, they like it genuinely, you know, to be with other people.

04:01:43.920 --> 04:01:48.080
[Guest]: So you know, sometimes when you think of, I don't think we should look for these global

04:01:48.080 --> 04:01:49.240
[Guest]: metrics of empowerment.

04:01:49.240 --> 04:01:52.440
[Guest]: I know that there's a quest to do that because of comparability issues.

04:01:52.440 --> 04:01:56.880
[Guest]: But I think that some sensitivity to context and to nuance.

04:01:56.880 --> 04:02:00.720
[Guest]: And the number of times I've seen this answer saying, oh, you know, Indian women don't go

04:02:00.720 --> 04:02:01.720
[Guest]: to the Mela alone.

04:02:01.720 --> 04:02:04.720
[Guest]: We don't want to go to the Mela alone.

04:02:04.720 --> 04:02:07.800
[Guest]: The whole point about the Mela is to have fun there.

04:02:07.800 --> 04:02:09.760
[Guest]: And we want to go with our friends.

04:02:09.760 --> 04:02:11.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's not lack of empowerment.

04:02:11.640 --> 04:02:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I think the danger here is also what economists called isomorphic mimicry.

04:02:15.880 --> 04:02:24.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, I've done an episode on this with Shruti and Alex, this seems to me like a foreign

04:02:24.840 --> 04:02:29.840
[Amit Varma]: kind of mindset, which you bring here and you assume that it will still apply.

04:02:29.840 --> 04:02:31.120
[Amit Varma]: But the point is like this nuance.

04:02:31.120 --> 04:02:32.120
[Guest]: We don't want to go to the Mela.

04:02:32.120 --> 04:02:36.880
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, the question if it had been, if you wanted to go alone, would you be able

04:02:36.880 --> 04:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: to?

04:02:37.880 --> 04:02:38.880
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a different thing.

04:02:38.880 --> 04:02:41.920
[Guest]: I mean, if I supposing I really want to go to the Mela alone, I should be allowed to

04:02:41.920 --> 04:02:42.920
[Guest]: do that.

04:02:42.920 --> 04:02:48.160
[Guest]: But if I don't ever go to a Mela and you know, just take myself, me as an example, obviously,

04:02:48.160 --> 04:02:54.440
[Guest]: I'm quote unquote empowered enough to go anywhere alone, you know, but somehow it's in my head

04:02:54.440 --> 04:02:59.040
[Guest]: that when I watch a movie, particularly in the movie, I don't want to go alone.

04:02:59.040 --> 04:03:03.200
[Guest]: So I always look for a companion, not because I can't, obviously I can, but the whole fun

04:03:03.200 --> 04:03:06.040
[Guest]: of going to a Hindi movie is to be with somebody.

04:03:06.040 --> 04:03:10.720
[Guest]: And I usually look for someone who would, you know, so, you know, often nowadays my

04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:14.000
[Guest]: daughter is my companion earlier, you know, friends or whatever, but the whole point of

04:03:14.000 --> 04:03:16.000
[Guest]: it is the fun of it, right?

04:03:16.000 --> 04:03:23.120
[Guest]: So I always tell students that whenever you do make a questionnaire, first apply to yourself

04:03:23.120 --> 04:03:27.600
[Guest]: and answer all the questions yourself and then see whether the conclusions that it's

04:03:27.600 --> 04:03:33.200
[Guest]: drawing about you, you like those conclusions or not, or making major financial purchases

04:03:33.200 --> 04:03:34.600
[Guest]: alone.

04:03:34.600 --> 04:03:36.360
[Guest]: I don't do it.

04:03:36.360 --> 04:03:39.160
[Guest]: I have never made a major financial purchase alone.

04:03:39.160 --> 04:03:40.680
[Guest]: I don't want to do it.

04:03:40.680 --> 04:03:46.680
[Guest]: If I buy a TV or a fridge or a gold bangle or property, all of which I have bought, but

04:03:46.680 --> 04:03:49.340
[Guest]: I want to consult my husband, I want to consult my family.

04:03:49.340 --> 04:03:50.340
[Amit Varma]: And even I don't do it.

04:03:50.340 --> 04:03:52.800
[Guest]: I mean, these are decisions you take together, right?

04:03:52.800 --> 04:03:58.340
[Guest]: Because you are a family unit and many of these are family things to enjoy, you know?

04:03:58.340 --> 04:04:06.220
[Guest]: So I just feel like we need to be more sensitive to questions and, you know, how they are framed

04:04:06.220 --> 04:04:10.060
[Guest]: and how the question is framed will determine your answer, you know?

04:04:10.060 --> 04:04:15.980
[Guest]: So when you say alone, zero, okay, not empowered, you know, and people aggregate these zeros

04:04:15.980 --> 04:04:21.360
[Guest]: and ones and the more the number of zeros are, that's what I was telling.

04:04:21.360 --> 04:04:26.520
[Guest]: I said, no, please count alone with husband because I understand that there is a power

04:04:26.520 --> 04:04:28.440
[Guest]: dynamic between husband and wife.

04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:32.500
[Guest]: But otherwise, you know, if you just do this, otherwise there'll be so many zeros because

04:04:32.500 --> 04:04:35.420
[Guest]: there are some activities that we do do together.

04:04:35.420 --> 04:04:39.020
[Guest]: I don't think it's necessarily lack of empowerment.

04:04:39.020 --> 04:04:44.580
[Amit Varma]: And what you just said about how you advise your researchers, keep, you know, answer it

04:04:44.580 --> 04:04:45.580
[Amit Varma]: yourself.

04:04:45.580 --> 04:04:46.580
[Amit Varma]: Don't just, you know, don't just tick boxes.

04:04:46.580 --> 04:04:48.900
[Amit Varma]: Don't just blindly put the survey out there.

04:04:48.900 --> 04:04:54.020
[Amit Varma]: That gets me to again thinking aloud about how in so many professions, especially in

04:04:54.020 --> 04:04:57.740
[Amit Varma]: corporate setups, most people are going through the motions.

04:04:57.740 --> 04:04:59.300
[Amit Varma]: They don't care deeply.

04:04:59.300 --> 04:05:02.300
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, because of incentives, you're likely to find the higher up you go

04:05:02.300 --> 04:05:06.500
[Amit Varma]: in a company or a startup, the more the person is likely to care because skin in the game

04:05:06.500 --> 04:05:09.180
[Amit Varma]: and all there's more at stake and all of that.

04:05:09.180 --> 04:05:11.060
[Amit Varma]: But most people are going through the motions.

04:05:11.060 --> 04:05:12.420
[Amit Varma]: Most people are ticking boxes.

04:05:12.420 --> 04:05:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Most people are showing up for work.

04:05:14.080 --> 04:05:15.740
[Amit Varma]: It's the same old grind.

04:05:15.740 --> 04:05:21.060
[Amit Varma]: What's the scene in academia like, you know, I just from my conversation with you, I can

04:05:21.060 --> 04:05:25.780
[Amit Varma]: see how animated you are by these questions and you're thinking about every aspect of

04:05:25.780 --> 04:05:26.780
[Amit Varma]: it.

04:05:26.780 --> 04:05:30.220
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure you're the kind of person who's like dreaming of conducting surveys and papers

04:05:30.220 --> 04:05:36.820
[Amit Varma]: when you're asleep in REM sleep.

04:05:36.820 --> 04:05:42.380
[Amit Varma]: But in general, when you look at your colleagues and your associates and all that, do you feel

04:05:42.380 --> 04:05:46.940
[Amit Varma]: that there is a similar phenomenon playing out there that many people, once they get

04:05:46.940 --> 04:05:52.180
[Amit Varma]: into that particular kind of academic groove, they're just doing the thing that passion

04:05:52.180 --> 04:05:53.180
[Amit Varma]: and engagement.

04:05:53.180 --> 04:05:54.620
[Guest]: I mean, what's the scene there?

04:05:54.620 --> 04:05:55.820
[Guest]: I think it's a mixed bag.

04:05:55.820 --> 04:05:58.180
[Guest]: I think it'll be hard to sort of generalize.

04:05:58.180 --> 04:06:04.380
[Guest]: It depends a lot on location, where you are, the right institutional setting, you know.

04:06:04.380 --> 04:06:09.700
[Guest]: And again, coming back to Ashoka, I have to say that Ashoka gives a very enabling environment.

04:06:09.700 --> 04:06:13.700
[Guest]: We have a very young department, large and young department.

04:06:13.700 --> 04:06:17.460
[Guest]: And I really love the energy because all these young people are there, you know, doing different

04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:22.300
[Guest]: things and some are working on theories, some are working on data, but there's a lot of

04:06:22.300 --> 04:06:27.700
[Guest]: excitement and there's a lot of, you know, what is the word I'm looking for, vibrancy.

04:06:27.700 --> 04:06:30.700
[Guest]: That may not be the case elsewhere.

04:06:30.700 --> 04:06:36.140
[Guest]: And I think public institutions are going through a period of crisis for many different

04:06:36.140 --> 04:06:38.700
[Unknown]: reasons and in many different ways.

04:06:38.700 --> 04:06:43.900
[Guest]: But I think the, once people start to lose that intellectual curiosity and excitement,

04:06:43.900 --> 04:06:49.020
[Guest]: I think that's where the death knell, you know, like that begins the death of the, because

04:06:49.020 --> 04:06:51.460
[Guest]: at the end of the day in academics, I mean, publishing, of course, it's important.

04:06:51.460 --> 04:06:54.700
[Guest]: I mean, I also would like to publish as much as I can.

04:06:54.700 --> 04:06:56.100
[Amit Varma]: You publish so many papers.

04:06:56.100 --> 04:07:01.020
[Amit Varma]: I have not spoken to a guest who has the same frequency of papers as you do.

04:07:01.020 --> 04:07:04.220
[Amit Varma]: It's like another woman makes roti and you publish a paper.

04:07:04.220 --> 04:07:05.220
[Guest]: No, no.

04:07:05.220 --> 04:07:06.220
[Guest]: It's not like that.

04:07:06.220 --> 04:07:11.220
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you interview Kartik, they're publishing in like a thousand big, big, big journals.

04:07:11.220 --> 04:07:13.220
[Amit Varma]: Kartik is also an outlier in a way.

04:07:13.220 --> 04:07:15.220
[Guest]: He's in a different league altogether.

04:07:15.220 --> 04:07:18.220
[Guest]: He also talks to the state secretary and publishes journals.

04:07:18.220 --> 04:07:19.220
[Guest]: Forget that.

04:07:19.220 --> 04:07:24.980
[Guest]: What I'm trying to say is that I think that as a country, I think we really need to pay

04:07:24.980 --> 04:07:32.060
[Guest]: attention to this problem a great deal more than we do, which is to maintain that level

04:07:32.060 --> 04:07:37.580
[Guest]: of energy and vibrancy in institutes of higher education.

04:07:37.580 --> 04:07:46.900
[Guest]: And I think the freedom of thought, I mean, the whole academic quest is about, okay, here's

04:07:46.900 --> 04:07:47.900
[Guest]: an idea.

04:07:47.900 --> 04:07:48.900
[Guest]: Let me see.

04:07:48.900 --> 04:07:49.900
[Guest]: Maybe it'll lead to something.

04:07:49.900 --> 04:07:50.900
[Guest]: Maybe it won't.

04:07:50.900 --> 04:07:51.900
[Guest]: Maybe I'll find this.

04:07:51.900 --> 04:07:52.900
[Guest]: Maybe I'll find that.

04:07:52.900 --> 04:07:53.900
[Guest]: It's okay.

04:07:53.900 --> 04:08:00.820
[Guest]: But let me just be unencumbered and let me think of possibilities without somebody seeing

04:08:00.820 --> 04:08:05.580
[Guest]: an agenda in my work or, you know, why is she working on stunting?

04:08:05.580 --> 04:08:08.340
[Guest]: Oh, is it, you know, some hidden agenda?

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:09.340
[Guest]: No, Baba.

04:08:09.340 --> 04:08:10.340
[Guest]: There's no agenda.

04:08:10.340 --> 04:08:11.340
[Guest]: I have some data.

04:08:11.340 --> 04:08:12.340
[Guest]: I noticed a problem.

04:08:12.340 --> 04:08:14.900
[Guest]: I'm working on it, you know.

04:08:14.900 --> 04:08:21.500
[Guest]: And I think that all of us who, most of us, I would say, who analyze using data from Indian

04:08:21.500 --> 04:08:25.540
[Guest]: problems, I think all with a view to make things better.

04:08:25.540 --> 04:08:30.260
[Guest]: I don't think the attention of academics, broadly speaking, is to run any country down,

04:08:30.260 --> 04:08:31.260
[Guest]: right?

04:08:31.260 --> 04:08:34.180
[Guest]: All of us, certainly Indians living in India and Indians living abroad as well, who work

04:08:34.180 --> 04:08:38.500
[Guest]: on India, they're trying to find solutions in their own ways, in different ways.

04:08:38.500 --> 04:08:40.300
[Guest]: Often they disagree with each other.

04:08:40.300 --> 04:08:44.060
[Guest]: But as a collective, I think the academic enterprises, the collective is not trying

04:08:44.060 --> 04:08:48.540
[Guest]: to run down, you know, the country at all, you know.

04:08:48.540 --> 04:08:55.140
[Guest]: But so I think that universities are and should remain, I mean, in an ideal world, universities

04:08:55.140 --> 04:09:04.300
[Guest]: are and should remain spaces of free thought, free inquiry, disagreement, debate, you know,

04:09:04.300 --> 04:09:05.300
[Guest]: healthy.

04:09:05.300 --> 04:09:09.860
[Guest]: That's what university, I mean, I'm a university child, really, because my entire life I've

04:09:09.860 --> 04:09:13.740
[Guest]: been associated with some university or the other, first as a child of a professor, then

04:09:13.740 --> 04:09:15.420
[Guest]: as a teacher myself.

04:09:15.420 --> 04:09:17.300
[Guest]: So that's the context I know the best.

04:09:17.300 --> 04:09:21.540
[Amit Varma]: Do you say this because you worry that that is not the case or it is in threat?

04:09:21.540 --> 04:09:22.540
[Guest]: I worry.

04:09:22.540 --> 04:09:23.540
[Guest]: Yeah, definitely.

04:09:23.540 --> 04:09:24.540
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

04:09:24.540 --> 04:09:25.540
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

04:09:25.540 --> 04:09:29.660
[Amit Varma]: We have like 20 minutes of time left and you've been very generous with your time so far.

04:09:29.660 --> 04:09:33.980
[Amit Varma]: And as far as you know, your work is concerned, I just encourage all my listeners to just

04:09:33.980 --> 04:09:35.460
[Amit Varma]: go out and engage with it directly.

04:09:35.460 --> 04:09:39.060
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if we start talking about each of those subjects, like 10-10 hours of episodes

04:09:39.060 --> 04:09:43.460
[Amit Varma]: will be done and surely we will meet again and talk again on the show as you've so kindly

04:09:43.460 --> 04:09:44.460
[Amit Varma]: offered.

04:09:44.460 --> 04:09:46.180
[Amit Varma]: So a few final questions.

04:09:46.180 --> 04:09:48.260
[Amit Varma]: When was the last time you went to a fair?

04:09:48.260 --> 04:09:50.860
[Guest]: Like what do you enjoy doing in your free time?

04:09:50.860 --> 04:09:51.860
[Guest]: Really?

04:09:51.860 --> 04:09:52.860
[Guest]: When did you go to a fair?

04:09:52.860 --> 04:09:57.740
[Guest]: Well, when we, when I used to go to Rehmatpur, you know, to the village, every Thursday was

04:09:57.740 --> 04:10:06.340
[Guest]: the Haat Bazaar, so we used to go and wear bangles and there used to be a special stall

04:10:06.340 --> 04:10:09.940
[Guest]: that my grandfather would take very sweetly, would buy.

04:10:09.940 --> 04:10:12.220
[Guest]: But yeah, I really haven't been to a fair.

04:10:12.220 --> 04:10:13.980
[Guest]: I wish I had more free time than I do.

04:10:13.980 --> 04:10:18.260
[Guest]: But my sort of most favorite things to do, one is I love watching movies, you know, so

04:10:18.260 --> 04:10:21.900
[Guest]: I would love to go on for a movie whenever, always ready.

04:10:21.900 --> 04:10:25.260
[Guest]: Aaj kal toh khair OTT aa gaya hai, so you know, that's another leisure activity that

04:10:25.260 --> 04:10:26.260
[Guest]: I do.

04:10:26.260 --> 04:10:29.660
[Guest]: I go to concerts as men quite, I mean, well, not enough.

04:10:29.660 --> 04:10:34.300
[Guest]: I would like to go to more concerts than I can go to actually, but I listen to Hindustani

04:10:34.300 --> 04:10:39.900
[Guest]: vocal music is my, between Hindustani and Karnataka, it's Hindustani, between vocal

04:10:39.900 --> 04:10:41.540
[Guest]: and instrumental, it's vocal.

04:10:41.540 --> 04:10:46.860
[Guest]: This is my like, one of my most favorite genres of music, but I like instrumental as well.

04:10:46.860 --> 04:10:49.360
[Guest]: So I mean, Hindustani music, I really, really enjoy.

04:10:49.360 --> 04:10:51.340
[Guest]: So I go to concerts whenever I can.

04:10:51.340 --> 04:10:54.300
[Guest]: Again, less so now than I used to go earlier.

04:10:54.300 --> 04:10:59.900
[Guest]: Theater has really gone down since my parents left Delhi, because earlier with them, because

04:10:59.900 --> 04:11:03.620
[Guest]: my father would be always going to the theater, we would just go along with him.

04:11:03.620 --> 04:11:05.980
[Guest]: I wish I could watch more theater than I do.

04:11:05.980 --> 04:11:10.340
[Guest]: Theater and dance has gone down, I used to watch a lot of dance and, and theater, that's

04:11:10.340 --> 04:11:11.340
[Guest]: gone down.

04:11:11.340 --> 04:11:14.900
[Guest]: But music I still sort of try to keep up.

04:11:14.900 --> 04:11:15.900
[Guest]: Then what?

04:11:15.900 --> 04:11:19.740
[Guest]: I mean, I read not enough again, not, not enough time to read.

04:11:19.740 --> 04:11:25.220
[Guest]: I feel I'm so tired by the evening that I'm trying to sort of dozing off, but I'm trying

04:11:25.220 --> 04:11:26.220
[Guest]: to read.

04:11:26.220 --> 04:11:31.820
[Guest]: I picked up a Hindi book after a really long time, Rej Samadhi, Bade Saalo Baad Hindi Padh

04:11:31.820 --> 04:11:33.900
[Guest]: Rahi Hoon, Bohot Saalo Baad.

04:11:33.900 --> 04:11:36.180
[Guest]: And I didn't realize that it's a difficult book to read.

04:11:36.180 --> 04:11:40.260
[Guest]: You know, it's not written in the usual full full sentences type.

04:11:40.260 --> 04:11:44.740
[Guest]: So I'm slightly little bit reading aloud every now and then, but I'm really enjoying it.

04:11:44.740 --> 04:11:46.980
[Guest]: It's slow, the going is slow.

04:11:46.980 --> 04:11:51.180
[Guest]: Marathi reading has more or less come to a standstill, but I always, I'm, I'm an optimist.

04:11:51.180 --> 04:11:54.140
[Guest]: I always think things will change drastically.

04:11:54.140 --> 04:11:58.340
[Guest]: So I have that on my to-do list, pata nahi kabhi hoga ki nahi hoga.

04:11:58.340 --> 04:12:03.820
[Guest]: Otherwise, we travel a lot as a family and we are fond of, you know, going to places,

04:12:03.820 --> 04:12:06.020
[Guest]: we go for walks.

04:12:06.020 --> 04:12:09.700
[Guest]: Yeah, so I value leisure a lot.

04:12:09.700 --> 04:12:14.300
[Guest]: And now I'm at a stage where I'm lucky enough that I can outsource some of the domestic

04:12:14.300 --> 04:12:16.340
[Guest]: work and I have a family that's very supportive.

04:12:16.340 --> 04:12:22.620
[Guest]: So a lot of the domestic, when we were younger, things were different, but so that does leave

04:12:22.620 --> 04:12:23.820
[Guest]: me for leisure time.

04:12:23.820 --> 04:12:24.860
[Guest]: That does leave leisure time.

04:12:24.860 --> 04:12:29.940
[Guest]: And then I'm, you know, when I can, I take music lessons once a week.

04:12:29.940 --> 04:12:30.940
[Guest]: Wow.

04:12:30.940 --> 04:12:33.940
[Guest]: So when I cook, I like cooking.

04:12:33.940 --> 04:12:36.460
[Guest]: So I, cooking is a hobby.

04:12:36.460 --> 04:12:42.540
[Guest]: So I, I don't do everyday cooking now, lucky enough to be, to have reached that stage.

04:12:42.540 --> 04:12:45.660
[Guest]: But I do occasional cooking, I bake a lot.

04:12:45.660 --> 04:12:47.220
[Amit Varma]: I try different cuisines.

04:12:47.220 --> 04:12:48.220
[Amit Varma]: What's your finest dish?

04:12:48.220 --> 04:12:49.220
[Guest]: Oh my God.

04:12:49.220 --> 04:12:50.220
[Guest]: I don't know.

04:12:50.220 --> 04:12:51.220
[Guest]: You'll have to ask my family.

04:12:51.220 --> 04:12:53.740
[Guest]: I bake a lot, you know, so I...

04:12:53.740 --> 04:12:56.180
[Amit Varma]: Something baked?

04:12:56.180 --> 04:13:01.900
[Guest]: I would say, I think so, because I do a lot of different cakes and different types of,

04:13:01.900 --> 04:13:08.020
[Guest]: not a big bread expert, but I would say cakes and pies.

04:13:08.020 --> 04:13:13.180
[Amit Varma]: Does baking play into the mathematical mindset because, I mean, obviously you have the mathematical

04:13:13.180 --> 04:13:21.060
[Amit Varma]: mindset or baking, I cook, but I don't bake, in my case, because baking means everything

04:13:21.060 --> 04:13:26.500
[Amit Varma]: is precision, precision numbers, minute, this measure, that measure, while I just like to

04:13:26.500 --> 04:13:28.460
[Amit Varma]: kind of play around and mess around.

04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:31.300
[Amit Varma]: So is there something to that stereotype?

04:13:31.300 --> 04:13:34.460
[Guest]: I don't know whether it's my, I mean, first, I don't know whether I have a mathematical

04:13:34.460 --> 04:13:35.460
[Guest]: mind.

04:13:35.460 --> 04:13:38.780
[Guest]: And secondly, I don't know whether it's that, but I like the precision of baking.

04:13:38.780 --> 04:13:44.620
[Guest]: And I think that it forces you to pay attention, whereas I do a lot of Indian cooking and different

04:13:44.620 --> 04:13:45.620
[Guest]: types of cooking.

04:13:45.620 --> 04:13:51.220
[Guest]: Maharashtrian, obviously, and my husband is Bengali, so I try dabble a little bit in Bengali

04:13:51.220 --> 04:13:52.220
[Guest]: cuisine as well.

04:13:52.220 --> 04:13:54.660
[Guest]: And I've learned other states of India as well.

04:13:54.660 --> 04:13:59.900
[Guest]: But that's, you know, it's like Hindustani Gaana, which is, you know, you sort of develop

04:13:59.900 --> 04:14:03.700
[Guest]: a raga, you develop a dish, it's kind of, and many people have drawn this analogy between

04:14:03.700 --> 04:14:05.980
[Guest]: Indian cooking and Indian music.

04:14:05.980 --> 04:14:07.340
[Guest]: Baking is very precise.

04:14:07.340 --> 04:14:13.340
[Guest]: It has to be, you have to pay attention much more in baking than you do in Indian cooking.

04:14:13.340 --> 04:14:14.580
[Guest]: So it appeals to me.

04:14:14.580 --> 04:14:18.100
[Amit Varma]: When you look back on your life, what makes you proud?

04:14:18.100 --> 04:14:20.820
[Guest]: Oh, gosh, hard to answer.

04:14:20.820 --> 04:14:26.140
[Guest]: I mean, I guess none, none of it has, it's almost turned out the way because, you know,

04:14:26.140 --> 04:14:27.700
[Guest]: I thought I was going to be a doctor.

04:14:27.700 --> 04:14:29.500
[Guest]: So in a way, nothing has turned out.

04:14:29.500 --> 04:14:31.620
[Guest]: I didn't plan too much, to be honest.

04:14:31.620 --> 04:14:32.860
[Guest]: So things just kept happening.

04:14:32.860 --> 04:14:37.380
[Guest]: And you know, it's that I have two Rafi songs that are my motto songs in my life, and one

04:14:37.380 --> 04:14:41.060
[Guest]: of them is, Main Zindagi Ka Saath Nibhata Chala Gaya.

04:14:41.060 --> 04:14:47.020
[Guest]: So it's Jo Mil Gaya Usi Ko Mukaddar Samajh Liya, Jo Kho Gaya Main Usko Bhulata Chala Gaya.

04:14:47.020 --> 04:14:51.060
[Guest]: So I think that attitude helps one to adjust, you know, to whatever life.

04:14:51.060 --> 04:14:54.020
[Guest]: I think I'm, I think I like the work that I do.

04:14:54.020 --> 04:15:00.660
[Guest]: I like the fact that there's a body of work now at this age where I feel like I've begun

04:15:00.660 --> 04:15:03.780
[Guest]: to understand a little bit, some of the problems.

04:15:03.780 --> 04:15:08.300
[Guest]: I'll still say I'm on the surface, but I think it's nice to feel okay, okay, now I'm beginning

04:15:08.300 --> 04:15:10.260
[Guest]: to see a little bit of the jigsaw coming together.

04:15:10.260 --> 04:15:13.020
[Guest]: Many more dots, many more dots than anybody else.

04:15:13.020 --> 04:15:17.180
[Guest]: But, you know, that feeling is nice.

04:15:17.180 --> 04:15:19.340
[Guest]: I'm very proud of my daughter.

04:15:19.340 --> 04:15:23.260
[Guest]: So you know, it's nice to see her as an adult and nice to interact with her as an adult.

04:15:23.260 --> 04:15:27.820
[Guest]: I don't know how much of that is due to me or whether, you know, despite me, she's turned

04:15:27.820 --> 04:15:29.580
[Guest]: out to be the way she is.

04:15:29.580 --> 04:15:31.500
[Guest]: But whatever it is, it's just nice to have that.

04:15:31.500 --> 04:15:36.380
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, overall, I, you know, just fortunate to have been born into the family

04:15:36.380 --> 04:15:38.540
[Guest]: that I have born into.

04:15:38.540 --> 04:15:40.220
[Guest]: Fortunate to have married into the family that I met.

04:15:40.220 --> 04:15:44.620
[Guest]: So, you know, many, many strokes of luck, or whether all this is to be proud of or not,

04:15:44.620 --> 04:15:45.620
[Guest]: I don't know.

04:15:45.620 --> 04:15:49.300
[Guest]: Yeah, don't know whether I've answered your question.

04:15:49.300 --> 04:15:52.140
[Amit Varma]: When you wake up in the morning, what do you look forward to the most?

04:15:52.140 --> 04:15:56.740
[Amit Varma]: Like, what brings you just happiness of being in the moment?

04:15:56.740 --> 04:15:58.280
[Guest]: Usually a song.

04:15:58.280 --> 04:16:01.740
[Guest]: So I listen to something in the morning.

04:16:01.740 --> 04:16:08.180
[Guest]: And it can be anything, I just very temperamental, I mean, I'm not very consistent about whatever,

04:16:08.180 --> 04:16:13.620
[Guest]: but I do think of the music I'm going to listen to, not in a very conscious way, not in the

04:16:13.620 --> 04:16:18.340
[Guest]: very sort of list making way, but it's just like, otherwise, actually, now, one has reached

04:16:18.340 --> 04:16:24.220
[Guest]: a stage where there's lots of, lots of chota chota chota work that needs to be done, you

04:16:24.220 --> 04:16:29.060
[Guest]: know, managing projects or some administrative work related to SIDA, the center that is at

04:16:29.060 --> 04:16:31.460
[Guest]: Ashoka or some departmental email.

04:16:31.460 --> 04:16:38.380
[Guest]: So there's a lot of this sort of admin type, admini type work, which is not my most favorite,

04:16:38.380 --> 04:16:39.460
[Guest]: to be honest.

04:16:39.460 --> 04:16:41.340
[Guest]: But it has to be done, it has to be done.

04:16:41.340 --> 04:16:44.940
[Guest]: The volume of email, you know, I wake up, there's a volume of emails to write to.

04:16:44.940 --> 04:16:49.340
[Guest]: So there is, but I realized that it comes with this, you know, you can't be choosy about

04:16:49.340 --> 04:16:50.340
[Guest]: this.

04:16:50.340 --> 04:16:55.460
[Guest]: I mean, you are where you are, and so all this is a part of the territory.

04:16:55.460 --> 04:17:01.780
[Guest]: But you know, if I end the day, if I end the day on, okay, I wrote these, you know, I wrote

04:17:01.780 --> 04:17:06.060
[Guest]: this, these paragraphs, or I finished this part of the paper, or I just even wrote a

04:17:06.060 --> 04:17:10.220
[Guest]: popular article or whatever, I feel, I feel really good about that.

04:17:10.220 --> 04:17:15.300
[Guest]: So when I do, when I get original writing done, those are my best days.

04:17:15.300 --> 04:17:18.580
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful, I feel like we have a lot to talk about.

04:17:18.580 --> 04:17:22.740
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to talk about your husband for that matter, and you know, how you've influenced

04:17:22.740 --> 04:17:23.740
[Amit Varma]: each other.

04:17:23.740 --> 04:17:27.540
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to talk about your Lata Mangeshkar debate with an academic in question.

04:17:27.540 --> 04:17:30.940
[Amit Varma]: And we'll leave all of that for the next episode, unless you want to talk about any of them

04:17:30.940 --> 04:17:31.940
[Amit Varma]: briefly and now.

04:17:31.940 --> 04:17:37.780
[Amit Varma]: But the final question I'll end on, which I ask all my guests is, tell us about, in

04:17:37.780 --> 04:17:44.740
[Amit Varma]: your case, songs, music, books, films, OTT shows, whatever stuff that you love, that

04:17:44.740 --> 04:17:46.060
[Amit Varma]: just mean a lot to you.

04:17:46.060 --> 04:17:49.900
[Amit Varma]: And they may not, they may or may not have anything to do with your work, that's irrelevant.

04:17:49.900 --> 04:17:53.180
[Guest]: But just what do you, what do you feel emotionally close to?

04:17:53.180 --> 04:17:55.220
[Guest]: It's a really tough question to answer.

04:17:55.220 --> 04:18:00.740
[Guest]: Partly because I, I watch so much that I forget what I've watched.

04:18:00.740 --> 04:18:07.380
[Guest]: But I think in terms of movies that I've watched recently, which I really, which really moved

04:18:07.380 --> 04:18:08.380
[Guest]: me.

04:18:08.380 --> 04:18:11.940
[Guest]: One was this Marathi film called Disciple, which is made by Chaitanya Tamane, the same

04:18:11.940 --> 04:18:12.940
[Guest]: person who made Kote.

04:18:12.940 --> 04:18:14.460
[Guest]: Kote also, I really, really liked.

04:18:14.460 --> 04:18:15.460
[Amit Varma]: Kote was a masterpiece.

04:18:15.460 --> 04:18:16.460
[Guest]: A masterpiece.

04:18:16.460 --> 04:18:17.460
[Guest]: And I've watched it several times.

04:18:17.460 --> 04:18:20.620
[Guest]: I, I recommend it to my students in Economics of Discrimination.

04:18:20.620 --> 04:18:25.260
[Guest]: Disciple is in Sunny Music, beautiful, beautiful film.

04:18:25.260 --> 04:18:29.860
[Guest]: OTT, we tend to watch a lot of crime thrillers.

04:18:29.860 --> 04:18:32.300
[Guest]: So very much into murder mysteries and all that.

04:18:32.300 --> 04:18:36.380
[Guest]: So Line of Duty, for example, is a show that we watched recently.

04:18:36.380 --> 04:18:39.660
[Guest]: Not all, all episodes are available here, but in England, we watched it.

04:18:39.660 --> 04:18:42.900
[Guest]: Fabulous, fabulous show, Line of Duty.

04:18:42.900 --> 04:18:46.300
[Guest]: I'd missed Downton Abbey completely when it had first come.

04:18:46.300 --> 04:18:49.140
[Guest]: And I wasn't particularly keen because it was a period drama, etc.

04:18:49.140 --> 04:18:52.380
[Guest]: I said, I don't know who cares about the British aristocracy.

04:18:52.380 --> 04:18:55.860
[Guest]: But when we started watching it through the pandemic, I realized that that's just the

04:18:55.860 --> 04:18:56.940
[Guest]: setting, you know.

04:18:56.940 --> 04:18:59.300
[Guest]: But there's so much more going on in that show.

04:18:59.300 --> 04:19:00.300
[Guest]: So love that.

04:19:00.300 --> 04:19:08.300
[Guest]: Bridgerton, oh my God, Bridgerton season two was my Hindi movie lover's delight, you know.

04:19:08.300 --> 04:19:13.700
[Guest]: I mean, you know, people criticize Hindi movies for being suggestive and, you know, they would

04:19:13.700 --> 04:19:17.020
[Guest]: show two flowers meeting each other and etc.

04:19:17.020 --> 04:19:20.980
[Guest]: Bridgerton is completely that, by the way, Bridgerton season two.

04:19:20.980 --> 04:19:26.820
[Guest]: But you know, so as I say, we've perfected that art of just the suggestive.

04:19:26.820 --> 04:19:32.180
[Guest]: But the power of a suggestive romance where very little actually happens and you hold

04:19:32.180 --> 04:19:33.800
[Guest]: the tension till the end.

04:19:33.800 --> 04:19:37.020
[Guest]: For years, Hindi movies have been ridiculed for doing this.

04:19:37.020 --> 04:19:41.660
[Guest]: Bridgerton has shown the power of, you know, how fabulous that chemistry and that anticipation

04:19:41.660 --> 04:19:43.780
[Guest]: and the climax can be when that happens.

04:19:43.780 --> 04:19:44.780
[Guest]: Love Bridgerton.

04:19:44.780 --> 04:19:51.340
[Guest]: A lot of crime shows, actually Shetland, Line of Duty, then the Good Wife, what is the second

04:19:51.340 --> 04:19:52.340
[Guest]: one?

04:19:52.340 --> 04:19:53.340
[Amit Varma]: Good Wife and Good...

04:19:53.340 --> 04:19:54.340
[Guest]: Not the Good Doctor.

04:19:54.340 --> 04:19:55.340
[Guest]: I think I'm thinking of Damon Galgoot.

04:19:55.340 --> 04:19:56.340
[Guest]: Good Wife.

04:19:56.340 --> 04:20:00.260
[Guest]: And then Christine Baranski stars in the...

04:20:00.260 --> 04:20:03.860
[Guest]: It's not a sequel to the Good Wife, but a lot of the characters of the Good Wife come

04:20:03.860 --> 04:20:04.860
[Guest]: into the...

04:20:04.860 --> 04:20:10.420
[Guest]: It's much more political, actually, by the way, it's sort of anti-Trump and it's a kind

04:20:10.420 --> 04:20:11.420
[Guest]: of a continuation.

04:20:11.420 --> 04:20:12.420
[Guest]: I mean, it's the same characters.

04:20:12.420 --> 04:20:13.940
[Amit Varma]: The Good Fight?

04:20:13.940 --> 04:20:14.940
[Amit Varma]: Good Fight.

04:20:14.940 --> 04:20:15.940
[Guest]: The Good Fight.

04:20:15.940 --> 04:20:18.500
[Guest]: So Good Wife and Good Fight, both of which I liked.

04:20:18.500 --> 04:20:24.500
[Guest]: Then there's this Japanese show, Japanese BBC collaboration, Haji Giri, that we liked.

04:20:24.500 --> 04:20:27.780
[Guest]: I'm just randomly trying to remember what I liked.

04:20:27.780 --> 04:20:35.540
[Guest]: Because the one big tragedy of this sort of globalized Hindi movie format is that music

04:20:35.540 --> 04:20:39.740
[Guest]: has gone out of Hindi films.

04:20:39.740 --> 04:20:45.340
[Guest]: So Gangubai Kathiyawadi was so nice because it had songs, you know, real, real tragedy.

04:20:45.340 --> 04:20:51.340
[Guest]: I mean, Hindi film songs used to be such a fabulous genre.

04:20:51.340 --> 04:20:56.500
[Guest]: But anyway, there's enough of an archive there that one can keep on listening to.

04:20:56.500 --> 04:21:02.660
[Guest]: So I listen to, I listen to podcasts on Hindi films as well, but I also listen to just songs.

04:21:02.660 --> 04:21:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And can I trouble you to sing something as you did for my Twitter followers?

04:21:06.300 --> 04:21:09.380
[Guest]: Oh my God, after five hours, six hours of talking?

04:21:09.380 --> 04:21:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Just something soothing that you like, something that...

04:21:11.820 --> 04:21:16.420
[Guest]: So even though Lata, I'm a big fan of Lata Mangeshkar, as you know, I don't sing a lot

04:21:16.420 --> 04:21:19.300
[Guest]: of her songs because they are very difficult to sing.

04:21:19.300 --> 04:21:24.060
[Guest]: So the song that I sang there was Asha Bhosle's song.

04:21:24.060 --> 04:21:26.980
[Guest]: Let me try to sing, oh gosh.

04:21:54.860 --> 04:22:01.460
[Unknown]: Tum apne charnon mein rakh lo mujh ko

04:22:01.460 --> 04:22:07.580
[Unknown]: Tumhare charnon ka phool hoon main

04:22:07.580 --> 04:22:13.900
[Unknown]: Main sar jhukae khadi hoon Preetam

04:22:13.900 --> 04:22:20.260
[Unknown]: Main sar jhukae khadi hoon Preetam

04:22:20.260 --> 04:22:26.460
[Unknown]: Ke jaise mandir mein lo diye ki

04:22:26.460 --> 04:22:32.620
[Unknown]: Chhupa lo yoon dil mein pyaar mera

04:22:32.620 --> 04:22:40.140
[Unknown]: Ke jaise mandir mein lo diye ki

04:22:40.140 --> 04:22:43.540
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful, I feel so fortunate.

04:22:43.540 --> 04:22:48.380
[Guest]: But if you were going to make me sing, you should have done it in the beginning, not at the end.

04:22:48.380 --> 04:22:52.660
[Amit Varma]: Because my voice is... I'll remember that for next time.

04:22:52.660 --> 04:22:54.780
[Unknown]: Phir 5 ghante bas gaana hi chalega.

04:22:54.780 --> 04:22:59.540
[Guest]: I think I should get you and Kartik together because he's also a singer and he loves Antakshari.

04:22:59.540 --> 04:23:01.660
[Amit Varma]: I haven't heard him sing, you know, I should listen to his episodes where he's...

04:23:01.660 --> 04:23:04.740
[Amit Varma]: The second episode he did with me on health care, he kind of sings at the end.

04:23:04.740 --> 04:23:08.580
[Amit Varma]: And then I made him promise that we'll do an Antakshari next time.

04:23:08.580 --> 04:23:12.860
[Unknown]: But this third time when he came on, he was recovering from Covid, his throat was messed up.

04:23:12.860 --> 04:23:17.060
[Unknown]: So I think we should do an in-person Antakshari at some point in time and

04:23:17.060 --> 04:23:21.900
[Amit Varma]: make you both come to my home studio in Bombay and just have a blast.

04:23:21.900 --> 04:23:23.300
[Amit Varma]: Ashwini, thank you so much.

04:23:23.300 --> 04:23:28.020
[Amit Varma]: I'm so fortunate and honored that you gave me so much of your time and shared so many of your...

04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:30.580
[Guest]: No, thank you. This was wonderful.

04:23:30.580 --> 04:23:32.500
[Guest]: Thanks a lot for having me again on the show.

04:23:32.500 --> 04:23:34.460
[Guest]: I enjoy your podcast, as you know.

04:23:34.460 --> 04:23:35.980
