00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to live in a borderless world. By that I don't

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.120
[Amit Varma]: just mean borders between nation states like the horrendous Ratcliffe line, but also borders

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.600
[Amit Varma]: of taxonomy and categorization, which divide people and ossify traditions. What would it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.800
[Amit Varma]: be like to be an unbridled seeker, to be able to pick up your bags and go on a journey without

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.520
[Amit Varma]: worrying about visas or passport controls, to enter into dialogues with people where

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.960
[Amit Varma]: your intellectual quest is your only agenda and barriers of birth and ethnicity and class

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.040
[Amit Varma]: and identity don't matter? Well, it turns out that a few centuries ago, a man today

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.480
[Amit Varma]: known as Guru Nanak did just that. He traveled to places that are today dispersed across

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.520
[Amit Varma]: nine countries, and he traveled not as a founder of a faith as we know him today, but as a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.880
[Amit Varma]: seeker in search of truth and dialogue. Things have changed since then. Centuries have passed.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: The brutalities of history have created walls between us, not just on land, but in our hearts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.240
[Amit Varma]: and minds. In such a situation, I wonder what would happen if someone attempted to retrace

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:22.720
[Unknown]: the path of Guru Nanak? Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.440
[Amit Varma]: politics, and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to The Scene

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.080
[Amit Varma]: and the Unseen. My guest for today's show is Amardeep Singh, who was for most of his

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.840
[Amit Varma]: adult life, a fat cat MBA busy being a corporate satrap. But then he gave it up at one point

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.640
[Amit Varma]: to travel through Sikh sites in Pakistan or other Nanak Panti sites, and we'll explain

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.960
[Amit Varma]: the distinction soon, and produced two books called The Lost Heritage and The Quest Continues,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.200
[Amit Varma]: as well as two documentaries on these travels. These will be linked from the show notes.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.600
[Amit Varma]: He is now engaged in a hugely ambitious process, that of retracing the travels of Guru Nanak

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.760
[Amit Varma]: across what is today nine countries. This is all coming together in a documentary series

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.840
[Amit Varma]: called Allegory, a tapestry of Nanak's travels. Before I begin my conversation with Amardeep

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.440
[Amit Varma]: though, let's take a quick commercial break. If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the show alive. The Scene and the Unseen has been

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.600
[Amit Varma]: a labor of love for me. I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.840
[Amit Varma]: my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours as well. But while the work has been its own

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
[Amit Varma]: reward, I don't actually make much money off the show. Although The Scene and the Unseen

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.160
[Amit Varma]: has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up to the insane engagement level of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520
[Amit Varma]: podcasts. I do many many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.680
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself. Scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.720
[Amit Varma]: and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.000
[Amit Varma]: you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.360
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.960
[Amit Varma]: do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.800
[Amit Varma]: your choice. This is not a subscription. The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.880
[Amit Varma]: on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.360
[Amit Varma]: keep this thing going. sceneunseen.in slash support.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Amardeep, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Thank you Amit for giving this opportunity. Really appreciate being here with you.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.840
[Amit Varma]: Amardeep, you know, before we get started, tell me a little bit about your history and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.840
[Amit Varma]: how you came to this because I was sort of, you know, when I first heard about this project,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.760
[Amit Varma]: when we were both invited to the Vidarbha Literary Festival, a month or so ago, I presume

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.240
[Amit Varma]: you must be a professor of history or something of that sort. And then I look at your bio

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.040
[Amit Varma]: and I'm like, wait, MBA from Chicago? And, you know, what's going on?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.960
[Guest]: You know, life has its own ways of manifesting and taking you in different strands. Yes,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.320
[Guest]: it's a non-traditional path. I'm walking a path of an unstructured life today, trying

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.680
[Guest]: to give it a structure. But then I've spent, like everyone else, good 25 years of my life

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.000
[Guest]: in a structured environment of the corporate world, right? And I educated as I was studying

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.080
[Guest]: at Dune School. I did my engineering, did a University of Chicago MBA, worked at Larson

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.640
[Guest]: and Toubro, Crompton Greaves, and then gone to American Express where I spent 21 years.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.880
[Guest]: I was a regional head for Asia Pacific. All this period was a very structured life, nine

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.480
[Guest]: to five, nine to nine, you know, fall it whatever it was. You had hierarchy, structure, and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.840
[Guest]: that's what you were doing. You were one piece in the big jigsaw puzzle, that's it. And then

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.520
[Guest]: something happened in 2014. And I walked out of the corporate world, actually not knowing

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.960
[Guest]: what was going to happen in the days to come. But I walked out with a bit of an egoistic

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.400
[Guest]: attitude because my, in corporate world you do, your egos are very high and that's how

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.840
[Guest]: you succeed, right? And I walked out because my job was moving to Australia and I didn't

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.120
[Guest]: want to go, period. So I thought, you know. You were based in Singapore, you are based

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.600
[Guest]: in Singapore. Yeah. So I started from India. I was in Hong Kong and then 20 years I've

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.040
[Guest]: been in Singapore. 2014, I walked away saying that I'll, at the peak of my career in the

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: corporate world, I'll get something else. But that was not meant to be. And when I was

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.280
[Guest]: going through that process, I would be lying to myself if I would say that I was not disillusioned.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.280
[Guest]: I was heavily disillusioned. The treadmill had stopped. I was still, my mind was running

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.440
[Guest]: at the same pace and I didn't understand what was happening. In fact, for a few months I

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.480
[Guest]: was lying on my bed just looking at, observing the fan going in the one direction and trying

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.200
[Guest]: to see why it rotates in the other direction visually, right? But you didn't understand,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.600
[Guest]: right? But then now when I look at my life, we are now in 2020. So 2014, 2020, good five

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.200
[Guest]: to six years have passed by. I can rationalise now everything that has happened. But in the

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.800
[Guest]: moment there was no rationalisation. And the rationalisation now is that I'm walking on

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.480
[Guest]: an unstructured path, not knowing that the projects that are manifesting in my mind,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.240
[Guest]: we're walking those paths and giving structures to those projects because you have to do an

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.360
[Guest]: unstructured approach to get the data. The short of it all is that when I walked out,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.320
[Guest]: what people don't realise is you just can't make a change one fine day. Because you try

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.480
[Guest]: and do the change in one fine day from an MBA engineering background to presumably you're

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.200
[Guest]: thinking I'm an historian. I'm not. Neither am I an anthropologist. Neither am I. I'm

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.800
[Guest]: a, I'm a theologian, right? Neither I'm a photographer, but I'm neither I'm a videographer

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.800
[Guest]: or neither am I a filmmaker, but I'm doing all that, right? So how does that happen?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.360
[Guest]: This change will not happen one day. If it happens one day, you will be totally disoriented.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.480
[Guest]: You'll not be able to manage it. What people don't realise is the process behind it unconsciously

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.560
[Guest]: that was happening for 30 years that led you to this change on one fine day. And I can

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.300
[Guest]: now look back and see the structure in that, in that process. And I do give this message

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.240
[Guest]: to the youth is that I always say that don't follow your passion. Most of the people say

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.680
[Guest]: that follow your passion in today's world. I said, don't follow your passion. You will

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.480
[Guest]: not succeed. Create your passion. There's a huge difference between following and creating

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.280
[Guest]: because when you're following, you don't really have a structure behind it. You don't juice

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.040
[Guest]: it out. You're just following it because sake of following, you're just filling in your

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.560
[Guest]: gaps, right? When you create a passion, then you are going to become the passion. So when

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.420
[Guest]: I was in the corporate world or before that in college, I mean, I, I had this habit of

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.720
[Guest]: just picking up something. It could be anything. I was picking up history and I was just kind

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.820
[Guest]: of juicing it out at the age of 17 years. I started reading history good at five to

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.520
[Guest]: six years into the reading of history for the regions that interested me was Punjab,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.960
[Guest]: Kashmir, Afghanistan. I juiced it out. I lost interest. And then my corporate career started

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.600
[Guest]: and I got spiritually oriented. I delved into the scriptures of my own faith and then the

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.400
[Guest]: Sikh faith. And then I delved into many of the scriptures, juiced it out. Then I got

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.360
[Guest]: into music, juiced it out in four or five years. I stopped at one fine day. I had this

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.440
[Guest]: habit of just stopping at one fine day when I think the challenge.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.600
[Guest]: And when you got into music, what do you mean? I started studying musicology and then slowly

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.680
[Guest]: started playing and understanding the Granth Sahib's, you know, rock systems. So the Indian

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.900
[Guest]: classical system, then that led me to understanding the verses a bit deeper, but I just suddenly

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.560
[Guest]: stopped it in five years time. And I stopped it at a time where I lost faith in the elusive

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.440
[Guest]: divine, the big power. I lost faith because certain events that were happening in my life.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.720
[Guest]: And I always say losing faith is important because it allows you to then delve deeper

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.560
[Guest]: and then re-emerge with a new faith, which could be different. And I lost faith and I

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.080
[Guest]: found answers in Kabir's verse in Granth Sahib. You know, Kabir says, Khalak, Khalak. God is

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.000
[Guest]: in creation. Creation is God himself. So what are you looking for? What is this quest of

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest]: yours?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.640
[Guest]: When I realized that, actually, I just dropped dead everything and I picked up the camera

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.160
[Guest]: and I started appreciating the creation itself. In a short time, my photography reached a

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.440
[Guest]: certain level. And then I realized that many photographers contribute to magazines, but

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.440
[Guest]: they seldom are able to express their deeper insights, what went behind the photographs.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.160
[Guest]: So I started doing those travel writings with a deeper spiritual insights and then magazines

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.960
[Guest]: started picking them up. What I'm trying to tell you is then all these skill sets were

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.640
[Guest]: parallelly prepared while I was in the corporate world doing nine to nine job and I was doing

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.760
[Guest]: it unconsciously. And then came 2014 when I walked out because of a certain decision.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.040
[Guest]: I thought, I don't want to move to Australia. I'll stay in Singapore, not realizing that

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.840
[Guest]: that was not meant to be. The door was going to be shut. And when the door was shut, these

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.840
[Guest]: manifestations, these skills that I had acquired over layers by creating passions successfully

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.640
[Guest]: in a successful period, I would look back and I would find the next passion just behind

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.640
[Guest]: me and I would pick it up, you know, because you prepared yourself with one and you just

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.440
[Guest]: turn back and the next purpose is right behind you. You pick it up. You have built it up

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.640
[Guest]: to a level where in 2014, I just thought, let me go to Pakistan. And the story starts

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.200
[Guest]: from there that just going to Pakistan leads to where I am today.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.720
[Amit Varma]: That's a fascinating journey. And I have some related thoughts. One, of course, is I couldn't

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.120
[Amit Varma]: agree with you more about follow your passion being a dangerous piece of advice, like on

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.440
[Amit Varma]: a note totally unrelated to you. What I often find is that when people say follow your passion,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.520
[Amit Varma]: they have in, they fall for what is known as a survivor bias, that they'll see someone

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.400
[Amit Varma]: who is very successful, having followed their passion. And they don't realize that if it's

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.960
[Amit Varma]: a creative field, especially 99% of the people aren't going to be that person, they're not

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.560
[Amit Varma]: going to make it that far. And, you know, the cafes at Warsaw, which I frequent are

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.040
[Amit Varma]: full of people who have been struggling for years, even decades in the film industry here.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.520
[Amit Varma]: So I, you know, I kind of see it all around me, it's sort of dangerous advice to give.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's also fascinating how and you've described this before on how you built up to where you

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.920
[Amit Varma]: are layer upon layer. And you've just described those layers of history, photography, sort

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.800
[Amit Varma]: of musicology, and you know, which is also now another piece falls into place in terms

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.320
[Amit Varma]: of understanding your work, because in your documentaries, also, there is so much very

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.880
[Amit Varma]: interesting and apt use of music before we get to you know, you're going to Pakistan

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.120
[Amit Varma]: and how that journey for which the rest of your life seems to have been a preparation

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.680
[Amit Varma]: at that point, before we get to how that journey began, and so on. Let's take a quick diversion,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.260
[Amit Varma]: because you mentioned Kabir's phrase about, you know, the creator being in everything

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.640
[Amit Varma]: all around us. And you have also spoken in the past about how people have this misconception

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.920
[Amit Varma]: of Nanak's religion as being monotheism when it's actually monism. And what Kabir's phrase

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.160
[Amit Varma]: seems to express is also monism of a sort. Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.920
[Guest]: I think now we're getting into theology. It's an interesting point. I hear you. I hear you.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:53.520
[Guest]: I mean, I was born with nothing in my mind. I was conditioned by my society, my parents,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.960
[Guest]: what's right, what's wrong. And we all go through the process, right? And one fine day,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.960
[Guest]: you start delving into the path yourself. And then you go to ask yourself these questions.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.040
[Guest]: Am I being, have I been taught the right thing all this time? And one of the things that

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.200
[Guest]: I realized in my journeys is that Nanak has not been really understood. Nanak wrote in

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.120
[Guest]: our Indic language. He's a master of languages. The Granth Sahib, if you see, there are, people

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.640
[Guest]: think it's Punjabi. Sorry, if you know Punjabi and try to read Granth Sahib, you'll not understand

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.120
[Guest]: head or tail. It's a composite of languages from Bengal when Jaidev is writing, Namdev

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.320
[Guest]: from Maharashtra is writing, Farid from Pakpattan is writing in Pakistan. It's Seraki, it's

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.840
[Guest]: Bengali, Sanskrit, it's Punjabi. Kurmukhi is a mere script, which we confuse, we don't

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.440
[Guest]: get into it. It's an amalgamation of many languages. Kabir from UP, Bihar area is writing

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.320
[Guest]: in it. So what I'm trying to say is that when you look at this whole composite, you find

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.480
[Guest]: this has been compiled in the time of the Bhakti movement. And Bhakti movement, there

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.880
[Guest]: are two strands. One is from the Indic faith. I will not brand this into Hinduism or something

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.120
[Guest]: else because Indic faiths were bigger, right? So Indic faiths had many systems inside it.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.760
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the Darshan Shastra of the Indian philosophical system, you know,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.840
[Guest]: they have Sankhya, Yoga, Vedanta and so on and so forth. One of the branch is that everything

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.960
[Guest]: is one. And then there are many other branches, right? And everything has space. Sufism came

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.560
[Guest]: from Islam and got amalgamated within the Indus belt into what became the, Islam got

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.160
[Guest]: amalgamated and became the Islamic version of Bhakti, which is Sufism, right? So we've

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.200
[Guest]: seen all this churning happening. And Nanak walks in this land of the Indus river. So

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.280
[Guest]: Nanak is talking in his verses about various languages. And then we have the Britishers

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.280
[Guest]: who come into the India and they give us the gift of English language and they translate

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.000
[Guest]: our texts. And we today, without delving into the deeper values of our own texts, have started

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.920
[Guest]: looking at translations to define who we are. You can do it. There's nothing wrong with

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.280
[Guest]: translations, but translations have limitations. So when I've gone through all this understanding

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.400
[Guest]: of Nanak, I've not found a single book. I'm making a statement here. I've found not a

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.880
[Guest]: single book, say this, that has described in English what his philosophy truly was.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.600
[Guest]: So Nanak is always described as he was the one who founded the monotheistic religion,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.720
[Guest]: Sikhism and so on and so forth. Well, he didn't find, he didn't found anything. He just was

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: a man on quest, right? But monotheism is a concept that comes from Abrahamic faiths and

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.800
[Guest]: Abrahamic faiths being Christianity, Judaism and Islam, where they say God is one. It's

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.520
[Guest]: up there, right? There's a son of God, there's children of God, but children cannot be God.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.680
[Guest]: God cannot be children. Like what Kabir says, God is in the creation, creation is God. It's

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:44.680
[Guest]: one ecosystem. Nanak says before Onkar, he writes a numeral one. Why didn't he write

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.580
[Guest]: two? Why didn't he write something else? One cannot as a numeral and he writes numeral.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.880
[Guest]: One numeral cannot be two or cannot be three or cannot be four, right? One means one. And

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.640
[Guest]: he's emphasising that this entire Onkar is one. We are one. Ek Onkar is one ecosystem

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.760
[Guest]: and that one ecosystem primarily means you are me, I'm you, we are all one. That is not

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:14.080
[Guest]: monotheism. That's monism. And there's not a single book that says Nanak was the advocate

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.120
[Guest]: of monism. Because when you go down that path to understand Nanak, why did he put the numeral

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.880
[Guest]: one in the starting of the scripture of Granth Sahib? You understand, in the Granth Sahib

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.720
[Guest]: also there's a verse of Bhagat Ravi Das. I mean, I don't believe in any caste system,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.400
[Guest]: but we need to actually bring that in because people, that's how they understand. Now Ravi

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:38.040
[Guest]: Das was a chamar, but yet he had profound verses. And he says, what's the difference

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.320
[Guest]: between you and me? He's asking a question. Now it can be you Amit and me, or it could

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:50.400
[Guest]: be the divine in me. Gold and the bracelet, substratum is the gold. The bracelet is a

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.760
[Guest]: form or Jal Tarang, you know, waves on the base ocean. There's no difference. So Nanak

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.480
[Guest]: is an advocate of monism. And that's the piece that has been not understood. I think that's

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.040
[Guest]: the piece that you were asking about. So Kabir voices the same thing. Ravi Das voices the

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.600
[Guest]: same thing. Farid voices the same thing. And that's why Nanak consolidated all their voices

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.520
[Amit Varma]: into the scripture that became Granth Sahib. And it's also, you know, picking up from what

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.680
[Amit Varma]: you said, it's also very interesting. And something I've discussed in previous episodes

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.640
[Amit Varma]: with Manu Pillay and Madhvi Menon, among others, something that Sanjay Chakraborty has written

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.460
[Amit Varma]: a very good book called The Truth About Ourselves, which is that what we think of as Hinduism

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.400
[Amit Varma]: is actually Brahmanism. It's a very ossified version of it, just one belt of it. And you

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.160
[Amit Varma]: know, you correctly spoke of it as the Indic religions or the Indic traditions. And what

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.840
[Amit Varma]: essentially happened was that when the British came here in an effort to understand this

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.280
[Amit Varma]: deeply complex universe that they had thrown themselves in of, you know, our subcontinent,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:58.240
[Amit Varma]: they created simplifying narratives, often with the help of the local elites, who obviously

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.840
[Amit Varma]: pushed what suited them. So you suddenly had a certain version of Hinduism, which is more

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.040
[Amit Varma]: like Brahmanism with an ossified view of the caste system, a very simplistic varna kind

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:14.080
[Amit Varma]: of thing. Thrust in and the tragedy is that today we look back at that as if that is Hinduism

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.560
[Amit Varma]: and as if that is a definitive truth. While the truth is that many of the Britishers who

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.600
[Amit Varma]: created these narratives not only knew very little, but someone like James Mill hadn't

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.800
[Amit Varma]: even been to India at the time he wrote what has now become a foundational text about India

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:34.360
[Amit Varma]: for us through kind of osmosis. And, you know, and in a sense, I find that that has also

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.520
[Amit Varma]: happened in the popular consciousness with Sikhism, whereas people now think of Sikhism

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.080
[Amit Varma]: as something different from Hinduism or something completely apart and the truth is, and I found

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.240
[Amit Varma]: out the beautiful metaphor of this in the Indus belt in the Indus River, which you have

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.640
[Amit Varma]: described as a place where faiths melted into each other, you know, tell me a little bit

00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.240
[Amit Varma]: more about sort of the culture of that belt and how like you point out Sufism, Bhakti,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.960
[Amit Varma]: what we'll talk about later as Nanak Manthi are all part of the same traditions.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:12.120
[Guest]: Yeah, so the Indic belief systems had the beauty of coexistence of varieties of thoughts.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.120
[Guest]: Rather than giving my understanding of it, let me quote you the source because primary

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.800
[Guest]: sources cannot be disputed, right? And I'll give you two quotes. Let's start with Kabir

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.640
[Guest]: himself, who finds, I mean, Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scripture, is the largest repository

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.960
[Guest]: of Kabir's writings. Bijak comes much later. That's the place which is the largest repository.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.640
[Guest]: And Kabir says a very interesting thing. So you brought in the Indus. So I'm going to

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.400
[Guest]: make a statement and bring Indus inside that. Kabir says, Hindu, Turak, Dohu ko samjao.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.920
[Guest]: I'm explaining to both Hindu and Turak. Okay, so let's step back for a moment. Why is he

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.960
[Guest]: not saying Hindu, Musalman, Dohu ko samjao? If he's talking about religions, then he should

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.160
[Guest]: say Hindu, Musalman, Dohu ko samjao. He's saying Hindu, Turak, Dohu ko samjao. Now today's

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.240
[Guest]: context when I use the word Turak, the present generation immediately gravitates to Turkey

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.120
[Guest]: and I say, you just got it wrong. Turkey is a nation in the modern state, right? Turak,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.640
[Guest]: Babur was a Turak, right? Lodi was a Turak. Turak is a civilization that had its unique

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.120
[Guest]: characteristics that existed on the west of the Sindhu River Indus. There was a civilization

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:25.360
[Guest]: that existed on its east. So Sindhu River was a defining boundary where two cultures

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.640
[Guest]: met. And of course, when you meet, you amalgamate, right? So what are the peculiarities of the

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.480
[Guest]: two cultures? Let's start with language. On the west of it, it's language from right to

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:44.780
[Guest]: left. On the east of it, it's left to right. 180 degrees. On the west of it, it's monotheism.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.800
[Guest]: It's an Abrahamic faith. There's only one God and God cannot be creation. All right.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.760
[Guest]: Come on the east of it. There's a potpourri of belief systems and everything can coexist,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.040
[Guest]: the Indic belt. And therefore people get confused. Monotheism is also a part of it, but it's

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.400
[Guest]: a subset of it. Monism is also a part of it. Multitudes are also a part of it, but that's

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.480
[Guest]: the Indic belt. And to understand that, let me pick up the second verse from Nanak himself.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:21.800
[Guest]: He says, chhe ghar, chhe gur, chhe updesh. What is this six? If you delve into the Indic

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.720
[Guest]: Darshan Shastra, the philosophical system, the philosophy system of the Indian subcontinent,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.080
[Guest]: you'll understand the Darshan Shastra classifies our historically, the old philosophical system

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.800
[Guest]: into six pillars, right? I'll not get into depth of it, but it's divided into six pillars.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.360
[Guest]: And it's a depth of study of six pillar system, right? Chhe ghar, there are six philosophical

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.400
[Guest]: systems. Chhe gur, unke chhe guru hai. Chhe updesh. Each philosophical system has a different

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:51.200
[Guest]: updesh. One is monism inside it. Chhe ghar, chhe gur, chhe updesh. Then he says, gur gur

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:59.400
[Guest]: eko. Guru ka guru eki hai. Gur gur eko, ves anek. Ves anek hai. Then he says, he gives

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:07.200
[Guest]: his final line in that. Chhe ghar, chhe gur, chhe updesh. Gur gur eko, ves anek. Baba je

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.360
[Guest]: ghar karte keerat hoi. Karta jo, uski keerat, uski sifat sala ho. Praises. Chhe ghar, whichever

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.400
[Guest]: home, so ghar lakh vada hi tohi. Wohi ghar vada hai, wohi vada hai. So what he's saying

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.180
[Guest]: is accepting everything. Nanak is accepting everything. But what he's saying is a profound

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.560
[Guest]: statement of the bhakti culture that was emerging at the time when Nanak walked with Baba Farid

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:33.760
[Guest]: 250 years before him. Jaidev in Bengal, Namdev here in Mirashtra. They were all somehow getting

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.920
[Guest]: connected and they were the proponents of the bhakti system. So he's talking about,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.160
[Guest]: in this Indic system, all was coexisting. That's what I'm trying to say. So he's talking

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.800
[Guest]: about Kabir who's defining a boundary and Nanak who's defining what the East was really.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.940
[Guest]: Now when you put this whole thing together, Indus is a defining point. And on this side,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.440
[Guest]: you had many systems that could co-exist. But when you bring in boundaries around it

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.600
[Guest]: and you bring in utilisation of a faith for the benefit, that's where Brahmanism starts

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.960
[Guest]: coming by. Now Brahmanism has been opposed in the Indian context by many faiths or many

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.680
[Guest]: belief systems. Buddha did that. Mahavir did that. Kabir did that. Any bhakt did that.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.360
[Guest]: Nanak did that. So they were all opposing this ownership or that God can be only reached

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: through me, the concept of Brahmanism. So these Indic religions had a co-existence.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.640
[Guest]: And what the Sindhu belt basically did was when the Turki people started coming in, if

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.200
[Guest]: you go to UP, you'll find where two cultures, the Hindi and the Islamic aspect, they use

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: two words, Saptah and Haftah. Saptah becomes Haftah because in the olden times, in the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.320
[Guest]: Persian, Sa is pronounced as Ha. So Sindhu became Hindu. When the Turkic civilisations

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.760
[Guest]: came to the defining point of Sindhu, Sindhu became Hindu. On that side was a different

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.960
[Guest]: culture which they were coming to assimilate into. I don't use the word conquer. There's

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.320
[Guest]: nothing as conquering. Boundaries were not there. They were coming in to assimilate.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.040
[Guest]: There were tugs of war happening in terms of faith, in terms of assimilations. Many

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.520
[Guest]: things happened in this thing. So they were assimilating here and they saw a different

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.800
[Guest]: culture and that's why the word Hindu came in. And I will just say one thing that I've

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.120
[Guest]: observed, you know, these are my own observations. When the earliest migrations of a lot of Punjabis

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.720
[Guest]: happened towards US, if you see the newspapers in the California belt, what they say, I'm

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.400
[Guest]: not, I'm not saying Sikhs are Hindus or Hindus are Sikhs or I'm not going to do all that

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.040
[Unknown]: discussion. I'm just telling you what I've observed. The papers say Hindus are coming

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.800
[Guest]: to America. Are they all Sikhs from Punjab coming in turban wearing Sikhs, right? What

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:42.160
[Guest]: I'm trying to say is that, yes, in the early days, the Hindu in the Indic belt was not

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.480
[Guest]: a defined religion as we are calling it today. Today, it's become a defined structure. You

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.640
[Guest]: got to take the word Hindu as coming from Sindhu river as people on the Indic side living

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.320
[Guest]: here. I think that's something very hard to digest today when you bring it in. A lot of

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.600
[Amit Varma]: people don't like it. And what strikes me is that on the one hand, there is a happenstance

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.560
[Amit Varma]: of colonialism and the British trying to keep the narratives which are convenient for them

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.960
[Amit Varma]: because it fits in with their whole tactical policy of divide and rule. So it works like

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.760
[Amit Varma]: that. But on the other hand, we also find this natural impetus within faiths themselves

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.080
[Amit Varma]: to sort of ossify in certain directions. For example, one, you've got the separation, this

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.640
[Amit Varma]: separation in people's minds of Sikhism from the other broader traditions that they were

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.160
[Amit Varma]: once considered to be part of. And on the other hand, you have, for example, the movement

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.320
[Amit Varma]: of Hinduism towards Brahmanism, which itself seems a political movement. And even within

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.840
[Amit Varma]: Sikhism, you know, the Khalsa strand of it taking prominence and therefore some of the

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:48.000
[Amit Varma]: other diversity with among Nanak's followers somehow kind of disappearing. Why do you think

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
[Amit Varma]: there is this tendency? Is it something inevitable? Is it going to happen to all intellectual

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.120
[Amit Varma]: traditions that you develop your own dogmas and customs and rituals and then they get

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.160
[Amit Varma]: ossified and then that defines a religion instead of being merely one expression of

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.160
[Guest]: it?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.140
[Guest]: No, I think any faith goes towards defining of a boundary. That's a natural process that

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:15.720
[Guest]: happens, right? So there's no faith that's excused from it. But in the context of Nanak

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.280
[Guest]: and his believers, one needs to put a bit of a historical context to it. When he walked

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.440
[Guest]: the path along the Indus belt, so he travelled far and wide, but his major influence was

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:32.440
[Guest]: in the Indus belt because I have walked the Indus belt from Kashmir in Pakistan side,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.480
[Guest]: right down till Sindh, Balochistan, through Pakistan's Punjab and Khyber. And we can talk

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.620
[Guest]: about my works later on, but I can confidently say probably in seven decades, I'm the first

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.920
[Guest]: one to have walked so deeply inside, definitely more than 180 cities and villages. And I've

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.760
[Guest]: seen strands of cultures that are still living there. I've been into Afghanistan, I've filmed

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.420
[Guest]: in Afghanistan and I've seen strands of surviving cultures. There are very few people left,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.560
[Guest]: but there was a thriving culture that was there till 30 years back. The war has disrupted

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.160
[Guest]: everything and there are only about 850, what I call as the Nanak Panthis left there. The

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.320
[Guest]: only point I will try and make is the moment you move from the India or the Punjab of India

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.280
[Guest]: and move towards the Indus belt in Pakistan and go down to Sindh, Balochistan, and then

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.800
[Guest]: go into Afghanistan, the one thing that you find in the people still who are living there

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.460
[Guest]: is that Nanak is an integral part of the entire non-Islamic society, which is a very interesting

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.280
[Guest]: observation because when you look at it today, in the context of where the believers of Nanak

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.680
[Guest]: are in India, so there were two strands and 47 people came here and for whatever reasons,

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.440
[Guest]: the boundaries kind of got restricted. A lot of people still believe in Nanak, they go

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.640
[Guest]: to the Gurdwaras and all, everything. He's there in people's heart, but I don't think

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.720
[Guest]: people are really understanding his philosophy, right? So it's just become another idol or

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.520
[Guest]: another worship factor, but people aren't getting the depth of it. And then the Sikhs

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.300
[Guest]: have now become the only kind of perceived followers of Nanak. But when you go into the

00:26:53.300 --> 00:27:00.760
[Guest]: Indus belt, you find Dada Rewa Chand, Bansri Lal, Santosh Kumar, Santokh Singh, Ram Singh,

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.400
[Guest]: all followers of Nanak. And then you go into Afghanistan, the boundary of distinction between

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.720
[Guest]: Hinduism, Sikhism, as we define in India, is not there. Now, when I look at that, so

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.200
[Guest]: then I ask myself, I've read about these things because when you read the Persian sources

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.400
[Guest]: after Nanak, before the emergence of Khalsa, I'm not trying to demean anything, Khalsa

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.680
[Guest]: emerged for a reason, there was a need for there, right? But till then, the Panth was

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.800
[Guest]: in the Persian sources known as Nanak Panthi. The Persians are writing about the Panth of

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.640
[Guest]: Nanak. Yes, in that Panth, there were many strands, many strands were there. Sutra Shahis,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.280
[Guest]: the Udasins, the many other strands were there. And then came the Khalsa strand. There was

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:42.760
[Guest]: a reason for that. It saw its glorious chapters. But somehow, the factors in my understanding

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.280
[Guest]: which have caused disruptions are a culture that was existing along the Indus belt where

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.720
[Guest]: the faiths were amalgamating. And I see that in Sindh, there are Darbars, and then there

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.120
[Guest]: are Gurdwaras. And you see, you know, there's a lot of syncretic aspect coming in.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:01.440
[Guest]: 1947 is a point of deflection. I would say, if you take the whole landmass, what you see

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.440
[Guest]: today as Punjab in India, is only about less than 5% of the entire landmass of the Indus

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.920
[Guest]: civilization where our forefathers came from. The Nanak's believers were right from Kashmir

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.560
[Guest]: down to Sindh, Balochistan. And that 95% of the land went away. And one fine day, you

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:23.920
[Guest]: were thrust into a new land, and you got disseminated into Maharashtra, into Tamil Nadu, into UP.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.160
[Guest]: My father from Kashmir landed into UP. And I've seen my own family's people, you know,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.480
[Guest]: the first obvious thing is you kind of, your generation becomes quiet because they've experienced

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.040
[Guest]: a holocaust, right? You become quiet. Second generation becomes confused because you were

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.880
[Guest]: quiet first. Second generation, the information is not passed on, you become confused. Third,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.760
[Guest]: it's lost totally. And some of them, islands get up and they start probing these questions,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.440
[Guest]: some of them. And I see myself as one of those islands. But when I look around, what I see

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:58.440
[Guest]: is that the dissemination of the people into a wider society resulted in a need for assimilation

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.440
[Guest]: and acceptance. It's natural phenomena, right? You look different, your faith is different.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.080
[Guest]: Here's a different, there's civilizations along river belts. And the two major civilizations

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.840
[Guest]: in the North India was the Indus belt and the Gangetic belt. Gangetic belt had a Hinduism

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.040
[Guest]: which was more, the Indus belt from the times of Nanak, Baba Farid and others, had moved

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.440
[Guest]: towards more bhakti tradition. And that's where the caste system was being shunned.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.080
[Guest]: The equality between men and women was being talked about. It was being talked about the

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:34.120
[Guest]: equality between faiths. Nanak was saying, na ko Hindu na musulman. It is very differently

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.360
[Guest]: inherently from the Gangetic belt. And then these people are thrust into this belt. Now

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.480
[Guest]: you are on the fringe as yet in terms of faith system, because only a few years had passed

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.760
[Guest]: by since Nanak and this uprooting happens. So as you land there, the generation starts

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.560
[Guest]: assimilating. I think that's what has caused a lot of moving away because people are confused.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.960
[Guest]: People don't understand. We've not done the passing of the philosophical message. That's

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.400
[Amit Varma]: caused the distancing, I think. So, you know, I have a couple of follow up questions on

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.960
[Amit Varma]: this. But before we get to that, you know, I've heard you speak about an encounter you

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.160
[Amit Varma]: had with someone from the Udasin faith in Bihar, which you said moved you greatly and

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.920
[Amit Varma]: moved me as well when you told that story. So, you know, why don't you tell us?

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.920
[Guest]: Well, you see, there was there was many traditions that I said were in the strands in the Nanak

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.360
[Guest]: Panthi culture. And what's right or wrong, I will not get into because, you know, now

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.440
[Guest]: I'm getting into the realm of faith, you know, and people have opinions. So to the viewers,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.240
[Guest]: I'll humbly request that don't pass judgments, because I'm only talking from what I've observed

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.480
[Guest]: in my works. We've not talked about my works as yet. But so I don't know if people have

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.960
[Guest]: the context of what I've generated. But for my works, when I really walked the paths,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.200
[Guest]: and I observe a lot of things where it takes me and transports me back into time. And when

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.680
[Guest]: they were in the Sikh history, when the Sikhs were facing the persecution, right, the Khalsas

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.000
[Guest]: were facing a persecution in the Punjab after the weakening of the Mughal Empire in the

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.680
[Guest]: period wherein Nader Shah invades, Ahmed Shah Dali invades eight times. In that period,

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.000
[Guest]: it's a very, very dark period of Sikh history, because there was a reward for a Sikh's head

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.280
[Guest]: in the lands of Punjab. So the one who would swear to wear a turban and be distinctly visible

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.960
[Guest]: had a reward on his head. Sikhs were living in jungles that time, they were doing guerrilla

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.120
[Guest]: tactics, right. And in that period for the defence, the Sikh community cannot forget

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.480
[Guest]: that the broader Nanak Panthi culture, the non-Khalsas took care of their shrines, their

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.840
[Guest]: places. And I say it's not there in the Sikhs, it was ours. It was of the every strand that

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.280
[Guest]: was there in Punjab, they were believers of Nanak. It was our collective composite culture,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.520
[Guest]: right. So the Udasi sect did do a lot of contribution. They managed the sites in the time when they

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.760
[Guest]: were not being persecuted because they didn't look like Khalsas, right. But the way history

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.400
[Guest]: moved on and with the definition of the boundaries of who a Sikh is in the modern context, which

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.120
[Guest]: happened about 100 years back, it's a different topic altogether. But when you define something,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.560
[Guest]: right or wrong, I'm not going to get into that. But if you define something, you also

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.680
[Guest]: define what you are not, you know. So defining has a negative side to it also. You also define

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.280
[Guest]: who you are not. And when you start defining yourself in terms of black and white, you

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.920
[Guest]: also define who the others were not, right. I think that led to a bit of distancing. So

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.400
[Guest]: the over a period of time in 100 years, the Udasi culture moved away. And I was moved

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.760
[Guest]: because I did meet one of the, in my filming of the Allegory of Tapestry of Guru Nanak's

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.000
[Guest]: travels, I try and go into a lot of these strands of the past where the broader believers

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.600
[Guest]: of Nanak. To understand Nanak, you cannot understand him from Gurdwaras alone. There

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:29.680
[Guest]: is space for Gurdwaras. But Nanak was travelling to Sufi sites, Hindu sites, Islamic sites,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.720
[Guest]: Jogis, where they were meeting. And therefore, you have to get into every place where he

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.320
[Guest]: had been. So when I go into those places, I meet lots of different kinds of people.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.600
[Guest]: I make an effort to even go to Kanfatta Jogis, because he was having dialogues with the Siddhs.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.280
[Guest]: So I have to now in 550 years later on in his lifetime, I have to also interact with

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.200
[Guest]: them. So when I interact with the Udasi order in Bihar, I mean, this person interestingly

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.240
[Guest]: made a very interesting statement. He said, unfortunately, the way things have gone, we

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.200
[Guest]: have been ousted from the faith. And he was hesitant to speak about Nanak. And I said,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.520
[Guest]: you know what, you've got Nanak all over your Dera. Why won't you speak about it? And he

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.240
[Guest]: says, because we've been ousted. And then he said a very interesting statement. He says,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.160
[Guest]: all right, you make a judgment that we do this XYZ. Look into your own self. Don't you drink?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.640
[Guest]: Don't you do this? Don't you do that? And then you pass a judgment on us. And you've ousted us.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.520
[Guest]: And he says, had you not ousted us, you know, what my vision as a youth was, when I was a 15

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.280
[Guest]: year old child, and I became an Udasi, all throughout my life, I was wanting to take

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.520
[Guest]: Nanak's philosophy into every temple of India, because it's the most important philosophy of

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.240
[Guest]: oneness. But then when I heard him, I said, yeah, I mean, this guy is saying right. So if I don't

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.720
[Guest]: have any religious objectives behind it, and no agenda, then just look at it objectively as to

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:50.240
[Guest]: what a person says, it makes you think. I'm no one to pass judgments on history, but it is what it

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.640
[Amit Varma]: is. And you know, it strikes me looking at Nanak as a layman, it seems that rather than think of

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.720
[Amit Varma]: him as the founder of a specific religion, which is distinct from all others, he seems to be more

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.680
[Amit Varma]: a figure like Kabir, that even if you're not a follower necessarily, like I'm an atheist,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.800
[Amit Varma]: but reading Kabir always moves me. And I find Nanak to be a similar kind of figure. Is that

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.800
[Guest]: something you would agree with? Absolutely. All the Bhagats were the same. The thing is,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.120
[Guest]: Nanak is absolutely, Kabir, Nanak, Jaidev, all of them are absolutely, Baba Farid, they're all

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.760
[Guest]: aligned. They're all profound Bhagats who were talking about oneness, trying to reform the

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:38.560
[Guest]: society. You find appeal in Kabir, I find it too also, right? But then I ask many a times,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.640
[Guest]: you being a Punjabi origin, how deep have you gone into Nanak? And we're not trying to compare

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.800
[Guest]: two individuals, each to themselves. They're both powerful people, right? But how many times have

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.840
[Guest]: you gone to Nanak? Now, I know the answer would be much lesser, right? And I as a follower of

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.720
[Guest]: the Granth Sahib have delved into both. And I've always asked this question as to why would you,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.520
[Guest]: who was also from the composite culture of Sindh belt, the Sindhu river belt, the Indus belt,

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.120
[Guest]: when your forefathers were actually revering the entire composite culture of the Granth Sahib,

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.080
[Guest]: where all these Bhagats were there, why would you not be reading Nanak so much? That makes me

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:19.680
[Guest]: then question is that have we created a boundary so hard around the practices that Nanak has become

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.720
[Guest]: inaccessible, his verses have become inaccessible? I think that's what has happened. Otherwise,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.400
[Guest]: there's no reason why Nanak's verse should not be sung by any other person who sings Kabir's verse.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.400
[Guest]: But rules, regulations and other things have made it hard now. Now, again, not trying to say what's

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.400
[Guest]: right or wrong because we're getting into the realm of religion, but purely from his verses and

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.800
[Guest]: his verses and his meaning, it's an unfortunate outcome that's happened. We can't blame anyone

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.440
[Amit Varma]: else but ourselves. Another sort of interesting thing that you were pointing out when we had,

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:53.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, coffee before this recording is how Sikh history has often been elided and, you know,

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.080
[Amit Varma]: not given adequate attention on either side of the border after partition. Tell me a little bit

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.360
[Guest]: about, you know, sort of why that has happened. So your question about history, just a bit of a

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:09.040
[Guest]: background for the viewers, is that the work that I've done, my two foundation works, is first in

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.040
[Guest]: the book called Lost Heritage of Sikh Legacy in Pakistan. Second one is The Quest Continues Lost

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.800
[Guest]: Heritage of Sikh Legacy in Pakistan, in which I've mapped the remnants of the Sikh legacy across 126

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.920
[Guest]: cities and villages in Pakistan, across Baltistan, Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh and

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.840
[Guest]: Balochistan. Of course, I've been very passionate about documenting for posterity and that's why

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:36.400
[Guest]: I've taken so much of risk to walk so deep inside, probably as a first person of non-Pakistan origin

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.720
[Guest]: because my parents were from that area. I walked deep inside and I was able to get this documentation

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:46.320
[Guest]: done. But in the process, as I released my first book, I remember there was a history teacher,

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.440
[Guest]: history professor sitting in the Delhi release, a non-Sikh, and she actually made an interesting

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.720
[Guest]: point. And she said, Amarty, what you've just shared with us is absolutely right. And I,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.560
[Guest]: as a history teacher, can validate this because in the Delhi University, we only make a passing

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.560
[Guest]: mention of the Sikh history, which is limited to Sikh gurus and a brief mention of Ranjit Singh

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.920
[Guest]: and that's it, brief. And you make me think as to why don't we delve deeper? And the answer to that

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:18.240
[Guest]: question of hers or the thought of hers was, I said, I have thought about this myself too. And I

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.080
[Guest]: feel that my community is a cucumber between the sandwich. And when I say my community, I'm talking

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.640
[Guest]: about the wider context, not just the Khalsa. Every Punjabi who got uprooted, every Sindhi who

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.880
[Guest]: believes in Nanak who got uprooted, cherished the valour. Every family of Punjab would have the

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.240
[Guest]: eldest son as a Sikh, right? They cherished it. That's why, right? They used to have them in the

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:43.440
[Guest]: past. So my answer to that was that we are a cucumber in the sandwich because I feel in India,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.200
[Guest]: not that it's officially said, but I feel we don't teach the Sikh history because 80%

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.440
[Guest]: of the glorious chapters churned in the lands that became Pakistan in 1947. And that is not our land.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.400
[Guest]: The great empire of Ranjit Singh and so on. 80% of the glorious chapters right up till Afghanistan

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.280
[Guest]: border, Jamrod Fort where Hari Singh Nalwa died. After 1000 years of invasions, he plugged

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.360
[Guest]: the further invasions through the Khyber Pass. No other invasion has happened thereafter. British

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.880
[Guest]: came from the other side, didn't come from Khyber Pass. But Hari Singh Nalwa is the deciding point.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.120
[Guest]: He plugged it. But that history doesn't find any place in India because it's a history that

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.360
[Guest]: churned in the lands that became Pakistan, which is no more part of India. And when I walk in

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.520
[Guest]: Pakistan, the history books do not mention the Sikh history period. There's a silence around it.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.200
[Guest]: And I've seen the Punjab University books in Lahore, university books, two volumes. They talk

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.240
[Guest]: about the demise of the Mughal empire, the coming of Nader Shah Ahmad Shah Abdali, and then comes

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.800
[Guest]: the advent of British. The entire period of the Sikh chapters is silent. And you look at that,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:50.240
[Guest]: and you wonder why. And then I think it's because it's a period after 1000 invasion where the ruler

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.600
[Guest]: of the state was not a Muslim. Now, it was a very secular empire. Ranjit Singh was a very secular

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.400
[Guest]: person because more than 50% of his forces were Muslims. His foreign minister was a Muslim. So

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.520
[Guest]: many brave generals of the Muslim faith actually died defending his empire. And yet he doesn't

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.800
[Guest]: find a mention because he is not a believer of the Islamic faith. So it doesn't find mention

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.360
[Guest]: in Pakistan, it doesn't find a mention here. And that to me is the unfortunate thing that our

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.160
[Guest]: community, therefore, I feel very passionately that if we don't write and protect our history

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.400
[Guest]: in terms of visual remnants and other things, how will my next generation remember? How will we

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.040
[Guest]: revive those art, architecture, cultural footprints from these various strands that I see across in

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.520
[Guest]: the remnants in Pakistan? It's important to bring that perspective into these documentations so that

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.000
[Guest]: we don't lose those strands. And that's why I've been actually dedicating myself onto this path.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.600
[Amit Varma]: And this also sort of reminded me of, you know, you've written about how Guru Arjan

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.280
[Amit Varma]: got Sam Iyam Mir of Lahore to lay the foundation of the Golden Temple at Amritsar. And how later

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.160
[Amit Varma]: when Guru Arjan was sort of imprisoned by Jehangir before he was eventually executed,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Sam Iyam Mir and Vazir Khan got together to petition for his release, which kind of shows

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.400
[Amit Varma]: how, you know, there was so much sort of syncreticism in it and the differences between

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.120
[Amit Varma]: these religions and his people weren't as ossified and hard coded as it seemed to be today. And you

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.200
[Amit Varma]: mentioned earlier families where the tradition was that, Hindu families where the tradition was that

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.000
[Amit Varma]: the first child would be a Sikh. And I'm told my own family was one of those. So the practice stopped

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.280
[Amit Varma]: a generation ago, which is kind of fascinating. And all of this comes because of, you know,

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.800
[Amit Varma]: that phrase that both of us have used, and I want you to talk about a bit more, which is

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Nanak Panthi. You know, you've pointed out, and we'll talk about your, you know, travels through

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan after this, but you've pointed out that people often have a misconception of how many

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Sikhs there are in Pakistan. The cookie cutter answer, as you've said, is 12 or 13,000 from the

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:47.440
[Amit Varma]: 1500 who were left after partition. But your answer is that if you don't define the followers

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:53.200
[Amit Varma]: of Nanak as Sikhs, and you look at what you call Nanak Panthis, there are many, many more than that.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.800
[Guest]: Yeah, that's true. I mean, I'm often always asked this question. And I think Pakistan does not

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.200
[Guest]: understand this context of the Indus Belt. Sikhs themselves are ignorant of it now. So they tend

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.200
[Guest]: to see only the Khalsa count, people who are turban wearing like me, and I'm a proud adherent

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.200
[Guest]: of the Khalsa tradition. That's my culture. That's my background. But I'm no one to decide who else

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.160
[Guest]: is a believer of Nanak. So when I say the entire culture along the Indus Belt, all the Sindhis,

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.960
[Guest]: all the Balochis have been the believers of Nanak. I mean, I see them all in Pakistan still.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.200
[Guest]: And what people don't know of is, you know, there are more than 250 Gurdwaras still operational in

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.280
[Guest]: Sindh and Balochistan, right? And so when you look at that, you say, you know, the entire culture

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.280
[Guest]: that's yet living there, and we are not recognizing them. So that entire belt is what we call as the

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:47.120
[Guest]: Nanak Panthis. My estimate is that there are over 800,000 Nanak Panthis still in Pakistan.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:53.120
[Guest]: When I meet Dada Rewa Chand in Sukkur in Sindh, and he shows me the translation of the Granth

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:59.280
[Guest]: Sahib that he's done in Sindhi script, 24 volumes, although he's a small minority in Sindh of the

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.600
[Guest]: Nanak Panthi culture. But that shows me the passion with which he actually believes in Nanak, right?

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you've written about how Hindus in Sindh call themselves Sehdari Sikhs.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.520
[Guest]: Yeah. And Bansri Lal in Mingora, who manages the Gurdwara, by all definition of East Punjab,

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:19.600
[Guest]: he will not be considered a Sikh, but he is a very devout Sikh. So I think that poses a question as

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:25.280
[Guest]: to where our boundary today is and where it was. I consider myself very fortunate that having been

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.600
[Guest]: born and being conditioned with what's right, what's wrong, as I walk these paths in these

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.920
[Guest]: lands, I found the remnants, the strands of the intangible culture yet alive. That makes me say

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:42.320
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, this was the society. Is this what you mean by what you said earlier about losing

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:48.240
[Guest]: your faith and then regaining it? Yeah. I mean, you have to grow in a condition, environment,

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.360
[Guest]: and then you have to drop the barriers and the conditioning. It's like breaking the shell,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.320
[Guest]: right? The egg shell, right? And you have to then now start re-looking at things. I am still

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:05.360
[Guest]: a proud Sikh. I am still a proud Khalsa. But the only thing I'm saying is the definition of what I

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:12.480
[Guest]: understand of the faith of the Indus belt was so beautiful, so broad, and Nanak was the entire

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.640
[Guest]: fabric of it. That needs to be re-looked in the India's context where the communities have got

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.640
[Guest]: disseminated. And people don't understand this. So I think for that, I consider myself fortunate

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.360
[Guest]: and thank the divine that you gave me this ability to walk the lands and interact and stay with

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.120
[Guest]: those people. I spend days and nights with them. And my heart pains when I look at how the culture

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.160
[Guest]: is now in small pockets. You know, when communities get in a holocaust, when they move out, the ones

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:46.480
[Guest]: who chose to stay, they become inwards. So they start protecting themselves more. But that's where

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.000
[Guest]: lies the beauty. Because when you parachute inside that society seven decades later, you find that

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.040
[Guest]: they protected a strand that is lost elsewhere, that's gone elsewhere else. So here you still

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.920
[Guest]: find it still protected because they become inwards now. They built a fort around themselves.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.600
[Guest]: They don't want to lose that. And you managed to get inside that, you parachuted from nowhere,

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.360
[Guest]: and you suddenly see and say, ah, this is what my father used to talk about. This is what I used to

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.920
[Guest]: hear about. This is what I've read about. And I'm finding the living strands of that. And it was a

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:23.440
[Guest]: very, very progressive society. And I want to deviate a little bit into the remnants of the art

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.240
[Guest]: and try and understand the culture. So in The Ruins, in my second book, The Quest Continues,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.760
[Guest]: I've shown a lot of pictures. I don't try and interpret a lot of stuff, you know, because I've

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.240
[Guest]: chosen not to do that. I want the viewer to interpret it themselves. I'm not trying to

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.840
[Guest]: handhold you and take you through. I'm just describing my journey. But I've given you so

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:45.360
[Guest]: much of visual material in there that if you are having the open mind to look at them and not

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.960
[Guest]: discard it because it goes beyond the domains of your conditioned mind, then you will find a lot of

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:56.320
[Guest]: answers in it. But you will have to find the answers. In my calls, in my talks, in my discussions

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.000
[Guest]: with people, I will, wherever there's an opportunity, give my thoughts, but I don't write

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.560
[Guest]: it everything. So I'll give you two things from art and talk about the culture itself.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:12.240
[Guest]: So I find in one of the places of worship, a fresco of a woman leading a hunt. It's in the

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.600
[Guest]: second book. And she's leading a hunt and catching hold of a blackbuck deer.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:25.760
[Guest]: And there's a man sitting on a horse behind, chilling it out with a hawk on his arm. So there

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.320
[Guest]: are two things that I take from it. One is blackbuck. Blackbuck, that means was there in Punjab

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.160
[Guest]: too. That's why you're hunting in Punjab. Today you don't have it because the environment has

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.760
[Guest]: changed in the 200, 300 years. The environment has changed from forests. A land of five rivers would

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.000
[Guest]: not be an agricultural land. They'll be heavily forested, right? If you read the Umdat-Uttarik,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.960
[Guest]: the day-to-day account of Ranjit Singh's period, they're going into forests. That forest is totally

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.360
[Guest]: gone. It's an agricultural land. Punjab today is absolutely manicured, pedicured land, right?

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.800
[Guest]: But there were black bucks moving around. Ranjit Singh's troops have hunted lions and tigers there.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.560
[Guest]: So they were there. One of the wildlife thing. I'm coming to more of a deeper meaning out here.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.280
[Guest]: This fresco probably is 200 years old. 200, 250. I can't put a date to it. I'm just saying probably,

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:15.040
[Guest]: right? That means 250 years back, the society in the Indus belt was believing in women's

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.080
[Guest]: empowerment because she was leading a hunt. Man was chilling behind. Women's empowerment

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:26.320
[Guest]: in today's world is 250 years old. It's 250 years late, sorry. 250 years late. In Punjab,

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:33.520
[Guest]: our forefathers were much ahead. Today, we have regressed. Today, Punjab cannot claim to be the

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.520
[Guest]: place where there's women's empowerment. We have regressed. But my forefathers were much more

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.440
[Guest]: forward. That's what I take from that art. Otherwise, that art would not exist there.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one wonders if the art is an outlier. I mean, I did an episode with Madhvi Menon on the

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.400
[Amit Varma]: history of desire in India. And it's certainly true that there were many different kinds of

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.360
[Amit Varma]: expression given to desire. And women could be, you know, could have lived different lives there.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.520
[Amit Varma]: But I am really not sure looking through history with the limited knowledge I have

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.560
[Guest]: that women were ever empowered. I would always kind of been.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.680
[Guest]: And in the context of Punjab, I would not agree because empowerment starts from a philosophical

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.800
[Guest]: seed first. If philosophically you don't believe in empowerment,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.400
[Guest]: an art as an expression cannot come out. So first, let's then step back. Nanak says in his writings,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.440
[Guest]: why do you call her inferior? Who gives birth to the greatest of the kings?

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.600
[Guest]: Why do you call her inferior? Nanak is talking 500 years back about women's

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:37.360
[Amit Varma]: equality in the society. On the one hand, this sounds fairly enlightened. But on the other hand,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.840
[Amit Varma]: one could also argue that this takes a paternalistic view of a woman in the sense

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.800
[Amit Varma]: saying that she is valuable because she gives birth to men.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.880
[Guest]: Yeah. But at the same place, he's writing in other places also about the glory of the woman,

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.440
[Amit Varma]: right? She's, I mean, But through the male gaze,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.600
[Amit Varma]: right? Through the male gaze, like in this example,

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.120
[Guest]: I think there are many other verses which are talking about her status in the society. Of

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.440
[Guest]: course, there's a maternal aspect, there's a nurturing aspect of the female species. And

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.440
[Guest]: today, I'm not trying to say women's empowerment today's context of that everyone needs to be in

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.960
[Guest]: the workforce and this and that. I'm not passing any judgment on that. But they were being put on

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.960
[Guest]: a pedestal with the natural instincts kept into them.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And certainly relative to the times. Absolutely. So I think there is the art,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.120
[Guest]: as I look at it, it had its some imprints into that. Of course, there's a lot of and I will not

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.760
[Guest]: the strategy is not perfect. But these are the glimpses that you get because there are

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.760
[Guest]: cracks in the society, right? There are always cracks. The second one I want to talk about is

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.920
[Guest]: very interesting fresco again, that you find frescoes inside some of these ruins of spiritual

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:44.320
[Guest]: sites of a gurdwara that I saw Shravan Kumar holding his parents in the two tokris on the

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:50.080
[Guest]: two baskets and walking. Now I look at that and say, wow, so Shravan Kumar is not about any religion.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:56.080
[Guest]: It's not about any religion. It's about respect to your parents that transcends every religion.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:02.080
[Guest]: It's a basic fundamental duty, right? And Shravan Kumar finds a space inside the artwork of a

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:08.720
[Guest]: gurdwara. And then I ask myself, will he find space in the artwork of a gurdwara today? Probably not

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.200
[Guest]: because he's not wearing a turban. That makes you think that, okay, here's a strand which I see in

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.600
[Guest]: the past of what the culture was, what the society was and where we are today. I'm not passing

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.160
[Guest]: judgment as to what has led to there, but it allows you to go back in time and then start

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.920
[Guest]: asking certain questions. That's what I'm doing again and again. I'm not writing everything in

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.880
[Guest]: my books, but I'm requesting the viewer to delve into the pictures and see for yourself.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, some of the pictures I found really fascinating in your book is in your chapter on

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.000
[Amit Varma]: the Baba Dhan Singh Gurdwara at Kot Fateh Khan, you've shown frescoes of Shiva, Nandi and Ganesh

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.240
[Amit Varma]: and then Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. And, you know, again, that was something I kind of had to spot.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.160
[Amit Varma]: You don't have much commentary on that. You've just laid it out for, you know, people to see

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.960
[Amit Varma]: and sort of think for themselves. In another chapter, you show Nanihal Singh's Haveli where,

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's a Rang Mahal on the roof and there you see Krishna listening to music and

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:03.840
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. How did you train yourself to be able to look at these frescoes and sort of

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.680
[Amit Varma]: identify who the characters are or even other nuances like elsewhere you have, you know,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:15.040
[Amit Varma]: identified a building and said the bricks that were used here were of a time of Ranjit Singh's

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.600
[Amit Varma]: time so we can date it accordingly. What was some of this knowledge part of the layers of

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.960
[Amit Varma]: knowledge you were building up before you embarked on this quest or was it during this quest that you

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.040
[Amit Varma]: kept refining your understanding? So, first and foremost thing, you're talking about Nanihal's

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.760
[Guest]: Haveli and you talk about Krishna and you talk about other things. Yes, you find a variety of

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: art form but I just want to point out there's one picture in there. Don't miss it. Go and look

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.560
[Guest]: by the picture again. There's also a Masjid in that. I missed it. Yeah. So, it's not, all I'm

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:50.160
[Guest]: trying to say it's not one view, right? So, in his bedroom, which is, I'm assuming it's his bedroom

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.600
[Guest]: because it's his living place, he's got arts of the entire culture, the composite culture of Punjab.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:02.400
[Guest]: Even Masjid is there. So, let's not just see the present Hindu aspect of it. There are Sikh gurus

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:07.360
[Guest]: there, there is Masjid there. So, they are reflecting the culture of Punjab in their bedroom,

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.720
[Guest]: right? I think that's the key thing out here. As far as the identification of bricks and the other,

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.640
[Guest]: many other things, I think it's not, your question is not about the bricks itself but the many layers

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:22.640
[Guest]: that we're talking about. It's a process. It doesn't happen overnight. As I said, don't follow

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.800
[Guest]: your passion. Create your passion. When you create your passion, every moment is a question. Every

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.480
[Guest]: moment is a question. In my talk to you right now, I'm probing certain things inside my mind, right?

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.880
[Guest]: Yeah. Every moment becomes a question when you start creating your passion and therefore every

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.120
[Guest]: moment becomes a learning space. I am not born historian. I am not an historian. I'm an electronics

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:52.720
[Guest]: engineer who's done MBA, who's walked in the path of the finance industry. I was the revenue

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:58.080
[Guest]: management head for Asia Pacific. I'm not trained for these things, but I've forced myself to start

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.520
[Guest]: asking questions in those creating passion sub-segments of my life of four to five years

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.080
[Guest]: that I was doing very passionately. And when you start doing that, you don't know what question

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:13.680
[Guest]: will come to your mind. So I'm not trying to go into a classroom environment, but I'm curious enough

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.400
[Guest]: to look at things and try and find answers. Okay, so why is this brick thinner than the bricks that

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:23.440
[Guest]: I see today? In the thin bricks, I find certain bricks are bigger in size and certain are smaller

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.200
[Guest]: in size. They are thin. Now you're going to have to look at that. Why is this larger? Why is this

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.040
[Guest]: thin? What period are they coming from? Because bricks are made in kilns, right? And people buy

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.360
[Guest]: them and they make monuments. Monuments survive. Now you're going to look at the brick sizes to say

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.880
[Guest]: which period it belongs to. There is a certain size of bricks in the Punjab region, which is

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.440
[Guest]: known as Mughlai bricks, thin bricks, but broader. Then Ranjit Singh's period, the kilns, the casts

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.880
[Guest]: for the bricks changed to smaller size, but still thin. So you look at the two, you can say this is

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.840
[Unknown]: Mughlai period or Lodhi period, and this is the Ranjit Singh's period. And then you look at the

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:02.480
[Amit Varma]: British bricks, which become thick, what we use today. Much like the British themselves, as we now

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:12.000
[Guest]: know. So no comments on that, but yeah, so that's how you start, you know, probing. And the only

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.760
[Guest]: thing I can say is that knowledge is a process of layering. No one can claim to know anything

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.040
[Guest]: and everything. I don't know anything and everything, but the layering will allow me to

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.840
[Guest]: assimilate knowledge from the works done by the people in the past. And hopefully I'm adding my

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:33.040
[Guest]: layer for the future generation to take away something from it. Knowledge comes in layers,

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.400
[Guest]: and knowledge will keep assimilating in layers. The question is, is the seeker showing it's his

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.840
[Guest]: or her commitment to delve deeper into the layers of knowledge to understand what the person is

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.880
[Amit Varma]: after? Very profound words. And I would add to that and say podcasts also come in layers. We

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.680
[Amit Varma]: will now take a commercial break and come back after the break to add a layer of your personal

00:53:53.680 --> 00:54:00.800
[Amit Varma]: journeys to Pakistan. If you're listening to the scene in the unseen, it means you like listening

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.680
[Amit Varma]: to audio and you're thirsty for knowledge. That being the case, I'd urge you to check out

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:11.680
[Amit Varma]: Storytel, the sponsors of this episode. Storytel is an audio book platform that has a massive range

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.160
[Amit Varma]: of audio books from around the world. The international collection is stellar, but so is

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.440
[Amit Varma]: a local collection. They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audio books. What's more,

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:26.560
[Amit Varma]: I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I talk about one book

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:33.200
[Amit Varma]: every week, giving context, giving you a taste of it, and so on. Download that app and listen to my

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.080
[Amit Varma]: show. And as long as Storytel sponsors this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.160
[Amit Varma]: an audio book that I liked on that platform every week. My recommendation for this week is Where

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.680
[Amit Varma]: India Goes by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears. This book takes a closer look at how Indians go to the

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:55.200
[Amit Varma]: toilet and has some startling insights about open defecation. Coffey and Spears argue that the

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.240
[Amit Varma]: practice of open defecation is not just a result of poverty, but a direct consequence of the caste

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.280
[Amit Varma]: system. Listen to the book for more or check out episode 82 of The Seen and The Unseen, where I

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.400
[Amit Varma]: discuss just this with Shruti Rajgopalan. We spoke about this book as well, so do listen to it on

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.320
[Amit Varma]: Storytel, Where India Goes by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears. Download the Storytel app or visit

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Storytel.com. Remember, that's Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com. Welcome back to The

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:27.520
[Amit Varma]: Seen and The Unseen. I'm chatting with Amardeep Singh about his fascinating work looking at Sikh

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.800
[Amit Varma]: legacy. Amardeep, let's kind of talk about your, you know, the first of your two projects, so to

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.840
[Amit Varma]: say, which was traveling through Pakistan, which resulted in these two books and these two

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.280
[Amit Varma]: documentaries. And you know, you start your book Lost Heritage by sort of injecting a personal

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.240
[Amit Varma]: note into it, where your father Sundar Singh in Gorakhpur receives a, you know, a postcard from

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Rawalpindi. Tell me a little bit about that. And was your sort of family history where there's a

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:59.520
[Amit Varma]: lot more history, which goes back to the trauma of partition? Was that part of what drove you on

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:06.400
[Guest]: your quest? Yes, it's there's a personal aspect to this whole quest, which has transformed from

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:12.560
[Guest]: a very personal probing to documenting for the broader communities. So it's a transformation

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:19.360
[Guest]: of a personal quest. I didn't go into Pakistan, to be honest, to write any book. It just happened.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.960
[Guest]: Because when I left the corporate world, I just thought I'm actually in between something. And

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.560
[Guest]: the doors were shut for a little while. And I think Divine was trying to push me in this direction.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.560
[Guest]: And when I decided to walk in, the gates started opening. So Divine was waiting for me to take

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:34.720
[Guest]: the step and then started opening the gates. But in that opening of the gates, I stepped in

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:40.320
[Guest]: with a simple quest as to my father was not able to go back to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan's Kashmir.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.640
[Guest]: And my mother was from Abbottabad. Both of them could not go. So I wanted to and there are no

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:52.240
[Guest]: more. So I wanted to see if I can go in and see the places. And then the layers of my own building

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:57.840
[Guest]: on creating of passions that I was doing had prepared me over the time as a photographer,

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:05.680
[Guest]: as a small visual narrative writer, as having enough knowledge about history, about spirituality,

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.880
[Guest]: about not just my faith, many other faiths, all the layers were prepared. And when I stepped inside,

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.160
[Guest]: the gates started opening up for me. But I only went in with a personal quest. But what I saw

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:21.200
[Guest]: and I felt that I came back with 36 cities and villages in a span of 30 days, I said, wow, this

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:27.760
[Guest]: is a huge land that I've traversed in just 30 days. And should I just sit back or should I write

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:33.520
[Guest]: this for posterity? Because like me, which was a personal quest, you said your father was from

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.280
[Guest]: Sheikhupura. I'm sure you have a desire too. I'm sure there are many others who have a desire.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.920
[Guest]: I'm sure there are many Muslims on the other side who have a desire to come to UP and Bihar.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:50.320
[Guest]: It's a human aspect. It's a human need to kind of connect to your roots. And the hardened boundaries

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:55.840
[Guest]: don't allow us to do that today. So if a divine energy has blessed you, should you keep it back

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:02.800
[Guest]: to your own quest? Or should you open it up? I may not be able to take you into your personal journey,

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.080
[Guest]: but I can give you a glimpse of the journey that makes you curious enough and you don't know how

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:14.240
[Guest]: these things will develop. And I've often said in my talks is I am waiting for a day when a Hindu

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.120
[Guest]: will get up and say, I will document the Hindu legacy in Pakistan. A Jain will get up and say,

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.680
[Guest]: I will document Jain legacy in Pakistan. And I'm waiting for a day when a Muslim will get up in

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.880
[Guest]: Pakistan and say, I will document the Islamic legacy in East Punjab. The day we've done that,

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:34.000
[Guest]: in 10 volumes, we will have the Punjabi legacy. Until that time, I'm only one piece of the

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.320
[Guest]: equation. So you are planting seeds for the wider communities to now start exploring their roots.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.120
[Guest]: And this is a natural formal path of putting layers of information where these things will

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.840
[Guest]: grow. And I thank myself that in the five years that I've seen, and I'm not the only

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:55.040
[Guest]: person who can take credit there. Many forces have come together, but I look at the picture

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.760
[Guest]: of the first book, the front cover picture of the broken Dera Chauha Baba Guru Nanak Gurdwara,

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:05.280
[Guest]: the historical Gurdwara. Between 2014, when I went there, and when we are sitting here last year,

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.840
[Guest]: it was announced that Gurdwara will be maintained like that. Many others have been decided to be

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:14.560
[Guest]: maintained. I don't take the credit for it, but I know in the quarters that I've dealt with,

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.240
[Guest]: the initial reaction was, why have you not shown Nankana Sahib in the front cover? But I said,

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.000
[Guest]: I have shown it inside. I've shown the things that are working well. I've shown where the

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.680
[Guest]: opportunities lie. And to me, these are opportunities. And my feeling is, it's my

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:33.440
[Guest]: heritage which is lost because another Amardeep may not be permitted. Another XYZ may not be

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.720
[Guest]: permitted. And therefore, it's lost from us. And I want us to think that there's a potential inside

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.120
[Guest]: this. And that potential is what can then transform and bring about change, right?

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.280
[Guest]: So I think the answer to your question is that we have to do the right thing. We can't control

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.840
[Guest]: every outcome. But if we do the right thing, I think it leads us to the right direction in terms

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.320
[Amit Varma]: of bringing about change. And it kind of seems to me that when you travel through Pakistan,

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.120
[Amit Varma]: you went simultaneously on three different kinds of journeys. One is an intellectual journey of

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:06.160
[Amit Varma]: trying to understand what happened and all the dissipations and to figure out what remains.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.240
[Amit Varma]: One is sort of, in a sense, a spiritual journey of understanding Nanak's legacy and Nanak's message,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.840
[Amit Varma]: so to say. And I'll ask you about both of those later. But you also went on an emotional journey

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.560
[Amit Varma]: where you're revisiting what is part of your past. For example, Muzaffarabad, you know, you point out

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.920
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, the postcard that your father in Gorakhpur received was from a long lost nephew

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.800
[Amit Varma]: who had been separated from your aunt in Muzaffarabad when, you know, the two kids, 10 and

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.200
[Amit Varma]: 8, were separated from their mother. And then they landed up on the other side. You also talk about

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.960
[Amit Varma]: your aunt, Inder Kaur, throwing her infant girl off the bridge in Muzaffarabad. And she died,

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.160
[Amit Varma]: of course. And you actually went to that bridge. You actually saw the place where all these corpses

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:54.320
[Amit Varma]: of your community and some of your family had actually lain there. What are sort of your

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.960
[Amit Varma]: feelings when you're visiting not just foreign towns, but also parts of your own past?

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.200
[Guest]: It's an interesting question you ask, right? Basically, you're asking what's my emotional

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.200
[Guest]: state, right? In other words,

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.880
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, and does it evolve? Like, are you then able to like, these quests are happening

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.400
[Amit Varma]: simultaneously. At one level, there is an intellectual understanding, like you write

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.960
[Amit Varma]: about how you have decided at an intellectual level that you're not going to pass judgment

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.480
[Amit Varma]: on characters in history. You're just going to document what happened and what there is.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.840
[Guest]: But at another level, you are deeply affected. So I think let's start with the second piece.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.400
[Guest]: Am I deeply affected? It's a question I ask myself, right? I'm going to give you an answer,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.120
[Guest]: which is going to be absolutely 180 degrees on the other end of the spectrum of what you're

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.000
[Guest]: thinking or what everyone thinks. The reality is when you go on this quest, I never went to

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.760
[Guest]: write the first book. You've got to understand that. I never went to write the second book.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.640
[Guest]: I never went to make the two documentaries. The only time I've consciously went, the two

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.560
[Guest]: documentaries on Sikh legacy in Pakistan, the only time I've consciously went in search of

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.840
[Guest]: something knowingly that it may not be possible because the task was too huge is the making of

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.200
[Guest]: Allegory and Tapestry of Guru Nanak's Travels, right? That's the only thing that has happened

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.280
[Guest]: in the last one year. But before that, for four years, I've done everything unknowingly.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.240
[Guest]: So I've gone inside because the energy opens up. I go inside and I start probing. I have the history

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.360
[Guest]: in mind. I have the other stuff in mind. But when I go to the place, the curious mind of mine does

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:23.440
[Guest]: not have the bandwidth for any emotions because I'm wearing 10 antennas on my head at that point

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.320
[Guest]: of time. I'm wearing the antenna of that emotional handshake and the coming together of people and

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.880
[Guest]: the welcoming aspect, you know, that's the human aspect. People welcome you and other things,

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.720
[Guest]: right? That's one thing you have to manage. Secondly, you're going to manage the, there are

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.320
[Guest]: questions and there are doubts as to this man has come inside. Why has he come so deep inside? There

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.480
[Guest]: are agencies that will be questioning you and there'll be other people questioning the people

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.920
[Guest]: who have doubts on you. Why have you come here? You've got to manage that aspect because that can

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.200
[Guest]: become a barrier in your quest, right? You've got to manage your time because there's a cost

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.120
[Guest]: associated with that time, right? And you've got to move fast. And you are doing 36 cities and

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.280
[Guest]: villages in 30 days. You've got to move fast. You go into a monument, there's a whole village that

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.440
[Guest]: gathers there. In that village, you don't want to be there for long because they are seeing a Sikh

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.280
[Guest]: for the first time after seven decades, right? I'm visible a Sikh, right? So you've got to get in and

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.600
[Guest]: get out fast. And then you've got to look at the frescoes, the ruins, the remnants, absorb all

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.000
[Guest]: that aspect. There's a lot happening in a short span of time. In that whole scheme of thing,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.840
[Guest]: in the moment, there's no scope for emotion. You can't sit and ponder by the bank.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.680
[Guest]: No, there's no time. This is where people think that you're on a holiday. No, you're on a holiday.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.960
[Guest]: 36 cities and villages in 30 days. You're going from one end of the country to the other end of

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.000
[Guest]: the country. You're getting up at 3 a.m. and you're on the road, coming back at 11 o'clock,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.440
[Guest]: backing up the data. It's a huge, humongous task. There is no scope for emotion. And I'm glad there's

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.200
[Guest]: no scope for emotion because the day there's emotion in the fieldwork, your fieldwork is

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.160
[Guest]: biased. Fieldwork has to be always emotionless. Then you start looking at the layers when you

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.800
[Guest]: come back. Does the emotion come later? Yes. When you come back and you start looking at,

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.280
[Guest]: and you lie down on your bed and you start looking at the ceiling above and say,

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.120
[Guest]: what happened just now? Something happened, right? And you say, my God, this was like a

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.760
[Guest]: journey of a lifetime, right? And then you say, oh, I saw this aspect. And you start interpreting

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.960
[Guest]: it. And then you start writing down. I never went to write a book. Then you start writing down.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.120
[Guest]: That's where the emotion starts coming. But it's a very task-oriented writing because you're trying

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.640
[Guest]: to do the whole thing. What takes five to six years in a PhD environment, you're doing in just

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.680
[Guest]: seven to eight months. You're doing very fast. You're just purging all the information down

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.720
[Guest]: from your mind into the paper, right? The emotion starts coming out really in this whole process is

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.960
[Guest]: when you start presenting to the audience and you see the audience is now connecting. And that's

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.080
[Guest]: where your inner state is saying, I'm glad we did this. That's where the emotion starts coming out.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.880
[Guest]: When the audience emotes, then you also have an emotional aspect coming out, right? So that's

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.240
[Guest]: the reality of the whole thing. And I'm glad it is the way it is because fieldwork should never

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.800
[Guest]: be influenced by emotion. And when you do that, then you have the ability of seeing different

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:55.760
[Guest]: strands coming out. A lot of people say to me that these works are going beyond the Sikh domain.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.080
[Guest]: And I say, you know what? You've not understood it. You've not understood the culture of the past.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.520
[Guest]: And these strands are the only strands that you have. You can't throw the baby in the bathtub

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.160
[Guest]: out. You've got to keep the strand the way it is. Right or wrong, let's not pass judgments

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.600
[Guest]: because my forefathers have made it. Our forefathers were collectively living, they have

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.400
[Amit Varma]: made it. Let's try and understand from it and figure out what is it. I'm going to play a brief

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.640
[Amit Varma]: clip. And of course, I'll play the audio, but I saw it on video in the second of your documentaries.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.880
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of moved me a bit where a gentleman named Aslam at Toha Khalsa talks about a massacre

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.880
[Amit Varma]: that happened there just before partition, where a massacre of Sikhs, where a lot of women gave

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.600
[Amit Varma]: their lives by jumping into a well. And you were actually at that well. And this gentleman was at

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.560
[Amit Varma]: that well with you. And he told you what he saw. And when I saw it, of course, I found it very

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.400
[Amit Varma]: affecting. So I'm going to briefly play that audio clip and then translate.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Right. So here's the translation of what Aslam says. He's asked where he was standing. And he

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.000
[Amit Varma]: says, quote, right at that spot. Many women were standing outside while some had jumped in the well.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.960
[Amit Varma]: There was no space left in the well as it was filled with bodies till the top. The ones yet

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.960
[Amit Varma]: alive in the well were trying to immerse their head in the water. They wanted to die. Stop quote.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.480
[Amit Varma]: And all this again, you know, when you read about it, when you go there, you've written also about

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.720
[Amit Varma]: the rape of Rawalpindi, for example, all the violence that happened. And again, for all of

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.400
[Amit Varma]: this, you're saying that you process it later. When you are there, you're just in the moment,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:51.520
[Guest]: you have to get the data and you have to get out. Absolutely. Because it's a very complex

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.680
[Guest]: thing in the limited time frame that you're there to access data. If you can get the data,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.240
[Guest]: then you understand after that. But you see, this work cannot be done if the divine is not

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.000
[Guest]: going to help you in this whole process. You only have the desire. Now, the desire gets me into

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.280
[Guest]: Tuha Khalsa village, which itself is in a restricted area. You can't get inside Tuha Khalsa very easily.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:18.000
[Guest]: I've reached the village. How do I find that well? This generation that saw it is nearing its end,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.200
[Guest]: right? There may not be anyone alive. So how do you stumble upon some man who then takes you to

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:29.680
[Guest]: his home and his mother, who's 92 years old, Muzammil Bibi, meets you and she says how great

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.480
[Guest]: Tuha was before 47. It was a big town and she talks about a Hindu and seek her friends. And

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.880
[Guest]: she's remembering the girls with whom she used to play. But she was probably at that time,

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.040
[Guest]: 92 years, 22 years old. She's 92 years now. So she was 22 years old at that time.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:53.040
[Guest]: And then from there, as you're walking out, you're trying to find the well. She's too old. She says,

01:07:53.040 --> 01:08:00.400
[Guest]: oh well, it happened. That well is there. But how do you go there? Where is it? People don't

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.720
[Guest]: understand it. The new generation has not bothered about it. And you come out and you suddenly see

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.440
[Guest]: an old man walking with his stick on the road. And I stopped the vehicle and I went to him and

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:15.200
[Guest]: I said, Baba Salaam. And he looks at me from his broken glasses, you know, he looks at me and he

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.960
[Guest]: says, how did you come here? Because he's seeing a visible Sikh, right? And I tell him and then I

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:30.480
[Guest]: asked him, do you know, do you know the well where the women jumped in 47? He says, I was present

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:37.120
[Guest]: there. How do you describe that? You will bump into someone who is an eyewitness random in a

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.160
[Guest]: short span of just a short visit to that village. And that person then takes you there. These are

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:49.840
[Guest]: divine blessings. So your understanding of the narrative is being propelled by a divine push.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.000
[Guest]: And then when you're there, when I saw the well, I didn't have a tear coming down of my eyes.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.360
[Guest]: It's contrary to what people would believe. I did not. Because for me, that moment is what I was

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.920
[Guest]: trying to capture. What is it? And I know I will be able to lie down on the bed later on and reflect

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.480
[Guest]: about it. In the moment, there was no emotion. But these emotions are being propelled by a force

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.120
[Guest]: that's guiding you towards something. And that to me is a divine intervention. And I think the

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.200
[Guest]: universe is waiting for, as I say, again, what we started off with, creating your passions. I think

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.760
[Guest]: the universe is waiting for the commitment from you, the commitment from you over a period of 30

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.880
[Guest]: years to say, now you're ready. Now I'm going to open the gates for you. And now wherever you will

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.960
[Guest]: walk, whatever be your desire, it will be manifesting in front of you. And that's where

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.080
[Amit Varma]: it all starts happening. So you mentioned that when you decided to go to Pakistan,

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.320
[Amit Varma]: and I think you went in October 2014, you landed up the first time, the first time,

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.480
[Amit Varma]: and you didn't intend to write a book, you didn't intend to make documentaries,

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.120
[Guest]: what pushed you? Why were you going there? So I was, as I said, in the interim of my in the

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.280
[Guest]: midway of moving out, I moved out from Amex, and I was supposed to go to Australia, I decided not to

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.840
[Guest]: go, I was going to look for another job. And finding a job when you exit at a senior level

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.880
[Guest]: takes a bit of time. And six months had passed by, I was going through the process. And I decided,

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.400
[Guest]: now's the time, I should go to Pakistan. And I landed there. How I got my visa is a different

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.040
[Guest]: story. I mean, how do I'm an Indian born, but I hold a Singaporean passport. In those days,

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.320
[Guest]: still the question was, you're an Indian born, both the countries do the same thing to the people.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.240
[Guest]: If you are, so I have a friend who's Pakistani born, and he had a wedding to come to in Delhi,

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.320
[Guest]: the wedding got over. And from four months after that, the visa got approved, right? So this is

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.840
[Guest]: a problem for both the nations, right? So I apply for it, and I get it. And the next time I land in

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:43.760
[Guest]: there, and then why did I meet that first person who held my hand? Six months prior to my going

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.920
[Guest]: there, I had seen someone doing something similar, which was of my passion, some Pakistani. And I

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.240
[Guest]: saw him and I asked him, why don't you click better pictures? He says, I don't have a camera.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.680
[Guest]: I just packed my camera and sent it to him, because I'm a photographer, I had many camera

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.400
[Guest]: bodies. I just packed two lenses and one camera and sent it to him. The point is, why did it

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.000
[Guest]: happen six months before? Because that person was already ready with that. Because I had done

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.040
[Guest]: something for me, for him, without him asking. And when I landed there, he was there to hold my hand.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.240
[Guest]: And one thing led to the other, to the other, to the other, and you did the whole journey.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.600
[Guest]: So you didn't go to write a book. But when you came back, that's when you started thinking,

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.800
[Guest]: I went on a personal quest. I have seen Muzaffarabad. I had only two reasons. One is I

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:31.040
[Guest]: want to see strands of my history. Are they still there? In the remnants, tangible and intangibles?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.240
[Guest]: Were they still there?

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.480
[Guest]: Those are the monuments through which the lost heritage, the Sikh legacy.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.920
[Amit Varma]: That's a Sikh history. What strands of your history there? Did you feel that personal

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.320
[Guest]: connection?

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.400
[Guest]: So my history is my community's history, my Punjabi history, the Islamic history,

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.480
[Unknown]: the Hindu history, the Jain history, the...

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.840
[Guest]: The Nanak Panti history.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.560
[Guest]: Everything is my history. The lands are my history. I'm choosing to see it from a Sikh

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.440
[Guest]: lens. But in that Sikh lens, you will find a lot of plurality actually intertwines, right?

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.440
[Guest]: When you're talking earlier about the artwork inside Nonyal's Haveli and a Masjid and Krishna

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.720
[Guest]: both exist there. It's our collective legacy, right? So I went to see that. And then when I

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.760
[Guest]: was able to go into Multan and see the Anglo-Sikh, second Anglo-Sikh war monument there

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.040
[Guest]: and find out that the Idgah where the second Anglo-Sikh war started because of Van Zagnew

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.760
[Guest]: was beheaded there. It's not there. But the place around which where the Idgah was there,

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.640
[Guest]: you see it, right?

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.400
[Guest]: So you find these remnants and you start stitching the story together. When you come back,

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:32.000
[Guest]: you feel propelled and compelled that it must be written because it's no more your quest. It

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.560
[Guest]: becomes a responsibility for the bigger communities and the wider communities and the inspiration

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.120
[Guest]: that you can provide to them. That's how the first book happened. And I did it fast. I just did it

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.440
[Guest]: because I was in a rush to get back into the corporate world. I never knew that this would

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.000
[Guest]: become my life. I did it. And I didn't know that after I got it published, I faced a lot of

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.520
[Guest]: problems in publishing in the first book because I'm an unknown author. I'm coming from finance

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.360
[Guest]: industry, trying to do a huge volume book. Publishers are there to make money out of it.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.120
[Guest]: They're looking at the commercial aspect, faced a lot of problems, but we managed to get it done.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.880
[Guest]: A lot of people came forward and saw my work and they helped me and thanked all of them.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.600
[Guest]: Once we got it published, I didn't realize that the world was waiting to hear the story.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.520
[Guest]: And then it just kept me on the road for a good 10 months. And I spoke at some 70-odd seminars

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.760
[Guest]: around the world. And it didn't allow me to come back to Singapore for a good eight months. People

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.080
[Guest]: kept moving me from one place to the other. So, eight months I was on the road. It's when I came

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.200
[Guest]: back and then I started applying for the job, not two and a half years had passed by. And I was dead

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.680
[Unknown]: meat for corporate industry. Because two and a half years is too late now, right? You've been far

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.400
[Guest]: out and living in a senior role. And that's when I started reinventing myself. I said,

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.200
[Guest]: no, I've got to restart this whole thing. So, I picked up a job in a startup. Something that I

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.000
[Guest]: was doing at an intellectual level, what I was probably doing 20 years back in my career. My

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.120
[Guest]: mind was not into it. And then the divine opened this gate again, because I used to dream of Jamrod.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.880
[Guest]: I used to dream of Jamrod at the Khyber Pass. I was looking at the Khyber Pass. I was standing

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.560
[Amit Varma]: at Jamrod. I was advised not to go to Jamrod in my first book. And Jamrod, of course, for the

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.440
[Amit Varma]: listeners, is a great fort at the Khyber Pass where Hari Singh Nalwa actually died, in fact.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.760
[Guest]: Yes. And it's the fort that finally plugged. It was a fort. It was made in just a few days

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.720
[Guest]: and finally plugged the invasions from the Central Asia into the subcontinent.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.240
[Guest]: Because thereafter, the British came after the Sikh Empire. They came from the East. They didn't

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.080
[Guest]: come from the West. No one has actually come from the West afterwards. So, that's a defining point

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.760
[Guest]: of the history. And I was standing there. I couldn't go inside because I was advised not to

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.160
[Guest]: go inside Jamrod. I was at Peshawar in the night before. This is 2014. The army school attack on

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.240
[Guest]: the children happened at that time. Taliban, this thing was in the peak. There are some Sikh

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.600
[Guest]: shopkeepers from Peshawar who have shops close to Jamrod. And I would ask them, can you take me in

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.280
[Guest]: the morning? No one was wanting to take me. They didn't want to take risk. Because I look different,

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.280
[Guest]: I talk different, I hold a camera body, and I could be a sitting duck, right? I could be easily

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.800
[Guest]: abducted, right? No one wanted to take me. And I got up in the morning. I just got into a car,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.640
[Guest]: went there. But I couldn't go inside because that fort is with the army. And I clicked a picture

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.440
[Guest]: from the outside and I came back. But between the first book and when the energy of the second book

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.400
[Guest]: developed, as I was giving the talks around the world, I used to get dreams of Jamrod. I used to

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.960
[Guest]: feel that I was so near and yet so far. I just stood across the road and I clicked a picture. I

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.280
[Guest]: couldn't go inside. And you know when you feel something very strongly and passionately, the

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.360
[Guest]: universe again answers. And I was in this job. I was doing it for three months. My mind was not

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.640
[Guest]: into it. And one day I get a call from the embassy of Pakistan in Singapore. And Mr. Nasrullah Khan

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.520
[Guest]: calls me. He says, come and meet us. I went there. He says, you know what? You did this first book.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.880
[Guest]: You went around the world. You called us to inaugurate the book in Singapore. I did call

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.560
[Guest]: them, right? I must say that you've taken a very tricky subject and you've taken it around the

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.560
[Guest]: world and you're not politicizing it. I said, there's nothing to politicize in it. I can't

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.040
[Guest]: change the history. But what can I learn from it? And what can we all learn from it? And what can we

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.720
[Guest]: motivate each other is the objective out here. And if you can actually openly talk about it,

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.800
[Guest]: then we will all be in a better space. He says, no, I do hear you because you went around the

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.040
[Guest]: world and we have got reports from all over that you've gone. Because I'm a Singaporean,

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.640
[Guest]: so of course the reports would come on it because I'm talking about a subject of Pakistan.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.080
[Guest]: And so I'm quite impressed that you've had no political tension anywhere in your talks, right?

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.440
[Guest]: So he says, we have selected you from our embassy on a academy of letters. It's like

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.760
[Guest]: a Sahitya Kala Academy Awards. They have an academy of collectors. They want to bring in

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.120
[Guest]: some foreign nationals to expose the artists in Islamabad to some foreign talent. So they said,

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.880
[Guest]: from Singapore, we selected you. Would you be able to go there? I said, absolutely.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.840
[Guest]: So I went in, I took that invitation. I took a leave from my job for five days.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:41.200
[Guest]: And Jan, 2016, I was in Pakistan. No, Jan, 2017, I was in Pakistan for five days. And then the

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.000
[Guest]: energy that developed again when I was there, I should still get the gleam of Jamrod. And I met

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.480
[Guest]: some people who had heard me and they were in influential quarters. And then I requested to

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.720
[Guest]: them that I'm here. Please open the Jamrod Fort for me. Next, I know the fort opened. Next,

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.200
[Guest]: I asked for Attaq. Next, I asked for Shabkadar. Everything started opening. I couldn't describe

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.640
[Guest]: this. I could feel that the energy is now in my favor again. And I asked myself this question,

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.040
[Guest]: do I walk away right now for that job, which I don't enjoy? I just picked up the phone and

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.520
[Guest]: called them that I'm resigning. I was there for five days. I came out of the country after 55

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:20.400
[Guest]: days. And in that process, I went after the force that I was shown to me. I just went on my own,

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:26.240
[Guest]: just went deeper and deeper. 90 cities and villages. I came back and I just couldn't hold

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.000
[Guest]: myself back. I said, this is, again, something that needs to be shared with the world because

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.760
[Guest]: now I've documented a huge amount of data about the culture, the intangible aspects in Balochistan,

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.120
[Guest]: living communities, the hidden treasures inside this of the Sikh era forts and other things.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.360
[Guest]: I just couldn't sit back. I just started writing immediately. No looking back. And it took me one

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.440
[Guest]: year, got it out. That was the second book, The Quest Continues, Lost Heritage of Sikh Legacy in

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.560
[Guest]: Pakistan. So that came out. And then I again, the moment the book came out, I was now this time

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.920
[Guest]: again, like the first book catapulted into these public engagements that took place in Pakistan.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.520
[Guest]: It took me to over a hundred seminars around the world in just about eight months. So the demand

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.720
[Guest]: was there. People just kept moving me. I just kept talking. And it's really in 2018, September,

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.240
[Guest]: that I came back. I didn't know what to do because this space that I'm in, creative space, which a

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.280
[Guest]: lot of creative people go through, it's what I remember. I recall Shiv Kumar Batalvi, who's a

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:25.120
[Guest]: Punjabi poet, talks about this concept in a poetry about birha. Virha, as we call it in Punjabi,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:32.560
[Guest]: say birha. And virha is that intense pain of separation from your purpose. I mean, virha,

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.480
[Guest]: actually in esoteric language, is talked about intense pain of separation from the divine.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.480
[Guest]: But for me, the divine was my work. And when that intense pain of separation is there,

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.680
[Guest]: because the purpose is lost, the pain becomes very, very intense. And this pain is what drives

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.080
[Guest]: the creative process. Every time I've seen in this creative, in that corporate treadmill,

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.680
[Guest]: I used to just go straight. Here, it's a sine curve. You go, you create something and go inside

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.800
[Guest]: a valley. And that pain becomes so large that you then catapult again and takes you even to a higher

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.640
[Guest]: pinnacle. How long can you do it? I don't know. But the pain, the deeper it is, the more you'll

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.880
[Guest]: catapult. And I went into a painful process again after my second book. And the catapulting of that

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.440
[Guest]: was basically, I was aware of the first phase, after my first book, that it was a painful

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.280
[Guest]: experience. And I was trying to keep myself busy. And in the making of the second book,

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.800
[Guest]: I had some video footage, thanks to Salman Alam Khan, who was deputed by the establishment to

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.360
[Guest]: follow me into some of the forts, just for the forts. And he told me that, Amardeep Sahib,

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.880
[Guest]: aap kuch bol diya karein, aap creative vande hain, you're a creative person, I'm a creative person,

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.240
[Guest]: aap bol diya karein, my job is not to do a documentary on you, I'm just following you,

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.080
[Guest]: right? But you know what, the data can be used somewhere. And the data fell on my lap. It was

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.480
[Guest]: again a divine intervention, divine gift on my lap. But I had not acted on that data for one and

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.840
[Guest]: a half years. And I came back after my second book, I started looking at the data just to keep

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.560
[Guest]: my mind busy. And I saw a story emerging from it. And I took the music, I took my own feelings,

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.720
[Guest]: and I stitched it together. A novice trying to make a documentary, I learned it. And I all

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.960
[Guest]: stitched it together on my own. And we created two documentaries, which became Peering Soul,

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.240
[Guest]: which takes the viewer in a 50-minute journey to non-traditional sites of spiritual sites

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.040
[Guest]: abandoned across Pakistan. This documentary is not yet fully released on YouTube. I am

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.120
[Guest]: going to probably release it in the third quarter of this year. But we have released the second

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.440
[Guest]: documentary, which is Peering Warrior. That's a 35-minute documentary, which takes the viewer

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.880
[Guest]: across the forts of the Sikhera, where our history had churned right up to the Afghanistan border.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.560
[Guest]: And some of the footage has never been seen before. So that documentary is there on the

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.960
[Amit Varma]: YouTube. If you search for Peering Warrior, you'll find it. It'll be linked from the show notes as

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.760
[Guest]: indeed the books will be as well. Peering Warrior documentary got completed and Peering

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.600
[Guest]: Soul. So Peering Warrior is there. And thereafter this two documentaries getting completed, my mind

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.800
[Guest]: now was again empty, right? And I'm saying what to do. And that's where very quickly this thought

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.240
[Guest]: manifested because I was already mentally prepared because I knew the narrative of Nanak. And I said

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.880
[Guest]: to myself this question, the skill set that I've developed is good to be aware of. What

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.360
[Guest]: corporate has taught me is it's good to be knowing your strengths and your skills. No point going

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.640
[Guest]: around and beating around the bush, life is too short, right? The skill that I developed in the

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:11.600
[Guest]: last five years was going into hard to access zones and making things happen to build a narrative.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.600
[Guest]: That's the skill set at the basic level. So I asked myself, this was January 2019,

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.240
[Guest]: we started this project. I asked myself this question, Guru Nanak travelled far and wide,

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.440
[Guest]: 70% of his region is today in conflict zones. He's travelled far and wide across India, Pakistan,

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:35.600
[Guest]: Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi, Tibet, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. If you look at the broad canvas,

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.640
[Guest]: 70% of the zone is not accessible today. Pakistan you can go to Nankana Sahib, Panja Sahib,

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.720
[Guest]: Kartarpur Sahib, three traditional Gurudwaras. But Nanak's narrative is not about the three

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.120
[Guest]: Gurudwaras. Nanak's narrative is about him going to Bahauddin Zakaria Shrine, him going to Hingol

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.360
[Guest]: Raj Mandir on his way to Mecca and all those aspects we need to bring in. So I started saying,

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.560
[Guest]: you know what, if my skill set is to get inside these hard to access zones, can I go once again

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.280
[Guest]: and bring together this narrative? And that's how this whole thing started, that I catapulted

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.040
[Guest]: myself last year in January into a journey that today we are performing. It's been now good 16

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.600
[Guest]: months on the road. And it's in the making of Allegria Tapestry Guru Nanak's travels. And I'll

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.600
[Amit Varma]: stop there. And maybe we can talk more about it later. Yeah, I want to come back to that later.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I find that whole project incredibly fascinating. But I have a few more questions about

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.840
[Amit Varma]: your travels through Pakistan. And one of them is this, that a lot of your photographs and by the

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.280
[Amit Varma]: way, your photography is absolutely excellent. I mean, it's hard for me to believe that you're

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.080
[Amit Varma]: a self-taught or an amateur or whatever, because this is beautiful. And a lot of them are of

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.440
[Amit Varma]: buildings and architecture and details of those. And it struck me that a lot of these are buildings

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.440
[Amit Varma]: and architecture that you have first read about. And, you know, and then you see them with your

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.000
[Amit Varma]: own eyes. For example, you've, you know, quoted Baron Carl Hugel's description of the Wazirabad

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.760
[Amit Varma]: Palace, and then you're actually there and you're seeing it with your own eyes. And in some cases,

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.640
[Amit Varma]: they're very dilapidated. They're in ruins. In some cases, they are being maintained and,

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, and in some places they don't even sort of exist. How is your sort of reaction to that?

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Are you reorienting your picture of Sikh Pakistan all the time as you travel through it, you know?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.520
[Guest]: First of all, let's correct this. I don't think I had read more than 15% of the monuments.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:21.200
[Guest]: So, I had read about, maybe it's a 15 to 20%. So, of course, I've read about the Attock Fort,

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.480
[Guest]: but I've not seen the Attock Fort. I don't know what Attock Fort looks like, right?

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.640
[Guest]: I know about Jamrud, but I can only imagine what Jamrud is. I've never seen it.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:35.840
[Guest]: Right? Okay. I've read about some of the Gurdwaras, Lahore Fort, some of the Gurdwaras,

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.480
[Guest]: historical Gurdwaras, period. And I know about what my intangible culture that my parents used

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.440
[Guest]: to talk about, or what we have seen the strands from my youth days and where we are today.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.800
[Guest]: I'm aware of these things, but that's all it is. As you get into the country, you are not going

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.240
[Guest]: with something that you know. You're going with an open crucible, with an empty crucible.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.160
[Guest]: It's a crucible of passion. And then the divine starts filling it up. In that moment,

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.120
[Guest]: you start observing it. Then when you come back and then you start looking at research

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.080
[Guest]: around it here and there, how do I fill it up? And therefore, in some of the places,

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.000
[Guest]: I can't tell you what the monument is about. I can't because I'm not a historian. I don't have

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.080
[Guest]: the facts. I don't have any published sources that are talking about it. So, I'm making the

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.760
[Guest]: most of telling you what I'm observing, because that can become a layer of history in time to

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.880
[Guest]: come. Wherever there's history available, I've quoted it, right? So, that's how one goes through

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:31.280
[Amit Varma]: it. And how do you warn against a tendency to try and romanticize what you're seeing? Like,

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.360
[Amit Varma]: to just kind of put that in perspective, I traveled through Pakistan when I was covering

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.240
[Amit Varma]: the cricket tour of 2006. And in fact, I, you know, went to the Gurdwara in Peshawar as well.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.960
[Amit Varma]: But while I was traveling, one tendency I noticed in myself and therefore tried to watch against

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.080
[Amit Varma]: was the tendency to exoticize everything, to see significance in everything. You know, while for

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.800
[Amit Varma]: the people there, they are just the everyday, they are the everyday and the mundane. And there are,

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.760
[Amit Varma]: of course, two sides to this. One is that an outsider brings with him eyes that look past

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.480
[Amit Varma]: the normalization. So, you can find interesting things which the locals might take for mundane,

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.080
[Amit Varma]: but actually is not. But the other side of it is that you try too hard to imbue meaning into

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.880
[Amit Varma]: everything that you see. And the locals are like, you know, who is this guy who's parachuted down,

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.320
[Amit Varma]: and he's finding this interesting and that interesting with these all our lives.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.720
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you thought about your own process of looking and how others viewed this?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:29.760
[Guest]: So, it's an interesting thing, you know, in my documentary, Peering Soul, I have inserted one

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:36.080
[Guest]: song, which is very much a feeling of my own state. When I'm at a Jambor village,

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.600
[Guest]: and it's Abhita Parveen's Sufi song, it says,

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.760
[Guest]: You made me a passionate person, you infuse passion in me, and I became passionate.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.600
[Guest]: Now, in this world of conscious people, so-called conscious inverted, don't make me a piece of

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.360
[Guest]: tamasha is a play or a spectacle. Yeah, don't make me that. Now, that's a very profound feeling I

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.160
[Guest]: had. Because then I would go into the places, people would crowd around me, it would cause a

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:16.240
[Guest]: sense of disturbance. And then there are places where the intelligence would be after me, places

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.160
[Guest]: where people would not open the gates, the places where people would embrace you, right? Potpourri

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:28.400
[Guest]: of emotions. But I'm making that statement in that Jambor village, because as I climb up on the

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.120
[Guest]: Gurdwara building, which is broken, I request a person on the other side of the building of the

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.600
[Guest]: Gurdwara to allow me to enter from his home and take a picture. First, he was absolutely closed.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.640
[Guest]: And to get inside a Muslim's home in that village with a purdah system, suddenly he agreed, and I

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.800
[Guest]: was inside. And I clicked a picture. At the same time, there were two, three people who were

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.720
[Guest]: shouting, get out, get out. But at the same time, the entire village had crowded around there and

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.520
[Guest]: looking at me walking on top. And I looked down and I said, I'm a source of play for them, right?

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.720
[Guest]: Source of tamasha for them. What I'm trying to get at is that in this whole play of things, you go

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:10.080
[Guest]: through a potpourri of challenges. And therefore, it's hard for you to kind of keep yourself focused

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.080
[Guest]: on what you're trying to do. And I've said this earlier, the idea is to just get as much

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.680
[Guest]: information and get out of that place. So it's hard for me to say that, you know,

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.400
[Guest]: the exact things that I would have done if I was a researcher, if I had free access,

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.160
[Guest]: maybe I would have put a staircase, I would have climbed up, I would have looked at each

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.320
[Guest]: artwork interpreted so differently, I would have spent maybe 10 days in a site.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.560
[Guest]: But that luxury does not exist. So there are going to be a lot of critiques about my work.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.680
[Guest]: And I say, you know what, critique it as much as you want to. The fact is, the situation does not

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.680
[Guest]: permit you to do that. Today, the situation might change because you've suddenly opened up the

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.760
[Guest]: Pandora's box about seeing the potential that exists there. And that needs to be seen in the

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.520
[Guest]: context of what you're doing as a leader into this domain. So what you were saying about is when

01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.560
[Guest]: you're getting inside, when you went in, you had this whole host of people looking at you and other

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.200
[Guest]: things. And how do you keep yourself aligned to your objective? It's hard, very, very hard,

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.680
[Guest]: very hard. And therefore, you have to be very focused as to why are you here.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, also, I think what eyes you're looking at your surroundings through,

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.640
[Amit Varma]: like if you bring eyes that are desperate to find meaning that are a collection of your biases and

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.480
[Amit Varma]: your feelings and your, you know, impressions, then that will influence whatever you're seeing.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Is that something where you thought that, okay, I you know, you already described that you weren't

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.000
[Amit Varma]: emotional during the, you know, during the process. So was your thing during the process

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.200
[Amit Varma]: of let me document everything now, I will process it later.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.320
[Guest]: You got to keep in mind, I didn't go to write the first book, I didn't go to write the second book,

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.320
[Guest]: I didn't go to make the documentaries. I was simply observing a mere observer.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.160
[Amit Varma]: But you were taking all these beautiful photographs.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.680
[Guest]: I was, I was trained as a photographer out of my quest for five years,

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.920
[Guest]: when I was writing for magazines, I'm, I'm capturing the moment for myself,

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:58.640
[Guest]: not to write a book is when I came back, I felt compelled to write it.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.760
[Guest]: But that moment, I'm just clicking it, maximizing, just getting out of that place.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.600
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what I'm going to do with it. I had no idea.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.960
[Amit Varma]: Would your journey have been different if you had gone there for the purpose of writing?

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.240
[Guest]: That's what I'm saying. So I don't know how different it would have been,

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.520
[Guest]: but I know it would have been much slower. And would it have been as successful? Maybe not.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.640
[Guest]: Because when you go in as a researcher, your mindset is, I'm going to now study this monument,

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.600
[Guest]: I want to look at 10 things. And I'm not a researcher from that context. I'm trying to

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.800
[Guest]: document, I'm just trying to feel things, right, and get out, right. And I have made

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.240
[Guest]: something compelling out of that. If I was going there as a researcher, let's say I was on a grant

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.320
[Guest]: or let's say going through a university, I would be on a very different frame of mind. In 30 days,

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.080
[Guest]: instead of 36 cities and villages, probably I would have done four. A book would have gone so

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:42.480
[Guest]: deep inside a subject. But this is about a bandwidth, which is horizontal.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.000
[Amit Varma]: This is breadth more than depth. And you're building a layer for others.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.680
[Guest]: I'm building a layer. There's a lot of depth if you really want to see it in terms of

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.640
[Guest]: Pakistan and Sikh legacy perspective. There's a lot of depth in it, but it's still at a wider

01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:01.200
[Guest]: horizontal space, right? You can pick up Nanak Panthis. I've devoted 110 pages.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.360
[Guest]: Pick up Nanak Panthis and I always say, I'm in touch with some Pakistanis and I tell them,

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.720
[Guest]: they're quite inspired with the talks that I've done in last Islamabad Literature Festival and

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.200
[Guest]: Karachi Literature Festival. Some academicians, they are saying that we want to study the Nanak

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.960
[Guest]: Panthis culture in Sindh and Balochistan. I said, by all means, do it because I will not

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.520
[Guest]: succeed in doing it. But I've planted the seed in you. I've given you 110 pages.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.800
[Guest]: Now you get inside it and you start creating the wells inside it to take you deep inside.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.440
[Guest]: But if you don't create this landscape, which has been absent for seven decades,

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.200
[Guest]: you can't hope that someone's going to drill a well. So I think that's where it is.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, now, courtesy you, I'm going to play another audio clip. And this comes from your trip

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.520
[Amit Varma]: to Lahore, where you met these Muslim descendants of Bhai Mardana. Bhai Mardana, of course, was

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Nanak's companion through his travels. So you meet Muslim descendants of his who are in Lahore

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:56.320
[Amit Varma]: and who've carried on a tradition of doing Shabad Kirtan, even though it's no longer the profession

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:00.160
[Amit Varma]: as it was for their forefathers. It's no longer what they do. They are laborers elsewhere and

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.040
[Amit Varma]: they're working at construction sites and all that. But they've kind of kept the passion alive.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'll briefly play this audio clip. And for those of you who listen to this podcast as higher

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:37.440
[Unknown]: speeds, as indeed I do, just for listening to this, please lower it to normal and then play.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:18.320
[Amit Varma]: So that was quite moving. And you also sort of I mean, I have two questions. One question is

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.560
[Amit Varma]: that there are these group of people who are Muslims, even though they're descendants of Bhai

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Mardana, and yet they're singing Shabad Kirtan and they don't get paid for it anymore, as their

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:32.480
[Amit Varma]: forefathers might have. Why are they doing it? Why do these traditions stay alive? What drives them?

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:40.960
[Guest]: Who you are is your DNA. It cannot be taken away by just one holocaust. You may try and erase that,

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.520
[Guest]: but deeply you are that, right? The more you'll try and erase it, the more the inside will revolt,

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.200
[Guest]: at least for some few people. Now, Bhai Mardana was the companion, a Muslim companion of Guru

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.400
[Guest]: Nanak, who held the Rabab and walked with him in nine countries. And whenever Guru Nanak wanted

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.560
[Guest]: to sing, Mardana would pick up the Rabab and play with him. They were best of friends.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:08.400
[Guest]: They were best of friends. 550 years back, Guru Nanak was born. So, do we think that 550 years

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.800
[Guest]: later, there'll be only one family of the descendants of Mardana? Obviously not. There'll

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.360
[Guest]: be many, right? But yet, I can only talk about one right now, right? Or maybe two. What I'm trying to

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.120
[Guest]: say is that the vast number of people have assimilated into many other things, but this

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.440
[Amit Varma]: island of one or two people. They're outliers. So, I'm a bias in a sense. You met them because

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.240
[Guest]: they're outliers. They're outliers and they're holding on because they are, for some reason,

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.000
[Guest]: having that seed planted in their roots, in their DNA, right? That's what is holding them,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.800
[Guest]: but the majority have moved away. So, I've often asked this question that I've, now we're getting

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.840
[Guest]: into the realm of the making of Aligriya Tapestry of Guru Nanak's Travels, which has been a project

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:54.320
[Guest]: that we've been working on for the last 16 months. And I was in Pakistan from February to April, May

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.480
[Guest]: last year. And in my earlier trips I've gone, I've always met this family of descendants of

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.600
[Guest]: Bhai Mardana. And I've also had an opportunity of meeting many more people. But what I'm going

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.000
[Guest]: to get at is the fundamental question that I've asked myself in the making of Aligriya Tapestry

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.880
[Guest]: of Guru Nanak's Travels, which is a multi-episode documentary on his travels across nine nations.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:21.040
[Guest]: I've asked, the entire community moved away of Nanak Panthis from the lands of Indus.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.640
[Guest]: And yet, is Baba Nanak alive in those lands? Because Baba Nanak as a physical

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.880
[Guest]: body, of course, is no more there. But his thoughts, are they still alive? It's a question

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.280
[Guest]: that you pose yourself. And then I've had this chance to meet many such people. And before I

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.080
[Guest]: get down to the Bhai Mardanas, I want to talk about, I have had the opportunity, which people

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:51.360
[Guest]: will find very interesting, to sit in congregations every Friday evening, where the Granth Sahib's

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:58.240
[Guest]: one verse is picked up. And people from the age of 16, boys, young boy and girl from the age of 16

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.320
[Guest]: to the ripened age of 80, discuss one Shabad. Where is this? In Lahore. And they're all Muslims.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:12.320
[Guest]: And they're all Muslims. Baba Nanak is yet alive, I firmly believe, in islands, but he's alive.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.120
[Guest]: People who have love for him, they may be doing it in closed doors. And I've had opportunities to

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.760
[Guest]: go there, sit down. I could not videograph them, because for all valid reasons, I could have

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.600
[Guest]: been respectful. They didn't want to. But when I look at that, I say, oh, he is still here.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.520
[Guest]: This is beyond faith. This is about Punjabis, beyond faith, Muslims getting together and

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:38.800
[Guest]: discussing Baba Nanak's Shabads every Friday evening. And then you look at the descendants

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.960
[Guest]: of Bhai Mardana. Bhai Lalji is Jatha. And I remember in 2014, when I went to Lahore first

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:50.000
[Guest]: time as a Dehradar Sahib Gurdwara, I met the Babaji there, who had come for 10 minutes of Kirtan.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.080
[Guest]: There was no one sitting there, no audience, and he was doing the Kirtan. And I asked him,

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.600
[Guest]: and I said, I'm deeply touched that, you know, you've kept the tradition alive,

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.120
[Guest]: but I want to go to their home. And they were very warm. And they said, yes, we would love you to

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.480
[Guest]: take you home. But we apologise, we can't take you home. Because since partition, our forefathers

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.840
[Guest]: used to do Kirtan in the Golden Temple Darbar Sahib and Goindwal Sahib in Punjab. The partition

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.320
[Guest]: was so brutal that, you know, we got thrust on this side and the patrons who would hear us all

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.480
[Unknown]: moved on the other side. Basically, Sikhs and Hindus all moved on the other side. So we landed

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.520
[Guest]: in this place, there was no one to hear. And we are living in poverty, we do daily labour, and we

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.360
[Guest]: just make our ends meet. And there is no Sikh who has come to our home till date. And we are afraid

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.880
[Guest]: that if you will come with your turban, people will, our neighbours will pass judgments. I left

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.200
[Guest]: it. I didn't go back. But every time I would go, I would call them up and we would meet outside.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:47.440
[Guest]: But you know, in last year, in February 2019, I was there for Guru Nanak's tapestry, Guru Nanak

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:53.200
[Guest]: Starvels making. And I asked the Baba again, I said, Baba, take me to your home now, we are here for Guru Nanak Starvels.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.560
[Guest]: And then he had seen me for four, five years. He said, okay, come, let's go. So he took us to his

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.440
[Guest]: home. And on his roof, we sat and we recorded him and his entire family. Which is a recording,

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.440
[Guest]: I just played a while back. Yes. And the beauty of the whole thing is so everyone had crowded on top

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.160
[Guest]: and they were looking at them playing from the roofs in Lahore. And we got a drone picture of

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:21.120
[Unknown]: them, everyone looking at them, right. So the beauty is that after we left, a week later, the Baba

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:28.160
[Guest]: calls me up. He says, son, an amazing thing happened. I said, what? He said, no one said

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.320
[Guest]: anything to us. No one complained. Yeah. I said, why should they? Did we do anything wrong?

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.320
[Guest]: We were there as a message of love. You were there to shower love. We were talking about

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:44.720
[Guest]: positivities, right. He said, no, you don't know. So I said, no, I respect. But he says,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.160
[Guest]: but the amazing thing is no one has said anything. What happened is that the veil of fear dropped

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.360
[Guest]: that day. And after that, I would find that, you know, last year was the 550th birth anniversary

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.440
[Guest]: of Guru Nanak. A lot of people were coming in. And he would proudly send a picture of every second

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.480
[Unknown]: person coming to his home. He says, oh, the following has come, the following has come,

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:10.000
[Guest]: following has come. And I would smile and say, we have just broken the barriers, right. So I think

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.280
[Guest]: that's the thing that I want to give as a message that when we talk, then we become closer. The

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:24.000
[Guest]: Radcliffe line has divided us so badly that a composite culture has got cracked. So basically,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.400
[Guest]: I think that's the strand. And, you know, then there are many I've met who are also

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.040
[Guest]: yet learning Kirtan. They do it in their own quarters. They're Muslims. They're learning

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:39.360
[Guest]: Kirtan. The beauty of Punjab was that there are pockets who would respect the Vedanta,

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:44.240
[Guest]: respect the Granth Sahib aspect. And there were also many Hindus and Sikhs who would also,

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.520
[Guest]: vice versa, respect the Islamic and Sufi saints. And embrace multiple identities of their

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.320
[Guest]: traditions. So there's a beautiful book. If you go a little bit down from Punjab and into enter

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.040
[Guest]: into Sindh now, there's a beautiful book by, I forget his second name, but it's Ramse. If you

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:06.640
[Guest]: search for Ramse, and the title is Hindu Muslim Sikh question mark, right? It could be the other

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.000
[Guest]: way around also. It could be Hindu Sikh Muslim. I don't know. I'll link it from the show notes.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.960
[Guest]: Yeah, it's Hindu Muslim Sikh. It's got a question mark. The question mark in that study is about

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.400
[Guest]: this Gora, this English man who's studying this community of the Nanak Panthis. And he's questioning

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.560
[Guest]: who are they? Are they Hindus? Are they Muslims? Are they Sikhs? Because for them,

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:31.520
[Guest]: Ya Allah, Hey Ram, Vaheguru, all come in at the moment when they have to say something.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.080
[Guest]: They're all a part of the culture. So this was the people of Indus belt.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of moving piece of music, which I'm going to play now again, is from a singer named

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Salima Khwaja from Lahore. And the backstory of this is that she learned music from a singer

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.040
[Amit Varma]: called Ghulam Chand. And Ghulam Chand was the sole carrier of a musical legacy that he nurtured all

01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.640
[Amit Varma]: alone for many, many years, till Salima Khwaja came to learn from him in Lahore. And now she

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.760
[Guest]: carries it forward. Tell me a little bit about what that was. So there were many descendants of

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.320
[Guest]: Bhai Mardana. And we just talked about one family. And then there was another one,

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.840
[Guest]: Bhai Ghulam Chand, who passed away about, I think, six years back. And he used to do Kirtan at the

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.960
[Guest]: Gurdwara in the Goindwal Sahib in East Punjab. And he also got thrust because of the unfortunate

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:32.480
[Guest]: partition on this side. But I don't see him actually actively performing in places. I've

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.640
[Guest]: not seen much of his recordings actually performing. So he was more of doing it for

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.040
[Guest]: himself. What he was doing for a living, I don't know. But when I stumbled upon him,

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:46.960
[Guest]: he was very aged. And he was basically doing, there were some people who had found him and

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.960
[Guest]: they were recording him sitting at his home and some private gatherings here and there.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:58.400
[Guest]: There are some people who were quite fascinated by his style of singing. So this is Rababi style,

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:04.400
[Guest]: you know, the Mardana's family style and singing Gurbani, singing Kabir, singing Nanak,

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.720
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. So some of the locals in Pakistan started going to him to learn.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.360
[Guest]: One of them was Salima. She went to him for learning Kirtan at 15 years of age.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.680
[Guest]: Not 15 years of age, sorry. She went to learn with him about 15 years back.

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.840
[Guest]: And today, the Baba is no longer there. He's passed away. But Salima has learned that tradition

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:37.280
[Guest]: and taken it forward. So to me, this is Bhai Mardana's DNA, which did not pass through the

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:43.280
[Guest]: blood lineage, has found another place to be seated in. It lives on in the culture. Yeah,

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:50.320
[Guest]: and it's found in the lady. It's crossing genders now. So Guru Nanak's quest continues from two

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:56.720
[Guest]: males traveling to now in Pakistan, a female now traveling with Baba Nanak in the form of Mardana.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:02.400
[Amit Varma]: So I think he's still alive. Let's listen to this piece of music. Once again, if you're listening

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:30.240
[Unknown]: at a higher speed, just bring it to normal for this. This will be the last such interruption.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.240
[Amit Varma]: That was beautiful. So tell me, Amardeep, you know, one of the things I noticed when I traveled

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:12.320
[Amit Varma]: briefly in 2006, so obviously I was essentially just a tourist, is how warm the people were,

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.520
[Amit Varma]: by and large. On your travels where you actually traveled much deeper and you were going from

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.480
[Amit Varma]: village to village, town to town almost, how did the people treat you and how did they treat your

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.880
[Guest]: quest? Let's try and answer this at a stratospheric level first. I think everywhere, and we've traveled

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.920
[Guest]: far and wide in different countries. I think first and foremost, the principle is as you think,

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.840
[Guest]: so you attract. So I think before we ask how people treated you, I think we need to ask how

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.640
[Guest]: you treated the people. Because if you treated them well enough, they will respond the same way.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.080
[Guest]: People want to live together. People want to hug each other. People want to be closer to each

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.800
[Guest]: other. People want to understand each other's stories. The pain is not mine. The pain is theirs

01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.560
[Guest]: too. The pain is yours too. We are all collectively impacted with it. And if you can understand that

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:06.000
[Guest]: from a humane perspective, why will people not connect with you? I think that's the principle

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000
[Guest]: that we need to first understand. If you're going into research work like this, you're going to go

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.520
[Guest]: deep inside. You're going to go deep inside where others are not going. If you go to Lahore,

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.000
[Guest]: oh, a Sikh coming into the turban, or you coming in from India, of course, you know,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.960
[Guest]: that's like more like a hullaballah, you know, just Mela kind of a thing. Now you're going deep

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:30.640
[Guest]: inside villages. That's where the true element will come out, right? By and large, people want

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.320
[Guest]: to embrace each other. Beyond faith, beyond religion, as humans, we want to associate with

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.480
[Guest]: each other. Our conditioning might have to be dropped because we might have certain conditioning,

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.240
[Guest]: this is not right, it's wrong, but all that will drop as you start gaining confidence. So people

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.120
[Guest]: are good by nature, but it's all about how you think. But having said that, I think the job is

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:54.880
[Guest]: not easy. Because people want to live together, but the sovereign nations and the politics of it

01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:01.840
[Guest]: and what we've created, and for all fair reasons, the fear factors. Sort of narratives we feed our

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:06.720
[Guest]: people. Yeah. And that comes from a political aspect, right? There are people who get paid

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.680
[Guest]: to do their jobs of keeping a watch on you and other things. Maybe that person who's keeping a

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.480
[Guest]: watch on me, when I sit down for a cup of tea, he will drop his guard and he'll become the same

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.160
[Guest]: person, but he's doing a job. You've got to understand that he's doing a job. And that's

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.480
[Guest]: in both sides of the border. They have a job to do. So that's one aspect. That's where the problems

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.600
[Guest]: start coming in. But deep down, they're also human beings. Having said that, when you start peeling

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.680
[Guest]: the layers and start going down, most of the experiences of people going to Pakistan in our

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:42.560
[Guest]: domain is in Punjab. And you also said you've been to Lahore, maximum Peshawar, it's just a bit off,

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.760
[Guest]: right? But you will find in, let's say in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there's a cultural sensitivity that

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.560
[Guest]: comes in. Punjabi by nature are more welcoming, you know, Punjab will be, you know, you feel at

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:58.000
[Guest]: home. But when you go to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the cultural aspect starts coming in. The barriers,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.120
[Guest]: not that people are, people are very nice, but the barrier is there to break that.

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.680
[Guest]: They're speaking Pashto instead of Urdu to begin with.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.040
[Guest]: Even if you start, let's say there are people who speak in Urdu, even if you're speaking in Urdu,

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:12.560
[Guest]: it takes a little bit more effort to break the barrier. People are nice, but it'll take a little

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:15.600
[Guest]: bit. And then the cultural sensitivity, you just can't barge into anyone's home and stuff like

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.640
[Guest]: that. So that becomes a bit of a barrier. I think Kashmir is a bit of an interesting space because

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.320
[Guest]: Kashmir hasn't been in turmoil state for long enough. So Kashmir, I break it down into two

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.800
[Guest]: kinds of people. One is Baltistan, where I've had a lot of chance to go. Baltistan, the Balti people,

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:34.080
[Guest]: very nice people, very nice. It's not impacted by the Kashmir issue of the partition, you know.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.320
[Guest]: I mean, the claiming of territories might be there, but people are not impacted by the crossfires

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.960
[Guest]: and other things. Very nice people. It's the Kashmir where my forefathers were from,

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.720
[Guest]: Muzaffarabad, which is right on the LOC, just next to it, right? Now there is a swapping of

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:55.360
[Guest]: population. There is bad blood that has flown in for long enough. There is doubt, there is suspicion.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.480
[Guest]: So I've not had major interactions then. I can't say any negative interaction, but neither have I

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.800
[Guest]: had any memorable, positive interaction to talk about. And then you go into Sindh. It becomes

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.960
[Guest]: very interesting that in Sindh, as I said, Hindu, Muslims, Sikh, question mark, Ramsay's work. These

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.160
[Guest]: are people, whether they are Muslims or they're Hindus or whatever they are, they are the Nanak

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.600
[Guest]: Panthis. They're all composite. Very interesting breed of people, the Sindhis are. Very interesting,

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.160
[Guest]: least understood, very interesting people. But now from the Northern and Central Sindh,

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:32.720
[Guest]: now you come down to a place called Karachi where the population swap happened in 1947.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.000
[Guest]: Who is the inhabitant of Karachi? It's people from UP and Bihar who came inside and that's where the

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.440
[Guest]: politics of the nation started. So they came in there. Now, let's not forget when partition

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:49.040
[Guest]: happened, the cleansing happened on both the sides. The UP-Bihar people who came to Karachi

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:55.040
[Guest]: in the period of July, August, September, their story is not about what happened to Punjab.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:02.080
[Guest]: Where did it start from? It starts from, we moved towards our homeland in Karachi and from Punjab,

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.840
[Guest]: in the East Punjab, they faced massacres too because there was massacres happening in West

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:12.400
[Guest]: Punjab. It was a tit for tat. So their impressions that have come down through the generation is that

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:18.720
[Guest]: we faced this onslaught on us when we were passing through Punjab. But that memory is ingrained

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:24.240
[Guest]: somewhere is my experience. When I talk to people, they're nice, they're all great, but there's a

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.120
[Guest]: memory which is there. It's a conditioned memory. No one has a historical understanding of

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.800
[Guest]: what led to the partition of Punjab. Where did it start from? What's the root cause? Because they

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.160
[Guest]: were coming from UP-Bihar, which is far away. Their narrative starts, I got, my father or my

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.840
[Guest]: grandfather experienced this in East Punjab. The narrative starts from there. So there's a

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.120
[Amit Varma]: mistrust deep down, potentially could be there. And I guess the first time they meet you,

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:53.360
[Amit Varma]: they're not looking at you as an individual per se, but there's all this baggage of that past,

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.240
[Guest]: which is sort of there. So that's how I would define it. So there's a stratospheric level.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.600
[Guest]: And then by and large, whichever place they may be from, it's how you think that's what you'll

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.120
[Guest]: attract. I think that's the principle. But then these are layers inside it. And that's what I

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.920
[Guest]: just want to expand on. And the same layers in India also. Each state will have a different layer,

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.120
[Guest]: different thinking. UP-Bihar is different than Punjab and South India and everything.

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.400
[Guest]: It's the same thing. But by and large in India, why would someone not live and embrace a person

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:25.840
[Guest]: without, irrespective of his religion or faith, right? Same thing. And you have another really

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.920
[Amit Varma]: nice story about how you went to the Daftu Gurdwara and this gentleman came to you and said,

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.360
[Amit Varma]: listen, I'm too poor to give you a gift, but I really want to give you something. So here's a

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:43.040
[Unknown]: pouch of opium. Did you take it? So certain things are kept secret, right? I have taken opium. I have

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.800
[Unknown]: taken even higher drugs than opium. I'm on synthetic drug because these passions are driven

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:53.920
[Unknown]: by druggy state. I'm just joking. But these are even a higher dose of opium, right? I'm on a drug

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.880
[Unknown]: state to do this work where you're risking your life. The high of the work. Yeah. It's like,

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.320
[Unknown]: I don't need an opium, which grows inside the poppy. My opium is something else, right?

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.200
[Guest]: So just coming to that, there are two very interesting things happened in Daftu.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.600
[Guest]: It's an abandoned Gurdwara. Not abandoned, people are living inside it. What happened,

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.280
[Guest]: unfortunately, in partition is that you've got to put the landscape correct. You know,

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.560
[Guest]: both the sides suffered. Islamic legacy got wiped out of East Punjab. Hindu and Sikh legacy got

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:26.800
[Guest]: wiped out. Jain legacy, no one talks about it. Entire Thakpur Kar is filled with Jain site.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:30.480
[Guest]: I always say to Pakistan, if you really want to develop your potential,

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.160
[Guest]: also look at not just the Hindu and Sikh aspects. Don't look at Katas Raj and Kartarpur only.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:42.000
[Guest]: Look at the huge amount of Jain temples, which are lying abandoned. It's a huge legacy that

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.840
[Guest]: needs to be also brought on the forefront. But you need to understand who these are,

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:49.200
[Guest]: because you've forgotten, not understood them, right? So when partition happened,

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.280
[Guest]: and people came from East Punjab, there was a humanitarian crisis. You needed a roof on their

01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:01.680
[Guest]: heads. You needed food. People were on their own. They went whatever they got. Gurdwaras typically

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.240
[Guest]: are congregational, and they have huge space. Temples typically are small plinth areas.

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.880
[Guest]: So they could not host people inside, right? Abandoned structures. A lot of people moved

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:14.080
[Guest]: inside Gurdwaras and made them their homes, especially in remote areas.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:19.520
[Guest]: Daftu is one such Gurdwara. It's a fortress-like Gurdwara made from thin bricks, which dates back

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:23.840
[Guest]: to, which points towards Ranjit Singh's period. Beautiful structure, beautiful fresco works,

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:29.280
[Guest]: but it's in a bad state now. So I went in there. First and foremost, this huge gathering of the

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:36.800
[Guest]: villagers came by, right? And someone asked me at the entrance, Sardar Sahib, what is written on top?

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:44.960
[Guest]: And it was Guru Nanak's verse of Japji, God is one, right? Truth. He's truth, right? He's the

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.160
[Guest]: creator and so on and so forth. So I basically then was standing there and described to the

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.200
[Guest]: person. I said, this is saying that Allah is one. Yeah. I have to talk in their language.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.840
[Guest]: And then I went inside and this man who's staying inside the Gurdwara, he comes to me and

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:02.720
[Guest]: is a very emotional. One of those few moments when I was really emotionally touched. He tells me

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:08.880
[Guest]: in Punjabi, he says, he holds, folds his hand, he says, I apologize. Say it in the original Punjabi

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:15.840
[Guest]: if you want to. Yeah. So he says, Sardar Sahib, maafi mangde hain. Saade kol uthe sirf do

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:22.000
[Guest]: waqt di roti seegi. Ish Punjab, from where he came. Saade kol uthe sirf do waqt di roti seegi.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:28.640
[Guest]: Gadar vich asi ithe aage, in partition we came here. Gadar vich asi ithe aage, pinda pinda firde

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.600
[Guest]: rahe, te daftu aa poche. Gurdwara khaadi seega, asi andar badge. Asi taan to ithe rahe hain.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:42.080
[Guest]: Maafi mangde hain, taadi imarat nahi sambhal sake. He's saying, in the Holocaust, we came from

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.480
[Guest]: East Punjab. We went through different villages and finally we came to Daftu. And we took place

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:52.960
[Guest]: inside shelter inside this Gurdwara. And I really apologize that I could not maintain your Gurdwara.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:58.880
[Guest]: Because asi uthe ek waqt di roti kamande se, athe aaj bhi ek waqt di roti kama rahe hain. We were

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.840
[Guest]: only earning one bread there and one bread we earn here. We are still poor, but we could not

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:12.240
[Guest]: maintain it. That tells you the humane aspect of this entire crisis. He feels it, right? That

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:17.440
[Guest]: someone has come. And then as I'm coming out and I'm leaving, there's a person comes in, again

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:24.000
[Unknown]: another old man, right? Whom I'm talking about. He comes in and he holds my hand before I'm leaving.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:31.040
[Guest]: He says, Sardar sahib, mere naal aao. He says, Sardar ji, come with me. I walk with him on the side.

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:37.280
[Guest]: I thought he's going to talk about something. And he opens his, from his shirt, he opens a small

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:44.240
[Guest]: knot. And he says, sade kul den waste kuch nahi hain. Thodi ji afeem hai laelo tusi. You know, I have

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:48.640
[Unknown]: nothing to give you. The little opium lying here, please take it. And I started laughing, right?

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.280
[Amit Varma]: I was touched by that moment. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. Let's talk about your current

01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.720
[Amit Varma]: project now, retracing the steps of Guru Nanak and his travels. First of all, how do you determine

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:05.680
[Amit Varma]: where Guru Nanak went? Because he didn't write about it himself. Yeah, it's a good question. So

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:13.120
[Guest]: you are embarking on a massive project in 550 years after his life, right? And we are trying to

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:18.080
[Guest]: retrace his footsteps through visual documentation. I'm very clear in my mind. I am a human,

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.680
[Guest]: I will make mistakes. But I don't want to create new history. Because I know the beautiful,

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:30.880
[Guest]: pristine philosophy of Guru Nanak, which is beyond the tangibles. His first profound verse itself

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.160
[Guest]: talks about the vastness of his philosophy, stands reduced and limited today to tangibles,

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:42.880
[Guest]: to miracles, to tangibles. All these humans who had powers can do miracles, but that's not

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:49.840
[Guest]: what their philosophy is about. They are beyond miracles. They, being humans, are transforming

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:55.920
[Guest]: lives is a miracle by itself. They're teaching someone about how to live is a miracle by itself.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.560
[Guest]: And yet today, we have reduced him to in this place, he took out water from the well,

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.680
[Guest]: and that place he implanted some impression and this and that. It's all magic and everything.

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:14.160
[Guest]: His ability to implant an impression in your heart and dig into the wells of your heart

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:19.200
[Guest]: is forgotten. So there's a big problem on how you're going to present Guru Nanak first at an

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:27.040
[Guest]: allegoric level. This is allegory, a tapestry of Guru Nanak's travels. A tapestry of Guru Nanak's

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:30.960
[Guest]: travels is easy to understand. It's like the fabric, the warp and the weft of his travels.

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.360
[Guest]: We can actually link it up. And we'll come to that, how you're going to determine that. But

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:40.800
[Guest]: the bigger thing is allegory. Allegory is actually a revelation of a hidden meaning.

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:48.400
[Guest]: Nanak today is not understood. I'm not a preacher. I'm not a theologian. But I have a probing in

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:52.560
[Guest]: this entire journey that I want to understand Nanak, who he is through these places. Why was

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.960
[Guest]: he traveling? What was he communicating? And that allegoric meaning has to be revealed.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:03.920
[Guest]: That he has written. The beauty of Nanak is, unlike Babar, who writes his Babar Nama,

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.200
[Guest]: or unlike Jahangir, who writes Tuzak-e-Jahangiri,

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:16.880
[Guest]: or unlike Ranjit Singh, who commissions to write Umdat-u-Tariq, Nanak only compiles

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:22.640
[Guest]: spiritual verses that tell us how to lead a life, the psychology of a life, the inner being.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:28.960
[Guest]: And that becomes later on a part of the Granth Sahib. He writes nothing about himself. Nothing.

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.160
[Guest]: And yet you then want to make a documentary on his travels. So where are you going to start from?

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.560
[Guest]: Because if your objective is not to create another new version of Nanak's travel, because

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.000
[Guest]: I sometimes jokingly say that Nanak in today's day is traveling further and further. Even in

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.880
[Guest]: 550 years after his life, every second day in the web university, or in the WhatsApp university,

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:56.720
[Guest]: or in Facebook, he's reaching newer and newer places. So I think Nanak needs to be left alone.

01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:02.240
[Guest]: We need to understand his philosophy. But yet we are attempting to map out his travels. How are

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.960
[Guest]: we going to do it? You have to then look at what's the documented sources. Now documented sources

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.520
[Guest]: are written by men of faith. And if he has not written it, these are not primary sources.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.920
[Guest]: Or someone living in his time has not written it, these are not primary sources. The first text

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:21.280
[Guest]: that appears is by Bhai Gurdas, who writes during the times of the Sikh gurus, but some 50 years

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.640
[Guest]: after his life. But he writes, Guru Nanak and Mardana traveled far and wide. And they went on

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:32.480
[Guest]: Udasis. Far and wide, but he specifically mentions four places, but he does not say that's what is

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.680
[Guest]: limited to. He travels far and wide, he's acknowledging, but he says he went to Sumer,

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:43.360
[Guest]: which is Kailash. He went to Baghdad. He went to Makkah. He went to Batala, where the Shivites and

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:48.240
[Guest]: the Sidhs used to sit. And then he says he traveled far and wide, not big enough to make a narrative

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.920
[Guest]: out of it. So then you move forward in timeline and you come across the first text that the men

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:59.680
[Guest]: of faith have written, which is known as Janam Sakis. Like the Buddhist Jatakas are there. So

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.920
[Guest]: like that, the Janam Sakis are written by men of faith, but seven to 10 decades after his life.

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.280
[Guest]: You can't throw the baby in the bathtub because that's the only source available to you. You have

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.760
[Guest]: to accept it. There may be human errors inside it, but that's the only source you have, documented

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:16.000
[Guest]: source. So you take this composite literature written seven to 10 decades after his lifetime,

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:23.200
[Guest]: and we draw a line there. We said we will make an assimilation of this and take out the journey

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:28.320
[Guest]: that he did out of this. Later on, texts continue to make him travel further and further and further.

01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:32.960
[Guest]: We've drawn a line at the hundred years. That's it. So we are mapping that and as per that,

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:40.480
[Guest]: he's traveled to nine countries. Today, in fact, in the 550th year celebration of Guru Nanak's

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:47.600
[Guest]: travels, there was a book that was released by Indian High Commission in Kathmandu.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:54.160
[Guest]: And it's about the Sikh sites in Nepal. And there's a lot of mention there of Guru Nanak

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:59.360
[Guest]: having come here, coming there, come there, not backed by any old texts. And they're confusing

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.760
[Guest]: it with the Udasi tradition who came in after the fall of the Sikh empire. And Rani Jindan,

02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:10.640
[Guest]: actually, who was the wife of Ranjit Singh, was given refuge by Nepal Naresh. She was captured

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:15.680
[Guest]: in the Chunar Fort and from where she escapes. Thereafter, a lot of these Udasi shrines come up

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:21.040
[Guest]: because they have old Granth Sahib, the old handwritten Granth Sahib. Today, people are

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.040
[Guest]: just randomly going and everyone can say anything and they say that Guru Nanak came here and so on

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:29.600
[Guest]: and so forth. So like that, Guru Nanak has been sent to Rome, to Turkey, to every place. I was

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:36.320
[Guest]: in Rome and I met the Pope's office and we explored it. There's some reference someone wrote on the

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:42.640
[Guest]: website. And once you write something that becomes imprinted, right? So 10 years back, something was

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:50.160
[Guest]: written, 2006, about 13 years back. And some person from the Rome, he's quoted from the Vatican

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.360
[Guest]: and the Pope and his office deny it. We don't have any references here of that. So here you're

02:00:55.360 --> 02:01:00.400
[Guest]: struggling with, someone writes just out of his faith and belief, nothing mentioned in texts of

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.720
[Guest]: 100 years. And then suddenly Guru Nanak has now reached Rome. Today, you find it hard to rationalise.

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:08.880
[Guest]: So in this whole context, we restricted ourselves to the oldest primary text because there itself,

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:15.360
[Guest]: if you can document that, it's a huge and humongous task because 70% of the area geographical expanse

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.920
[Guest]: is not accessible because it's all in conflict zones. You will be able to go to three Gurdwaras

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.840
[Guest]: in Pakistan. How will you go into Balochistan? How will you go to Hinglaj? Carry a camera to

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:30.720
[Guest]: Hinglaj temple? Who's going to allow you? You go behind an Indus region from Indus river in the

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.360
[Guest]: Baltistan area when he's coming from Kailash Mansarovar into Ladakh and then comes into Kashmir

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:42.160
[Guest]: and from that area, how will you get into behind Kargil? It sounds impossible. Leave alone Iraq

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.480
[Guest]: and Iran. Iraq, Iran, it's a different ballgame. How will you go to Mansarovar and take out a camera

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.240
[Guest]: to film? The Chinese government is not going to allow you. And then from there, walk up to the

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:56.080
[Guest]: Himachal border or walk up to Pangong Tso on the China side. How are you going to do it?

02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:02.480
[Guest]: It seems impossible. And yet when you walked, it happened. So two questions for you. One is

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.520
[Amit Varma]: obviously clear to me that, you know, Nanak is one of the great travellers of those times,

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.120
[Amit Varma]: but unlike others like Yohun Sang and whoever, who are, you know, Marco Polo, who are celebrated

02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:17.280
[Amit Varma]: as travellers, I think a little less of his travels is known probably because he didn't

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.760
[Amit Varma]: write about it himself. So one question is how did he actually get around? Those are the days

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.240
[Amit Varma]: before sort of mass transport exists. There are no flights, there are no trains, there's none of that.

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.800
[Amit Varma]: How is he getting around from place to place? What is he exactly doing? What is the nature of

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:39.600
[Amit Varma]: his quest? Like clearly he is engaging in dialogue with all kinds of people to get greater clarity

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.920
[Amit Varma]: and to spread his ideas. What is that process like? And the second question, which we can come

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:49.120
[Amit Varma]: to later, is that in these times where borders do exist, how did you manage to go to all these

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.880
[Guest]: places? So I don't know whether Nanak was meeting people to spread his ideas. I don't know. Some

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:59.840
[Guest]: people may not like what I'm saying. Because if we treat Nanak as a human being first, then there's

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.640
[Amit Varma]: a quest that he's on. In fact, one of the places you visited in Pakistan and photograph was Nanak

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Tibba, which is this mound where Nanak compiled the verses of Baba Farid. He collated it. He

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.680
[Guest]: collated it. So it's a quest for understanding from what. Absolutely. So one third of his life,

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:20.720
[Guest]: he doesn't move out. The other part of his life, the second or the third part of his life,

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:27.360
[Guest]: he goes on a quest for 22 years. In the last of the three phases of his life, he settles down in

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.800
[Guest]: Kartarpur. My sense is, this is purely my sense, having travelled on these parts, and I've been

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.120
[Guest]: a person on a quest also, when you're travelling, you're meeting so many people, a lot of things,

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:42.320
[Guest]: you're congregating, you're listening, you're imparting, you're hearing, but it's a two-way

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:49.680
[Guest]: process. You can't just be giving, giving, giving. It's a two-way process. If you treat Nanak as a

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:56.240
[Guest]: human being, the process of growth happens by hearing and imparting. Is there a mapping of

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.040
[Amit Varma]: that growth? Like, do we have a sense of how his thinking changed during this quest? Yeah,

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.280
[Guest]: so just let me just complete this. So then you come to the third part of his life, where he

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.280
[Guest]: settled on Kartarpur. I think that's where he started getting a congregation. That's where he

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.840
[Guest]: passed the betan. So I always think about it. Why is it that the Kabir Panthis did not have a

02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.000
[Guest]: structured group that following? I mean, theoretically, Kabir Panthis could have also

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.800
[Guest]: formed an empire at one point of time, like the Sikhs did it. I think that military aspect came

02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:27.520
[Guest]: much later. But it was because Nanak and Kabir had one, they were similar, but they did one thing

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:33.760
[Guest]: different. Nanak passed a leadership betan to the second guru, and betan passed down for 10 gurus.

02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:40.000
[Guest]: Kabir did not pass him. So Kabir only remained at a realm where he was a bit less hardened.

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:45.760
[Guest]: So what I'm coming to is that Nanak was on a quest, he traveled, and he traveled on a two-way

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.400
[Guest]: process. But where was he traveling is the question. If you look at the structure in his

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:57.280
[Guest]: mappings, wherever we've been, there is a spiritual congregation in that place where he was going to

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:06.880
[Guest]: go, of that time. Spiritual congregation either associated with myth, reality, but people were

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:13.120
[Guest]: coming there. For him, interaction with people was the most important. Whether it was at Haridwar,

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:17.920
[Guest]: he gave the profound message of, if you're doing shraddh, if you're giving water to your parents

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:24.240
[Guest]: who passed away, or your forefathers, and if that can reach by putting the water towards the sun

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:31.120
[Guest]: to that passed away generation, then I can turn the other way around and water my fields in Punjab,

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:36.000
[Guest]: and this water should reach smaller distance here. So he was trying to rationalize. Basically,

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.880
[Guest]: he was going to places where people would congregate. And that took him then to places

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:48.080
[Guest]: of Islamic, Sufi, Jain, Buddhist, a lot of Hindu sites, Jogis, and he would congregate with them.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.240
[Guest]: So when you understand that, then you start questioning, okay, how did he travel then?

02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:57.760
[Guest]: Not a rocket science. Not a rocket science at all. From Punjab, people were traveling to Makkah.

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:02.800
[Guest]: How were they traveling? There were two routes. One would get them along the Indus,

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:08.080
[Guest]: maybe get onto a boat, maybe walk down. You can do about 20 kilometers a day.

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.880
[Guest]: And you get down to Sindh. From Sindh, you go via Balochistan into Iran, and then you reach

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:21.280
[Guest]: to the desert route into Makkah. The other one was you go down into the Arabian Sea and take a

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:27.200
[Guest]: boat from there and sail into Makkah. Both are possible. People were doing it. So Nanak also did

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:31.680
[Guest]: that same thing for a certain period of his time. But the difference was that they would come back,

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:37.040
[Guest]: and he went on the old pilgrimage route to Baghdad, but people from Baghdad would also come.

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:41.680
[Guest]: From there, he turned into Afghanistan. People would from Afghanistan also go that way. He came

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:51.040
[Guest]: on that route. People from India would go to Mansarovar, Kailash. From time immemorial,

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:56.480
[Guest]: they're going. The Sidh used to sit there. The Nath yogis used to sit there. And he went along

02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:02.160
[Guest]: from the Badrinath area, along the passes into Kailash and Mansarovar. It's just a few days'

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:09.280
[Guest]: trek. People were doing it. Through Shivkila Pass, they went from there. So if you really

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:16.800
[Guest]: break down his travels, which on a macro level looks like a huge landscape, actually break into

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:21.920
[Guest]: small chunks, it's all doable. But he was only going to places where spiritualists congregate.

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it's a 22 years' travel. And do you have a sense of his intellectual evolution

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.480
[Amit Varma]: in this period? Like he's going to all of these places, he's talking to all of these people,

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:36.160
[Amit Varma]: he's learning, he's assimilating knowledge and ways of thinking. How does this influence what

02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:42.160
[Guest]: Sikhism becomes? It's a hard question for me to answer. And it's getting into a realm of any

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:48.160
[Guest]: opinion I'll give could touch people on the wrong side. But I'm just saying that if we treat Nanak

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:56.160
[Guest]: as a human, if we treat, then every human has an evolution process. Nanak was a spiritually

02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:02.320
[Guest]: elevated person right from his childhood. He was having conversations around certain mundane tasks

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:10.480
[Guest]: about religious practices. Yes, he was absolutely evolved. But him meeting Mardana, and then bringing

02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:15.440
[Guest]: in the musical knowledge, and then the two walking into Islamic sites, Sufi sites, different places,

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:23.600
[Guest]: of course, he would have assimilated. I'm not comparing myself with any Nanak. I'm not one.

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.880
[Guest]: But I know when I've travelled, the good chunk of my career that I spent in the corporate world,

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.240
[Guest]: where I was meeting people with a different mindset was still making me learn. But this

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:40.720
[Guest]: path and this journey has made me more learned, more evolved. I'm nowhere near Nanak. But it's

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.800
[Guest]: made me a different person who I am. When you meet and interact with people of different faiths,

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.680
[Guest]: you will understand the quest of Nanak was not Gurdwaras, there were none at that time.

02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:55.440
[Guest]: Quest was something different. And to understand Nanak, you will have to understand Jainism,

02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.480
[Guest]: you will have to understand Buddhism, you will have to understand Vedanta, you'll have to

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:02.640
[Guest]: understand the six philosophical systems, you will have to understand the Nath Jogis,

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:06.640
[Guest]: you will have to understand the Sufis, you'll have to understand Baba Farid, and so on and so forth.

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.680
[Guest]: So when he goes to Pakpattan, and he sits there, the 11th descendant of the Gaddi Naseen of Baba

02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:18.480
[Guest]: Farid, because Baba Farid was 250 years before him, and beautiful Punjabi verses he writes.

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.000
[Guest]: He collates it. Why does he collate it? Because he finds a similarity in their mindsets.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:31.200
[Guest]: In fact, the most valuable contribution in Punjabi poetry of Baba Farid is by Nanak that he collated

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:37.360
[Guest]: it. This was going through by oral traditions. In fact, all the works of Baba Farid that have

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.640
[Guest]: been done later on in Shahamukhi, which is the Urdu script, much later are all taken from the

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:50.160
[Guest]: Granth Sahib, because Nanak documented it. Nanak documented Kabir's verses. Bijak came much later,

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:55.280
[Guest]: which today people say is Bijak is Kabir's work. Go into the Granth Sahib, and there's a repository

02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:01.360
[Guest]: of Kabir's writings. And that's the beauty of what he was doing. So could he be doing that without

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.880
[Amit Varma]: evolving? I find it hard to accept. At one level, I'm thinking Nanak could easily as he traveled,

02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:10.560
[Amit Varma]: have done a podcast called The Seen and The Unseen and documented all these dialogues in

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:14.880
[Amit Varma]: audio form. But alas, there was no technology back then. So to get back to the second question,

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:20.560
[Amit Varma]: I ask, at a practical level, like we're recording this on March 12, you decided you'll do India last,

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.240
[Amit Varma]: you are about to finish India, you did all the other countries, you did all the travel,

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:28.880
[Amit Varma]: you went to these conflict zones, you went to Baluchistan, you went to Iran, Iraq, you went

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:34.800
[Amit Varma]: everywhere. How was that experience like both in terms of getting permissions and to other places

02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:38.720
[Amit Varma]: where Nanak traveled, where Nanak Panti is simply not there, there's no trace of it, he only happened

02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:45.680
[Guest]: to go there. Traveling into these places is very tough. You cannot retrace Guru Nanak's travels the

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:50.480
[Guest]: way he traveled. It's impossible today. We're talking about sovereign nations. I cannot travel

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.360
[Guest]: in that sequential manner, but I can get the data and can stitch it so that you and the next

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.520
[Guest]: generation when they're looking at, they see it sequentially. That's the only way it's possible.

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:02.320
[Guest]: But sovereign nations, there are a lot of ifs and buts, especially if we're trying to do

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:06.160
[Guest]: photography and videography. Is it going with a team and a crew? When I did my Sikh legacy in

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:09.680
[Guest]: Pakistan, I just had my camera and I just had my passion. But now you've got to go with a team.

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.640
[Guest]: And that's a very different ballgame. And when you get inside the country, first and foremost,

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:21.520
[Guest]: the barrier is how will you get inside? How deep can you go? How will you enable it? There's some

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:25.360
[Guest]: countries where the permission is not going to come to you. You just have to do it as a stealth

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:30.800
[Guest]: mission. Risk your life and just do it as a stealth mission. Some countries, the permission

02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:35.600
[Guest]: will come to you, but may not come to you deep inside. Some countries, visas will be a big

02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:40.560
[Guest]: problem. I've faced a lot of problems, a lot of visas in many places. India might sound to be the

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.640
[Guest]: easiest, but what one does not realize is that India, I have a Government of India's approval

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.400
[Guest]: from Ministry of Culture, but when you're traveling, every temple has its own management.

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:57.120
[Unknown]: They don't recognize the Government of India's letter. Right? Everyone's a king out here. Every

02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:00.640
[Guest]: state is different. You might have the Government of India's approval letter from Ministry of

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.640
[Guest]: Culture, but BJP may not be in a power in a certain state. They don't care about that letter.

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:11.040
[Guest]: So there's this huge mix of challenges and you've got to manage that. Even in a country where life

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:17.520
[Guest]: is not a threat in India, right? You can imagine how tough it becomes. So that's the first part to

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.960
[Guest]: the question. So your second question was that the Nanak Panthis, were they there, right? Look,

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:28.080
[Guest]: when Nanak was traveling, the Nanak's panth was not being formed. Nanak in his first part of his

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:33.120
[Guest]: life was not creating any followership. Second part, he was on a quest. Third part, when he came

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.480
[Guest]: and settled down at Kartarpur, people started flocking around him because he now had immense

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.120
[Guest]: value to offer. I think the panth starts emerging from there. The community starts emerging from

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.680
[Guest]: there. Till then, he's just moving around. He's making an impact. It's the betan that he passes

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.960
[Guest]: on to the second guru and that lasts on for 250 years in the name of Nanak creates a bigger and

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.880
[Guest]: bigger community up till Afghanistan, deep inside India, Maharashtra and so on and so forth. That

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: becomes the Nanak Panthis. So, you know, we're kind of running out of time. So my sort of final

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: question here would be that, you know, in the process of immersing yourself in Sikh traditions

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.880
[Amit Varma]: or Nanak Panthis traditions, first in Pakistan and now on this entire trip, how has a way that

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:22.880
[Amit Varma]: you look at your faith changed, your community changed? And if any, what is a message that you'd

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.840
[Amit Varma]: like to sort of give to the Sikh community at this point in time about how they look at their

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:35.760
[Guest]: own history and their own heritage? Well, I think the learning is only a reaffirmation of the most

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:42.160
[Guest]: fundamental message of Nanak of oneness. There's nothing different, right? It's just one message,

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.720
[Guest]: simple message of oneness that we are one. And I think it's free to have the ability to

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:54.640
[Guest]: understand that all can coexist in a bouquet of oneness. That's the only message that I'll take,

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:58.240
[Guest]: because I have seen the love and affection and the challenges that have been overcome

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.800
[Guest]: by the people in Afghanistan, in Iran and Iraq who have embraced us. If not for them and not

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:09.440
[Guest]: their feeling for oneness, this project would not have been done. That's my takeaway from it.

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.960
[Guest]: And the message to my communities also is that it's the message of oneness. There's no difference,

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:20.000
[Guest]: right? So we need to have the ability to embrace everyone. It's the need of the day. The world is

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.360
[Amit Varma]: already broken up. And does that also mean being honest and self-critical and recognising the

02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:30.160
[Amit Varma]: rigidity that has crept into the faith over the last few decades? Well, every faith goes into

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.800
[Guest]: all kinds of rigidity, all kinds. There's nothing new. It's not rocket science. Every faith evolves

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:43.040
[Guest]: that way, right? Religion is a defining of a boundary around spirituality. So I am a proud

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:48.560
[Guest]: adherent of the Khalsa tradition. I wear a turban. I keep uncut beard. I'm proud of it because of my

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:53.760
[Guest]: culture, my history, my tradition, and I will die like this. But that's not any reason for me to not

02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.080
[Guest]: embrace anyone else. Your culture, a Sikh in Afghanistan may have a different culture. In my

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:08.480
[Guest]: journey, I met Assamese Sikhs. I met Nanak Panthis of Oriya origin in Orissa, right? And they don't

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.400
[Guest]: speak my Punjabi language, but yet they are believer in the faith, right? And they don't look

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.920
[Guest]: like me. So who am I to pass judgment on them? It's the only thing that I've learned, right? I think

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:25.520
[Guest]: the key message is that the need of the hour, the need of any place in the world, even within our own

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.840
[Guest]: country at this point of time is that we need to learn to live with the oneness. There's a lot of

02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:37.120
[Guest]: damage that's happened to the underlying structure of the coexistence, and we need to rise above that.

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:43.600
[Guest]: And Nanak's message in this time is very important for that. And I'm often reminded of the prayer we

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.120
[Guest]: used to read in our school, in Doon School when I was there, Rabindranath take orders, right?

02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:54.080
[Amit Varma]: But the world has not been broken up by... Into fragments by narrow domestic walls.

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:58.960
[Guest]: Yeah, into that heaven of freedom, let my country awake. I think that's the only message.

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:04.480
[Amit Varma]: I think Nanak was striving for that. And finally, you've finished shooting most of Allegory,

02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:08.240
[Amit Varma]: which is a 30 part documentary series, but there's a lot of work left on post production.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:13.760
[Amit Varma]: You're going to Lahore soon to record again with Salima Khwaja. You still need to raise funds for

02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.920
[Amit Varma]: some of that. If any of the listeners of the show would want to contribute to your project,

02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:22.880
[Guest]: how can they do so? Where should they go? Yeah, so there is a charitable organization

02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:26.960
[Guest]: that's supporting this project within India. It's a global project. We're managing it out

02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:32.080
[Guest]: of Singapore, but we are in need for fund. These projects for five years are only running because

02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:37.600
[Guest]: of people who support us, right? And if anyone wants to support, there are ways of doing it.

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:42.800
[Guest]: We have a tax exempt organization that's helping us as a third party organization.

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:50.960
[Guest]: At this point, I will simply request that my email could be given and they can contact me on that.

02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:59.600
[Guest]: Or my WhatsApp, it's the Singapore number, which is plus 6598326508. They can drop me a line on

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.840
[Guest]: that or they can email me and you can give my email at the bottom of the podcast.

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.920
[Guest]: Both the email and the number will be in the show notes.

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:10.640
[Guest]: Yeah. And anyone can contact me and we can take it from there. But we are looking for support.

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:16.880
[Guest]: I mean, there are no organizations behind this project. This is a quest of a madman.

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:23.280
[Guest]: And we have proven ourselves as a team long enough for five years that we are able to generate stuff.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.760
[Guest]: And if people who feel that there's a space for this narrative, it's not about Sikhs. It's about

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:36.880
[Guest]: humanity. All these narratives, my books on Sikh legacy in Pakistan are about humanity and equally

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:43.040
[Guest]: should impress and motivate any non-Sikh to delve into them. Similarly, Gunanak's message has to be

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.200
[Guest]: appreciated by everyone and anyone who comes forward can reach out here.

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And even if we can't exactly live in borderless geographies,

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.480
[Amit Varma]: we can live in borderless minds. Thank you so much for coming on the show, Amardeep.
