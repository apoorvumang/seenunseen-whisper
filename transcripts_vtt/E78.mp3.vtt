00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Guest 1]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:28.720
[Amit Varma]: Are you a different person when you are in a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: crowd than when you are alone?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.720
[Amit Varma]: I know I am.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes you adjust your behavior to fit the social norms expected in a given situation.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.980
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes you are anxious either to fit in or to impress.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.800
[Amit Varma]: You have a performative self, perhaps even different performative selves for different

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
[Amit Varma]: situations.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.240
[Amit Varma]: But maybe being in a crowd doesn't change you as much as it amplifies some part of your

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.440
[Amit Varma]: character.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.640
[Amit Varma]: In a cricket stadium, you cheer louder for your favorite team and feel deeper emotion.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.720
[Amit Varma]: And maybe when you are part of an angry crowd, baying for the blood of someone who is not

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.960
[Amit Varma]: from these parts or who is not part of your community, your baser instincts get aroused

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and you do things you would never do if you were alone.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.440
[Amit Varma]: You hit somebody, you hurt somebody, maybe you kill somebody.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.640
[Amit Varma]: Are you a different person when you are in a crowd than when you are alone?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.080
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.280
[Amit Varma]: Last week, the Supreme Court asked the Indian Parliament to enact a new law against lynching.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.040
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a post in the group blog I edit, Pragati Express at express.thinkpragati.com, arguing

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120
[Amit Varma]: that this was just virtue signaling by the court.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.360
[Amit Varma]: There were already laws against beating people, against killing people.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.880
[Amit Varma]: There are even laws that can be used to prosecute people who spread fake news on WhatsApp.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.080
[Amit Varma]: A new law would not cover anything that isn't already covered.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.400
[Amit Varma]: Our problem is not that we don't have enough laws, but that we don't have the rule of law.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes the state doesn't have the will to prosecute certain crimes.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.160
[Amit Varma]: And even when it does, often when it does, there is not enough state capacity to prosecute

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.320
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Creating a new law is not going to solve these problems.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, the topic for today's show is crowd violence in India.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And my guests today are Madhav Chandravarkar and Alok Prasanna Kumar.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Madhav is a legal expert at the Takshashila Institution, and Alok runs the Bangalore branch

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.400
[Amit Varma]: of Vidhi, a legal think tank.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.960
[Amit Varma]: They're working on a project together that involves lynching and crowd violence.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'm delighted that they agreed to chat with me about it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.000
[Amit Varma]: But before I cut to the conversation that we had, a small commercial break.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.520
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.400
[Amit Varma]: So check out the ones from IVM Podcasts who co-produced this show with me.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.580
[Amit Varma]: podcasts that cover every subject you could think of.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.880
[Amit Varma]: From the magazine I edit, Pragati, at thinkpragati.com, there is the Pragati podcast hosted by Hamsini

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Hariharan and Pawan Srinath.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.120
[Amit Varma]: There is a brilliant Hindi podcast, Huliyabazi, hosted by Pranay Koteswamy and Sourabh Chandra.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.360
[Amit Varma]: And apart from these policy podcasts, IVM has shows that cover music, films, finance,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.120

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
[Amit Varma]: app.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.160
[Amit Varma]: So download the IVM podcast app today.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Alok Madhav, welcome to the show.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160
[Guest 1]: Thank you.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
[Guest 1]: Thank you.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
[Amit Varma]: Nice to be here.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.320
[Amit Varma]: So the Supreme Court just came out with this suggestion today to the parliament that it

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.400
[Amit Varma]: enact a law to stop lynching, to deal with lynching.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And like I wrote a comment on Pragati Express about how that's just virtue signaling because,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, laws already exist that deal with beatings, with killings, with spreading fake

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.280
[Amit Varma]: news if it comes to that.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.860
[Amit Varma]: And Alok, I know you have a slightly deeper take on what the Supreme Court fundamentally

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.920
[Amit Varma]: gets wrong, even in understanding this problem of crowd violence.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.640
[Guest 2]: And I think you said it best, that virtue signaling.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.040
[Guest 2]: And if you see the judgment itself, they don't seem to have any idea of what they're talking

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.380
[Guest 2]: about.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.400
[Guest 2]: Because this petition, then we'll go to go back to when this petition was filed in 2016,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.280
[Guest 2]: was filed in a particular context.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.640
[Guest 2]: You've had these instances of Muslims, of Dalits being attacked and being killed over

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.000
[Guest 2]: rumors that they were handling beef or possessing beef or transporting cows or some such kind

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.040
[Guest 2]: of a thing.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.940
[Guest 2]: And more often than not, the attackers were largely upper caste Hindus or dominant communities

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.940
[Guest 2]: in that area.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.720
[Guest 2]: Nowhere in the judgment of the Supreme Court go into this at all.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.200
[Guest 2]: It does not discuss even one incident of what it means by lynching, right?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.880
[Guest 2]: It is talking about this issue in a totally acontextual way, that is, you know, just some

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.920
[Guest 2]: accidental thing that happens without any basis for it, without any historical or sociological

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
[Guest 2]: context.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.960
[Guest 2]: But we know lynching is not something that happens just like that, or just something

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.960
[Guest 2]: that happens because the police aren't doing their job properly or the police haven't done

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.600
[Guest 2]: their duties properly.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.360
[Guest 2]: It happens in a particular historical and sociological concept.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.240
[Guest 2]: Even the term lynching, academically and sociologically, is used in a particular historical context.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.120
[Guest 2]: Now, if we go back to the late 19th century and early 20th century, the incidents happened

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.640
[Guest 2]: largely in the southern part of the US, in the former slaveholding states, where after

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.280
[Guest 2]: the Civil War, when the North stops imposing the reconstruction, so to speak, where they

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.600
[Guest 2]: try to ensure that African Americans are treated more equally and the laws aren't unequal towards

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.280
[Guest 2]: them, the white community tries to reimpose some level of dominance over the African American

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.560
[Guest 2]: community there.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.600
[Guest 2]: And therefore, you find that largely African American men are victims of lynching.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.120
[Guest 2]: These are all public events.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.040
[Guest 2]: Nobody is suddenly picking up someone and trying to kill them.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.160
[Guest 2]: There are even postcards made of these events, postcards are made and people circulate them

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.960
[Guest 2]: freely to say, look what we did.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.720
[Guest 2]: Nobody's doing this secretly or in private.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.280
[Guest 2]: Yes, of course, you have the Klu Klux Klan and all of those, but the instances of lynching

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.440
[Guest 2]: take place in a very public manner.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.840
[Guest 2]: There is what we would now call a performative aspect to say, we are happy we did this and

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.360
[Guest 2]: we are sending out a message that this is what we will do if you dare to cross racial

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.360
[Guest 2]: boundaries.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.680
[Guest 2]: So you have these fears raised, I mean, like how we have beef as a fear.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.160
[Guest 2]: Then the fear was interracial mixing or interracial marriage.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.240
[Guest 2]: Look, black men can't resist themselves and they see white women and so on.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.840
[Guest 2]: So you have these fears raised that we need to somehow control black men and therefore

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.420
[Guest 2]: that is the kind of fear that is created and that sort of leads to these kind of instance

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.480
[Guest 2]: of lynching.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.760
[Guest 2]: It is not some totally a contextual set of killings which take place.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.220
[Guest 2]: None of that is informed in the way in which the Supreme Court approaches the issue.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.420
[Guest 2]: They quote Mark Twain, they quote Benjamin Franklin, but they don't actually quote any

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.040
[Guest 2]: of the historical studies or the solid data driven work which has gone into understanding

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.520
[Guest 2]: the phenomenon.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
[Guest 2]: Forget about the US.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.560
[Guest 2]: Even in India, there's tons and tons of work which has gone into understanding and examining

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.560
[Guest 2]: each of these events, going in depth into why these happened and what has happened.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.600
[Guest 2]: And that also results in some of the directions that the Supreme Court passes.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.760
[Guest 2]: The way they say, oh, you know, if the police just take care and do this and they appoint

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.200
[Guest 2]: a nodal officer and make sure you file the FIR and fast track court, everything will

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200
[Guest 2]: be fine.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.080
[Guest 2]: The silly thing is exactly all of this, in fact, happened in Jharkhand.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.320
[Guest 2]: In Jharkhand, over the killing of one cattle trader, Alimuddin Ansari, who was actually

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.040
[Guest 2]: killed by the upper caste Hindus in that area for quote unquote transporting beef, the state

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.800
[Guest 2]: government did quickly file the FIR, did arrest 11 people.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.040
[Guest 2]: There was a fast track trial in one year.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.840
[Guest 2]: They were all convicted, except the high court gave bail to eight of them almost soon after

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.080
[Guest 2]: because the trial was so shoddily conducted, because the evidence was not presented properly,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.940
[Guest 2]: because the rules of procedure were not followed at all.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.360
[Guest 2]: So it's all very well to say all of this, but you're just only ensuring that even justice

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.120
[Guest 2]: is not done properly.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.280
[Guest 2]: And to compound matters, you have a Jain Sinha who goes there and garlands these eight people

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.840
[Guest 2]: saying, wow, rule of law one, right?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.280
[Guest 2]: So the Supreme Court is completely mistaken about what it is talking about at all.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.920
[Guest 2]: It has so completely failed to even understand the underlying sociological phenomenon, which

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.280
[Guest 2]: leads to things like lynching, that when it gives these directions, when it gives these

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.520
[Guest 2]: kinds of guidelines or whatever you want to call it, it has no clue how they will be effective.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.760
[Guest 2]: And making a new law will have no impact at all.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest 2]: I mean, deterrence theory has been discredited for years and years now, and that it's kind

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.560
[Guest 2]: of ridiculous that judges still think that if you have a new law, which deals exclusively

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.160
[Guest 2]: with this, it will be sufficiently harsh.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.480
[Guest 2]: I mean, why should I blame judges?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.160
[Guest 2]: Even some of the well-meaning people seem to think that if you have a new law exclusively

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.040
[Guest 2]: dealing with lynching, that will handle the issue.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.520
[Guest 2]: I mean, I'm not going to blame the judges alone in this.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.160
[Guest 2]: So which is why I don't think people really understand what the phenomenon going on here.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.480
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of clarificatory questions here.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.600
[Amit Varma]: The first is to do with the terminology, that where did lynching come from and the judges

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.880
[Amit Varma]: don't understand it.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.520
[Amit Varma]: So let's say we've seen two kinds of organized violence in recent times, which have been

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.200
[Amit Varma]: loosely the term lynching has been used for them.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.800
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, for communal purposes, like people transporting beef and all that.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, generally, it'll be a Hindu mob getting together and beating up or killing

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040
[Amit Varma]: a Muslim or a Dalit.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.040
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, with the post-civil war lynchings, the 19th century lynchings,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.960
[Amit Varma]: there's a certain amount of pride in the people carrying them out.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.040
[Amit Varma]: The other kind is when these fake rumors are spread through WhatsApp that strangers abducting

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.040
[Amit Varma]: children.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.800
[Amit Varma]: And for that, random strangers who just don't happen to be from the area are lynched.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.600
[Amit Varma]: And there's not necessarily a communal angle to it, nor is it necessarily a matter of communal

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.740
[Amit Varma]: pride, community pride.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.320
[Amit Varma]: So would you then say that the second kind of mob violence is not really lynching?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.440
[Guest 2]: It's not really lynching at all.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.120
[Guest 2]: And I think we're making a huge mistake, in fact, by calling it lynching at all.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.840
[Guest 2]: I actually prefer to use a vaguest term, which is killings.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.120
[Guest 2]: The reason why I say this is so India Spend has this extraordinarily detailed spreadsheet

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.020
[Guest 2]: that they keep updating on a daily basis.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.440
[Guest 2]: It's on their website.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.240
[Guest 2]: And if you actually go through it, there are about 68 events they've kept track of starting

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.080
[Guest 2]: from February of this year.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.080
[Guest 2]: That's the earliest event, if I'm not mistaken, that they have cataloged.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.560
[Guest 2]: They could be earlier dating back to and they're focused specifically on child lifter rumors

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.840
[Guest 2]: being spread on WhatsApp and so on.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:52.200
[Guest 2]: These instances are everywhere from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu to, you know, in Northeast as

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.860
[Guest 2]: well in Assam, if I'm not mistaken.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.880
[Guest 2]: So they're spread across the country.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.080
[Guest 2]: Interestingly, there is a mix of urban and rural areas.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.520
[Guest 2]: You have events in instances in Ahmedabad, you have instances in Bangalore, you have

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest 2]: instances in tribal hamlets, you have instances in Malegaon, you have instances across the

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.600
[Guest 2]: country.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.800
[Guest 2]: The common factor, as you can see, is that one, as you pointed out, it's just a stranger.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.520
[Guest 2]: The only thing common is they don't know who that person is, right?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.120
[Guest 2]: They can't identify who that person is.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.040
[Guest 2]: So you've had Muslim mobs attacking Hindus.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.440
[Guest 2]: You have had Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.080
[Guest 2]: You have had upper caste mobs attacking lower caste.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.720
[Guest 2]: You've had lower caste mobs attacking upper castes.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.400
[Guest 2]: You have had tribals attacking non-tribals.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.080
[Guest 2]: You have had people of not well-off attacking equally non-well-off people.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.160
[Guest 2]: For instance, in Bangalore, it was actually a Tamil majority area, which is not one of

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.880
[Guest 2]: the well-off areas in Bangalore.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.200
[Guest 2]: The man who was attacked was a Rajasthani speaker, right?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.240
[Guest 2]: So somebody who didn't speak, forget about Kannada, didn't speak Tamil, right?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.240
[Guest 2]: So which is why you can't even use that whole thing about some level of social control or

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.040
[Guest 2]: some level of context there.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.440
[Guest 2]: It's just that this was somebody that just caused a mild level of panic simply by being

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
[Guest 2]: a stranger.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.480
[Guest 2]: So you can't find any common pattern to describe lynching as we would understand it commonly.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.520
[Guest 2]: The second thing is that the communities themselves where this is happening seem to be underprivileged

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520
[Guest 2]: communities by and large.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.800
[Guest 2]: You're not talking about, say, dominant castes.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.960
[Guest 2]: Even say, for instance, dominant castes in terms of rural areas, those who enjoy some

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.360
[Guest 2]: privilege in terms of hierarchy and so on.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:36.320
[Guest 2]: They are communities who don't seem to have that level of access to state resources.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.560
[Guest 2]: Nobody here in this community can, for instance, or for instance, actually thought of calling

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.360
[Guest 2]: their local corporator or police officer and saying, hey, I heard these rumors, are they

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360
[Guest 2]: true?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360
[Guest 2]: Or can you do something about it?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.760
[Guest 2]: Or do you think you can ask the cops to increase patrolling?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.920
[Guest 2]: You can imagine if this is a community which had good connections, if the local corporator

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.160
[Guest 2]: was from them, or if the local police was somebody that they knew, they'd be able to

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.880
[Guest 2]: get something done about it, right?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.200
[Guest 2]: Or at least visibly done something.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.040
[Amit Varma]: So what you're referring to where the killers aren't from a dominant community, you're talking

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.000
[Guest 2]: about the second kind of killings as it were.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
[Guest 2]: Yes, second kind of killings.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.400
[Guest 2]: Not the first kind where they are definitely the dominant community.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.840
[Guest 2]: Because if you see all the lynchings, the lynchings proper, you will find that the police

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.640
[Guest 2]: either have a blasé attitude towards the whole thing.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.160
[Guest 2]: You would have seen the recent pictures from Uttar Pradesh where the police are generally

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.480
[Guest 2]: tagging along as they drag the body of the victim.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.240
[Guest 2]: You will find in many cases the police hand over the person that they catch or they come

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.680
[Guest 2]: fairly late onto the scene and file FIRs against the victim, right?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.480
[Guest 2]: So there is some sort of a tacit or even active support of the killers from the police machinery.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.880
[Guest 2]: Whereas in terms of the childlifter killings, we find the police themselves being attacked

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880
[Guest 2]: in so many cases.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.800
[Guest 2]: When the police reach to rescue the people being beaten up, they get attacked because

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.560
[Guest 2]: the crowd is in a total state of panic.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.080
[Guest 2]: They don't know if the police are in disguise or actually the police.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080
[Guest 2]: They don't enjoy any support.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.960
[Guest 2]: And they have such a level of mistrust with the police that they sometimes end up attacking

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960
[Guest 2]: them.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.280
[Guest 2]: So even the police can't control them.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.400
[Guest 2]: So there is that one very key difference that is very noticeable if you just examine the

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400
[Guest 2]: reports.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.200
[Guest 2]: I mean, there still needs to be more studies done as to how the people reacted when the

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200
[Guest 2]: police came.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.400
[Guest 2]: And when you read their FIRs, you'll get more details.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.880
[Guest 2]: But clearly it is not as if the police knew what was happening or the police knew whom

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.160
[Guest 2]: to speak to and control the situation.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.240
[Guest 2]: Repeatedly, one very detailed instance comes from Malegaon, for instance, where the police

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.400
[Guest 2]: in charge try to speak to the elders to say, please calm the mob down.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.120
[Guest 2]: And they say, we don't have any control.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.600
[Guest 2]: People have just gone crazy about the situation.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.760
[Guest 2]: They think these five people whom they don't know are childlifters, which is crazy because

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.600
[Guest 2]: the five people in question are everything from a child of five years old to somebody

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.960
[Guest 2]: 40, 50 years old.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.240
[Guest 2]: So which is why there is a certain level of irrationality which has gripped the mob.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.120
[Guest 2]: It is not a calculated effort to do something to show that we are asserting control or any

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
[Guest 2]: such thing.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.320
[Guest 2]: So, which is why this phenomenon needs to be tackled very differently.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.160
[Guest 2]: Some police agencies are getting this.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.640
[Guest 2]: They are understanding that, OK, this is a failure on our part.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.320
[Guest 2]: We haven't reached out to these communities.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.840
[Guest 2]: So which is why the first response is to say, let's reach out.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.800
[Guest 2]: I mean, it's apart from just saying, don't believe in rumours, going out to the communities

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.200
[Guest 2]: to say, we are here.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200
[Amit Varma]: Please call us.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.320
[Guest 2]: They are proactively trying to say that these are our numbers.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320
[Guest 2]: Call us.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.400
[Guest 2]: In some cases, this has I mean, they've messed up very badly, for instance, in Tripura, instead

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.480
[Guest 2]: of the police going out, the state government, in a very stupid move, sent somebody from

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.280
[Guest 2]: this Agartala to a village to say, please tell everybody to not to panic, except that

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.000
[Guest 2]: poor fellow got killed.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.760
[Guest 2]: They thought he was a childlifter because he wasn't wearing a uniform.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.000
[Guest 2]: He was somebody from the state government.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.240
[Guest 2]: The state tried to deal with it as a pure PR exercise.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.640
[Guest 2]: The police didn't accompany him.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.040
[Guest 2]: There was no official stamp about him.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.140
[Guest 2]: So he got killed in the process.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.560
[Guest 2]: So there is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.200
[Guest 2]: The right way to do this is to treat it as a look, there is a failure of the police machinery

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200
[Guest 2]: here.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.060
[Guest 2]: There's a breakdown of trust between communities and the police.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.520
[Guest 2]: But there is one deeper question to go to.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.120
[Guest 2]: Why are people believing these rumours?

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.680
[Guest 2]: It's not just WhatsApp which is causing it.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.920
[Guest 2]: We had, you know, 20 years ago, people believing rumours about Ganesha's drinking milk, pre

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.680
[Guest 2]: WhatsApp, pre internet.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:27.320
[Guest 2]: We found instances of similar killings in rural West Bengal, about 30 or 40 years ago.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.680
[Guest 2]: So rumours do spread, right?

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.400
[Guest 2]: Rumours are there all around us all the time.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.960
[Guest 2]: Why is it that they suddenly get acted upon at certain points of time?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.120
[Guest 2]: This is an open question.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.720
[Guest 2]: And I think this is really the issue which needs to be looked at and researched.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.040
[Guest 2]: And I don't say I have an immediate answer for this.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.080
[Guest 2]: One potential answer is that these are communities which feel some level of anxiety about them,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.240
[Guest 2]: that they feel they're under threat in some way, that could be an economic threat, could

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.200
[Guest 2]: be that they feel that they've been going to be displaced, or could be that they genuinely

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.320
[Guest 2]: feel that there have been instances of child lifting.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.440
[Guest 2]: But maybe they feel that there is a genuine breakdown of relationship between the police

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440
[Guest 2]: and this.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.400
[Guest 2]: And so there needs to be more deeper questions asked.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.760
[Guest 2]: And we should not stop at just calling it lynching.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.400
[Guest 2]: We should not just stop at saying it's WhatsApp fault.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.520
[Guest 2]: And we shouldn't just stop at saying it's the police's fault.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.440
[Guest 2]: So that's that's sort of why I want to make this conceptual difference.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.400
[Amit Varma]: So Madhav, I want to turn to you.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are really two interesting questions here.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:32.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one is what Alok just raised about why do people believe such rumours and not

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.720
[Amit Varma]: just why do people believe such rumours, but rumours are pretty ubiquitous.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.520
[Amit Varma]: And why at certain times, do certain rumours gain currencies, which is a large open question.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.000
[Amit Varma]: But the other open question, which I know you've spent a lot of time thinking about,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.700
[Amit Varma]: is why do crowds get roused to violence, when very often crowds are composed of individuals

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.320
[Amit Varma]: who by themselves would not have that proclivity for violence, but when a crowd comes together,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.960
[Amit Varma]: it seems to behave entirely like a beast of its own.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.800
[Amit Varma]: So are these two kinds of crowd violence related?

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Is there a common theory that kind of explains them?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.260
[Guest 1]: There's a long history in terms of the pathology of of crowd violence.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:18.440
[Guest 1]: On the first question, I think whatever theories we have in terms of cognitive biases and why

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:26.640
[Guest 1]: people would believe easily disprovable information, I think there's a fair amount of research

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.400
[Guest 1]: that I think has been discussed in this podcast before, so I won't go too much into that.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest 1]: But the history of crowd pathology is quite bizarre, because I think most people have

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.000
[Guest 1]: a very poor understanding of how crowd violence works.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.140
[Guest 1]: They seem to think that when someone is in a crowd, it's sort of the so-called mob mentality

00:19:53.140 --> 00:20:01.360
[Guest 1]: takes over and you sort of reduce to a primal, sort of feral, violent sort of personality.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.200
[Guest 1]: But that's not actually true.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.880
[Guest 1]: And that theory actually comes from this French polymath called Gustave Le Bon.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:17.220
[Guest 1]: I think he published his paper in 1895 in the specific context of the Third French Revolution.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.400
[Guest 1]: And if you look at the actual sort of empirical evidence that we have now, the violence that

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.840
[Guest 1]: was happening in Paris at the time was the opposite of a mindless mob.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840
[Guest 1]: It was very structured.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.040
[Guest 1]: They had very clear goals and motivations.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:42.480
[Guest 1]: And that theory of Le Bon is sort of proven to be very sticky to this extent that even

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.340
[Guest 1]: when it has been disproved, it has set the parameters of the discussion.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:54.420
[Guest 1]: So I think in late 1920s, an American FH Allport came and basically argued the opposite that

00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:05.360
[Guest 1]: instead of crowds making someone revert to some primal self, the people who commit violence

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.560
[Guest 1]: in crowds are just bad eggs.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.280
[Guest 1]: So they're just bad people.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.000
[Guest 1]: So they bring in their baggage with them, and that's why the violence happens.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.160
[Guest 1]: And that is also empirically unsound.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.660
[Guest 1]: And what has happened since is that a lot of people have sort of merged these two theories

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.960
[Guest 1]: in a very toxic way.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:33.040
[Guest 1]: They sort of argue that the Le Bon majority of the crowd is this hapless, mindless, very

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.480
[Guest 1]: easily influenced sort of section.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.400
[Guest 1]: And they get turned over, hijacked or flipped, the lot of police terminology sort of used

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.400
[Guest 1]: to describe, by an Allportian minority.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:56.580
[Guest 1]: And this is the prevalent sort of understanding of mob violence, the so-called agent provocateur.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.080
[Amit Varma]: So basically the bad eggs make the sheep do terrible things.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:08.800
[Guest 1]: And the biggest problem with this understanding of crowd pathology is that nowhere is the

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.680
[Guest 1]: role of the police factored in.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:21.600
[Guest 1]: So in the sort of late 70s and early 80s, there was this guy called Stephen Riker, who

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.240
[Guest 1]: basically came up, and he comes at the end of a lot of intellectual thought.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.480
[Guest 1]: So he has an excellent paper that I would recommend reading called The Psychology of

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.640
[Guest 1]: Crowd Dynamics.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.840
[Guest 1]: And basically he argues for what he calls the elaborated social identity model, where

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:49.240
[Guest 1]: the basic argument is that everyone has a very unique individual sense of identity.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.860
[Guest 1]: But what happens when you get thrown into crowds, and by crowds, Riker is not just talking

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.180
[Guest 1]: about, you know, mobs in the streets, he's talking about any collectivization.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.760
[Guest 1]: What happens is that you shift from that individual identity to the collective identity, and you

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.760
[Guest 1]: sort of almost, you start, because of social pressure and a lot of other factors, start

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.000
[Guest 1]: subscribing to the norms and behaviors of that group.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.720
[Guest 1]: And it is, I think, in that context that the fake news and the WhatsApp and the Twitter

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.880
[Guest 1]: sort of come into play.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.840
[Guest 1]: In fact, to me, Twitter is more dangerous than WhatsApp news, because Twitter is the

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.920
[Guest 1]: kindling and WhatsApp news is simply the spark.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.120
[Guest 1]: And a spark without kindling is harmless.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:48.280
[Guest 1]: And it's the discussions on Twitter, as well as maybe some of the actions or rather non-actions

00:23:48.280 --> 00:24:00.920
[Guest 1]: of sort of influence setters, like political leaders or actors or whoever it may be, that

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.760
[Guest 1]: sort of influence these norms and change the accepted modes of behavior.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:15.440
[Guest 1]: So a lot of what Alok was talking about in terms of upper-caste Hindu men violently securing

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.760
[Guest 1]: a social order of some kind is witnessed every day by all of us on Twitter.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:29.320
[Guest 1]: And I think that is the more sort of, it's also the more difficult nut to crack.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.520
[Guest 1]: How do you change social norms, WhatsApp news is fake news.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.040
[Guest 1]: It's becomes this, it's still a very nebulous idea, but at least in people's conceptions,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.480
[Guest 1]: there's a very easy solution.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.800
[Guest 1]: You stop it, as opposed to changing norms.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.080
[Guest 1]: How do you even begin to go about such a task?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.440
[Amit Varma]: So just to paraphrase you and correct me if I did it wrong, what you're essentially saying

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.040
[Amit Varma]: is that there is an inherent tribalism in us, which is amplified by Twitter.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And then what happens on WhatsApp subsequently is just an expression of that.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.480
[Guest 1]: No, I wouldn't say there's an inherent tribalism.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.560
[Guest 1]: You don't feel the tribalism is inherent?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.200
[Guest 1]: Perhaps I'm a little uncomfortable with the connotations of the word tribalism.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.240
[Guest 1]: I think there is some, there's some connotations of reverting to a primitive.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.480
[Amit Varma]: But in a sense, I'd say that all of us are hardwired to think in terms of in-groups and

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.760
[Amit Varma]: the other.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And culture is at the end, the whole enlightenment project is essentially about fighting our

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.240
[Amit Varma]: hardwiring in many of these primitive ways.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.240
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.760
[Guest 1]: So that's actually the whole concept of the in-group and the other, something that features

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.960
[Guest 1]: very much into the ESIM model of crowd policing.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:49.520
[Guest 1]: Because what they say is that if you have a peaceful protest, and which the police think

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.880
[Guest 1]: that, okay, it's a bunch of peaceful protesters, but you know, it's the Lebanon majority, which

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.400
[Guest 1]: may get hijacked.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.480
[Guest 1]: So the police treat them as a homogenous danger, even if they understand that the crowd in

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.960
[Guest 1]: front of them is a heterogeneous.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.700
[Guest 1]: And what that encourages is escalated policing.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.480
[Guest 1]: So your lathi charges, water cannons, rubber bullets, whatever it may be.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:19.600
[Guest 1]: And what that does is that it, one, it takes a majority of the crowds, which Riker calls

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.960
[Guest 1]: moderates.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:28.760
[Guest 1]: And the moderates basically go, I am doing some legitimate activity, like enjoying a

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.640
[Guest 1]: football game, or politically protesting.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.960
[Guest 1]: I am being prevented from this legitimate activity by this extremely violent police,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.200
[Guest 1]: which then casts the police as illegitimate.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.920
[Guest 1]: And what it automatically does is because the police is treating that entire crowd homogenously,

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.240
[Guest 1]: they start to identify with the slightly more radical elements that may be there in the

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.560
[Guest 1]: crowd saying that, yeah, you know, these guys are the enemy, see what they're doing.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:03.400
[Guest 1]: And then that sort of, that interplay between the various identities and beliefs and the

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:10.160
[Guest 1]: reactions to the actions of each of those collective groupings, is then what drives that crowd

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.160
[Guest 1]: towards violence.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.600
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, you're saying the crowd is probably not radical to start with, but because

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.280
[Amit Varma]: the police preemptively treats it as radical because of the Le Bon theory that a few small

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.520
[Amit Varma]: eggs will make them all go bad, so treat them all the same, actually radicalizes them and

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest 1]: drives them towards violence.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.720
[Guest 1]: Yeah, which is my number one problem with the Supreme Court's judgment, because they're

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.280
[Guest 1]: basically saying more of the same and not with any nuance.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.240
[Amit Varma]: So if it's not more of the same, for example, like I figured out what you mean by the same,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.760
[Amit Varma]: which is the whole Le Bon model of crowd violence and therefore don't, so what would you do

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760
[Amit Varma]: differently?

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest 1]: Like, how should the police?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.800
[Guest 1]: So what the ESIM or a lot of people within that sort of theory say is exactly what Alok

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.560
[Guest 1]: was saying, which is about community management, community participation.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.920
[Guest 1]: It's I think a drowning voice in the Black Lives Matter movement that what you need to

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:13.600
[Guest 1]: do is actually have more interaction to build back the trust, because what is there right

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.920
[Guest 1]: now is a fundamental distrust of the police.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:25.520
[Guest 1]: And so that will only happen through not only whatever the thousand police reforms that

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.920
[Guest 1]: need to be done in the country, but even if those happen, that the trust will only be

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.320
[Guest 1]: brought back by continuous engagement.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.120
[Amit Varma]: But isn't this a sort of dual problem there?

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.640
[Amit Varma]: At number one, we don't have state capacity in the sense that we simply don't have enough

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.280
[Amit Varma]: police and they're trained very badly.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.440
[Amit Varma]: And this is too much of a ask.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.720
[Amit Varma]: And beyond the state capacity, there's also the problem of the will, like Alok correctly

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.400
[Amit Varma]: pointed out in many of the communal kind of communal lynchings, which is appropriate to

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.000
[Amit Varma]: call them lynchings.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.560
[Amit Varma]: The police are actually on the side of the mob, in a sense.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:07.240
[Guest 1]: So which is what makes us inherently sceptical of any solution that says more policing, right?

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:14.040
[Guest 1]: So by policing, I mean, specifically the police going out on streets with the lathis or the

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:21.520
[Guest 1]: guns or whatever violent forms, but or even arrests or detentions.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:30.160
[Guest 1]: But I am happy with sort of nonviolent, more sort of communicative participatory forms

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.520
[Guest 1]: of policing like Alok was talking about.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:40.400
[Guest 1]: I don't see as much of danger over there.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:46.960
[Guest 2]: So just to build on that a little bit, again, each problem requires its own set of solutions.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.040
[Guest 2]: And while we're talking about how to manage these kinds of WhatsApp rumor based killings,

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.720
[Guest 2]: what this requires is for the police to go back, build its trust with the communities.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.080
[Guest 2]: I mean, of course, the killings need to be handled as through the criminal justice system,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.640
[Guest 2]: you have to bring the perpetrators to justice, all of that has to happen.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.160
[Guest 2]: But the police need to go back to the communities.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.200
[Guest 2]: They can't just militarize, shut down the places, increase police presence and think

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200
[Guest 2]: that the problem will go away.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.800
[Guest 2]: That will only cause more panic.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.320
[Guest 2]: It'll make people believe that, you know, we are now being punished for what we think

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.200
[Amit Varma]: we were trying to defend our community kind of stuff.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.760
[Amit Varma]: So it's part of the problem in this kind of, for example, rumor fueled killings, that the

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:31.400
[Amit Varma]: people at large, especially the kind of marginalized people you say are usually the perpetrators,

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.560
[Amit Varma]: don't have faith in the rule of law to begin with.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.040
[Amit Varma]: So when they hear about child abductions in the area, they think that, damn, we got to

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.280
[Amit Varma]: take this into our own hands.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.320
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I think that is, that is, I think, at the core of this, right?

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.720
[Guest 2]: I think at the core of it, it is that they just don't feel we can reach out to the police

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.240
[Guest 2]: that we don't think action will be taken that even if we go there, right, nobody's going

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240
[Guest 2]: to listen to us.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, just a slight digression.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.520
[Guest 2]: One of the things that keep coming up when you sort of read people's assessment of a

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.360
[Guest 2]: government, especially across North India and in rural, a lot of rural belts, is our

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360
[Guest 2]: Sunwai, right?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.160
[Guest 2]: They would think that if a government listens to us, it's good enough.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.800
[Guest 2]: They don't, even if outcomes may be good or bad, they judge a government on how well they

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
[Guest 2]: listen.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.280
[Guest 2]: And the fact that you can't expect, even if you can't even expect a hearing from this

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.040
[Guest 2]: police, or you can't even expect to go be heard by this police, suggests that such a

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.320
[Guest 2]: total level of breakdown there.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:34.800
[Guest 2]: And in inevitably innumerable number of cases, you will keep finding that you can't even

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.600
[Guest 2]: expect the police to take down your complaint if you don't go with your local MLA or local

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.280
[Guest 2]: corporate or local panchayat officer.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:47.120
[Guest 2]: And that is for the people who have access to these level of, you know, government functionaries.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.840
[Guest 2]: If you're a community or if you're a group of people who have no access to these functionaries,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.360
[Guest 2]: then you feel even more cut off from the rule of law seems like nothing.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.540
[Guest 2]: I mean, it's just a concept that has no meaning at all for you, right?

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.720
[Guest 2]: So which is why you have to first start by enforcing that, yes, we will respond, we will

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.840
[Guest 2]: listen to you.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.280
[Guest 2]: We are here to respond to you and we are here to understand what you don't take the law

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.800
[Guest 2]: into your own hands.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.240
[Guest 2]: That is where that can have a sort of meaningful response in at least preventing future outbreaks

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.840
[Guest 2]: and preventing more people from taking the law into their own hands in that sense.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.800
[Guest 1]: And there are in terms of the impact of like the fundamental breakdown of rule of law that

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.320
[Guest 1]: we currently have in our country.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:38.720
[Guest 1]: It's I think dual fold, one is the sense that the social orders that we currently live by

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.320
[Guest 1]: are no longer legitimate.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:48.160
[Guest 1]: So the people feel that they are no longer need to be bound by them.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.600
[Guest 1]: And that is more a question of a normative position of whether they should engage in

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.160
[Guest 1]: a certain behavior or not.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.760
[Guest 1]: And the other is just a simple metric of power, they feel they can get away with it.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.120
[Amit Varma]: So let me let me try to sort of summarize what I've learned from you guys about these

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.600
[Amit Varma]: two different kinds of violence, which is very clear to me in order to explain it, that

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:16.400
[Amit Varma]: the lynchings that happen over, say, eating beef and so on are fundamentally just in every

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.840
[Amit Varma]: possible way different from the kind of killings which happen over WhatsApp rumors.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.680
[Amit Varma]: So let me try and summarize it and tell me if you have something to add to that.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.940
[Amit Varma]: What's happening in the case of the WhatsApp rumors is that they are, let's leave aside

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.560
[Amit Varma]: the question of why people have a proclivity to believe these kinds of rumors, because

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.240
[Amit Varma]: we are a species that after all feeds on narrative, we we make sense of the world through stories.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know what the precise mechanism of these rumors working is a different matter.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.000
[Amit Varma]: But these are generally committed by marginalized groups who recognize that there is no rule

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.840
[Amit Varma]: of law in this country, which is something I've always said, the rule of law, if it exists,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.520
[Amit Varma]: exists only for the very rich.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.520
[Amit Varma]: It simply does not exist for most of the people.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, I'd you know, Madhav, I disagree with your terming it a breakdown of the rule

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080
[Amit Varma]: of law.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't think the rule of law has actually existed in India at all, all through our independence.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.280
[Amit Varma]: And these are marginalized groups who because they realize the lack of the existence of

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.920
[Amit Varma]: the rule of law, do not trust the police at all.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, when they believe these narratives, these paranoid narratives of child abductors

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.880
[Amit Varma]: or whatever the case may be, take matters into their own hand.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And even when the police actually come and they try to intervene, they'll beat up the

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.520
[Amit Varma]: police as we've seen in recent cases, they just don't care.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.280
[Amit Varma]: So that's one aspect of the problem.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.640
[Amit Varma]: And you would say that merely trying to apply the danda will make these guys more angry

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.120
[Amit Varma]: and will make matters worse.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, one way of doing it is through police outreach to them and making them trust

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.400
[Amit Varma]: the law again, which seems to require massive structural changes, and it almost sounds impossible.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.720
[Amit Varma]: The other kind of violence, which is the lynchings per se, are very different in the sense that

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.560
[Amit Varma]: they are normally carried out by the dominant community, which, like you said, mostly in

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.920
[Amit Varma]: the cases that we've been seeing are upper caste Hindus who are beating up or killing

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:12.520
[Amit Varma]: Dalits or Muslims, they are against the other, they often have the tacit support of the police.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.480
[Amit Varma]: If the rule of law exists, it exists in a perverse way that the legal machinery is on

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.080
[Amit Varma]: their side.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And it is, again, it is against the other, but it's driven, it seems to me, largely by

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:32.400
[Amit Varma]: tribalism, which I would argue is inherent in humans, but amplified by social media.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.200
[Amit Varma]: So A, do you, are these characterizations accurate?

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:42.120
[Amit Varma]: And B, what are the different kinds of ways in which, as policy people, you would set

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.400
[Amit Varma]: out to deal with them?

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:50.280
[Guest 1]: I would sort of maybe dispute a little bit with the characterization of the second kind.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:58.600
[Guest 1]: I'd say the sort of defining characteristic, I think Alok alluded to it earlier, is one

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.360
[Guest 1]: that is inherently political.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:06.760
[Guest 1]: I think there is a question of some political purpose or political structure that is sought

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.080
[Guest 1]: to be achieved or protected in some way.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:18.920
[Guest 1]: And that is sort of, I think, one of the defining characteristics of the lynching kinds of violence.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And like, for example, like, what kind of, can you illustrate that?

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.560
[Amit Varma]: Like, is it that the dominant groups want more state patronage and they want to cut

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560
[Guest 2]: off the others?

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.520
[Guest 2]: Consider this, you know, like, for instance, go back to the 2014 campaign.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.240
[Guest 2]: We were all hearing Ache Din, but there was a threat to the campaign that we in the TV

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240
[Guest 2]: didn't hear it.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.600
[Guest 2]: But if you heard Modi's speeches, there was a whole, oh, look at what the UPA government

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:51.320
[Guest 2]: did with the pink revolution, which was clearly targeted at the fact that India's meat exports

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.320
[Guest 2]: had increased, right?

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.280
[Guest 2]: And that was coded message saying that, look, these guys have benefited at your expense.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.960
[Guest 2]: These guys being the Muslim communities benefited, these butcher communities have benefited at

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.560
[Guest 2]: your expense, right?

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.200
[Guest 2]: Which is clearly to pit one community against the other.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:14.080
[Guest 2]: It put them at a very socioeconomic status to say that they are benefiting and you're

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080
[Guest 2]: not.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.080
[Guest 2]: How unfair is that?

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080
[Guest 2]: Right?

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.880
[Guest 2]: It may not have anything to do directly at the ground level, right?

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.640
[Guest 2]: You may measure the GDP and say, no, actually, Muslims are still not as well off as equivalent

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.640
[Guest 2]: in the communities.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.320
[Guest 2]: But that message struck, right?

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320
[Guest 2]: That message struck.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.960
[Guest 2]: And that was used later on to push that narrative of, you know, and of course, you pass the

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
[Guest 2]: laws.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.840
[Guest 2]: But the other element here is something that the Supreme Court totally misses out is the

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.320
[Guest 2]: fact that you've passed the laws legitimizing the notion that even possessing beef is somehow

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.040
[Guest 2]: illegal and unfair.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.640
[Guest 2]: So all those laws, Supreme Court has made no mention of.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.880
[Guest 2]: Supreme Court has, again, not even acknowledged its own role in weakening the Atrocities Act,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.940
[Guest 2]: which makes it more difficult to prosecute people who attack the Dalits for being Dalits.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:08.160
[Guest 2]: So you have all of these things which sort of aggravate existing social inequalities,

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:14.840
[Guest 2]: disparities, to specifically say, the government is on the side of this community, the government

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.240
[Guest 2]: is going to support you against the rest of the people.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.720
[Guest 2]: And that is to sort of give you the impression that when you take things in your own hands,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.400
[Guest 2]: we are there to have your backs, we are there to protect you.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.000
[Guest 2]: So it makes a difference that when, say, an FIR is filed, saying that this person was

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.640
[Guest 2]: killed, a counter-FIR is filed, which says, actually, no, this person was carrying beef.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Right, right.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost as if the second one is a greater crime.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.400
[Guest 2]: The second one is a greater crime.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400
[Guest 2]: Because why?

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.240
[Guest 2]: There's a legal framework, which sort of was passed by the people in power to protect you

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240
[Guest 2]: in case you do something like this.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.420
[Guest 2]: So there is a political gain, which is to be made by sort of pitting that one community

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.420
[Guest 2]: against the other.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.980
[Amit Varma]: So something I'm fond of quoting is something the late Andrew Breitbart once said, politics

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.880
[Amit Varma]: is downstream of culture.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And I would hold it before you had this communal Hindu versus Muslim politics, you had that

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:11.000
[Amit Varma]: animosity actually embedded in the culture, that, you know, this is not something new.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.960
[Amit Varma]: You'll see this right from the time the Jan Sangh was formed as a political formulation,

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960
[Amit Varma]: for example.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.560
[Amit Varma]: They've consistently over the years got that 15-16% of the vote or whatever it is.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:26.880
[Amit Varma]: And these ideas, these thoughts, this tribalism was in the culture, and it's only been amplified

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.880
[Amit Varma]: now.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And of course, one theory is that it's social media has helped to amplify it because, you

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.480
[Amit Varma]: know, you have what is called preference cascades, people sort of discover there are so many

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:41.520
[Amit Varma]: others like them, what I call invisible bigots, and, and they all come out of the cupboard

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.680
[Amit Varma]: and then that's a consolidation there.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not quite sure about the formulation that this is, you know, it's purely political,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.120
[Amit Varma]: but leave that aside.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.280
[Guest 1]: I mean, that's, that's, it's no, I would, I wouldn't say this purely political.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.520
[Guest 1]: I just meant that it's one of its defining characteristics is that there is some political

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:06.160
[Guest 1]: purpose that is sort of at the root of the violence, right?

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:16.480
[Guest 1]: So whether it is preventing inter-caste marriages, or sort of the whole beef sort of issue and

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.960
[Guest 1]: everything that has happened around that, it's, there is some political motive behind

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960
[Guest 1]: it.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.760
[Guest 1]: And also not just political, there is some level of calculation.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.200
[Guest 1]: This may not necessarily be premeditated, though that is often the case, but certainly

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest 1]: afterwards statements and actions made by whether it's people in power or just the leaders

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:49.360
[Guest 1]: of that organization, calculated to continue the legitimacy of those actions.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:56.240
[Guest 1]: With the second kind of violence, I'm not saying it's completely apolitical, that's

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:05.160
[Guest 1]: what I'm saying, but it's more the outcome of political negligence.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:11.400
[Guest 1]: So I would say maybe that I have, I frequently like to say, sort of treat the disease, not

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.520
[Guest 1]: the symptom, which the Supreme Court judgment just does not do, it only treats the symptoms.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:28.680
[Guest 1]: So I'd say with the first example of the lynchings, the disease itself is political in nature,

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:35.220
[Guest 1]: and as well as the symptoms, but with the second, it's just the disease, the symptoms

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:40.920
[Guest 1]: itself in terms of the actual outbreak of violence, that is not really political.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.600
[Guest 1]: It's just about because that community for a long period of time, I don't know how clear

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.040
[Guest 1]: this distinction has come out, but because that community for a very long time has been

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.680
[Guest 1]: politically neglected in some way, that they are sort of driven to this edge.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.840
[Guest 1]: So it is their absence within the political system, it is a marginalization from the political

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.560
[Guest 1]: system, which is causing.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:10.160
[Guest 1]: And this is something that is, again, I sound like I'm being paid by some ESIM psychologists,

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.120
[Guest 1]: but this is something that is borne out in empirical evidence of, say, riots.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:23.160
[Guest 1]: And also, they've gone through some of the previous studies that proved slightly more

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:30.240
[Guest 1]: Alportian or Le Bon sort of theories of crowd psychology and run them through their models

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.720
[Guest 1]: and have come out with results that prove their model and show that the other ones are

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.360
[Guest 1]: empirically unsound.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:43.160
[Guest 1]: And basically show that, say, I think with the Tottenham riots in London, it was about

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:50.880
[Guest 1]: the persecution of Mark Duggan, I forget his name, but this is one individual who died

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.280
[Guest 1]: during an arrest.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.960
[Guest 1]: And the community viewed that effectively like an assassination.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:04.640
[Guest 1]: And that was because of a long history of marginalization and just being persecuted,

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.920
[Guest 1]: if not prosecuted.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.080
[Guest 1]: So, yeah, it does stem from a long history of demarginalization.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.400
[Amit Varma]: So, let me throw this question to you.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we started by discussing the Supreme Court judgment and you guys explained how

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.120
[Amit Varma]: it's so fundamentally flawed.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.720
[Amit Varma]: And we've also sort of spoken about how these two kinds of violence are fundamentally different

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and need to be dealt with differently.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's say that you are the Supreme Court, the two of you are the Supreme Court bench,

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.900
[Amit Varma]: and you have to come up with a judgment that obviously won't make these mistakes.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.520
[Amit Varma]: What would be the broad contours of that judgment then?

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.520
[Guest 2]: What would you say?

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.120
[Guest 2]: See, one thing would be to identify that firstly, there is a legal framework, which is sort

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.000
[Guest 2]: of encouraging and promoting these kinds of activities.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.040
[Amit Varma]: I think that has to be attacked first.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040
[Amit Varma]: What is that framework?

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And what are we referring to?

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.800
[Guest 2]: So we're talking about all these beef ban laws, right?

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.200
[Guest 2]: We're talking about laws which sort of essentially say that my sentiments are more important

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.080
[Guest 2]: than actual livelihoods.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:08.400
[Guest 2]: That you have state level laws, which sort of say that, I mean, the least harmful ones

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.600
[Guest 2]: of these are the ones that say sale of meat is banned for eight or nine days, all the

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.820
[Guest 2]: way to the Maharashtra law and the Uttar Pradesh law, which sort of say that even possession

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.760
[Guest 2]: of beef can land you in jail for eight or ten years.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Are these unconstitutional laws?

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.880
[Guest 1]: I would say these are totally unconstitutional.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880
[Guest 1]: Possession has been overturned.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.240
[Guest 1]: Yeah, but that is only by the Bombay High Court, for the Maharashtra laws.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.040
[Guest 2]: The appeals for them are pending in the Supreme Court.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.640
[Guest 2]: They've been pending since 2016.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.720
[Guest 2]: They haven't been heard yet.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.120
[Guest 2]: They should have been heard by now.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.520
[Guest 2]: They should have been heard and decided by now.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.680
[Guest 2]: Because the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy case very clearly said, there's a right to

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.680
[Guest 2]: eat what you want.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.760
[Guest 2]: There's a right to all of that.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.760
[Guest 2]: But as quickly as it listed and heard, say, I mean, the hearings are going on right now,

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.920
[Guest 2]: the Section 377 case, I think this was just as important.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.360
[Guest 2]: The court should have taken this up and said, OK, we can't separate these two issues.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.360
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.880
[Guest 2]: We understand that somebody has filed a PIL for lynching, but I think we can't separate

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880
[Guest 2]: the issue.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.680
[Guest 2]: I think administratively and also judicially, the two issues should have been heard together.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:13.000
[Guest 2]: To have said that, it's not as if these people are suddenly gathering together and, you know,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.640
[Guest 2]: killing Muslims or whatever for fun.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.680
[Guest 2]: They're doing this because there's a certain legal regime which sort of tells them that,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, beef is a problem.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.740
[Amit Varma]: So the first part of your judgment of the Supreme Court, which the bench of Alok and

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:29.240
[Amit Varma]: Madhav would come up with, is change the legal framework by declaring all these laws unconstitutional.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.240
[Guest 2]: Yes, absolutely.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.800
[Guest 2]: It would it would sort of make this thing to, of course, our constitution has provisions

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.320
[Guest 2]: relating to, you know, you should try and reduce cow slaughter and say, OK, fine, we'll

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:44.920
[Guest 2]: give it a de minimis thing to say, yes, you can promote safe animal husbandry by reducing

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.520
[Guest 2]: the need for cow slaughter, but we will not criminalize possession.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.720
[Guest 2]: We will allow, say, slaughter of buffaloes and old cattle and so on and so forth.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:59.360
[Guest 2]: So we will take it back to the old 50s position, which drew a sensible balance between these

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360
[Guest 2]: two considerations.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.960
[Guest 2]: That would be the start.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.360
[Guest 2]: The second would be to hold the state government responsible, to say the state government is

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.580
[Guest 2]: going to be responsible for the killings, not just the police.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.840
[Guest 2]: And that would be in terms of saying, if you make a statement, you will be treated as an

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840
[Guest 2]: accused.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.060
[Guest 2]: If it is a post facto statement expressing support for the accused, you can be added

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.440
[Guest 2]: as an accused.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:26.320
[Guest 2]: The state government has to come forth and sort of basically say that, yes, we will not

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.320
[Guest 2]: be saying a word in favor of the accused, that, you know, it doesn't matter if it's

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.320
[Guest 2]: the chief minister.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.800
[Guest 2]: It has to either you shut up and say nothing or you say, we will let the criminal justice

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.880
[Guest 2]: system take its course forward.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.160
[Guest 2]: Let the case continue forward.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.240
[Guest 2]: Don't try to do something as silly as what happened in Jharkhand, where they were so,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.280
[Guest 2]: oh, no, we have to show everyone how amazing our judicial system is.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.040
[Guest 2]: We will carry out a botched trial.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.840
[Guest 2]: You can't repair the judicial system just for this one category of cases.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.280
[Guest 2]: Let it happen as it is intended to happen.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:05.360
[Guest 2]: You also have to take into account that maybe it is not possible for these trials to take

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.360
[Guest 2]: place in that state.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.240
[Guest 2]: The Supreme Court has to then say that if any party comes to us saying that the police

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.840
[Guest 2]: is prejudiced against us, we will immediately transfer it out of that state, preferably

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.720
[Guest 2]: to a state where that particular party is not the ruling party.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.640
[Guest 2]: But then who will conduct the prosecution because the police is part of that.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640
[Guest 2]: So, which is which is why.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.880
[Guest 2]: So, for instance, the most recent example, for instance, in the Khatwa rape case, where

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.480
[Guest 2]: they transferred it out of Jammu and Kashmir to Chandigarh, I mean, the investigation was

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480
[Guest 2]: complete.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.520
[Guest 2]: This is the prosecution will now be conducted by the government authorities in Chandigarh.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.640
[Guest 2]: For instance, in the Gujarat riots case, they transferred it from Gujarat to Maharashtra,

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.240
[Guest 2]: where the prosecutors from Maharashtra did it.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.440
[Guest 2]: So they can appoint I mean, the Supreme Court can say the problem is with the investigation

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440
[Guest 2]: itself.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.480
[Guest 2]: We will appoint we will handpick a set of investigation police officers whom we feel

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.160
[Guest 2]: can carry out a set of independent investigations in these kind of cases.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.040
[Guest 2]: And all such incidents will be investigated only by these authorities, irrespective of

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.040
[Amit Varma]: the state.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Some could argue that it's overreach on the part of the court, right?

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.400
[Guest 2]: It's meddling with what should really be an executive.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.400
[Guest 2]: It is.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.400
[Guest 2]: That is true.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.040
[Guest 2]: But in a sense, when the executive itself is part of the offense, right, we are talking

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.160
[Guest 2]: about a situation like as with the Gujarat riots, as with the whole as with, for instance,

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.520
[Guest 2]: the 1984 riots, the executive itself is seen to be aiding and abetting the offense.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.880
[Guest 2]: That is the part of the court has totally missed in the judgment.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.960
[Guest 2]: It's not as if these are happening, despite the best efforts of somebody in the government

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.360
[Guest 2]: to stop it, or the government just doesn't have the capacity to stop it.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.600
[Guest 2]: There is a level of aid and abetment that is happening.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.160
[Guest 2]: I mean, you are having, as I pointed out earlier, government ministers going and garlanding

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.400
[Guest 2]: people who got this thing, you having accused who died, who being given the national flag

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.400
[Guest 2]: and so on.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.880
[Guest 2]: So these are obvious signals being sent out, right?

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.000
[Guest 2]: Saying that we know who, I mean, this is whose side we are on in this matter.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.740
[Guest 2]: So this is why context matters for a lynching.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.040
[Guest 2]: This is why context matters.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.160
[Guest 2]: These are not entirely a historical, these are not entirely a contextual killings.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.120
[Guest 2]: So which is why the court should have understood that these are usually killings where the

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.720
[Guest 2]: government is in favor of one party over the other.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.600
[Guest 2]: So, you know, say that in such killings, we will transfer it out of one state to the other.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.200
[Guest 2]: Give us a list of such cases where you think the government has not done a good job.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.200
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.760
[Guest 2]: Jharkhand, they did a bad job of it.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.080
[Guest 2]: They could have done better.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.400
[Guest 2]: But where the state is just not moving ahead with the prosecution, where the state has

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.400
[Guest 2]: filed cases against the victims, you know, give us a list of those.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.520
[Guest 2]: We transfer it out of those states, from Uttar Pradesh, we'll transfer it to maybe, I don't

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.680
[Guest 2]: know, Delhi, which is not ruled by the BJP, for instance, or transfer it from Gujarat

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.520
[Guest 2]: to some other state, something like that, you know, give us a list of this, we're happy

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.520
[Guest 2]: to do it.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.720
[Guest 2]: The thing is, these are all powers the court legitimately enjoys under the constitution.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.480
[Guest 2]: For precisely this reason, the court doesn't have to manually oversee the investigation.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.120
[Guest 2]: They just need to ensure the process takes place in a manner which inspires confidence.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.760
[Amit Varma]: So the court has a power according to the constitution that if they feel that a particular

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.160
[Amit Varma]: party cannot prosecute or decide on a case well enough, they can transfer it anywhere.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.400
[Amit Varma]: And they can even, for example, say that if the case is in a BJP state, they can transfer

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.720
[Amit Varma]: it to a non-BJP state and take that political consideration into account.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.080
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I mean, they don't expressly say this, but they have done this in the past without

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.120
[Guest 2]: saying it in so many words, they've done this in the past.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.280
[Guest 2]: For instance, Jayalalitha's case was moved out of Tamil Nadu to Karnataka, simply to

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.240
[Guest 2]: keep, I mean, not because shift from AIDMK to DMK, but they recognize that because it

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:35.080
[Guest 2]: referred to the supremo of AIDMK, there is no chance of fair trial at all in the state.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.920
[Guest 2]: That whichever party is there, they would interfere with the trial.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.320
[Guest 2]: So they moved the whole trial to Karnataka.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.520
[Guest 2]: So which is why they do have this power.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.440
[Guest 2]: They should have understood that this is what is actually going on and they have failed

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.440
[Guest 2]: to do so.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.960
[Guest 2]: So I think there was a lot of scope for this court to have done.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:59.200
[Guest 1]: But meaning this is also not surprising because frequently sort of one of the truisms that

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:05.600
[Guest 1]: I keep on returning to as a lawyer sort of interest to working in the public policy space

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:11.100
[Guest 1]: is the justice must not only be done, but seen to be done.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:17.880
[Guest 1]: And our current chief justice has shown his almost willful disregard of this concept in

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:23.280
[Guest 1]: sort of some of the sort of actions and positions that he has taken.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.400
[Amit Varma]: So can you briefly summarize that for those of my listeners who may not have been following

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.400
[Amit Varma]: legal developments?

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.320
[Guest 1]: Well, I think the better person to describe that may be Alok, because he is one of the

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:41.480
[Guest 2]: participants, I think in that.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:50.440
[Guest 2]: Working backwards, apart from this case, just in terms of how cases have been heard in the

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:59.080
[Guest 2]: Supreme Court, where you want to ensure fairness in the procedure, where you want cases to

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:06.000
[Guest 2]: be heard by judges without any conflict of interest, that has not happened.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.560
[Guest 2]: Even cases relating to himself, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra has heard it himself by considering

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.120
[Guest 2]: allegations against him.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:20.520
[Guest 2]: Where in terms of Judge Lohia case, where people want to know what happened, the judgment

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.520
[Guest 2]: not he didn't author it, but the bench that he was part of basically said nobody needs

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.200
[Guest 2]: to know anything, right?

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.920
[Guest 2]: Some people have given statements, that's it.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920
[Guest 2]: Be happy with it.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.240
[Guest 2]: Nobody needs to ask any further questions.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.000
[Guest 2]: That's the second instance that I can think of.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.680
[Guest 2]: The fact is, even for instance, I can give an current example with the section 377 case,

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.280
[Guest 2]: there are actually two cases.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.040
[Guest 2]: So one case is the writ petitions filed by Navtej Johar and a few others, which was challenging

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.000
[Guest 2]: 377 directly in the Supreme Court.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.960
[Guest 2]: The second set of cases are actually a continuation of the old Kaushal cases, which sort of questioned

00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:01.680
[Guest 2]: the correctness of Justice Singhvi's judgment, which brought back 377 into the picture.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.960
[Guest 2]: Those have not been listed.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.400
[Guest 2]: Those have not been listed because according to the Supreme Court's own rules, if those

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.840
[Guest 2]: were listed, Justice Deepak Mishra would have had to involve the three other senior judges

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.760
[Guest 2]: of the Supreme Court of India.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.480
[Guest 2]: He did not want to do that.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.440
[Guest 2]: He did not want to sit on the same bench as the three other judges who went on a press

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.680
[Amit Varma]: conference against him.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:26.680
[Amit Varma]: So you have this kind of petty politics in the, you know, the highest institution of

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.880
[Amit Varma]: the land almost, which makes you wonder that even if the, you know, even if the Supreme

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.240
[Amit Varma]: Court, say, tries to correct the executive, who's going to watch the watchman?

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.240
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.480
[Guest 2]: Which creates this kind of a situation.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.800
[Guest 2]: But yeah, I mean, the point, of course, being that at the end of the day, the Supreme Court

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:48.360
[Guest 2]: had a chance to ensure that justice was seen to be done here in this case.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.160
[Guest 2]: And they've once again, gloriously blown it.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.800
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I'd like to add one dissenting opinion to what Alok said.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:01.720
[Guest 1]: It was a minor point where he said, even if the politicians don't say anything, I don't

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.200
[Guest 1]: subscribe to that, meaning maybe they shouldn't be held liable.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:14.040
[Guest 1]: But I think it has been pointed out sufficiently online, at least about the silence of our

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.480
[Guest 1]: Honorable Prime Minister on some of these issues.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:28.640
[Guest 1]: And as the sort of icon of his party and perhaps this current movement, his silence is as damning

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:35.640
[Guest 1]: as any of the inflammatory statements that have been made by maybe slightly more minor

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.640
[Amit Varma]: players.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.640
[Amit Varma]: I absolutely agree.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.160
[Amit Varma]: And also, on the campaign trail, he's been incredibly skilled with dog whistles.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what will simply happen if you do have the Supreme Court saying that his

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.200
[Amit Varma]: state government should not say anything in their favor, is that while ministers themselves

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.640
[Amit Varma]: may not say anything, you'll have random party people saying things and, you know, freedom

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.640
[Amit Varma]: of speech, of course, they can, I mean, we support the right to do so.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:04.800
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to sort of, you know, wind it up by asking you guys a couple of questions

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.920
[Amit Varma]: that I ask all my guests on whatever subjects they're talking about.

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And we'll start with you, Alok, two questions each, which is what makes you hopeful?

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And what makes you despair about what is happening in this country with regard to mob violence?

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.080
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, both these kind of crowd violence, lynchings and the killings?

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:35.680
[Guest 2]: What makes me hopeful is the fact that perversely, I mean, of all the people to have responded,

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.560
[Guest 2]: the first and perhaps the most effective response might have been WhatsApps, even though they

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:46.040
[Guest 2]: may have about a 5 or 10% responsibility, not to say they're totally not responsible,

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:52.400
[Guest 2]: but 5 or 10% responsibility, their response, I think, one, they tried to fix their platform,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.040
[Guest 2]: there's an ongoing response.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.800
[Guest 2]: Two, they have called for people to submit proposals to carry out research.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.240
[Guest 2]: I think, ideally, in an ideal situation should have been the government of India or some

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:09.920
[Guest 2]: executive agency which says, we want to commission studies to find out what is going on, find

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.960
[Guest 2]: government moves slowly, WhatsApp moves quicker, good for them.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.560
[Guest 2]: But I think the fact that people are not sort of keeping quiet and saying, okay, we'll fix

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.040
[Guest 2]: these two, three things, and maybe the problem will go away.

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.280
[Guest 2]: I think it's a good thing.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:31.320
[Guest 2]: And I think if some of the good research organizations that this country has sort of take up this

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:36.800
[Guest 2]: challenge seriously, and I know there are many who will go down to this to the ground

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:40.400
[Guest 2]: and not just research, even media organizations, I think what this really calls for some of

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.880
[Guest 2]: the kind of on the ground reporting that any number of solid reporters in this country

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.880
[Guest 2]: can do.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:50.920
[Guest 2]: If we can get 10 good on the ground, long form pieces, which sort of say this is what

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.560
[Guest 2]: happened on that day, when this person accidentally found themselves in the middle of a mob which

00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.440
[Guest 2]: thought they were a child lifter, I think we will get an incredible insight into what

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.760
[Guest 2]: is actually going on in this process.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:09.600
[Guest 2]: So I think understanding what is going on will help us go there.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.380
[Guest 2]: That at least makes me more helpful.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.680
[Guest 2]: The fact that there is an interest and there is that capacity to find out what is going

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.000
[Guest 2]: on, I think that gives me hope.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.440
[Guest 2]: What makes me despair, of course, is that, again, in terms of the fact that the Supreme

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:33.080
[Guest 2]: Judicial Body with all its level of protections, with all its judges is uninterested in saying

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:38.240
[Guest 2]: what it should have said, you know, that that is what dispairs me that you had this opportunity

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.760
[Guest 2]: to say something, even if the directions missed their mark, right, okay, I'm not saying that

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.760
[Guest 2]: this court should have has the opportunity to think through things maybe as deeply as

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.160
[Guest 2]: some of us may have.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:55.480
[Guest 2]: But even if you had said, framed the issue in the way it ought to have been framed, I

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.960
[Guest 2]: think that would have been and even that signaling would have been that signaling would have

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:03.840
[Guest 2]: been great to have said, we see that people are being killed over carrying beef, that

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.240
[Guest 2]: is offensive to the idea of India, we see that people are being killed for wearing jeans

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.480
[Guest 2]: just for being just for being Dalits who wear jeans, that's an offensive idea to the notion

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.320
[Guest 2]: of India being a republic, if they had said that in a judgment, right, I think that would

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.840
[Guest 2]: have itself sent out sufficient signal that they know what is happening, they may be powerless

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.880
[Guest 2]: to do something immediately about it, or their measures may have missed the mark a little

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.640
[Guest 2]: bit understandable, but that they didn't even name it, right, they didn't name what is happening.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.440
[Amit Varma]: I think that is a cause for hope is really what civil society is doing.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And your cause for despair is what the institutions and just protect us are, you know, how they

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
[Guest 1]: are mishandling their

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.300
[Guest 1]: And the most to just add a little more context to it, Alok was saying, if you actually go

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:52.720
[Guest 1]: through the judgment, it doesn't read like a judgment, it reads like the kind of lecture

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:59.760
[Guest 1]: a judge would give if he was invited to some event, it's completely devoid of any context.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:06.680
[Guest 1]: And also, he like parrots these very slogany kind of phrases like the unity and diversity

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:13.920
[Guest 1]: and which he says at least like 20 times, and he doesn't say like, Dalits once.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:23.840
[Guest 1]: So given that the sort of judgment is written in this very sloganeering kind of fashion,

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:32.080
[Guest 1]: which, to be fair, is also Deepak Mishra's writing style, the absence of like a clear

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:38.360
[Guest 1]: sort of denial or call to arms against this kind of behavior is even more stark.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And would you like to share his reasons or like, what are your reasons for hope and despair?

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.120
[Guest 1]: If you have something to add?

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:54.160
[Guest 1]: Well, my reasons for hope are, I'm going to be a little more selfish in that we are currently

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.000
[Guest 1]: working on a project on this, hopefully that will have some

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.600
[Guest 1]: That's Takshashila and Vidhi.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.920
[Guest 1]: So hopefully that will have some impact on the discourse.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.120
[Guest 1]: The law is, I think, being a bit too ambitious.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.120
[Guest 1]: And sort of my primary sort of pet peeve with this whole issue, which I haven't discussed

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:22.440
[Guest 1]: in detail so far is, and I've written an article about this in the Hindu, is that sort of organizations

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:30.440
[Guest 1]: which are otherwise formally or legally recognized can commit these acts, their members may get

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.120
[Guest 1]: arrested and get thrown under the bus, but the organizations go scot-free.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:42.320
[Guest 1]: So I think in terms of signaling, if you can somehow even find, forget, I don't even want

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.720
[Guest 1]: to go into banning an organization because that's a problematic proposal constitutionally.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Sardar Patel once did ban the RSS, leave that aside.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.840
[Guest 1]: But it's much more liable to abuse.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
[Guest 1]: I agree with that.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.680
[Guest 1]: So I don't want to get into banning, but some kind of accountability to the organization,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.840
[Guest 1]: some kind of group liability, I think needs, I think will go a long way, at least with

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:15.000
[Guest 1]: the sort of virtue signaling so that we can then at least go back to a narrative of bad

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.600
[Guest 1]: eggs as opposed to these large monolithic institutions that are behind these people's

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.280
[Guest 1]: backs.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.840
[Guest 1]: So that is one area that sort of, I think, gives me cause for hope.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.600
[Guest 1]: Cause for despair is pretty much everything else.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.160
[Guest 1]: And you alluded to the current state of our criminal justice system, whether it's the

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.920
[Guest 1]: courts, the prosecution, the police.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:49.800
[Guest 1]: It's one of the recommendations that Deepak Mishra gives is the, I think the favorite

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:56.240
[Guest 1]: for any criminal issue, which is them fast track courts.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.280
[Guest 1]: In my brief one year of practicing, I visited the same fast track court six times for the

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
[Guest 1]: same matter.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.920
[Guest 1]: And it was always the same stage because it was an appeal of awaiting records from the

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.920
[Guest 1]: lower court.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.720
[Guest 1]: So this is the current state of fast track in our country.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.280
[Guest 1]: It is a, well, it is, it does nothing.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they should put a jogging track around the fast track courts, so at least it'll have

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.120
[Amit Varma]: some kind of fast track around it.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.200
[Amit Varma]: I know that's a bad joke, but so is our system, right?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200
[Guest 1]: Yeah, yeah.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.840
[Guest 1]: Or maybe take a sort of a cue from Silicon Valley and maybe have a standing desk designed

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.840
[Guest 1]: to the courts.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:44.040
[Guest 1]: But yeah, it, everything else pretty much is, I think you already said that a lot of

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.520
[Guest 1]: the things that we're talking about are predicated on having a criminal justice system that we

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.760
[Amit Varma]: simply do not have.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And on that note of despair, we hope you enjoyed listening to us, Alok and Madhav.
