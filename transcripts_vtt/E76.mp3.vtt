[Unknown]: IVM

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:26.840
[Amit Varma]: People

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
[Amit Varma]: who talk about the great potential India has and how we are becoming a younger country

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.320
[Amit Varma]: and we have this demographic dividend and so on, miss one important and depressing point.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.360
[Amit Varma]: As a society, we actually suppress the potential of half our population. Women in this country

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: are treated as second class citizens. They are not empowered in their childhood and are

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.760
[Amit Varma]: often educated less or worse than their brothers. They are forced to conform to roles that destroy

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.560
[Amit Varma]: their potential. In fact, they're looked upon more as property than as people. And when

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.320
[Amit Varma]: women speak up about this, they face an amazing amount of anger from men. Anger. Where is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.920
[Amit Varma]: this anger coming from?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.800
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. When I first asked the remarkable other team, it's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.720
[Amit Varma]: good to join me on this episode. I told her the subject would be misogyny in entertainment

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and Indian society. Aditi said she wanted a different title. She suggested claiming

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.320
[Amit Varma]: our space. My subject was a lament, but hers was also a call to action and couldn't have

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.680
[Amit Varma]: been more appropriate. While we were chatting about it at the IBM podcast studio, one of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.760
[Amit Varma]: the producers, Swati Bakshi, also got involved and shared some of her insights. So we improvised

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.320
[Amit Varma]: and asked her to also be a guest on the show. Swati is a former journalist who now works

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.760
[Amit Varma]: as a producer at IBM and will be taking over producing the show from Abbas Momen, whom

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.200
[Amit Varma]: you heard in the last episode, who is leaving the scene and the unseen to take over as producer

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.840
[Amit Varma]: of Cyrus Broach's fantastic show, Cyrus Says. I tried to convince Abbas to stay, but he

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.640
[Amit Varma]: simply doesn't agree that I'm funnier than Cyrus. Go figure. Anyway, I had an enlightening

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.480
[Amit Varma]: conversation with Aditi and Swati. But before we get to that, let's take a commercial break.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.000
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.400
[Amit Varma]: more. Check out the ones from IBM podcast who co produced the show with me. Go to IBM

[Amit Varma]: Aditi and Swati, welcome to the show.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.400
[Unknown]: Thank you, Amit. Hi, Amit. Thank you.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.760
[Amit Varma]: Aditi, in the last show that we did last week, where you spoke about the beginning of your

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.960
[Amit Varma]: journey as a stand up comedian, you said something which sort of a light bulb went off in my

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.400
[Amit Varma]: head. I mean, it shouldn't be a revelation. And I'm sure it's something that people like

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.200
[Amit Varma]: you take for granted. But you spoke about how part of the reason you came on your own

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.880
[Amit Varma]: as a comedian as someone who would stand and tell jokes was because you were in the girls

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.920
[Amit Varma]: college after a girl school, you went to St. Mary's in Pune and then to Sophia's in Bombay.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And because there were girls all around you, you were actually able to get the confidence

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.760
[Amit Varma]: and were given the space to stand up and speak for yourself and build an audience. And your

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.880
[Amit Varma]: point was that if it was a coed environment, the boys would never have let that happen,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.440
[Amit Varma]: because they want to be in charge of everything. And at that point, it struck me that there

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.800
[Amit Varma]: is no male comedian anywhere who would say that I got the chance to claim my space, because

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.640
[Amit Varma]: I was in an all boys school, because if I was in a coed environment, the girls wouldn't

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.560
[Amit Varma]: have let me. No male will ever say that, which kind of, you know, brings us to what I want

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.440
[Amit Varma]: to start this episode with is that when we speak about the role of men and women in society

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.840
[Amit Varma]: and how it is reflected in attitudes, we are starting at a very unequal spot, where women

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.320
[Amit Varma]: have to face a whole bunch of structural obstacles, which men are completely unaware of, like

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.360
[Amit Varma]: I was unaware that they could be such a thing till you mentioned it in the last episode

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.560
[Amit Varma]: when it's like, okay, another bulb goes off in your head. So I and you know, when I invited

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.760
[Amit Varma]: you to do this specific episode, and we spoke about it, the way I framed it was let's talk

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.840
[Amit Varma]: about misogyny and entertainment. And you said no, let's call it claiming your space,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.840
[Amit Varma]: because that's a more positive way. And it's also broader. And, you know, we brought Swati

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.080
[Amit Varma]: into the show, because she had a whole bunch of thoughts on that from her experience. So

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.880
[Amit Varma]: let's talk about claiming your space. What has the journey been like?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.280
[Guest 1]: A G and you know, that line you said was so true is that we're starting from a grossly

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.680
[Guest 1]: unequal. I mean, the finishing the starting line is completely different when it comes

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest 1]: to the different genders. And I sort of I remember being in an all girls school and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.200
[Guest 1]: I think I do this joke in my show right now, which is that in my family, we don't beat

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.880
[Guest 1]: girls because they bruise easily. It's much easier to beat a little boy and be like, oh,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.520
[Guest 1]: he fell down from a cycle. That's why he has triangulation marks on his neck. And that

00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.440
[Guest 1]: always gets a huge laugh and a huge applause. But it also simply points out the fact that

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.880
[Guest 1]: the treatment of girls and boys is unequal and is harmful for both girls and boys. I

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.760
[Guest 1]: mean, girls, whether it's just being given a chance to be born, really is a is a sort

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:25.800
[Guest 1]: of mathematical. So I think you're sort of you're playing Russian roulette from the womb.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:33.200
[Guest 1]: If you happen to be any other gender than male, and we cannot deny that whatever narrative

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:41.120
[Guest 1]: that is currently running the world is male has been defined by heterosexual, to a very

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:49.080
[Guest 1]: large extent, white men. Every other story then or every other voice that speaks up is

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.280
[Guest 1]: then trying very hard to have themselves heard in a room that's already full of cacophony

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.800
[Guest 1]: of one story that is trying to keep every other story down. So from the point of just

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.920
[Guest 1]: being born to the point of having access to I mean, I keep thinking about I used to have

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.680
[Guest 1]: this cousin who was really into cricket. And I remember because we were told no, no, no,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.240
[Guest 1]: only girls only play badminton, and boys will play cricket. And she I mean, unfortunately

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.760
[Guest 1]: for her got breasts at the age of 12. And that was it. That was the end. No more cricket.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.320
[Guest 1]: No more cricket. No, Mithali Raj. I remember and this is an awkward, embarrassing thing

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.240
[Guest 1]: to bring up literally within the first three minutes of this podcast. But I remember when

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:44.920
[Guest 1]: I got my period, I hid it from my family for four months. And that included coming up with

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.680
[Guest 1]: such weird devices to stop anyone from knowing because I knew that the moment I told them

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.120
[Guest 1]: that I had my period, it would immediately be now sit with your legs closed. Don't talk

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.680
[Guest 1]: loudly. Don't talk to boys. You can't be you know, doing all these things. I was terrified

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.720
[Guest 1]: of the fact that my femaleness had suddenly asserted itself completely out of my control.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.080
[Amit Varma]: That's almost incredible awareness for 11 or 12 year old or whatever it was.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.080
[Guest 1]: Gee, I'd seen it just happen with I'd just seen it happen with so many of my classmates

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.680
[Guest 1]: who would suddenly become demure, you know, during sports period, who would, you know,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.600
[Guest 1]: be sort of like, constantly be like, shoved aside and hushed aside. I just I was like,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.760
[Guest 1]: I can't let my childhood end. And I sort of, I mean, finally, I sort of came to terms with

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.760
[Guest 1]: it four months later when it got found out. It's not even that I told anybody it got found

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.120
[Guest 1]: out. And that was another hugely humiliating experience. Even though I come from a very

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.200
[Guest 1]: liberal family, where you know, the other kind would be like better chocolate low now

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.560
[Guest 1]: you're a woman. But what chocolate I wanted to run around I wanted to talk to boys I want

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.960
[Guest 1]: to laugh loudly with my mouth open. I wanted to do those things. And I just knew at that

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.760
[Guest 1]: age, that I was walking into a disadvantage. And I think that has sort of colored my perceptions

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.480
[Guest 1]: of everything that I have done as an adult and as a woman.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And Swati I often say, you know, when I write about economics, I say from the economics

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.360
[Amit Varma]: perspective that India really inhabits three centuries at the same time, the 19th, the

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.360
[Amit Varma]: 20th and the 21st. And that's equally true of social attitudes that we inhabit those

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.280
[Amit Varma]: three centuries at the same time. And the journey for you in one sense has been starker

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.320
[Amit Varma]: for you know, those of us who are from Bombay or Delhi or whatever, because you actually

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.240
[Amit Varma]: come from Lucknow, and you've kind of made that journey from there. What has it been

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.920
[Guest 2]: like?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.920
[Guest 2]: It's quite a journey. And being in Lucknow was a entirely different experience, I would

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:49.000
[Guest 2]: say that Lucknow University is still I think, like you said, is 18th century, I would not

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.200
[Guest 2]: even say 19th. I mean, the way men behave with women there. And if you go to the university

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:06.640
[Guest 2]: without wearing a suit or a dupatta, I mean, it's a scandal. And the way men look at you,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.960
[Guest 2]: they hound you, make comments on you, it's very, very normalized, it's quite normalized.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.920
[Guest 2]: And it is seen as a...

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:23.560
[Guest 2]: So the level that it has been normalized is a problem. And it's not, it doesn't stop there.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:30.120
[Guest 2]: It seeps into every aspect of your life and everything that you do. So despite being highly

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.320
[Guest 2]: educated and you know, working in one of the best organizations in the world, my experience

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:43.160
[Guest 2]: has always been something that I would, you know, remember as an experience filled with

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.920
[Guest 2]: discrimination on various levels and various different forms.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And just to set the context, what period are we talking about when you were in college

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.480
[Guest 2]: in Lucknow?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.360
[Guest 2]: It's still 2003.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.320
[Amit Varma]: Till 2003. And at what point does it sort of strike you that this is something that

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.480
[Amit Varma]: is not normal but normalized?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.600
[Guest 2]: Because even at your home, you are told to present yourself in a particular way because

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.520
[Guest 2]: you're a girl and you're grown up. I was, I mean, I became comfortable with my own body

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.600
[Guest 2]: after I would say, you know, doing my post graduation in Delhi. Until then, it was a

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.360
[Guest 2]: very turbulent phase because when I landed in Delhi from Lucknow, it was a completely

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:36.240
[Guest 2]: different structure of, I would say, the structure of living, commuting, studying, everything

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.040
[Guest 2]: was quite different from Lucknow. And it took a toll on my performance also, I remember.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.880
[Guest 2]: And that's like a blot on my resume till now. Until then, I was like a distinction holder.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.080
[Guest 2]: And then suddenly in DU, my percentage went down to 56%. It was like shattered.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080
[Guest 2]: What was different?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.040
[Guest 2]: It was a cultural, I don't know, a cultural adjustment coming from a small town in India

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:10.200
[Guest 2]: to a bigger town and then being a girl on your own. The kind of pace Delhi offered me,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.360
[Guest 2]: I was not prepared for that. And the kind of people around, I was not prepared for that.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.040
[Guest 2]: And it took me a lot of time to, you know, sync with the pace of the city. And that was

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.440
[Guest 2]: obviously something that I had to understand. And then two years time was something that

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:35.720
[Guest 2]: I took to understand that, to be in sync with myself and the city. So the city in itself

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.400
[Guest 2]: is something, a big phenomena that decides how a woman would be. I don't know in other

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.720
[Guest 2]: countries also, I think it's the same. But in India, it's very much a big factor that

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.320
[Guest 2]: decides how you're going to move, till what time you're going to move, what subjects are

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.640
[Guest 2]: you going to study if you're studying in a university. Because, you know, I remember

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.560
[Guest 2]: in Lucknow University, the sociology department was notorious. And there were very few women

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.360
[Guest 2]: opting for sociology because of that. One being myself, because my sister, elder sister

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.560
[Guest 2]: who was studying in that department, she told me categorically not to take sociology because

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.920
[Guest 2]: that department is notorious. So you imagine that how women do not, you know, make their

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.440
[Guest 2]: choices, their choices are already being made.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.080
[Amit Varma]: So here's my question for you. That fine, Lucknow and Delhi when you move there were

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.360
[Amit Varma]: like 18th century or 19th century India or whatever. And these attitudes were there and

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.480
[Amit Varma]: you just had to kind of adjust. But then you went on after that to work for the BBC, for

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.240
[Amit Varma]: example. Was that 21st century India?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:47.240
[Guest 2]: It is. It is because BBC gave me a perspective. I was not that open minded, I would say to

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.840
[Guest 2]: discuss certain things that the profession of journalism and the organisation gave me

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.240
[Guest 2]: to think about. And the newsroom was a space where we used to discuss each and everything.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:03.000
[Guest 2]: And it's a good space to do that. Because there is no filters that we have to apply

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.520
[Guest 2]: when we're discussing in meetings and all those things. But, you know, it took a lot

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.440
[Guest 2]: of time for me there also to be comfortable talking about it. Like Aditi now can talk

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:18.760
[Guest 2]: about her periods and I now can, but a few years down the line, I could not actually.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:25.080
[Guest 2]: So the organisation actually was something that offered me that space where I could open

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.480
[Guest 2]: up and explore.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And would you say it is true of journalism or are there still those misogynistic attitudes

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.040
[Amit Varma]: creeping into journalism itself?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.880
[Guest 2]: I would say true of journalism as a profession, definitely, because, you know, you are given

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.000
[Guest 2]: certain assignments like reporting assignments where you are challenged by the space that

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.600
[Guest 2]: you are accessing. And you have to understand that how you're going to do keeping yourself

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:57.720
[Guest 2]: safe at the same time delivering what is required of you. So I would say journalism definitely

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.240
[Guest 2]: made me a stronger person who is not only a woman, but a person.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.120
[Amit Varma]: A stronger person by empowering you or challenging you?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.520
[Guest 2]: Challenging me. Empowerment comes very late, you know, in Delhi, of course, when after

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.200
[Guest 2]: 2012 also, when all these steps were taken that people would be dropped off, women would

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.720
[Guest 2]: be dropped off with guards and all those things, that things, you think that a city can be

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.640
[Guest 2]: secured like that, it's not possible at all, you cannot do that. So empowerment is something

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest 2]: that I think our country needs to needs to think about, but challenging, of course, because

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.080
[Guest 2]: if you are challenged, then you think about your own security, and then you devise ways

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.520
[Guest 2]: of doing it. That is, again, is limiting your choices, because you don't have many choices

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.240
[Guest 2]: to you know, to function and to make yourself secured at the same time.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And Mumbai, of course, is a world apart from Delhi. So you started doing, for example,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:59.240
[Amit Varma]: open mics and stand up comedy in 2010. And on that, was it harder for you to be accepted?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.920
[Guest 1]: Yeah, because the truth is also that we are taught we are inconveniences, our bodies are

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.000
[Guest 1]: inconveniences, the space that we try to occupy is an inconvenience. Every time we speak up,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.680
[Guest 1]: it is an inconvenience. We are collateral damage to the narrative of the great man story.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:25.960
[Guest 1]: And we are side characters in our own story. And so I think that sense of like worthlessness,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.240
[Guest 1]: that's why it attaches itself to your psyche. That's why it attaches itself to our bodies.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.480
[Guest 1]: That's why I mean, marketers and advertisers can prey on our insecurities left, right and

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.920
[Guest 1]: center. I personally do not remember looking at my own body because I was terrified. I

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.520
[Guest 1]: was like, I don't know what is happening to my body as I grew up. Because I was like,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.720
[Guest 1]: I know that this is a problem. I know that this is going to like, restrict my space,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.240
[Guest 1]: this is going to make me invisible.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.960
[Guest 1]: And so it's going to make you invisible because people will see the body, not the person will

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.920
[Guest 1]: see the body and not the person will not hear the words and that has not stopped. That has

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.640
[Guest 1]: not stopped. I mean, I still am constantly getting you know, trash about what I wear

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:14.400
[Guest 1]: on stage. You know, even the way I'm sure no male comedian ever does. No, no, no. You

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.720
[Guest 1]: know, the kind of comments that that you see below my YouTube videos, which I've stopped

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.760
[Guest 1]: looking at. But if you see the kind of comments below my YouTube videos, they will have a

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:29.600
[Guest 1]: distinct color that I don't think any male comedian sees under their videos ever. The

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.080
[Guest 1]: kind of abuse even if you say something ridiculous and you know, the kind of abuse that comes

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:41.400
[Guest 1]: at you is always gendered. There is sexual abuse involved. There is rape threats involved.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.720
[Guest 1]: You know, there is general minimizing involved, which you don't see going to no matter how

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:55.360
[Guest 1]: outspoken a man. When I started doing and I mean, I remember at the age of 10 when my

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.240
[Guest 1]: I saw my brother was taking buses at the age of 10. And he had all these friends and he

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.400
[Guest 1]: was going and hanging out with them and they would you know, form these cool gangs and

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.120
[Guest 1]: they would go do cool things. And I remember I was dying to turn 10 so that I could take

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.840
[Guest 1]: a bus and go meet my school friends and everything and I knew never turned 10 I turned 10 when

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.880
[Guest 1]: I was 16 is when my mother finally allowed me to take a bus by myself. And that to then

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:24.880
[Guest 1]: of course, you know, the but don't even put your bag in front, you know, and I mean, you

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.800
[Guest 1]: see even today college girls going into trains into buses will have their bags will they

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.800
[Guest 1]: have their backpacks in front of them, instead of on their backs, they'll have them in front,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:42.880
[Guest 1]: because it takes your breasts off the spoking stabbing market for that journey at least.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.280
[Guest 1]: I mean, and for like, I remember I started doing open mics. My mother was genuinely confused.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.440
[Guest 1]: She was like, you're going, you know, into these clubs and stuff like that. First of

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.520
[Guest 1]: all, you're not even telling me what clubs these are. And then you come back late in

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.480
[Guest 1]: the night. And you know, I think her problem was a little different, where she was like,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.280
[Guest 1]: you're not even drunk. What did you do at this club? If you've come back sober? This

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:14.720
[Unknown]: is terrifying. Did you not go to a club? So much for empowerment. She was sort of like

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.720
[Guest 1]: she was terrified. She was like, you know, are you not going to clubs? Oh, God, you're

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.960
[Guest 1]: going to somewhere worse. And I was like, no, no, no, clubs only mom, clubs. But I know

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.640
[Guest 1]: it took her so much longer to come to terms with the fact that I was doing this and that

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:35.360
[Guest 1]: work required me to be out till say 1230 in the night. Even, you know, when I was sort

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.440
[Guest 1]: of when I would say these ridiculous things on stage, that some might find sort of edgy

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.680
[Guest 1]: or racy or whatever. I mean, luckily, I feel like as I mentioned earlier, that I've been

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:52.320
[Guest 1]: blessed with super, super open minded parents. I think I am more conservative than my parents.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.200
[Guest 1]: I think I police myself a lot more than they imagine policing me. Because I am like, I'm

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.200
[Guest 1]: like now they don't care. They don't say anything. Yeah, I have to be careful. Yeah. Who will

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.760
[Guest 1]: marry me? You know, all those thoughts that that sometimes even our parents have not put

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:17.280
[Guest 1]: into us have been ingrained into us by society. That, you know, if you if you speak too much,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.120
[Guest 1]: no man will ever find you attractive. This is my theory. The more a woman talks, the

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.320
[Guest 1]: lesser men want to f**k her. And men do not know what to do with a woman they do not want

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.960
[Unknown]: to f**k. I have realized that men are like, I don't want to put my dick in her why she's

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.640
[Guest 1]: still talking like they get damn confused. And you have to and I think at the age of

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.520
[Guest 1]: 32, I can finally say I'm okay with not fitting into any of the stereotypes that you have

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.960
[Guest 1]: in your narrative of your story. I don't care if you are like confused by me. Because I

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:58.400
[Guest 1]: am the hero of my own story. And it has taken me 32 years. I can't imagine I mean, I, I

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:05.040
[Guest 1]: hated my 20s. I hated the insecurity of my 20s. I hated how it made me feel. And I my

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.400
[Guest 1]: heart goes out to everybody who is navigating this world in their 20s with the level of

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.360
[Guest 1]: unsurety with the fact that you are constantly being sort of minimized told that you are

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.000
[Guest 1]: a side characters I said in somebody else's story. It just breaks my heart.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.360
[Amit Varma]: And what you said and all of us laugh when you said it just a few moments ago about men

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.800
[Amit Varma]: not knowing what to do with women that who are not sexual objects for them. We all laugh

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.440
[Amit Varma]: but the fact is that it's not actually a joke. It's actually just true. And earlier you mentioned,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, edgy content. And it also strikes me that a lot of content which coming from

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.960
[Amit Varma]: a male comedian would not be considered edgy like sexual talk and so on or talk of body

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.480
[Amit Varma]: parts and all that is suddenly madly edgy if it's coming from a woman. Yeah. So how

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.440
[Amit Varma]: do you deal with that when that realization comes that everything that you say has that

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.040
[Amit Varma]: added layer of the context of your gender to it? How does that then affect the world?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Do you try to sort of push the boundaries or do you censor yourself?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.800
[Guest 1]: And for a very long time, so I've been doing comedy for seven, eight years now, I was clinically

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:14.200
[Guest 1]: depressed for two during it, because I was terrified. I did not know what I was doing.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:21.400
[Guest 1]: And I knew that I didn't know how to do anything else. And I think the depression sort of,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.680
[Guest 1]: I mean, you know, sort of navigating through it, while simultaneously going on stage, of

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.240
[Guest 1]: course, because girls got to make a living was...

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.400
[Amit Varma]: You got paid in garlic bread, you mentioned in the last episode.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:44.400
[Guest 1]: What I meant was girls got to make an eating. But I know that I saw my peers travel much

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400
[Guest 1]: faster.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Your male peers.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.760
[Guest 1]: Yes, my male peers travel much faster to a journey that was taking me much longer. Even

00:23:51.760 --> 00:24:00.160
[Guest 1]: today the market rewards male comedians because more spaces are male, because the biases against

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.280
[Guest 1]: I mean, males, male comedians don't get your laugh is irritating. Your voice is irritating.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.080
[Guest 1]: She is making too many faces. I was like, this is my face. What do I do now? But that

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:19.160
[Guest 1]: you don't see are problems for male comedians. But if you don't fit a certain type of role,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.640
[Guest 1]: when you are like, I mean, and unfortunately, or fortunately, the four or five stereotypes

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.000
[Guest 1]: that we have of funny females is either you are grossly obese and disgusting to look at.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.160
[Guest 1]: And therefore your biggest shtick is how like you're just ugly and nobody will want to f**k

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.720
[Guest 1]: you. And that is the sort of the even the hero will, you know, you had the tuntuns and

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.600
[Guest 1]: the sort of these things where we just accompanied with...

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.640
[Guest 1]: There was very little narrative for somebody who was the hero of her own story or the heroine

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.680
[Guest 1]: of her own story.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.320
[Guest 1]: And I feel like I struggled with that for a very long time. I was like, what point of

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.160
[Guest 1]: view am I writing from? And should I, am I worth, am I valid in saying all these things

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.960
[Guest 1]: when I go into an audience? Does my personal story have any value? Because they don't want

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.440
[Guest 1]: to hear it. They're a group of, you know, 200 people who've come to laugh. So why should

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.720
[Guest 1]: I I mean, if I put myself out there, you know, what will the backlash be like? What will

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.920
[Guest 1]: I hear that? And how long can I take that for?

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And did you ever then in that case face a conflict between your desire for validation,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.600
[Amit Varma]: which of course, every artist wants, and your desire to also do the kind of work you want

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.840
[Guest 1]: to do and be true to yourself, whatever that may mean?

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.720
[Guest 1]: And that actually has never stopped. That never stops. That is a continuous process

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.480
[Guest 1]: that requires you to continuously engage your ego in this battle of like, I want to do this

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.960
[Guest 1]: so badly. I want to tell my story. I want to hear you laugh so badly. But at the same

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.680
[Guest 1]: time, I also want to protect myself. And I feel like with comedy, especially there was

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.120
[Guest 1]: no precedent. There was nobody in India that was doing it before me. And there were no

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.360
[Guest 1]: other women. So it was extremely lonely. And it was, you just sort of had to look within

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.800
[Guest 1]: yourself to find...

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.160
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, like if eight guys are performing on a given night, and you're the only woman,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.400
[Amit Varma]: you're in a sense like a freak, right? They're looking at you differently.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.840
[Guest 1]: I mean, and even the green rooms and you know, environments, I mean, you I'm sure have been

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.240
[Guest 1]: in all male environments. And what is now of course, legendarily known as locker room

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.680
[Guest 1]: talk, right? You know, at some point, you're sitting there and you're hearing some men

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.720
[Guest 1]: talk about another woman like that. And you're wondering, like you're looking out at the

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.160
[Guest 1]: floor and wondering, Oh, what are they saying when I leave the room? And if so, then should

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.600
[Guest 1]: I participate? Should I also participate in the abuse of this woman so that they will

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.600
[Guest 1]: think I am cool?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600
[Amit Varma]: One of them.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.560
[Guest 1]: That I am one of the guys.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560
[Guest 1]: And how do you reconcile that?

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.640
[Guest 1]: I am not one of the guys. I am not one of the guys. I have zero interest. Like I've

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.040
[Guest 1]: realized dudes are way more drama than girls, by the way. This is what I have learned by

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.640
[Guest 1]: interacting with groups of men is that they have way more drama in their lives.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.160
[Amit Varma]: Then what do you say that then being in these environments and you know, overhearing these

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.440
[Amit Varma]: conversations and finding out what men are really like, in a sense, as the solution due

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440
[Amit Varma]: to some extent?

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.800
[Guest 1]: Extremely, extremely. And the pushback also, that's I'm saying no, like when I started

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.920
[Guest 1]: doing comedy, I had nothing about men. I do not care about men from here to Pune. I have

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.760
[Guest 1]: zero interest in men. But I constantly got, excuse me, female comedian, you hate men.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.200
[Guest 1]: I'm like, why do you make it so easy then?

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.200
[Amit Varma]: And I was watching a YouTube clip of one of your shows and I'd encourage my listeners

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.120
[Amit Varma]: to check out all the clips on YouTube, where you were speaking in some show in Australia,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.160
[Amit Varma]: where you said that, you know, I'm, I've been introduced here as a comedian, but in India,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm always introduced as a female comedian.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.480
[Guest 1]: And you know, and that was the flip side of the empowerment, right? Is then they mollycoddle

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.960
[Guest 1]: you, then they'll be like, you don't want to get raped? Okay, now take these company

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.280
[Guest 1]: sanctioned cars. You are not going to save, you're not going to stop rape by wrapping

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:03.840
[Guest 1]: women in bubble wrap. You are going to stop rape by educating rapists to not rape. But

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.640
[Guest 1]: that seems to be something that I feel like, like our women's safety budget 100 crores

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.160
[Guest 1]: on CCTV cameras. I was like, use that money to just talk to dudes about how women are

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest 2]: human beings.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.080
[Guest 2]: And that's the issue, this protection thing that why do women have to, they are the sufferers.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.240
[Guest 2]: They are, you know, fighting their way out.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.600
[Guest 2]: You should be saying we are the sufferers.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.680
[Guest 2]: And then we have to actually protect ourselves. I mean, in our own country where we are born

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.560
[Guest 2]: and we are, I mean, we are the part of that productive population, we are contributing

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:45.640
[Guest 2]: to the economy, we are the part of that intellectual section of this society. And we have to protect

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.760
[Guest 2]: ourselves and find ways to not get raped and be molested and all those things. Why do we

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.760
[Amit Varma]: have to do that?

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.960
[Amit Varma]: It's incredibly perverse when you you frame it from the sense that if misogyny is a problem

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.840
[Amit Varma]: in India, surely the problem lies with the boys and not the girls. People who have the

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.720
[Amit Varma]: attitudes rather than the object of the attitudes. And you mentioned about, you know, women being

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.280
[Amit Varma]: a productive part of the workforce. And that's another thing I think that people sort of

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:13.120
[Amit Varma]: just take for granted that, you know, so many men will talk about growing the economy and

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.320
[Amit Varma]: this is our GDP growth rate and bang bang. But the point is that you treat half the people

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.400
[Amit Varma]: in the country as practically subhuman. And how many women in this country would actually

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.560
[Amit Varma]: be in the workforce and be productive? I'm not saying they're not productive if they're

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.880
[Amit Varma]: not in the workforce necessarily. But you know what I mean? They'd be far more fulfilled

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.960
[Amit Varma]: and contributing much more, but they're not allowed to.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.080
[Guest 1]: You know, this is sort of one of those things where 80% of the problems in this country

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.560
[Guest 1]: would really be solved if we tried to solve women's problems. Because obviously, as a

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:51.280
[Guest 1]: gender are people and specially prone to seeing the effects and consequences of bad policies,

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.640
[Guest 1]: bad public decision making. They are specially prone to suffering the consequences of that.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.780
[Guest 1]: If you started solving their problems one by one, you would have, like, I bet the number

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.760
[Guest 1]: of problems that we could solve and the kind of conclusions that we could come to are much

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:13.920
[Guest 1]: better. I mean, there is that fantastic Angela Saini book called inferior, which talks about

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.280
[Guest 1]: how you know, I mean, biologically, it's been said that women are inferior to men physically.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:26.720
[Guest 1]: And, and then she talks about the biases in data collection, is that we have all known

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.800
[Guest 1]: that a pain in your left arm is a sign of a heart attack. Turns out, it's mostly for

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.560
[Guest 1]: men. For women, the signs are very different. But we have all been taught that it's a pain

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.560
[Guest 1]: in your left arm. There have been people, women who have been having heart attacks and

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.680
[Unknown]: not known they're having heart attacks, because there's no pain, because they've been waiting

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.840
[Guest 1]: for their left arm to hurt. It is I mean, and I mean, science clearly is not sexist

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:59.120
[Guest 1]: or corruptible. But the people who are practicing said science are just, the samples are male,

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.080
[Guest 1]: are just are corruptible and sexist. I mean, not willingly, clearly, but I mean, the sort

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:14.160
[Guest 1]: of the systemic oppression and ignoring of women in the mainstream has just has had,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.160
[Guest 1]: I mean, long term effects that we are going to see for the next six, eight generations.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So now my big question is, are we, you know, now that we've sort of moved well into the

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.360
[Amit Varma]: 21st century and the social media and we are exposed to attitudes around the world, are

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.080
[Amit Varma]: we changing or not? But I'll come back to that after a quick commercial break.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.880
[Unknown]: So welcome to another week on IVM. If you aren't following us on social media, please

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.000
[Unknown]: his coding craze and a lot more about his stories. And now, on to your shows.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.320
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the Scene and the Unseen. I'm chatting with Aditi and Swati about the

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.760
[Amit Varma]: broad subject of claiming your space, specifically talking about the misogyny in the industries

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.280
[Amit Varma]: that they are part of, which is entertainment, journalism and in Indian society in general.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.360
[Amit Varma]: So my question to both of you is that, you know, in terms of technology and access to

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.280
[Amit Varma]: the world and so on, India's modernizing really fast, social media, we are, you know, the

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Me Too movement was all over the interwebs recently, and so on. And there is a lot more

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.240
[Amit Varma]: talk of feminism coming even from men, though one could argue that a lot of it is performative

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.440
[Amit Varma]: feminism and it's just, you know, empty virtue signaling without anything really behind it.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:09.240
[Amit Varma]: Have things been changing in actual concrete terms in the way? Like, is it easier for women

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.480
[Amit Varma]: today than they were when you guys entered your respective professions?

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:19.520
[Guest 2]: It's difficult to say that it's easier and how it is happening is to be seen as well.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.760
[Guest 2]: Because if you see urban women like us who have opportunities, if they get educated,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.160
[Guest 2]: if they are alive and they get educated, they have opportunities, definitely, no matter

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.160
[Guest 2]: how difficult the way is, but then how they are achieving that has to be seen. You know,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.960
[Guest 2]: every morning when I leave home, there is a cook who comes to cook for me and my husband,

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.360
[Guest 2]: which means that my success somewhere is related to her unsuccess.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And the irony is that she is also relatively empowered compared to her peers.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:57.840
[Guest 2]: Yes, yes. But this success, what we consider as success is actually is half hearted. And

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.440
[Guest 2]: I don't think so that it can be seen as a success or achievement because there is a

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.480
[Guest 2]: very, very small minuscule section which is being empowered, if at all. What about all

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:14.400
[Guest 2]: those women who are not part of this, this league? Are we not going to think about them?

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.480
[Guest 2]: Are we not going to do anything about them?

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.240
[Amit Varma]: And you've actually studied film studies. So let me, so the next question might be right

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:26.560
[Amit Varma]: up your street, which is, I know popular culture merely reinforces what society is also like,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.080
[Amit Varma]: but in reinforcing that, you know, it's sort of a vicious cycle that plays out. How much

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:39.280
[Amit Varma]: of a role does popular culture have to play in terms of the role of women in Indian society?

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.080
[Amit Varma]: And is that something that has gradually changed? Like, essentially, the reason so many Indian

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.280
[Amit Varma]: men end up so entitled and become stalkers of women is because that's what you see in

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.880
[Amit Varma]: Bollywood films. That's how you win a woman's heart by teasing her and harassing her till

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.320
[Amit Varma]: she eventually gives in. Is that changing? And how much of a role does popular culture

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.320
[Guest 2]: play in that?

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:06.400
[Guest 2]: Yeah, definitely. Popular culture itself is a representation of what you see around. If

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:12.640
[Guest 2]: you see the history of various forms of popular culture, say films, if we see how many women

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.840
[Guest 2]: have given space in history, like you were saying that we have to claim space and you

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.600
[Guest 2]: were mentioning about Tuntun. Do we actually want to know about Tuntun and how many people

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:31.480
[Guest 2]: have written about Tuntun? So that kind of thing that they have been systematically relegated

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.640
[Guest 2]: to the margins in every spare.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, here's a tragedy that, you know, I heard Tuntun's name today just now in the

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.440
[Amit Varma]: podcast when you brought it up after probably decades. And I remembered at the last time

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.520
[Amit Varma]: I heard her name, I would, when I was a kid, I would probably have laughed at the thought

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:51.680
[Amit Varma]: of Tuntun. And one should not laugh at the thought of Tuntun. It's incredibly, you know,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.520
[Guest 1]: and everything that, you know, I mean, you think about

00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.720
[Guest 1]: someone, but someone as amazing as Shobha Kote, for example, you're like, what a woman,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.920
[Guest 1]: what timing, those scenes that, oh my God, just stellar work. Who's talking about her

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.640
[Guest 1]: in comedy? Who is, I mean, even when we went through the history of comedy, there's very

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.840
[Guest 1]: little mention of women. There's very little mention of their contributions. And you know,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.320
[Guest 1]: I agree. I mean, I agree and disagree to a certain extent that because I feel like whenever

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.960
[Guest 1]: Bollywood film, then we're like, wow, wow, look, Bollywood is affecting society change.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.560
[Guest 1]: But then when bad things happen, you're like, well, it's just art. So there has to be a

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.120
[Guest 1]: level of somewhere where responsibilities are taken on both ends, right? By the filmmakers

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.760
[Guest 1]: to realize that, okay, we are living in a world where, you know, violence against women

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.200
[Guest 1]: is at its peak or is being reported at its peak. And it's something that everybody is

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.240
[Guest 1]: talking about and needs to be addressed. So I maybe will not make a rape revenge fantasy

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.400
[Guest 1]: film for a man, maybe, you know what I'm saying? As a filmmaker, maybe you decide to take that

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.480
[Amit Varma]: responsibility. There was a horrible film which came out last year where Hrithik Roshan

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.240
[Amit Varma]: played a blind guy, one of a blind couple and his wife gets raped. And the second time

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.160
[Amit Varma]: she gets raped, she kills herself. And she does it for the reason that she doesn't want

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:08.640
[Amit Varma]: to cause him any more pain because every time she is raped, he is getting caused pain. And

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.920
[Amit Varma]: that is just mind blowing. This is a film which came out last year. How can those people

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.520
[Guest 1]: even agree to act in those movies? And so there has to be there has to I mean, there

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:26.440
[Guest 1]: has to be a responsibility taken in both directions. And I mean, truly the we cannot there's that

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.400
[Guest 1]: whole chicken and egg situation where you're like, oh, does the phenomena come first or

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.560
[Guest 1]: the this thing? These are two inextricably tied in to each other. And you attack them

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.320
[Guest 1]: where you can. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's because and I you know what, this is one thing

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.800
[Guest 1]: that I find very amazing is when people are like you comedians, y'all are attacking that

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:52.680
[Guest 1]: movie. I was like, I eat my dinner for lunch the next day. I have worn my pajamas for five

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.800
[Guest 1]: days in a row. You know what I'm saying? That's my level of power. So me saying something

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:04.240
[Guest 1]: stupid to some dumb movie, which is a 60 crore project with 40 crores in this thing you're

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:10.920
[Unknown]: telling me my stupid to have pajamas Salman Khan doesn't even have a shirt. Shame on you,

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:17.040
[Guest 1]: you privileged person. But you know, we we have stopped acknowledging the unevenness

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.440
[Guest 1]: of power. That sort of popular culture because I don't know when popular culture became the

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.600
[Guest 1]: victim. I don't know when Bollywood became the thing to be protected. I don't know when

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.160
[Guest 1]: the other day also some that Airtel thing happened where some girl right, you know,

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:40.880
[Unknown]: said some nonsense. Somebody was like, I feel bad for Airtel. I said once you feel bad.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:48.560
[Unknown]: I feel bad for Airtel. What? This is a corporate with money with PR with what? And also no

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.920
[Unknown]: matter what has been done to a company should never feel bad for a company. Definitely never

00:38:52.920 --> 00:39:01.560
[Unknown]: ever for a company. That's that's sort of that's my heart beats for relying on Adani

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:10.120
[Guest 1]: cop must be lying awake in bed. Poor Adani cop. You know that that sort of like treating

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.680
[Guest 1]: pop culture as if it's equal to the people who are consuming it is very dangerous. Right?

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's a vicious circle they feed on each other. Yes, and everything is interrelated.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.160
[Amit Varma]: But you attack them when you can. If you see something wrong, you call it out. Yes. That

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.280
[Amit Varma]: doesn't mean you have to call everything that is wrong out. I'm just preempting the inevitable

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:33.360
[Amit Varma]: what about the Airtel ka naam liya, Hatch ne bhi wo kya, uska naam kyu nahi liya. So

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.600
[Amit Varma]: before we started recording this Swati, you were talking about journalism and how it is

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.120
[Amit Varma]: such still today such a misogynistic profession and you said something that intrigued me.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.440
[Amit Varma]: You said that even the women who have risen to the top of the profession have turned themselves

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:54.880
[Guest 2]: into men. I'm going to ask you to elaborate on that. Yes. I think my experience I'm talking

00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:02.440
[Guest 2]: only from my experience and I can't talk for others. But my experience has been like that.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:09.640
[Guest 2]: Because I think that's the way for women to reach to the top. I definitely know that it's

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:16.680
[Guest 2]: much harder for them than their male colleagues. But then in that, you know, fight, when they

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.040
[Guest 2]: become like their male colleagues is something that they're not conscious about.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.720
[Amit Varma]: When you say that's a way for them to reach to the top, you mean play the patriarchal

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:31.020
[Guest 2]: game, do the whining? Yeah, I mean, because there is a lot of fight going on internally

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.160
[Guest 2]: and externally, you know, when you're trying to achieve something within a space that has

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:42.480
[Guest 2]: its set rule, because you cannot change the organizational rule. So you somehow now device

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:50.040
[Guest 2]: ways of dealing with it. And the people that you're dealing with are not easy. Then what

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:56.120
[Guest 2]: happens is your own tools and equipments that you have to fight it out do not feel sufficient,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.080
[Guest 2]: you have to learn something, do something undo something. And that process actually

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:08.080
[Guest 2]: changes you before you even realize it that it has, you know, has had an impact on you

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:13.120
[Guest 2]: in a way that you're not recognizing it, but you are completely changed by the time you

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.840
[Guest 2]: pass through that entire tunnel and you reach to the target where you wanted to, you are

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.320
[Amit Varma]: a completely changed person. So if I can just paraphrase that to make sure I'm understanding

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.120
[Amit Varma]: it correctly, what you mean is that, let's say that you're a journalist, and you have

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.960
[Amit Varma]: great journalistic skills, whatever they are, but that's not all you need to get ahead.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.120
[Amit Varma]: You also have to play that corporate game of getting ahead in the organization according

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.120
[Amit Varma]: to certain rules, whether they are certain rules of socializing or certain modes of behavior

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:45.480
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. And if you choose to play that game to get ahead in the profession,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.080
[Amit Varma]: then that will inevitably change you as a person in the process. And you will become

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.840
[Amit Varma]: a part of that game, which is what you mean by the women who reach the top turning into

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.880
[Guest 2]: men. Yeah, because you are trying to fit in somewhere and it has its own, you know, set

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:04.680
[Guest 2]: of rules to and consequences to confirm, I mean, rules to confirm to and consequences

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.960
[Guest 2]: that will follow. You know that this is the only way. And that is how you decide that

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.680
[Guest 2]: whether I want this or I don't want this, like I made a decision that I don't want this.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:21.080
[Guest 2]: So I did not have, you know, have to walk that particular road. And I made my alternative

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.960
[Guest 2]: to you know, reach somewhere where I want to see myself. So everybody is not able to

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.760
[Guest 2]: make that. Yes. In a way, I find myself privileged and I'm in complete harmony with myself, no

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:38.800
[Guest 2]: matter what others think about it. You know, in a workspace, when you are not able to follow

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:45.000
[Guest 2]: the rules, you are seen as somebody who is cynical, who is not making enough effort to

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.560
[Guest 2]: do something. I have heard from my bosses that, you know, you're very pessimistic and

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.160
[Guest 2]: you're a cynical person because you're not there are so many opportunities, you're not

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.440
[Guest 2]: trying to grab them. Because I saw people grabbing those opportunities and the ways

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.080
[Guest 2]: it through which you know, those opportunities can be grabbed. And I'm somebody who decided

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:09.280
[Guest 2]: that okay, I don't want to be that successful. What success actually means in those terms.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.680
[Guest 2]: So it's okay for me that if I'm not successful, that's the way I am. But people who have actually

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.700
[Guest 2]: achieved it would not admit that, that they have done that. But they would say that these

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:27.800
[Guest 2]: are the ways to achieve success, because you can't do much about it. It's a constitutional

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.880
[Guest 2]: thing. Like there is a constitution which has already been set. It's not being said

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.600
[Guest 2]: by women, but they have to follow that it's the rule of law, and you live by the rule

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600
[Amit Varma]: of law.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.520
[Amit Varma]: In all fairness, I'll just say that, you know, I write for a number of publications and all

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.560
[Amit Varma]: my editors at this current point in time are women and they have reached the top of the

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.000
[Amit Varma]: professions and they're very strong women and I respect them a lot. But I can't speak

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.160
[Guest 1]: on their behalf. You know, you're sharing your experience. So,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest 1]: You know, and that's what it is, is that, I mean, because often this, the conversations

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.800
[Guest 1]: around patriarchy and misogyny ends up becoming a men versus women thing, which it is not.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:14.360
[Guest 1]: Women can be misogynistic as well. And I can say safely that, you know, before I sort of

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:20.040
[Guest 1]: got introduced to so many feminist women and feminist thought, I was also a misogynist.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:30.040
[Guest 1]: I was in charge of my own oppression. I internalized my own misogyny to hate myself enough because

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:37.240
[Guest 1]: I knew that that was what everybody else was doing. And so, you know, when I meet women

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:42.160
[Guest 1]: who are misogynistic, it doesn't surprise me. It just breaks my heart a little bit that

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.840
[Guest 1]: like, you know, this is sort of, I wish I could tell you that this is about, you know,

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.040
[Guest 1]: it could free both of us if we stopped thinking like this, but that's not my place.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.160
[Guest 1]: They made the choices. Exactly. And I cannot be the judge of how

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:02.600
[Guest 1]: they got to making those choices. Yes, if you know, if they are in turn hampering my

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:09.640
[Guest 1]: growth, I can be mad. But that's at the max I can be is mad because it just, I understand

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.400
[Guest 1]: that the systems that are oppressing me are the same systems that are oppressing them.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:21.000
[Guest 1]: And with women, I just feel like the conversations you can have are very different. Whereas with

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.920
[Guest 1]: men, I have seen an active resistance to understanding. And I mean this in the most like the most

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.400
[Guest 1]: well-meaning men will turn around and be like, what you're saying women are discriminated

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:37.560
[Guest 1]: against. That's crazy. I'm like, you're kidding. You're kidding. I have done. I mean, I have

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.040
[Guest 1]: to say this. I don't do interviews anymore because it's been a year and a half since

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.120
[Guest 1]: I've done an interview. And I just stopped doing them because I was getting calls from

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.280
[Guest 1]: female journalists, of course, who would call me and say that the you know, we want to talk

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest 1]: to you about comedy, and then it would just go into but tell us about sexism. And I was

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.040
[Guest 1]: like, but I have brilliant thoughts about comedy as well. But to them, they're like,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.040
[Guest 1]: we're doing you a favor by showcasing you. Yeah, if you wanted to talk about comedy,

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:08.320
[Guest 1]: we'd call the XYZ. We'd call the men, but we are calling you so now avratas. And so

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:14.120
[Guest 1]: then you have to avrat them. And so beyond the point, and also I mean, like, to be honest,

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:22.280
[Guest 1]: you meet sort of interviewers who are so deeply dismissive of the work that you do. I have

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.280
[Guest 1]: had to educate all my interview, whenever I get called for an interview, I'm like, have

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.520
[Guest 1]: you seen a show? Do you want I'll send you a video so you watch it. So you know what

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:36.120
[Guest 1]: you're talking about when I give you my free time to come and tell you about my work.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.120
[Amit Varma]: At this point, Swati, I must confess that when I invited Aditi on the show, I proposed

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:45.000
[Amit Varma]: two ideas. I said one, we can talk about the history of stand up comedy in India, especially

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.920
[Amit Varma]: and two, we can talk about misogyny in entertainment. So it's like talking about me.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:56.240
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, you know, again, don't be defensive. Yeah, exactly. And no, and the and you know,

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.180
[Amit Varma]: going on that don't be defensive point. It is also true that whenever you mention misogyny

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:06.760
[Amit Varma]: to a man, the man will take it as if it is a personal slur and get defensive. And that,

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:12.440
[Amit Varma]: in a sense is also an admission of guilt in a manner of speaking. Yes. Yeah. And I mean,

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.080
[Guest 1]: you know, the thing is, I like we are all misogynist. We have all been misogynist at

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:22.520
[Amit Varma]: some point in time or the other. And misogyny is just one level of f***ed upness. We are

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.560
[Amit Varma]: all humans are f***ed up in various different human ways. And it's fine. If you work on

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.920
[Amit Varma]: that and acknowledge that like, when I look back on myself as you know, 15 years ago,

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.960
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't just misogynist. I was a lot else which is you know, you work past that. Yeah.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:49.680
[Guest 1]: And and I think we especially with the elite women's right now. We are angry. We're angry.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.880
[Guest 1]: Women are who are realizing their rights. And the way they have been discriminated against

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:59.360
[Guest 1]: are angry. And I feel like that anger also intimidates people and they will tell you

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:05.760
[Guest 1]: tone down your anger, be nicer, be more palatable. How much how many waves of feminism will come

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.680
[Guest 1]: and go before you will realize that this anger is justified, that this is costing us time,

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.560
[Guest 1]: costing us money, costing us emotions, costing us energy, costing us careers, costing us,

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.960
[Guest 1]: you know, families, how much longer and how much more politely would you like someone

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:26.800
[Amit Varma]: to say, please stop f***ing XYZ over? So what do you answer then be to the question I'd

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.560
[Amit Varma]: earlier asked and Swati had taken on that are things getting better within this age

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.120
[Guest 1]: of social media and so on? In fact, I think, no, you know, I don't know if they're getting

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:43.640
[Guest 1]: better as an absolute whole. The fields where it can be messed up is even more like, like

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:49.000
[Guest 1]: now the the what used to be these conversations in public spaces like on the roads, where

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.840
[Guest 1]: you're walking down the road and you get cat called and then you suddenly cover yourself

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.280
[Guest 1]: up with your dupatta and you walk a little smaller. Those conversations are being taken

00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.320
[Guest 1]: online. Yeah. So now you are sitting at a Twitter account where you've just wanted to

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.640
[Guest 1]: say I ate an apple and then suddenly you've got 300 you know abuses under that and so

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.200
[Guest 1]: you realize well I'm not going to come back to this site. I'm not going to say so how

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.120
[Guest 1]: do you deal with that you don't read the comments? I personally you know again it took me time

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:20.360
[Guest 1]: it took me time and it requires a lot of sort of it requires a lot of mental energy and

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.360
[Guest 1]: it costs you a lot where you see your male peers shooting off at the mouth and you know

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.320
[Guest 1]: getting ahead in life and whatever it is that they're doing. Whereas you are sort of like

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.160
[Amit Varma]: no no no I don't know I should cut my back back in front of you you're wearing a backpack

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:39.400
[Guest 1]: in front of you very essentially and it takes time it takes time but I I know for a fact

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:46.000
[Guest 1]: that this is a thing and that the battle as we explore new fields is not going to become

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.960
[Guest 1]: absolutely better. The battle will take different shapes and forms of just being able to protect

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:57.600
[Guest 2]: yourself and being able to be free at the same time. And I think we really need to question

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:06.800
[Guest 2]: women's role also because it's very important to recognize that who is actually playing

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:13.200
[Guest 2]: an important role in carrying this kind of tradition forward. It's not only men because

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:20.560
[Guest 2]: it can't happen like that. It's it's definitely males and females both and we have to realize

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.440
[Amit Varma]: it and at some point address it. Wasn't it Kareena Kapoor who recently dismissively said

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.760
[Guest 2]: oh but I'm not a feminist. But I'm not I would not say that I'm a feminist. Yeah well well

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean I mean my position there really is that every decent person male or female should

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.120
[Guest 1]: be a feminist should be a feminist. Yeah you know being human. You know but this is another

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.480
[Guest 1]: thing. Why is the labor of claiming feminism on Kareena Kapoor. Why does nobody go to Shakti

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.680
[Guest 1]: Kapoor and say Bhai tumne toh bahut rape scene ki hai. Tell us are you a feminist. Nobody

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:53.560
[Guest 1]: asks him that. So again the the labor of even I've realized that I think the media focuses

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.240
[Amit Varma]: on that because it's more newsworthy if Kareena says she's not a feminist and Shakti Kapoor

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.840
[Guest 1]: says she's not a feminist. Shakti Kapoor is the one that has you know caused the problems

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.120
[Guest 2]: now. But Shakti Kapoor is not that popular also. I think that could be one of the reasons

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.040
[Guest 1]: that when Kareena Kapoor says something so we'll listen to her. Make a big deal out of

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.440
[Guest 1]: it. That's what I'm saying. If you are a woman journalist realize that the things that you're

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:21.080
[Guest 1]: doing and you know this sort of this pinning the blame and even asking women to take the

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.720
[Guest 1]: mantle of fixing things. I've noticed that with this immigration crisis that's happening

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:33.520
[Guest 1]: right now. 90% of the female comics on my Twitter timeline are doing charity shows.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.680
[Guest 1]: Charity shows to send money to these kids that are in these detention centers right

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:44.880
[Guest 1]: now. Not any male comics. And it is because just women are putting themselves out there

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.840
[Guest 1]: more taking on the labor of fixing the problems that they see. And to me you know I agree

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:56.040
[Guest 1]: with you that we have to as a society address patriarchy and the problems that misogyny

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:02.240
[Guest 1]: is causing and the economic loss that amount that misogyny is costing us in sort of income

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.600
[Guest 1]: is crazy. But we also have to look at the role of men. And the fact is that you have

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.240
[Guest 1]: to sort of realize that this problem is not only because it's a woman's problem. It's

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.000
[Guest 1]: only for women. This is a problem that both genders need to sit down and address. And

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.800
[Guest 1]: very rarely is the other drawbacks of patriarchy on men discussed. So let's say there's a male

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:30.160
[Guest 1]: listener of my show and hopefully there are male listeners of my show. I figured by now

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.480
[Guest 1]: all the men have tuned out. All the men are like these bitches. No, I really doubt it.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:40.480
[Amit Varma]: Every man who hasn't tuned out kindly leave a Twitter message in support of these ladies

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.840
[Unknown]: and please tag them on it. Please. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.280
[Amit Varma]: no, no, no, no, no, no. Good men should also speak up once in a while so here's kind of

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.800
[Amit Varma]: my final question to you, you've painted a really dismal picture and so on. And assuming

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:59.240
[Amit Varma]: that there are male listeners of this show of any age who agree with the fact that this

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:04.280
[Amit Varma]: picture is really dismal, but whose responses to say that, look, I know that I am a nice

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:10.220
[Amit Varma]: guy in my personal life. It's a fact. My sympathies are with you, but I don't do any of these

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:14.040
[Amit Varma]: things. I'm a good person. But that's not the whole story. What would you want to say

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.560
[Guest 1]: to them? First, I would say stop getting defensive when somebody says there's a problem. Right.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:25.320
[Guest 1]: Because, because every time I like you just say man, dudes are like this, there'll be 600 dudes.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.280
[Amit Varma]: What if they don't get defensive and they just shrug their shoulder and say not my problem.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.200
[Guest 1]: And that's also fine. Actually, that would be preferable to you being like, excuse me,

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:39.160
[Guest 1]: not all men. So one is don't get defensive. Two, talk to other men. I think right now the biggest

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.640
[Guest 1]: education needs to be given from one man to another one because men will only listen to each

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:51.640
[Guest 1]: other. Two, also because there is the fact is that men need to start discussing how patriarchy

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:57.080
[Guest 1]: is affecting them. They need to start discussing how emotionally stunted men have become because

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.080
[Guest 1]: of the fact that they are not allowed to express their emotions. They need to discuss what is the

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:09.480
[Guest 1]: crazy suicide rates among men of the age of 15 to what is it 45. What is causing that? They need to

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.160
[Guest 1]: discuss what is causing that. I don't know. You tell me. It's, it's, it's a, it's a male problem.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.600
[Guest 1]: It's a young men are committing suicide in larger numbers than any other subgroup.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.160
[Amit Varma]: Toxic feminism. I'm kidding. Don't look at me like that. I'm not even looking at you.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.720
[Guest 1]: Men need to start discussing with each other. And this is one thing. I mean, if you see a creep,

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.840
[Guest 1]: if you see a fellow friend who's a creep, address it immediately. Because when your

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.600
[Guest 1]: creepy friend gets called out, then it's going to be much more difficult for you to be like,

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.680
[Guest 1]: well, actually, I thought he was just a friend, but he's a creep. It's much better to quickly

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:53.320
[Guest 1]: tell your friend, listen, brother, you're being a creep. Don't be a creep. Don't be a creep,

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:58.760
[Guest 1]: right? It is much easier. It will save you and the entire ecosystem of brotherhood that you

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:06.120
[Guest 1]: are supporting a lot of trouble. If you start calling each other out. One that, so that's three,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:13.240
[Guest 1]: four, don't interrupt women. Five, listen to what they're saying. Start with these five and,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:20.760
[Guest 1]: and believe them, believe them because you realize that women think a lot before speaking up.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:26.840
[Guest 1]: They think a lot before speaking up. And so, and therefore the words carry more weight.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.400
[Guest 1]: They're, they're, they're worth, especially if they're speaking directly to you,

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.320
[Guest 1]: understand that a woman who is speaking directly to you is taking some time out.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.480
[Guest 1]: If she's explaining stuff to you, she is taking some time out. So appreciate that. Also,

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.520
[Guest 1]: this one, it's a final one is that when two women are talking or when women are talking to an

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:54.040
[Guest 1]: audience, don't interrupt them. Save all your feminism for your fellow men. It'll help.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:56:00.840
[Guest 2]: That's an amazing point. Swati. I think I would say two things only. One is a sensitization. We

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.560
[Amit Varma]: really need to sensitize men and at various levels. And you'd say that like Aditi said,

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.600
[Amit Varma]: the responsibility of that is also on the men themselves. Men themselves. That was my second

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:21.480
[Guest 2]: point. So the first point is to sensitize them at every level. I mean, right from home to school to

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:28.360
[Guest 2]: the organization that they go to work. That's very, very important. Otherwise they never realize

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.360
[Guest 2]: what they're actually doing. If they're not sensitive enough to what they're doing, their

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.720
[Guest 2]: words, their actions, their postures, gestures, you have no idea how gestures, postures, and,

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:43.240
[Guest 2]: you know, those smirks actually, you know, psychologically affect you when two men are

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:47.560
[Guest 2]: doing that and you know, okay, I'm not part of that. So there is something which is going on.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.280
[Guest 2]: It might be against me, might not be against me, but you are actually focusing on that,

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.760
[Guest 2]: which takes your energy, which is your creative energy. If you are creative or if you are in the

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:02.280
[Guest 2]: field where you are supposed to do something. So that's one thing that they need to be sensitized

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:07.320
[Guest 2]: that women are normal human beings. They are human beings like you. They feel,

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.400
[Unknown]: if you precast, you will not bleed.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:25.560
[Guest 2]: And second thing is, I think we need a men's movement for women, because this is not going

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:31.880
[Guest 2]: to happen, you know, in isolation that women, okay, everywhere at every platform, like she said

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.440
[Guest 2]: that Kareena Kapoor herself is not responsible for, you know, saying that, okay, I'm a feminist,

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:42.440
[Guest 2]: okay, she opts out of it, then what? And I'm not sure that it can happen in such a diverse and,

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:48.920
[Guest 2]: you know, huge country, which is so divided on various lines, but that is a solution to this

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:54.120
[Amit Varma]: problem from micro level to macro level. And at some level, it's also a call for self-awareness,

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.680
[Amit Varma]: because men instead of getting defensive and saying, oh, they are saying that men are bad,

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.360
[Amit Varma]: are actually saying that many men are just clueless. And if they were a little more

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:07.160
[Amit Varma]: clued into what they are doing, and you know, the world would be a better place.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.200
[Guest 1]: Yeah. And also last one, if you ever have any thoughts about like, oh, what should I do in

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:17.640
[Guest 1]: this case? Is this sexist? You know, what would a woman think? Ask a woman.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:23.320
[Amit Varma]: Boom. On that excellent note, we shall end this episode. Aditi and Swati,

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.560
