00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of the scene in the unseen, I have a recommendation for

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.600
[Amit Varma]: you. Do check out Pulya Bazi hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Kotesane, two really good

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.880
[Amit Varma]: friends of mine. Kickass podcast in Hindi. It's amazing.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.840
[Amit Varma]: Liberals, progressives, conservatives, libertarians. I have a problem with these labels. In fact,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.160
[Amit Varma]: I have four problems with these labels. Problem one, they have changed meaning over time.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.200
[Amit Varma]: The word liberal meant one thing in the 19th century and means quite another in the 21st.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And it means different things in different parts of the world. For example, American

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.320
[Amit Varma]: liberals often have the opposite beliefs to European liberals and classical liberals and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.720
[Amit Varma]: left liberals are often at loggerheads with one another. Problem two, the proper nouns

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.880
[Amit Varma]: often do not mean what the common noun does. For example, I meet too many liberals who

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.440
[Amit Varma]: are anything but liberal. So many progressives are certainly not progressive and many conservatives

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.280
[Amit Varma]: are actually quite radical. Problem three, these labels have acquired a tribal significance.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And if you call yourself say libertarian, it is held as meaning that you belong to a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.320
[Amit Varma]: tribe of people who call themselves libertarian and not that you believe in a certain set

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.080
[Amit Varma]: of values. And you then become part of the tribal warfare between liberals and conservatives

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.200
[Amit Varma]: and progressives and libertarians. And the discussion becomes heated and personal, degenerating

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: to abuse rather than calm and rational revolving around values. Problem four, these labels

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.640
[Amit Varma]: are meaningless in an Indian context. Politics in India is not divided in the left right

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.640
[Amit Varma]: spectrum as it is in the West and identity politics dominates here. Though I did explore

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.480
[Amit Varma]: in episode 131 of the scene in the unseen, the theory that ideological fault lines do

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.160
[Amit Varma]: exist in Indian politics, but around different issues than in the West. And yet, here I am

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.360
[Amit Varma]: doing an episode called the Indian conservative. Why is this? Well, here's the thing. The scene

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.600
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen is basically driven by my intellectual curiosity about ideas and events. And over

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.440
[Amit Varma]: the last few months, I have been reexamining a prior belief I held about India, that there

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.440
[Amit Varma]: was no such thing as conservatism in India. I held the view that conservatism as it is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.840
[Amit Varma]: in the West, say Burkean conservatism was missing in India, and that the term conservative

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.720
[Amit Varma]: was used as a respectable fig leaf by communal bigots who were simply indulging in identity

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.040
[Amit Varma]: politics. This is partly true, but I've come to realize that it's a simplistic view, and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.400
[Amit Varma]: that there have been strains of conservative thought in India. And if we want to understand

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.000
[Amit Varma]: this country as it is today, we need to engage with it seriously and respectfully. My intellectual

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.200
[Amit Varma]: journey on the subject has partly taken place in public through various episodes of the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.040
[Amit Varma]: scene in the unseen, in which I've spoken to guests like Aakar Patel, Suyash Rai, Rahul

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Verma and Akshay Mukul. Today, I take one more step in that journey with a fine author

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.960
[Amit Varma]: who has written an erudite book called the Indian conservative, which is therefore the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.640
[Amit Varma]: subject of this episode, and of my continuing exploration of the hidden currents that drive

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.240
[Amit Varma]: our great nation.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.600
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.400
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Jayatit Rao, better known as Jerry

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.360
[Amit Varma]: Rao, who made his fortune as an IT entrepreneur and his name as a columnist in various national

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.520
[Amit Varma]: newspapers over a couple of decades. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book, the Indian conservative,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: which defines conservatism, locates it in India's own traditions, rather than just to

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.560
[Amit Varma]: Western thought, and proposes and maps out two major strains of Indian conservatism in

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.360
[Amit Varma]: a formulation that was both new and thought provoking for me. The conversation you'll

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.160
[Amit Varma]: hear now is both combative and respectful, which brings me to an aside about a criticism

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.440
[Amit Varma]: some have leveled at me, that I do not invite guests who I disagree with. This is an absurd

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.160
[Amit Varma]: criticism, because I have had disagreements with every single guest I've had on the show,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.400
[Amit Varma]: but always expressed in a civil way. Listeners used to the vituperative violence of social

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.480
[Amit Varma]: media may not even have realized that an argument was underway. This particular conversation

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.720
[Amit Varma]: was great fun for both Jerry and me. But before we go there, let's take a quick commercial

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.080
[Amit Varma]: break. Hey, I want to thank Intel for supporting the scene and the unseen. If you haven't already,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.320
[Amit Varma]: I recommend you check out Intel vPro. Intel vPro is a business platform that maximizes

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.840
[Amit Varma]: the performance of your company's computers. One of the ways in which it does this is through

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.400
[Amit Varma]: their active management technology, or AMT. AMT allows a company to discover, repair and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.160
[Amit Varma]: manage computing assets. This means features like remote power on, set wake up times and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.960
[Amit Varma]: schedule updates, see your infrastructure remotely even when it's down, recover faulty

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.520
[Amit Varma]: systems without sending a tech like I've seen work grind to a halt in companies when something

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.160
[Amit Varma]: is not working and tech support is taking forever to even show up. Intel's active management

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.320
[Amit Varma]: technology or AMT allows companies to sort these issues out super fast, remotely, you

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.560
[Amit Varma]: get to make the most of your time and resources. What's not to like? For more details, head

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.080
[Amit Varma]: on over to Intel dot i n slash vPro. That's v p r o Intel dot i n slash vPro. Keep it

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.840
[Amit Varma]: running. Keep it smooth. Jerry, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you so much

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Amit. Before we get down to talking about your book, The Indian Conservative, which

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.280
[Amit Varma]: I greatly enjoyed reading very thought provoking. Let's first talk a little bit about your personal

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.400
[Guest]: journey like what makes Jerry Rao, Jerry Rao? Well, I guess some relatively standard kind

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:56.080
[Guest]: of Indian middle class background on the 50s, 60s, 70s. My father was an official in the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.840
[Guest]: government and he got transferred from place to place and we as a family moved with him

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.280
[Guest]: from place to place. We are South Indian originally from the state of Tamil Nadu, but we are not

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.280
[Guest]: Tamilians. We are Kannada speaking people. My family roots go back to Coimbatore. But

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.600
[Guest]: for more than 100 years now, 120 years, we've been in Madras. So Madras is where I finished

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:33.040
[Guest]: school and did my college. So that kind of gives you a smattering of Hindi, a smattering

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.680
[Guest]: of Tamil, a smattering of Kannada and pretty much otherwise English is the way and a little

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:48.520
[Guest]: bit of Sanskrit too in fairness. But that's pretty much the way one's linguistic narrative,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.920
[Guest]: if you will, pans out. Conservative family, very traditional, religious, every single

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.240
[Guest]: religious festival occasion was observed, visited lots of temples as a child and as

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.840
[Guest]: a teenager. So from that perspective, very much rooted in things Indian, also in things

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.680
[Guest]: of the Raj, because my grandfathers, both of them were very much into English literature

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.720
[Guest]: and so and into an appreciation of the finer things of the British Raj. So that too came

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.640
[Guest]: through in the stuff. Oddly enough, oddly enough, since you ask, one of the incidents

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:42.400
[Guest]: that I've been remembering recently in different contexts is when our family went to Bhakra

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:53.480
[Guest]: in 1960, I think, and the dam was still being built. And my father, I remember telling us,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.960
[Guest]: look, what a grand thing Panditji is building for us. So there was that whole sense of the

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.880
[Guest]: 1960s effervescent patriotism, the looking forward to a great future and all that and

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:17.000
[Guest]: pride and all that. So that too was very much part of my upbringing. After that, after college,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.760
[Guest]: I went to business school, went to Ahmedabad, then got into banking and went around the

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:30.160
[Guest]: world and took a couple of years off, went back to university, University of Chicago,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:38.160
[Guest]: then came back into banking, spent a lot of years in banking about 25 years, left in California

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:45.880
[Guest]: in 1998, and went into it. That was a 10 year stint in it. Then we sold off our company

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.960
[Guest]: and then I moved on. And since then, I've been an investor in a variety of companies,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:59.120
[Guest]: including housing finance company, which I exited some time back, and a housing development

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.760
[Guest]: company where I'm still involved as a promoter.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And what's your intellectual journey through this period? Like, like you'd mentioned when

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.760
[Amit Varma]: we had coffee before this, that you were a socialist in college.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.320
[Amit Varma]: Yes, that is true.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.120
[Amit Varma]: What was that journey like? How did you change? Was it that you were, you know, you did your

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.640
[Amit Varma]: MBA and you're out in the real world and you're mugged by reality, or?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:29.760
[Guest]: I think definitely the socialist thing was very strong in my college days, I would say

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:40.120
[Guest]: age 16 through 20 time period. It was also remember the time when Vietnam War protests

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:49.240
[Guest]: were taking place all over the world, including in sleepy Madras. And the Berkeley and Paris

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.240
[Guest]: and all these things were, were very much part of the, the consciousness of people like

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.760
[Guest]: us. And in India, we had a charismatic leader who was nationalizing banks and troubling

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:08.120
[Guest]: Rajas. So, there was a, there was that wave of, of popular socialist feeling, which was

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:16.040
[Guest]: very much part of my consciousness and my, my interest. And I've written a poem somewhere

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.680
[Guest]: where I mentioned the fact that when we were young, we read Lenin's State and Revolution.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.720
[Guest]: Kind of tells you something about the nature of the time. Over, I think it is not just

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:37.120
[Guest]: MBA and so on. It is over the years, gradually, with greater exposure to different kinds of

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:45.160
[Guest]: texts, different kinds of people, that conservatism, first, it was actually on the economic side,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:55.480
[Guest]: a movement towards markets as being more consequentially efficient. But then I would say in the last

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:03.800
[Guest]: 30 odd years, it's been, or 25 years, it's been more from the moral side as to what,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:11.320
[Guest]: what is appropriate for human beings, that the, the intellectual journey has, has taken

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:20.840
[Guest]: place the way it has. To some extent, I think, constantly reinforced by the fact that at

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:31.020
[Guest]: least for the last 20 odd years, yeah, no, maybe 25 years, I've been doing a lot of pilgrimages

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:38.840
[Guest]: and temple visits. And that somehow tends to reinforce a certain idea of India, and

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.440
[Guest]: a certain idea of what it is that one needs to conserve about India, about our own society,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.280
[Guest]: and therefore what one needs to conserve about human beings in general.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And who are the sort of thinkers who influenced you? Like, are there any, like, one question

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.720
[Amit Varma]: I often ask my guests is that, is there any book which changed the way you look at the

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.320
[Amit Varma]: world? Which is perhaps a little simplistic, they often won't be just one book, there'll

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.280
[Amit Varma]: be multiple books. But if I were to post it to you?

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:14.200
[Guest]: I think the most important influence, both from an aesthetic and a, and a kind of moral

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:24.120
[Guest]: perspective is T.S. Eliot. Because I think the development of Eliot between Wasteland

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.200
[Guest]: and Journey of the Magi, which is my favorite poem, I read it at least once or twice a month,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:40.920
[Guest]: sometimes aloud. And for Quartets, kind of established for me that there is continuity

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.120
[Guest]: in what we as human beings do. And to snap that thread of continuity and to kind of do

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.240
[Guest]: something radical or revolutionary and break down and try to build anew is something that

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:03.720
[Guest]: I've started detesting quite a bit. So I would say Eliot. Initially, Eliot was a shock, as

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.720
[Guest]: what Hugh Hefner says, is a neurasthenic shock of reading Profrock. But over time, Eliot

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:21.040
[Guest]: was not. I remember once going to London and I visited St. Mary Woolnott Church. I went

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.760
[Guest]: down King William Street to where St. Mary Woolnott kept the hour. It's in Wasteland.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.360
[Guest]: And then I went to the other church where there's Ionian white and gold. And then one

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:43.880
[Guest]: started getting a feel that, that in seeking to maintain continuity with tradition, Eliot

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.840
[Guest]: was trying to give us an extremely important lesson about, and he does it, of course, in

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.640
[Guest]: the aesthetic literary world. But I think it's equally applicable in the political,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:05.040
[Guest]: social, aesthetic worlds. And the second influence, I would say, is Smith. Adam Smith, the early

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040
[Guest]: Smith.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040
[Guest]: Moral sentiments.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.640
[Guest]: Theory of moral sentiments. And this, I never knew about it, frankly. I, like everyone else,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.680
[Guest]: one read or one skimmed through Wealth of Nations and quoted one sentence from it. That's

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:28.080
[Guest]: the way Standard Economics 101 works. But several years ago, 10, 15 years ago, I was

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:37.640
[Guest]: at a longish meeting with Professor Amartya Sen when he kind of directed me to go and

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:48.240
[Guest]: read Theory of Moral Sentiments, which subsequently, of course, I did. And it opened up. The fact

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.680
[Guest]: that it was published a decade earlier than The Wealth of Nations and precedes it, and

00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:03.080
[Guest]: in fact is the foundation for the later capitalism that Smith developed, struck me. Again, this

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.440
[Guest]: whole thing that ideas evolve. That is, Bacon says something, somebody else says something,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.800
[Guest]: you build on what Bacon says. You know, it's not, it's not something that comes in a sui

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:22.200
[Guest]: generis at one particular point in time. So that's the thing that I kind of saw in Smith's

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:29.200
[Guest]: evolution and that there is a moral purpose to markets, which is much more than the consequentialist

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:36.280
[Guest]: efficiency, which the Butcher Baker quotation talks about. I would say in recent times in

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:43.560
[Guest]: the last 10 years, Scruton, Roger Scruton, Roger Scruton has been important because he's

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.960
[Guest]: defending a society which is, actually, I wrote this about Naipaul too. I don't know,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.200
[Guest]: you can go back and look at one of the essays I wrote in the Indian Express several years

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:59.960
[Guest]: ago when I was talking about Naipaul, comparing him where he is talking about the decline

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:07.880
[Guest]: of modern civilization, particularly Western civilization, comparing him to a kind of Latin

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:16.840
[Guest]: epigramist living in Tuscany in the year 409 AD, one year before Rome was sacked by Alaric.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:26.560
[Guest]: So there's this sense of foreboding that Naipaul, as a great conservative, has that in not preserving

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.040
[Guest]: and in not building on what we have inherited from humans and trying to jettison that, we

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.520
[Guest]: make great mistakes. And Scruton is very much at the center of that, at least as far as

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.080
[Guest]: England is concerned. Because the Church of England is in decline, church music is in

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:53.760
[Guest]: decline. Shakespeare is no longer fashionable. People don't care about common law. All the

00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:03.800
[Guest]: things that matter to keeping the English traditions going are what Scruton talks about.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.080
[Guest]: But it's not completely dead. The important thing is they're in decline, they're under

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.400
[Guest]: assault, but I think they'll come back. And there is a sense of optimism also, if you

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.440
[Guest]: see in my book, at the end of it, that it's not completely over. John Major made a very

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.280
[Guest]: interesting statement, I think when, which the cricket commentator John Arlott died,

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:32.160
[Guest]: Major said, English summers will never be the same again. You know, it's a way of kind

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:40.360
[Guest]: of keeping in touch with and to some extent, conservatism is an outlook, it's an approach.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.320
[Guest]: It's less an ideology.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.600
[Amit Varma]: What I'm then going to do since you brought Scruton up is I'm actually going to quote

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.000
[Amit Varma]: from one of his recent books on conservatism. And I have a question for you based on that.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I initially thought that we'll talk about the roots of conservatism starting from

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Burke onwards, and we'll get to that. But since you brought up Scruton, he makes a point

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.440
[Amit Varma]: in his book, which is a point that you have also made at length in yours, which is I'll

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.040
[Amit Varma]: quote him, conservatism is not by nature an international cause. It takes its character

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.200
[Amit Varma]: from local questions, and the loves and suspicions that thrive in specific places and times,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.720
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And then he goes on to say, conservatives believe, quote, the root of politics is settlement.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.120
[Amit Varma]: This is he's put in italics, settlement, the motive in human beings that binds them to

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.740
[Amit Varma]: the place, the customs, the history and the people that are theirs, stop quote. And these

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.000
[Amit Varma]: concerns come out in what you just said about how, you know, English culture is declining

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.080
[Amit Varma]: in these various ways you pointed out. And that, but that is a lament, which it also

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.680
[Amit Varma]: seems to me it might be said, it's a two part, it's one observation and a question. And the

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.400
[Amit Varma]: observation is, it might be said that that is a lament of Scruton and people like him

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.360
[Amit Varma]: is not necessarily a lament of England, because England itself has changed partly through

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.200
[Amit Varma]: immigration, much as America has been completely transformed through immigration. And the danger

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.120
[Amit Varma]: that a conservative might make there is hold on to a notion of it, which is an archaic

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.440
[Amit Varma]: notion. And just because they value a particular aspect of it doesn't mean that others who

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:20.080
[Amit Varma]: come from different traditions necessarily do. And my question really is about the local

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.120
[Amit Varma]: nature of conservatism, as you stress, and through most of history, individuals have

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.200
[Amit Varma]: had one geography, that's the place around them, the town where they live, or whatever,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.400
[Amit Varma]: it's a physical geography. But today, it could be said that we all inhabit many different

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.720
[Amit Varma]: geographies that are not bound by physical space. Like, my neighbours are not just those

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.160
[Amit Varma]: who live in the flat next door in Bombay, but they are also people who are on the same

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.760
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp group with me from across the world, or whatever. And therefore, my traditions

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.000
[Amit Varma]: are not just the traditions are imbibed from the physical spaces around me or the physical

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.920
[Amit Varma]: culture in those physical spaces, but also from the whole globe, I mean, with what technology

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.600
[Guest]: has done. So as a conservative, how do you respond to that?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.880
[Guest]: Yeah, let's, let's, of all the things you've said, the one word that I would kind of really

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:18.400
[Guest]: object to is the word archaic, which is said in a kind of derogatory manner.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm not saying it's archaic. I'm saying it might be archaic. That's what I meant, just

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680
[Guest]: to clarify.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:30.760
[Guest]: But my point is, so be it. The Magna Carta is archaic, Shakespeare is archaic, Handel

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:39.400
[Guest]: is archaic. So do we therefore, very soon, the Beatles may be seen as archaic. So do

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:46.920
[Guest]: we therefore jettison? And this is what Eliot, that's why I started with Eliot. Eliot goes

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:53.040
[Guest]: back to Donne. He goes back to earlier metaphysical poets, goes back to Dante. In fact, he goes

00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:00.680
[Guest]: back all the way to Radharani Kopanishad, to go back to the kind of human continuity,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.560
[Guest]: the chain of continuity, where there's a gradual development evolution. So I think, yes, England

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.360
[Guest]: is changing. England is not today what it was 500 years ago. A hundred years ago, it

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.440
[Guest]: is not what it was 400 years ago. Nobody is saying that there is no change. The only concern

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:27.800
[Guest]: is in the course of change, are we abandoning good things? If we abandon bad things, that's

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.800
[Guest]: perfectly fine with conservatives, as Desirelius, Burke, Scruton have all said in different

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:44.920
[Guest]: contexts. But if we give up, who will be the loser if we give up? If tomorrow we are no

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:52.400
[Guest]: longer able to sing Tyagaraja Kritis in the ragas that he composed them in, who is the

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.160
[Guest]: loser? You can say, hey, that's archaic. But our view is, hey, it's worth defending. By

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.720
[Guest]: calling it archaic, you can't dismiss it. In fact, we think the old has special value.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.240
[Guest]: What was the second question you were asking around that?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll come back to it. Let me kind of sort of respond to this to clarify sort of what

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.920
[Amit Varma]: I meant. And I'm not, again, talking about reform and political changes and so on, just

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.560
[Amit Varma]: in the realm of culture, for example. Let's say that the Englishman I'm thinking of is

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.840
[Amit Varma]: a second generation Bangladeshi immigrant. His parents immigrated to London or Suffolk

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.640
[Amit Varma]: or wherever, they set up a restaurant, he runs a restaurant. So that's a stereotype.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.000
[Amit Varma]: He does whatever there. But he considers himself English. He's born and brought up in England.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.040
[Amit Varma]: He speaks a language. He is an Englishman. He'll even cheer for the England cricket team.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.280
[Amit Varma]: But he doesn't listen to Handel. Maybe he listens to Pawan Das Ball, right? Or he listens

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.200
[Amit Varma]: to whatever he wants to, which is a question of individual choice. And maybe in a certain

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.360
[Amit Varma]: sense, he's a cultural conservative that he's preserving those elements of his culture.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.200
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, from that point of view, it could be argued that, say, Scruton's lament

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.920
[Amit Varma]: that Handel is not being listened to is perfectly legitimate as a personal lament. But can it

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.560
[Amit Varma]: be a lament on behalf of society itself?

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:17.640
[Guest]: I think the Bangladeshi immigrant, who is now an English person, would actually be better

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:27.160
[Guest]: off, is my personal view, not forgetting the Baul music at all, but by greater acquaintanceship

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:33.800
[Guest]: with Handel, because he is living in a country to which Handel is given so much. And I think

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.440
[Guest]: that is important. For instance, you and I live in what's now called Mumbai, used to

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:52.200
[Guest]: be called Bombay. I think it only helps us to be sensitive, enthusiastic, involved in

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:59.400
[Guest]: Ganpati festivals or in the Varkari annual pilgrimage, because we are here. It doesn't

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.680
[Guest]: mean you forget whatever Hindi literature you're acquainted with, or I forget Tamil

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:15.880
[Guest]: or Kannada, but it behooves us, to Scruton's point, to be part of the landscape where we

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.560
[Guest]: are. And I think this is an important... Yes, and the landscape changes. I'm not saying

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:27.560
[Guest]: it doesn't change. Bombay was Kalachuri, then it was Adil Shahi, then it was Mughal maybe

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.560
[Guest]: for some time, then it was Portuguese, and it was British, and now it's Free India. So

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:40.040
[Guest]: it's changed. But that doesn't mean that certain things, for instance, if you do live here,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.800
[Guest]: to be enchanted by Elephanta, by the Maheshamurthy there, I think is part of... You can't simply

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.800
[Guest]: say, oh, I've come from a foreign place, I'm only going to be interested in things thousand

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.960
[Guest]: miles away. I think you lose out. And that's the point that Scruton is making, that in

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:02.760
[Guest]: not associating with a... And your point you made, I'll come back to that, the virtual

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:08.960
[Guest]: and the physical. Yes, conservatives are very much into physical. We love architecture.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.640
[Guest]: We're very much into landscapes, forests. I wrote many years ago that if you don't love

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:24.600
[Guest]: water bodies, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, forests, mountains, hills, then you don't love India,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:31.760
[Guest]: because that's what the country is all about. So the physical thing is extremely important.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:39.640
[Guest]: And I think conservatives would feel profoundly, profoundly anxious if somebody is going to

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:48.760
[Guest]: spend the whole day sitting on a laptop, talking to people thousands of miles away digitally,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.280
[Guest]: and not be concerned much about the physical landscape around him or her. That would upset

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.360
[Guest]: us. So yes, the digital world is real, you can't run away from it. But we would hope

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.640
[Guest]: that there'd be a balance and a return to appreciating the immediate physical.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough. Let's kind of get back on track and talk a little bit about Burke. What does

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.000
[Amit Varma]: conservatism mean to you? And, you know...

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.520
[Guest]: Okay, Burke, you know, is always... Everybody calls himself a Burkean conservatism. Burke

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.280
[Guest]: is always quoted. I even mentioned somewhere in the book that Ambedkar quoted Burke in

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:35.280
[Guest]: his great speech in our constituent assembly. The reason Burke is fascinating is that he

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.320
[Guest]: called it right on the French Revolution. He said that this is going to result in a

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:48.520
[Guest]: military dictatorship sooner or later. This is going to result in a permanent hundred

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.680
[Guest]: year wound on the French psyche. You're destroying Notre Dame Cathedral and calling it Temple

00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:01.560
[Guest]: of Reason. You're really making breaks in the continuous change of French culture, going

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:07.320
[Guest]: back to, you know, French and country of France is more than 1066. English talk 1066. France

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.680
[Guest]: is, I think, 400 AD or something. There's continuity there. And exactly what happened.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: You got Napoleon, and you got a military dictatorship, and you got an imperialist war machine. And

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.080
[Guest]: the wounds that the French have inflicted on themselves have remained. He called it

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.640
[Guest]: right on the American colonies. Strangely enough, you would think he would... Being

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.280
[Guest]: conservative, he should have opposed their independence. In fact, he took the other position.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.840
[Guest]: He said these people have left England in order to live as colonists, and we have given

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.800
[Guest]: them charters. Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a charter. Commonwealth of New York has

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.360
[Guest]: a charter. And now you're violating that charter by imposing taxes, by doing stuff. And he

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.760
[Guest]: called it right on India. That I never knew till I read O'Brien. O'Brien has a whole chapter

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:03.480
[Guest]: on this. Because not everybody knows about Burke's impeachment of Warren Hastings and

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:11.800
[Guest]: that he was therefore opposed to the perfidies and the excesses and the plunder involved

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:20.520
[Guest]: in harassing the Begum Zawahud or the Raja Banaras Jait Singh and so on. But the fact

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.800
[Guest]: that Burke had some very concrete ideas on India. First of all, he said this silly thing

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:35.680
[Guest]: that we can break everything in India and not pay attention to their traditions is ridiculous.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.800
[Guest]: He said that's a recipe for disaster. And sure enough, that's what happened when we

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:49.960
[Guest]: had the 1857 uprising when you kind of ignored the traditions of the country. Two, he was

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:57.080
[Guest]: in favor of directly the House of Commons supervising India. He didn't like this idea

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.600
[Guest]: of the king and the prime minister having a secretary of state for India. And certainly

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.440
[Guest]: he didn't like the idea of a company, East India Company, running a whole country. And

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:15.040
[Guest]: if that had happened, imagine if you had had five or 10 parliamentary commissioners supervising

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.680
[Guest]: the India office in London. And through them, the governor general here, etc. They would

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:29.360
[Guest]: have been answerable to local public opinion in England. They would have been on with changes.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.080
[Guest]: Whereas what happened subsequently in India was an ICS officer would come and stay here

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.520
[Guest]: for 30 years. So he would only be acquainted with the intellectual currents of 30 years

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.600
[Guest]: earlier. He didn't know what was changing or forget intellectual currency, technological,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:51.080
[Guest]: any changes that are taking place in the world. So we got a kind of a frozen bureaucracy,

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.040
[Guest]: and one that was very heavy handed, ruled through the secretary of state, which was

00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.800
[Guest]: the cabinet office. And George III actually and Pitt opposed Burke because they wanted

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.480
[Guest]: to keep the patronage to themselves. They didn't want to give it over to the parliamentary

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.320
[Guest]: commissioners, which was a pity. So Burke had thought through some of these things,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.720
[Guest]: even vis-a-vis India, with great patience and with great, you know, kind of intellectual

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.960
[Guest]: agility. So when I read O'Brien, then I went back, and I went to my favorite bookshop in

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:29.000
[Guest]: New York, Hagersee, and got the complete works of Burke, which I have with me, and started

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.080
[Guest]: reading here and there in different bits and pieces. And one started understanding that

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:44.360
[Guest]: this man was not a Bacon or a Locke. He was not a philosopher in that sense. He was more

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.840
[Guest]: of a practical, empirical guy saying, hey, this doesn't make much sense what you're trying

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.600
[Guest]: to do. And this is not a very noble thing that you're trying to do. I mean, that's the

00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:03.760
[Guest]: way he approached discussions. Then when I read Nicholas Philipson's book on Adam Smith,

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.320
[Guest]: I came across a brilliant thing, which I hadn't come across earlier, which was in I think

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:16.200
[Guest]: Quartly Review or Edinburgh Review, Burke reviewed Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.120
[Guest]: book review. And this Philipson quotes extensively, Nicholas Philipson quotes extensively in his

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:27.600
[Guest]: book. And that's where I came across this expression, wisdom of the swain. You know,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.260
[Guest]: Burke basically said, hey, common people are wise. This idea that these intellectuals sitting

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.800
[Guest]: in Oxford, Cambridge are wise and common people are stupid or something. And it's a very continental

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:44.880
[Guest]: idea. The professor in France or Germany has supreme knowledge and the peasants don't know

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.440
[Guest]: anything kind of. It's very much opposed to the Burkean conservative view.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.680
[Amit Varma]: So, let me try and summarize Burke's central insight and tell me if I've got it right,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.760
[Amit Varma]: which is, I mean, an insight I more or less agree with, which is that traditions and ways

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.080
[Amit Varma]: of behavior of a place evolve for certain reasons, because they are concomitant with

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.360
[Amit Varma]: human nature, because they reflect what works and what doesn't work. And if we are to make

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.620
[Amit Varma]: a radical shift from this, you know, it causes a violence in society that can lead to trouble

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:22.480
[Amit Varma]: much as the French Revolution. And therefore, Burke's point is that change is by all means

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.600
[Amit Varma]: good. Let's stick to what's good about the past. Let's discard what is bad about the

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.880
[Amit Varma]: past, but let's change gradually and not cause these fundamental shocks and dislocations.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And like you sum it up, I'll quote you now from your book, quote, in our view, by which

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.600
[Amit Varma]: you mean in conservatives view, quote, in our view, the principle challenged faced by

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.800
[Amit Varma]: societies is how to change constructively without losing things of value in the process

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.680
[Amit Varma]: of change. Therefore, in principle, we are opposed to revolutionary change, preferring

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.840
[Amit Varma]: the evolutionary variety any day. Correct. That's a that's a correct. This is absolutely

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:02.240
[Guest]: see the nobody is saying that because there was slavery in the past, we should continue

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:11.000
[Guest]: with it. Slavery has to go. Now, that is for sure. Or, you know, burda or burning of women

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
[Guest]: or dowry or whatever. There are there are innumerable things that have to change. The

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.720
[Guest]: question is, when you do something abruptly and when you do something wholesale, first

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.520
[Guest]: of all, there's violence, which has unintended consequences, usually which are bad. Very

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:36.600
[Guest]: rarely does violence have unintended consequences, which are good. Secondly, you lose the good

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:45.440
[Guest]: things associated with the past. And that's the concern that constantly bothers conservatives

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.600
[Guest]: is that. And that's why it's in my book. Later on, I say it. The best thing that happened

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.600
[Guest]: to us was the way our independence happened. For three years, we actually remained a dominion.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.820
[Guest]: We didn't even become a republic. We it took place gradually, evolutionary step by step

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:10.240
[Guest]: by step. It didn't happen. Whereas in 1917 in Russia or 1949 in China, it happened of

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:17.240
[Guest]: a bitter civil war with with great violence and with a complete rupture with the past.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.640
[Guest]: You kill off the entire king and his entire royal family in brutal manner and all that

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.120
[Guest]: kind of stuff. It didn't help them in the long run. It actually hurt those societies.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:37.880
[Guest]: And by writing our constitution in English, by using the Government of India Act of 1935

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.280
[Guest]: as the basis, by accepting principles of English common law as a basis. Indian Constitution,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.920
[Guest]: by the way, is the only constitution in the world which has a specific article which allows

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:58.160
[Guest]: the Supreme Court to intervene in the interests of equity. When the letter of the law doesn't

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.000
[Guest]: achieve equity, the Supreme Court can intervene. Equity is a very basic seven, eight hundred

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest]: year old English common law concept. So, we've kept the traditions of the Raj and we've built

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.160
[Guest]: on it. Now, we've changed many things. Now, there are no Rao Bahadurs or Sirs or things

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.080
[Guest]: of the Raj used to give out. I'm not saying we kept everything of the Raj, but we managed

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:26.720
[Guest]: to do this in an evolutionary step by step constitutional manner where could have approved.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.200
[Amit Varma]: It could also, of course, be argued that we kept things like the Indian Penal Code with

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.400
[Amit Varma]: the sedition law and the anti-free speech laws like 254 and 153A.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.120
[Guest]: Yeah, the law on homosexuality. I mean, see, the Indian Penal Code is a very... See, one

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.960
[Guest]: of the things I've mentioned somewhere is that... Now, we don't know for a fact whether

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.880
[Guest]: Manusmriti was actually used or it was simply a ideal text that was referred to. But under

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:01.760
[Guest]: Manusmriti, the same crime committed by persons of different caste origins would have different

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.040
[Guest]: punishments. Indian Penal Code doesn't have that. It's quite clear that a murder is a

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: murder. It is a crime that is punished and it is not... The cost of the individual is

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: irrelevant. So, it has those good features. It has features associated with 19th century

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.720
[Guest]: social thinking on homosexuality or on sedition which need to change. And I think the way

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:35.400
[Guest]: to do it again is the way we've done it. Do it by passing a law, having a select committee,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:43.320
[Guest]: sit, talk about it, discuss, debate, change the law or go through an elaborate judicial

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:49.760
[Guest]: process and let the court rule. You know, that's the way to do it, not by having a revolutionary

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.400
[Guest]: change, one fine day saying we will get rid of this. Because then, the whole Penal Code,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.880
[Guest]: if you throw out, you throw out also some of the good things that are there.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Right. I'll come back to that a little later. I want to move to another question now, since

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:11.120
[Amit Varma]: we are discussing what conservatism is and what Burke's fundamental insight was. I want

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.640
[Amit Varma]: to quote from someone who is my intellectual hero, Frederick Hayek. And he's written this

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.200
[Amit Varma]: famous essay you must have read called, Why I am not a conservative. So, I'll just quote

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.920
[Amit Varma]: a bit from that. He, of course, at the time called himself a liberal, but that was in

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.280
[Amit Varma]: the classical sense, in the European sense, a classical liberal. Today, he'd be called

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.640
[Amit Varma]: a libertarian and basically both labels, which I think more or less would apply to me to

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.280
[Amit Varma]: avoid labels. But here's what Hayek has to say in his essay, Why I am not a conservative.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:45.800
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Let me now state what seems to me the decisive objection to any conservatism which

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.160
[Amit Varma]: deserves to be called such. It is that by its very nature, it cannot offer an alternative

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.760
[Amit Varma]: to the direction in which we are moving. It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.680
[Amit Varma]: in slowing down undesirable developments, but since it does not indicate another direction,

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.540
[Amit Varma]: it cannot prevent their continuance. It has for this reason invariably been the fate of

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:13.600
[Amit Varma]: conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing. Stop quote. And my question

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.160
[Amit Varma]: here is, I mean, I know what you've clarified multiple times in your book is that conservatives

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.520
[Amit Varma]: don't merely want to stop change. They want to change gradually and they want to keep

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.840
[Amit Varma]: what's best of the past. So, I get that. I'm anticipating that you're going to say that.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:32.080
[Amit Varma]: But my deeper sort of question and my genuine puzzlement is that if the central insight

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:40.480
[Amit Varma]: of conservatism is about the means of affecting change, what about the ends? If I ask a conservative,

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.280
[Amit Varma]: what are your ends? What are they? You know, and you will get different answers from different

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.560
[Amit Varma]: people. You would, of course, also talk about individual rights and so on. But then the

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:55.960
[Amit Varma]: question is that if conservatism is centered around not changing things abruptly, then

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:03.160
[Guest]: where do you actually draw your ends from? Okay, let's start with Hayek now. It's a very

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:12.600
[Guest]: continental view of the world where there's a linear theory of historical progress. And

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:18.400
[Guest]: so progress is happening and conservatives are being dragged because progress is going

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:27.920
[Guest]: to happen anyway. Now, we are very, very skeptical about this because this is the thing that

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:37.480
[Guest]: keeps promising utopia, promising some great progress and therefore don't hold it back,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:45.320
[Guest]: which ties up with your question about ends. Actually, conservatives do not have a very

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:54.640
[Guest]: strong view on ends because we do reject the idea of a utopian end. And we reject the idea

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:04.120
[Guest]: of perfection. So things will not be perfect. Yes, incrementally, there will be less hunger

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:12.200
[Guest]: than today. Tomorrow, we hope there will be more freedom for men and women than today.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:19.800
[Guest]: Will there be perfect freedom? Will there be an end? Answer is no. So in fact, the means

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:28.720
[Guest]: are the end. There is no such thing as working towards a superordinate goal that comes at

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:38.000
[Guest]: the end of the rainbow. That's rejected completely because utopias are the scariest thing for

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.160
[Guest]: conservatives because for two reasons. In a consequential sense, most attempts to get

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.220
[Guest]: to utopia lead to dystopias. And that's a fact in history we've seen. In a more fundamental

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:57.400
[Guest]: moral sense, religious conservatives would take the position that it is not up to human

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:08.040
[Guest]: beings to make heaven on earth. That is God's role. And non-religious conservatives would

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:18.960
[Guest]: take the position that such a paradise on earth is neither possible nor feasible and

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:27.060
[Guest]: its pursuit will only result in hubris. So that would be my response to the Hayek observation

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.560
[Amit Varma]: and your question about ends. That's fair enough. No, I entirely agree with

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.640
[Amit Varma]: you that chasing utopias normally leads to dystopia. But let me sort of try to elaborate

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.920
[Amit Varma]: on where I'm coming from. For me, where I derive my view of the world is not from a

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.440
[Amit Varma]: view of history proceeding in a certain direction or that the world should be like this, a particular

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:52.000
[Amit Varma]: end state. I rather derive it from a set of values which holds individual rights to be

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.160
[Amit Varma]: paramount above all else. And therefore, I want the world to move towards a position

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:03.520
[Amit Varma]: where the consent of every individual is respected more and there is less and less coercion.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.800
[Amit Varma]: That's sort of the directional movement that I would like to see.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.720
[Guest]: We would not agree. You know, for us, the fact is rights and obligations are intertwined.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:22.880
[Guest]: The idea that right exists, rights for people exist in isolation of their obligations to

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.040
[Guest]: other human beings, to environment, et cetera, is not something that conservatives would

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:37.640
[Guest]: easily accept. The second issue really is that things like particularly in the area

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:47.000
[Guest]: of rights, the in recent times, the liberal position, unfortunately, has moved away beyond

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.680
[Guest]: individual rights, to communal rights, to community rights, group rights.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I think that if I may interrupt that again, I think depends on because the meaning of

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.800
[Guest]: the word liberal has been changed and appropriated. Okay, so you're really talking about the left

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.680
[Guest]: liberals, non-classical liberals. And that, of course, conservatives are very petrified

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.160
[Guest]: about. No, I opposed it as much as you got. No, I'm telling you why we are petrified about

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:20.600
[Guest]: because we actually want associative things. We are for associative things. But again,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:30.080
[Guest]: from a perspective of common traditions, from a perspective of band of brothers coming together,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:42.760
[Guest]: from a perspective of social transactions, trust, the danger with these group rights,

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.160
[Guest]: if you will, is that they become pathological at some stage. And that's what conservatives

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:58.960
[Guest]: are so scared of. But coming back to your earlier issue, the idea of a right, which

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.960
[Guest]: is not intertwined with an obligation or a duty, it just won't fly with virtually anything.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Right. So let me respond to both of those. I mean, first, as far as your aversion to

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.520
[Amit Varma]: group rights is concerned, mine is no less, because group rights and individual rights

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:21.840
[Amit Varma]: can't coexist and group rights always go hand in hand with coercion. But equally, I'm again

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.480
[Amit Varma]: for associative behavior, as long as it is voluntary. Again, that's the consent coercion

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.080
[Amit Varma]: thing. Actually, no sovereign state intervention. As for rights versus obligations, I think

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.040
[Amit Varma]: in the Lockean view of rights, which I subscribe to, I think rights do come with obligations.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.640
[Amit Varma]: But the only obligation I will accept is the obligation to respect the corresponding rights

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.760
[Amit Varma]: of others. Because only in that situation do your own rights have any meaning. But that

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:58.160
[Amit Varma]: clarification aside, I don't actually want to harangue you. Because honestly, your book

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:03.720
[Amit Varma]: was just a wonderful read. I learned a lot from it also about, you know, about the development

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.720
[Amit Varma]: of conservatism in India, things which I didn't know before you showed me a new lens to look

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.120
[Amit Varma]: at it. So I will save my thorny questions for the end, the rest of them. And let's kind

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:21.080
[Amit Varma]: of go back to your book. And an interesting statement you make early in the book is, you

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:28.160
[Amit Varma]: point out that, quote, conservatism in India is not purely or entirely an imported intellectual

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:33.120
[Amit Varma]: conceit, you say, quote, its antecedents are both universal and Indian. Two of our civilization's

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:39.040
[Amit Varma]: foundational text, the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata and the Tirukkural of Tiruvalluvar

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.080
[Amit Varma]: can be seen as providing the enduring basis of Indian conservatism. And a little later,

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.280
[Amit Varma]: you talk about the Telugu poet Alasi Peddana. And you talk about, yeah, sorry, my bad for

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.800
[Amit Varma]: the pronunciation. And you point out how he quote, dealt with concerns that are uncannily

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.240
[Amit Varma]: similar to those of Scruton today. So elaborate a little bit on that.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:10.440
[Guest]: You see, the first of all, the Orientalist view that Indian intellectual traditions are

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:20.360
[Guest]: ascetic and otherworldly, etc. is comprehensively dismissed, if you look at the Shanti Parva

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:27.120
[Guest]: and the Tirukkural, which I believe both constitute, I use the word foundational texts, very advisedly,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:36.800
[Guest]: I believe that they are very, very central to our whole Weltanschauung. They both incidentally

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.520
[Guest]: are interested in the three vargas, the three Purusharthas. In Sanskrit, you would call

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:51.800
[Guest]: them Artha, Dharma, and Kama. Artha is the pursuit of political and economic activity.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:57.480
[Guest]: Dharma is pursuit of virtue and ethics. Kama is a pursuit of pleasure and sensory stuff

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:05.640
[Guest]: and aesthetic sensibility. It's called Porul Aram and Inmam in Tirukkural. The interesting

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:12.440
[Guest]: thing that both texts kind of glide over, they acknowledge that the fourth salvation,

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:18.240
[Guest]: the fourth goal, Moksha, for human beings is the most important and transcends these

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.880
[Guest]: three. But the implicit assumption is you get these three right, salvation is automatically

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.960
[Guest]: taken care of. So, so much for accusing Indians of being otherworldly. Neither is Valluvar

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:36.200
[Guest]: otherworldly, nor is Vyasa in the Shanti Parva otherworldly. The second thing that they are

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:45.000
[Guest]: both focused on is how should an individual pursue Artha, Dharma, and Kama, Porul Aram

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.400
[Guest]: and Inmam, and how should he or she pursue this in society. So, that's for conservatives,

00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:01.120
[Guest]: the second part is very important. We do not see ourselves as isolated, autonomous people,

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:10.760
[Guest]: but as people in a band of brothers or sisters. And the focus is in both rights and obligations,

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:20.200
[Guest]: therefore. The focus is on the sober pursuit of wealth. Sober is as important as pursuit.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:29.080
[Guest]: Virtuous pursuit of wealth and political power, and a balanced pursuit of the aesthetic sensibility

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:37.280
[Guest]: with, imbued with ethics. And then there's extensive discussion on the importance of

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.800
[Guest]: the ploughman in Valluvar. Valluvar, the central figure for Valluvar, by the way, is not the

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.560
[Guest]: merchant or soldier or the king, but it's the ploughman. Because, you know, and I mentioned

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:56.240
[Guest]: it somewhere, it's almost, it's like, you know, Pierce Ploughman Langman's poem, it's

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:04.120
[Guest]: almost as if Valluvar anticipates it by a thousand years. The pursuit of activity in

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:10.840
[Guest]: a meaningful way, and in a social context. Now, in the Shanti Parvat, there's a lot of

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:22.120
[Guest]: discussion of Rajadharma. What is the appropriate virtuous conduct for a king? So everybody

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.480
[Guest]: says before Magna Carta was written in England, the king was above the law. That was the first

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:31.600
[Guest]: time that the king was brought under the law. It's not true. Shanti Parvat is quite clear.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:39.960
[Guest]: The king is subject to a royal law that he has to follow. Then there is this concern

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:51.240
[Guest]: about Nyaya, about the fact that you need justice and you need a social milieu in which

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.640
[Guest]: justice and good conduct prevails. For the ancient Indian scholars, the most horrifying

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:03.040
[Guest]: thought was Matsya Nyaya. Matsya Nyaya is where the big fish eat the small fish. It's

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.880
[Guest]: a breakdown of law and order. It's a breakdown of order in society. For them, that has to

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:16.960
[Guest]: be the most horrifying times in life. It's like Hobbes, almost, you know, before order

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:24.980
[Guest]: comes, how it is, how brutish, nasty it is. So this anticipation of so many of these conservative

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:31.240
[Guest]: ideas going back, and there is one which in fact predates even the Mahabharata and the

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:36.560
[Guest]: Kural, which goes back all the way to the Apasthma Sutra, the Vajra Veda, which is Yogadharma,

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:43.120
[Guest]: which comes to your point or Hayek's point about progress. What Yogadharma is an idea

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:50.440
[Guest]: that different ages have different dharmas. Now, if you were living 2000 years, 3000 years

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:58.080
[Guest]: ago in ancient Athens, and slavery was prevalent, what would be your advice to a slave? Be an

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:04.640
[Guest]: obedient slave. Now, that doesn't make it right or wrong or fashionable, but that was

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:11.180
[Guest]: appropriate for that time. And your advice to the master would be, treat your slave kindly.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.600
[Guest]: But 2000 years later, you say, no, let's abolish slavery. You know, it's a different, this

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:24.520
[Guest]: is a different age. In a particular age, in an age before the birth control pill was invented,

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:30.600
[Guest]: you know, there was a certain level of freedom that women couldn't aspire to. Now, if that

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.880
[Guest]: has changed, if technology provides for certain things, you have to automatically make the

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:42.520
[Guest]: change that that provides. So, Yogadharma is another one, which is very, very central

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.320
[Guest]: to, particularly to the idea, you know, in Conningsby, which is one of the Israeli's

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:53.000
[Guest]: famous novels, he mentions that we have to gradually change without abandoning the best

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.120
[Guest]: in the past. And that's what Yogadharma is about. There are certain aspects of dharma

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:05.440
[Guest]: that do not change. You know, right conduct, speaking the truth, those are eternal verities.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.520
[Guest]: But certain aspects do change, and you must be willing to make. And I think Raja Ram Mohan

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:16.280
[Guest]: Roy frankly understood that. He understood that, that is why he is such an important

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:23.720
[Guest]: figure in modern Indian conservatism. He understood that we had to discard some old practices.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.360
[Guest]: And he did it very cleverly. He simply said, they're not in keeping with the spirit of

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:34.200
[Guest]: our own scriptures. It's kind of a very clever, dexterous way of doing it. But this Yogadharma

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:39.800
[Guest]: is also very much there in our texts. Lastly, which is something that we may come back to

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:46.280
[Guest]: in later discussions, I do pay some attention to the Atharva Veda, where we are, when we

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:53.520
[Guest]: talk about conserving the environment, which is a very central idea in Indian thought,

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.080
[Guest]: and what it means. In fact, Burke has made a brilliant speech on that subject in the

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:06.600
[Guest]: House of Commons, not when he was talking about Warren Hastings impeachment, when he

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.560
[Guest]: was talking about the Prince of Arcot's debts. Prince of Arcot's debts are a very funny and

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:17.440
[Guest]: very sad set of events in Indian history. We can talk about that offline. But anyway,

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:26.680
[Guest]: while talking about that, Burke refers to the fact that Indian kings built canals, reservoirs,

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:32.440
[Guest]: created lakes, knowing full well that they would not enjoy them. But they were for the

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:39.120
[Guest]: enjoyment of future generations. So there was an intergenerational kind of trust and

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:44.520
[Guest]: transaction there. And Burke talks about it. So he knew enough about India to be able to

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.200
[Amit Varma]: say, to refer to that kind of detail.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.920
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's sort of come to relatively modern times, by which I mean the last 200

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:57.880
[Amit Varma]: years or so. And one of the interesting things I sort of discovered in your book was you

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:03.000
[Amit Varma]: present this lens of looking at Indian conservatism, where you say that it's not one thing. There

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.760
[Amit Varma]: are two very distinct strands, which are running through Indian conservatism. And one of them,

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.400
[Amit Varma]: of course, is the Raja Ram Mohan Roy strand, which is sort of more inspired by Burke. Tell

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.560
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit about both these strands. I mean, let's start with Raja Ram Mohan Roy.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:27.280
[Guest]: Raja Ram Mohan Roy, one of his most important statements he made to a visiting Frenchman

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:35.000
[Guest]: was that he wanted British rule to continue for a long time. So here is a man saying something

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:42.240
[Guest]: very important saying, let's not get rid of the British that easily. Let us learn from

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:49.640
[Guest]: them. Let us imbibe what is good and not be in a hurry for some kind of quick revolutionary

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:59.040
[Guest]: uprising and change. He would have opposed the 1857 uprising, for instance. And he died

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:08.400
[Guest]: before that, so we can't say for sure, but I would suspect that he would have. And he

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:15.640
[Guest]: was also for making sure we maintain continuity with our own traditions. So Upanishads, in

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:23.720
[Guest]: Brahmo Samaj, he reintroduces or introduces Upanishadic prayers. So he did not see a contradiction

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.240
[Guest]: in getting the best out of the Raj traditions and getting the best out of ancient Indian

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:38.320
[Guest]: traditions and building on them for constructive, slow, constitutional, evolutionary change.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:43.080
[Guest]: How did he ask for change? He wrote a letter to the Governor General. He got signatures.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.720
[Guest]: He didn't go and, you know, beat up and have a revolutionary attack. No, he petitioned

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.840
[Guest]: in triplicate. Correct. Absolutely. That's I know it sounds boring. It doesn't sound

00:55:53.840 --> 00:56:00.600
[Guest]: romantic. Revolutionaries are always romantic, but this is boring. This is discussions, debates,

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:09.560
[Guest]: treaties, petitions, signatures. But that's what results in enduring change and in constructive

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:16.200
[Guest]: change, which does not kind of destroy other stuff while making the change that one wants

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.280
[Guest]: to. He got rid of sati, he got rid of many other things. He was very much in favor of

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:28.480
[Guest]: English language. Although he was a scholar of Persian Sanskrit, et cetera. He realized

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:35.720
[Guest]: that in in the Raj, we had this opportunity. And so he wanted English education. So the

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:49.120
[Guest]: joy represents this bundle of patriotism, pride in the country, pragmatism, empiricism,

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:58.960
[Guest]: all of the things that we like in and above all, continuity, slow evolutionary, proper

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:08.920
[Guest]: insightful progress. And I think there is a direct kind of, you know, lying down from

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:19.120
[Guest]: him to various conservatives right through. And Bhandarkar clearly is in that Yadunath

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:26.840
[Guest]: Sarkar, is in that league and comes down all the way to Rajagopalachari and Masani in the

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.840
[Guest]: second half of the 20th century. So there is in the political side and frankly, on the

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.480
[Guest]: aesthetic side, there is also with with it coming down through Kumaraswamy and so on.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:46.160
[Guest]: This idea that we need to keep this balance between the Upanishads and modern learning.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.600
[Guest]: It's not one or the other, you know, many, many people felt it was one or the other.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:58:00.620
[Guest]: In fact, I've argued that instead of decrying English and accusing English speaking Indians

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:06.640
[Guest]: of being Macaulay Putras and so on, we should look at Macaulay, who was actually fairly

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:13.120
[Guest]: vain and conceited and foolish fellow in many other respects. But he did us a favor. It's

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.200
[Guest]: the way we should look at it. Like Hrishyashringa, I don't know if you remember in Valmiki Ramayana,

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:25.200
[Guest]: he's the man who does the yajna and Rama is born. So he gave us the great prince of our

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:30.640
[Guest]: land Rama. So similarly, Macaulay, for whatever stupid reasons of his own, has given us this

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.480
[Guest]: great gift of English, which instead of kind of getting het up and worked up about and

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:42.400
[Guest]: having an inferiority complex about, we need to understand its value. And we need to see

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.000
[Guest]: it as part of the continuity. There is no discontinuity there.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.320
[Amit Varma]: I would say English has been an Indian language for more than a century now. I did an episode

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.380
[Amit Varma]: with the historian Manu Pillay and he pointed out how when the Indian National Congress

00:58:54.380 --> 00:59:00.680
[Amit Varma]: met for the first time in 1886 or whatever year it was, 1885, that, you know, people

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.400
[Amit Varma]: came from all over, they were dressed in all kinds of clothes, but the one common thing,

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.160
[Amit Varma]: the one condition practically for being part of the gathering is that you knew English,

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.560
[Amit Varma]: otherwise, how would you converse? So it was almost as if the British gave us that common

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.960
[Amit Varma]: thread. I want to come back to exploring in much more detail the Raja Ram Mohan Roy strand

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.880
[Amit Varma]: as it were, but for the benefit of our listeners, before we come back to that, can you also

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.920
[Guest]: talk a little bit about the second strand and what it is, which is about…

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:30.600
[Guest]: There is a second strand in Indian conservatism and most leftists do not like to admit it

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:36.440
[Guest]: or do not, or I think just by, they feel that just by dismissing it, it will go away or

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:42.360
[Guest]: it will get less, it will become intellectually lightweight, and I reject that. I think it

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:48.160
[Guest]: is a very respectable school. You may have agreements, disagreements with it, but it's

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:55.600
[Guest]: worthy of respect, it's worthy of interest, it's worthy of study, which is the Hindu nationalist

00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:06.040
[Guest]: school of Indian conservatism, which starts with, in some sense, that may be earlier anti-Semites,

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:15.920
[Guest]: but at modern times, it starts with Bankimchandra Chatterjee. And it has its own lineage going

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:23.840
[Guest]: down through Lajpatrai, Malavya, even again, Banarkar is here also, you can see him on

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:29.920
[Guest]: both sides here. And then it comes down all the way to Dindayal Upadhyay, Shyamprasad

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.920
[Guest]: Mukherjee. So that has got its own intellectual gravitas. And the argument will always be

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:45.320
[Guest]: made whether this is in fact conservative, or is it a radical revivalist school. And

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.960
[Guest]: I think I have taken the position and I continue to take the position that it is either a subset

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.200
[Guest]: of Indian conservatism, or it's a sibling of Burkean Indian conservatism. It is not

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:05.720
[Guest]: something far removed. It's very much there. And just kind of ad hominem attacks or just

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.040
[Guest]: kind of glib dismissals is not going to make its intellectual respectability go away.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.640
[Amit Varma]: I think I have to confess that I used to glibly dismiss it myself as well. And it's actually

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.960
[Amit Varma]: in the course of doing this podcast and many episodes, such as a recent episode with Akshay

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: Mukul, where we spoke about the Gita Press, when we realized that it's actually a very

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.080
[Amit Varma]: coherent intellectual tradition with its own values and first principles, which I may not

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.240
[Amit Varma]: agree with. But that doesn't mean that, you know, one should not engage with it and that

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.520
[Amit Varma]: it is nothing but bigotry and misogyny dressed up in more respectable colors, which is what

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.600
[Amit Varma]: I once used to think. And I have a more nuanced view of that now. And of course, Mota Mota,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.160
[Amit Varma]: the one point that you make in your book is that the Raja Ram Mohan Roy strand of Indian

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.160
[Amit Varma]: conservatism sort of became sort of lost its impetus around the death of the Swatantra

01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:00.080
[Amit Varma]: Party. And the conservatism that you now see with Hindu nationalism is really a form of

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: the Bankim Chandra Chottapadhyay.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.600
[Guest]: At least in the political sphere, you're right.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600
[Amit Varma]: At least in the political sphere.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:11.640
[Guest]: Yes, that is correct. I think I think Burkean conservatism today would not be able to operate

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:18.200
[Guest]: as an independent political movement. Its best hope is to try and influence other movements.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:23.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to go back to your book now in your chapter on conservatism in the political

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.640
[Amit Varma]: sphere in India, you have a sort of a fascinating chronology of this tradition, the Burkean

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.360
[Amit Varma]: tradition, the Raja Ram Mohan Roy tradition. And one of the interesting points that you

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.400
[Amit Varma]: make there is their willingness to work with and often their support for the British and

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.600
[Amit Varma]: often for good reasons that liberals today would appreciate. For example, you know, again

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.680
[Amit Varma]: to quote from your book at one point you say, quote, the historian Rajmohan Gandhi has pointed

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.400
[Amit Varma]: out that the Dalit leader Anshus had gone one step further when in as early as 1970,

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.320
[Amit Varma]: he had argued that the departure of the British in the launch of home rule, whether by Brahmins

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.240
[Amit Varma]: or non Brahmins, would crush the Dalits. Stop quote and later on you write, quote, the Raj

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:10.920
[Amit Varma]: did have a liberating touch for India's downtrodden for reasons of their own persons as distinct

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.880
[Amit Varma]: as Bhera Malabari, Pandita Ramabai, Cornelia Swarabji, and others were also supporters

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.760
[Amit Varma]: of prolonged British rule. They believed that it prevented the emergence of a ruling elite

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.040
[Amit Varma]: dominated by the upper caste. And later on in the book, you say, quote, the same issue

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.520
[Amit Varma]: received considerable attention from our detractors like Kipling, who argued that Indians did

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.840
[Amit Varma]: not deserve freedom, principally, because we were given to oppressing our women and

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.160
[Amit Varma]: our poor. And in fact, it was a British who protected these unhappy residents of our fair

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:50.120
[Amit Varma]: land. Stop quote. And, you know, it also strikes me that I've been reading biographies of Churchill

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.640
[Amit Varma]: recently, because I've been sort of researching the Bengal famine. And the interesting thing

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.600
[Amit Varma]: is that a lot of Churchill's criticisms of Gandhi in the Congress, you know, they make

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.400
[Amit Varma]: for pithy quotes, but when you look at his elaborations for them, they have to do with

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.240
[Amit Varma]: all these upper caste, we know how they treat the Dalits, or the lower caste, as he would

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.240
[Amit Varma]: call them. And, you know, if we leave India, God knows what will happen to them. And this

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.280
[Amit Varma]: is very interesting, because, like, on the whole, I think that empire hurt us much more

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.160
[Amit Varma]: than it helped us. And one can argue that, but it is not a complete black and white situation.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.880
[Amit Varma]: And the leaders of that generation possibly could not know what we now know with the benefit

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:35.520
[Amit Varma]: of hindsight, that this can be a viable independent nation. They just knew sort of what the reality

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.040
[Amit Varma]: is, which is that the British are ruling, how best do we work to make things within

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.160
[Amit Varma]: that tradition? That's a classic conservative thinking.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.880
[Guest]: No, I think within the British establishment, while there were some who believed that there

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:55.280
[Guest]: could never be a viable, free India, even early on, Malcolm and Montserrat Elphinstone

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:01.600
[Guest]: and Monroe had kind of figured out that eventually, British rule would end and Indians would take

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:10.960
[Guest]: on. The question really is that, my point is, in the NCERT textbooks, post-independence,

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.200
[Guest]: anyone who supported British rule is portrayed as a traitor, as a bad person. And I'm saying

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:26.000
[Guest]: there's such a bloody range of people. Malabaria, Jyotiba Phule, I mean, Anchar Sahej, Ambedkar,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.520
[Guest]: Tej Bahadur Sapoor, they're not all, they're quite patriotic.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
[Amit Varma]: Gopi Lalade.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:37.640
[Guest]: They were not, they were quite patriotic. And the point is that, they were not, and

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.720
[Guest]: of course, these leftists will say, Compradors, all the rubbish words they use. They don't

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:50.160
[Guest]: change the fact that the, I mentioned earlier, technically, I don't know how many kings in

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:58.520
[Guest]: India actually use the Manusmriti, but technically, a Dalit's rights in a criminal court were

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:04.440
[Guest]: far fewer than an upper caste person's rights in, under the Manusmriti. And this was not

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.640
[Guest]: the case with the Indian penal court, which Macaulay wrote. So, there is a goodness that

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:15.920
[Guest]: the British rule had towards certain subaltern groups. And this granular study needs to be

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:23.080
[Guest]: made. You need to listen to them. It's not just NCERT telling us British rule was bad.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:27.040
[Guest]: What did Anchar say? What did, you know, what did Ambedkar say? Ambedkar was a member of

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.200
[Guest]: the Vice-President's Executive Council right through the war. Does that make him any less

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:38.000
[Guest]: patriotic? I mean, of course not. Hindu Mahasabha President made speeches encouraging Indians

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.120
[Guest]: to join the, the war effort, because he said, for so long, we've been disarmed, and we haven't

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.960
[Guest]: been given military training. Let us join the Navy, Air Force and Army. Was that unpatriotic?

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.960
[Guest]: I think Mahatma Gandhi did during the First World War, right? He did. So, does that make

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:05.040
[Guest]: them unpatriotic? You know, in fact, in these, these things, easy ways of describing dismissing

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:13.000
[Guest]: people take away from the, the complex relationship between the British and the Indians. Most

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:22.520
[Guest]: Indian soldiers who joined the British Indian Army saw soldiering as a noble profession,

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:27.480
[Guest]: as something that they were proud to do, and they went and did it. Now, you can't dismiss

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.120
[Guest]: them as mercenary, unpatriotic people. In fact, the present government at least has

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:39.400
[Guest]: made you know, I've written in the book, with Belgium, with Britain, with France, with Israel,

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:46.280
[Guest]: we have now honoured Indian soldiers. Otherwise, the previous dispensations from 47 onwards,

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.880
[Guest]: you wanted to keep quiet about the Indian contribution to First World War and Second

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.480
[Amit Varma]: World War. And all of those soldiers were fighting for the government of India as it

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.920
[Amit Varma]: was then. It's just a different matter that it was a part of the empire. But they might

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:03.560
[Guest]: have been fighting for their regiment, which is very important for them. I mean, this,

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:12.200
[Guest]: this exposed fact to judgment by these self appointed judges, I find that very, very difficult

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.620
[Guest]: to accept the Madras regiment, which is the oldest regiment of the Indian Army started

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:22.880
[Guest]: by Stringer Lawrence around the siege of our court in 1750. Now, what are we talking about?

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:29.080
[Guest]: It had Hindus, Muslims, Christians, it had Dalit supper castes, it was one of the first

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:37.000
[Guest]: integrated institutions in India. Now, that is a British gift to us. Now, you can say

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.680
[Guest]: they did many other bad things, they had famines, they had racist courts, they didn't let us

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.240
[Guest]: sit in first class. I'm not saying everything that they did was right. But you must say

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.280
[Guest]: and let's build, let's now create, take that Madras regiment tradition forward, which is

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.160
[Amit Varma]: what we are doing today. Right, let's take a quick commercial break now. And when we

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.280
[Amit Varma]: come back, let's get a little deeper into the Raja Ram Mohan Roy strand of Indian conservatism.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.680
[Unknown]: Hi, everybody, welcome to another great week on the IBM podcast network. If you're not

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.520

[Unknown]: Food Institute. They explain what plant based meat is what will be the next food revolution

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.520
[Unknown]: and the objective behind their podcast feeding 10 billion. That's not all you're going to

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.600
[Unknown]: see of Ramya this week. Ramya is also on the paperback podcast with Rasita and Satyajit.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.800
[Unknown]: She discusses her book Rebuild and points out how brands have tackled situation of crisis.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.040
[Unknown]: Guys, we have some really exciting news this week to our show advertising is dead has reached

[Unknown]: 50 episodes. This special occasion was marked with a live recording at the glitch office.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.840
[Unknown]: We had some really, really great guests for this episode as well. Rohan Joshi, the comedian

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.840
[Unknown]: was there as was actor social media influencer and co host of Agla Station adulthood, Ritasha

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.560
[Unknown]: Rathore. The episode drops on Tuesday, November 5. Make sure you check it out on our Kannada

[Unknown]: podcast Thaliharate. Pawan and Surya sit down to talk about how Karnataka must think about

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:23.040
[Unknown]: its future so that the state can deliver prosperity and well being to all its residents. On Simplified,

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.560
[Unknown]: the gang is back for part four of the 150th episode. That's a long 150th episode they

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.920
[Unknown]: got going there. Join Chuck and Naren as they break down the dying question of why a sign

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.120
[Unknown]: called Shiv, the Easter Islands, Instagram influencer ecosystems and a whole lot more.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:42.320
[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Jerry Rao about his book The

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Indian Conservative and Indian conservatism in general. One of the fascinating elements

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.680
[Amit Varma]: of this book was the two parallel strands of Indian conservatism, which, you know, I

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.800
[Amit Varma]: am roughly taking the liberty of calling them the Raja Ram Mohan Roy strand and the Bankim

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.560
[Amit Varma]: Chandra Chottopadhyay strand. That's a perfectly correct way of looking at it. 3R and BCC.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:11.440
[Amit Varma]: That's to even shorten it further. So I want to now sort of, you know, you've referred

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.840
[Amit Varma]: to RG Bhandarkar a couple of times and you've referred to his 1895 speech. So I'll just

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840
[Guest]: quote from that.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Please, what a brilliant sentence.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to encapsulate the sort of Burkean conservatism that, you know, a lot

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.440
[Amit Varma]: of the Indian liberals slash conservatives of the time, and I'll come to that nomenclature

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.840
[Amit Varma]: as well, used to believe in. And Mr. Bhandarkar says, this is 1895, mind you, quote, we should

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.960
[Amit Varma]: not adopt the procedure of the French Revolution, but imitate the mode of action of the English

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:47.920
[Amit Varma]: people whose pupils we are. They have realized as great changes as the French Revolution

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.000
[Amit Varma]: sought to affect, but in a manner which connects them with the past history of the country,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.800
[Amit Varma]: stop quote, and you speak about this sentence, your words now, quote, this single statement

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.960
[Amit Varma]: can be considered the high watermark of 19th and early 20th century conservatism. And you

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:09.200
[Amit Varma]: know, some of my intellectual heroes are people I've thought of as liberal heroes in the classical

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.800
[Amit Varma]: liberal sense, people like Naoroji, Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, especially Agarkar.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:20.840
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that in your book, you have appropriated them all. And where I guess

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.480
[Amit Varma]: it fits in is that it seems to me that in their belief for gradualism working within

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.360
[Amit Varma]: the system, giving petitions in triplicate, what they are doing is moving towards what

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.960
[Amit Varma]: I would call liberal ends through conservative means.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:42.760
[Guest]: Well, I would say they are advocating gradual, constructive, evolutionary change. That's

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.920
[Guest]: the way I would put it. Because as I said, as we talked earlier, this ends always worries

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:56.000
[Guest]: us. And I think the reason I've also mentioned why many of these people did not get tracked

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:05.840
[Guest]: as conservatives. I laid the blame entirely with a section of stupid Tories in England,

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:16.440
[Guest]: who represent the George III Lord North School of Tories and going back to the 1760s, 1770s.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:23.800
[Guest]: And which also had an element of racism about it. So Naoroji could only get election ticket

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:30.200
[Guest]: from the Liberal Party. You know, when Gokhale went to England, only liberals would meet

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.800
[Guest]: to listen to him. So the Tories cut themselves off from the spirit of gradual change when

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:43.080
[Guest]: it came to India. Not all Tories, but most Tories did. And that is what Burke would have

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.080
[Guest]: emphasized, did in fact, emphasize in his speeches. And that's what they lost out on.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:56.160
[Guest]: As a result, willy nilly, all these guys got associated with the British Liberal Party

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:03.920
[Guest]: and therefore they got tagged along as liberals. And yes, the question of what is liberal and

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.720
[Guest]: what is conservatives. I mean, considering we are now talking about intellectual traditions

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.560
[Guest]: which are 300 years old, it's not some hoary antiquity going back to Plato or Isaiah. This

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:23.000
[Guest]: is recent times. And during the times of Burke and in the times of Locke and Adam Smith and

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:31.400
[Guest]: so on, these were still evolving terms. Okay. And so too in India, I think they were evolving

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:38.480
[Guest]: terms. Now what Bandarkar is saying is very key. He's saying several things in that statement.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:45.000
[Guest]: He's saying one, the British achieved the same change that the French achieved. Right.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.720
[Guest]: Liberty before law, extended franchise, all those things that were, that the French Revolution

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:59.800
[Guest]: gave as gifts to its citizens. But they achieved it without the violence. And more importantly,

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:06.400
[Guest]: they achieved it without a break in their history, in their consciousness. So, there

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:13.500
[Guest]: remained the continuing thread of Englishness, which was violently disrupted in France and

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:19.240
[Guest]: frankly till the 20th century, till the Dreyfus case and so on. France never really recovered

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.800
[Guest]: from these traditions of anti-clericalism at one extreme, Roman Catholic conservatism,

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.180
[Guest]: monarchism, all kinds of things. They just never managed to create a blended blend of

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:37.000
[Guest]: brothers the way the English were able to do. That's what he's trying to say that, hey,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.200
[Guest]: let's imitate the British. Let's take our traditions along. The other important point

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:50.000
[Guest]: he's making, which is subtly inserted there, we are their pupils after all. So, there he's

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.400
[Guest]: making the point that we have a large connection. We are being ruled by them. That connection

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.300
[Guest]: is there. It's an organic connection. It's a link. It's the contingencies of history

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:06.080
[Guest]: have done it. If Iyer Coote had lost at Wandiwash, the French might have ruled us. I mean, these

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.660
[Guest]: are contingencies in history. And we never know how the count of actuals would have been.

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.320
[Guest]: But given that it has happened, what Bandarkar is saying, we are their pupils and we should

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:22.600
[Guest]: learn from them. We should take advantage of British rule. We should obviously work

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.100
[Guest]: against those things about British rule which are bad or inimical to our interests. Nobody

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:34.800
[Guest]: is denying that. Naroji never denied that. He was very clear about that. But do it while

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.880
[Guest]: not jettisoning the good things about British rule.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that even Gandhi himself was of the school of thought. He was

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.440
[Amit Varma]: a great admirer of Gokhale in South Africa. He would basically be petitioning by triplicate

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440
[Guest]: till he did his first satyagraha.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.280
[Guest]: He never started a satyagraha without first giving a petition, by the way. Not one. First

01:16:54.280 --> 01:17:00.320
[Guest]: he would write a petition request to Irwin, to anybody. It didn't matter who. Only then

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.560
[Guest]: would he start his first satyagraha.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.960
[Amit Varma]: And it just strikes me that, you know, just thinking of Gandhi's dandi march, Naroji in

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.280
[Amit Varma]: 1894 or 1895, if I remember correctly, had brought up the salt tax in the British Parliament,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.200
[Amit Varma]: demanding that it be repealed. And Gandhi took up the same cause later. And the irony

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.440
[Amit Varma]: is both of them failed because the salt tax today is far higher, no matter how you look

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.080
[Amit Varma]: at it, than it was back in the day.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.760
[Guest]: Is salt subject to GST? I don't think so. Is it?

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't know. But the last I checked, like three years ago, I wrote a piece about it.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:38.080
[Amit Varma]: And the last I checked, the salt tax in independent India was much more than under the British,

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.480
[Guest]: which, in a sense, buttresses my point of the kind of tragedy, the kind of oppression

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:49.360
[Guest]: you should get this in the front pages, because this is something we, we must be the problem

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:56.720
[Guest]: with salt in the British was more than the tax. It was also an egregiously absurd monopoly.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.840
[Guest]: And in fact, there are studies which show that it might have actually resulted in lower

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.760
[Guest]: consumption of salt among the poor, stunting of bodies and all kinds of, you know, really

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:14.480
[Guest]: reprehensible consequences. There was a department called Akbari department. Akbari department

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:22.080
[Guest]: was, and people got jobs in Akbari department, they, they sold salt and controlled salt.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:28.120
[Guest]: There's a Premchand short story called Namakka Daroga. So there is a Daroga, there is a policeman

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:35.080
[Guest]: or a police inspector whose job is to control salt, Namakka Daroga. So it was a very central

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.120
[Guest]: part of the Raj experience and a very unfortunate one.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.360
[Amit Varma]: Which is a nice segue to sort of the next point I want to look at, which is conservative

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.560
[Amit Varma]: support for markets. Because the interesting thing is the British also, for example, destroyed

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.480
[Amit Varma]: the cotton industry in India, and it, you know, all sort of shifted to Manchester and

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:58.760
[Amit Varma]: they destroyed many local industries. And but what a mistake that people often make

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:05.840
[Amit Varma]: today is conflating empire and markets, just because empire came to us via a corporation,

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.560
[Amit Varma]: which is the East India Company. But as many of what I would call the great freedom fighting

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.320
[Amit Varma]: liberals, but you would say conservatives, and I think there's, you know, sense in ascribing

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.680
[Amit Varma]: both those labels to them. What a lot of them constantly protested about was what the British

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.600
[Amit Varma]: really did was they came here and they destroyed free markets in India, rather than the other

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:32.000
[Amit Varma]: way around. And I'm again going to quote from your book, quote, both Naoroji and Dutt, that's

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.040
[Amit Varma]: Dadabhai Naoroji and R C Dutt, both Naoroji and Dutt held firm that the Indian entrepreneur,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.280
[Amit Varma]: the Indian merchant, the Indian producer did not need or want any special support. What

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.800
[Amit Varma]: they advocated was a free and level playing field, where British economic interests and

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.240
[Amit Varma]: the interests of favored British crony capitalists would not be the deciding factor in the framing

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.600
[Amit Varma]: of government policies and actions, stop quote. And they were, of course, protesting behavior,

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.000
[Amit Varma]: which impoverished millions in our country, which destroyed our local economy, and which

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.640
[Amit Varma]: even other great conservatives like Burke and Adam Smith protested against. Adam Smith

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:13.440
[Guest]: hated the East India Company for two reasons. One, he felt that it is ridiculous to allow

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:19.360
[Guest]: a commercial company to rule a country. It will always rule in the interest of its shareholders,

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.600
[Guest]: not of the country, which is the primary purpose of government, to rule for the benefit of

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:32.680
[Guest]: the citizens. And two, because it was a monopoly. On both counts, he hated it. Burke, of course,

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.680
[Guest]: liked it immensely, for very similar reasons. I think the Valsal Neerajan actually made

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:44.360
[Guest]: this point in practical terms when he fought with the British shipping companies, P&O,

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.960
[Guest]: whatever the shipping company was, Inchcape, Lord Inchcape was a guy running it. You know,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.960
[Guest]: they basically had monopolies.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.480
[Guest]: And he said, wait a minute, I don't want to run a ship. What's the big deal? You know,

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:02.040
[Guest]: in fact, there is a very famous Tamilian, V.O. Chidambaram Pillai. He started a South

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.920
[Guest]: Indian shipping, steam shipping company, and he was basically put in jail. He was not allowed

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:14.480
[Guest]: to, I mean, we were not, free entry, which is one of the requirements of a market economy,

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480
[Guest]: was he essentially denied.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I did an episode on the historian Manu Pillai about this and he mentioned Mr.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Pillai, and who started this thing in about, I think 1906, 1907, lost everything, was impoverished.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And then when Gandhi returned to India from South Africa, he was this one time tycoon

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.760
[Amit Varma]: was in the egregious position of trying to borrow a little bit of a petty amount from

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Mohandas Gandhi and just makes you feel so sad that these sort of forgotten heroes and

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.320
[Amit Varma]: the way they were destroyed by an oppressive empire, not entirely dissimilar from the oppressive

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320
[Amit Varma]: empire of today.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:58.160
[Guest]: Yeah, this is the point, you know, when state sovereign governments decide to use their

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:05.160
[Guest]: power to stifle markets, to stifle free human economic activity, they invariably do it to

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:13.080
[Guest]: help one bunch of people who support them. And the rest is history, rest is sadness.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:19.480
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's sad that the intellectual argument for markets becomes hard to make an almost

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.600
[Amit Varma]: counterintuitive because what people from the outside is they see companies benefit

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.160
[Amit Varma]: and they conflate that with markets. So earlier, you would look at East India Company benefiting

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.120
[Amit Varma]: and you would conflate that with, oh, look what free markets have done to India when

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.280
[Amit Varma]: in reality, there was only cronyism, no free markets. And you have a similar thing today

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.880
[Amit Varma]: when you have that, oh, look at the favours the government is dispensing to its favoured

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.640
[Amit Varma]: capitalists be they Ambani, Adani, whoever. And again, this is cronyism. It's not free

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:53.440
[Guest]: markets. We don't have free markets here either. Free entry is one of the most important things.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.840
[Guest]: Anybody should be able to enter a business, you know, there's licensing, there's prohibiting

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:07.160
[Guest]: people from entering business, giving entire Russian trade goes to one British company,

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.240
[Guest]: entire Indian trade one company. Absurd, completely absurd.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.800
[Amit Varma]: So I'll take you now to something again, which you said in your book, you just brought up

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:18.160
[Amit Varma]: George the third, and you pointed out in your book, and this is very interesting that in

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.520
[Amit Varma]: some ways, there is a similarity between George the third and Churchill, in the sense that

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:28.640
[Amit Varma]: in the 1930s, one of the aims of all these Indian conservatives was actually about to

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.600
[Amit Varma]: happen. India was about to be granted dominion status as Stanley Baldwin wanted and Baldwin

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:39.280
[Amit Varma]: was firm about it. But Churchill staked his career on it. In fact, that decade of his

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.440
[Amit Varma]: is called the wilderness years because he chose to go against his party on two questions.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.160
[Amit Varma]: One of course, is granting India dominions status and the other of course, was which

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.720
[Amit Varma]: evolved in the second half of the decade was the appeasement of Hitler. But the interesting

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:59.520
[Amit Varma]: point you were making there was that the conservatives almost got what they wanted, if not for Churchill,

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.560
[Amit Varma]: and then we might still have been a dominion with the titular head being the British Queen

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.560
[Amit Varma]: and as per you and as per conservatives, that's not a very bad state of affairs. So my question

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.840
[Amit Varma]: to you, therefore, is a slightly mischievous question is that is independence, then a mistake

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:20.840
[Amit Varma]: that we should regret, and it was accompanied by say, the horrors of partition, which you

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:26.000
[Guest]: would expect with any radical act. So what would these are things that after the fact

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.880
[Guest]: one can never really make judgments about counterfactuals, but let me first deal with

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:38.960
[Guest]: the George the third thing. That's not my original idea. Leopold Emery, who was a minister

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.280
[Guest]: in Churchill's cabinet, he has said, he was Secretary of State for India. He said Winston

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.760
[Guest]: knows as much about India as George the third knew about the colony. So that's where the

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:53.960
[Guest]: idea his own friend, colleague, schoolmate, he said that there's a history between Emery

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.480
[Amit Varma]: and Churchill. Have you read Churchill's autobiography? My early days? No, I haven't. So in that there's

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.400
[Amit Varma]: this funny incident where he goes to school, and he sees a small kid near the swimming

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.600
[Amit Varma]: pool. And he goes and he pushes this kid in the swimming pool. And then that kid emerges

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.160
[Amit Varma]: enraged and he chases Churchill around to beat him up. And it turns out that kid is

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.520
[Amit Varma]: actually two years senior to him, and is Leopold Emery. And then Churchill calms him down by

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.160
[Amit Varma]: saying that I'm sorry, I didn't know you were senior because you're so small. And then he

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.840
[Amit Varma]: realizes that could be a faux pas. And he says, Okay, my father was also small, he was

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:31.560
[Guest]: a great man. Anyway, that's a, that's a complete aside. They were good friends. But, but Emery

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:36.800
[Guest]: was sensible. He said, Hey, this guy doesn't get it. Okay, now let's look at the counterfactuals

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:43.200
[Guest]: that you've talked about. So Aminata Nair wrote a brilliant piece some years ago, about

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.680
[Guest]: India becoming free in 47 and Hong Kong in 97. I mean, our British rule ending in Hong

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:56.680
[Guest]: Kong. And he said, maybe Hong Kong lucked out by having 50 years of free markets and

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:08.800
[Guest]: the stable British laws and, and free trade. So it's not obvious that independence is necessarily

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.440
[Guest]: such a great thing. And in fact, Bernard Lewis has made this point when he talks about the

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.640
[Guest]: Arab Middle East. He says independence is not the same as freedom. You can be a French

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.920
[Guest]: colony Syria, then you become independent. Syrian people are no freer, they still have

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.920
[Guest]: a dictator ruling them. So those are things that now there's also been a view has been

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:37.800
[Guest]: a view when in the 30s, as this, especially after 1940, the Lahore resolution of the Muslim

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:45.920
[Guest]: League, when this discussion kept going, there were two, three possibilities. One was to

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:52.620
[Guest]: take someone like the Prince of Wales, and make him the titular head of a united India.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:27:00.920
[Guest]: So then this Hindu Muslim, the Muslim separatism for Pakistan automatically comes down. There

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:09.160
[Guest]: was another move to go and find the last surviving descendant of Bahadur Shah Zafar and make

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.400
[Guest]: him a titular emperor. So there were these kinds of ideas that were floated, it was not

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:22.880
[Guest]: inconceivable that you could think of a dispensation which has a monarchical, because generally

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.320
[Guest]: imperial dispensations tend to be monarchical.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.720
[Amit Varma]: In fact, at one point, Mahatma Gandhi made a throwaway comment that the Nizam of Hyderabad

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:35.200
[Amit Varma]: could be the next emperor of India, to which Savarkar responded by saying that no, it should

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.000
[Amit Varma]: be a Hindu kingdom with the king of Nepal on top, which is very amusing in hindsight.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.760
[Guest]: No, I think what if the Nizam had been made emperor, but it had been a constitutional

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.960
[Guest]: monarchy, hey, it might have worked because it might have kept Pakistan. But you know,

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.960
[Guest]: these are all counterfactuals. If you look in my book, I am now convinced that these

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:01.640
[Guest]: are silly arguments that we should stop pursuing. Pakistan is a reality, it has happened. This

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.240
[Guest]: idea of let's unite again, all together, all that is bogus, we should just move on.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.000
[Amit Varma]: But my question was not so much about the counterfactual, but about if you put yourself

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.120
[Amit Varma]: back in that time, independence is clearly a radical idea, remaining part of the empire

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.440
[Guest]: would be the conservative way to go.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.640
[Guest]: Everybody wanted that, Sapporo wanted that, Shastri wanted that. And finally, if you look

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:30.360
[Guest]: at it for three years, we remained a dominion. In fact, that was V.P. Menon and Mountbatten's

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:38.760
[Guest]: and Patel and Nehru's final decision to, and actually supported it. So, suppose we continued,

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.960
[Guest]: kept a constitution, but remained a dominion, it's entirely possible we might be more like

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:49.680
[Guest]: Canada or Australia today. I don't know. It's very difficult to, I think it might have been

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:56.120
[Guest]: politically difficult. I think the movement under Mahatma, which was not a conservative

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.240
[Guest]: movement, which was a radical movement, had radicalized the Indian masses a little too

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:06.680
[Guest]: much. And I don't think people would have gone along with, they might have in 1935,

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:07.680
[Amit Varma]: but not in 1947.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Speaking of sort of political difficulties, let's continue talking about the Raja Ram

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.280
[Amit Varma]: Mohan Roy school, where, you know, we've gone through this early set of reformist conservatives

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.640
[Amit Varma]: in your Navroji, Gokhale, Mehta, I presume you would ignore, and even Motilal Nehru to

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.320
[Amit Varma]: an extent would probably fall within that.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.040
[Guest]: He was not a man of many ideas. So, there's no intellectual, there's not much intellectual

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.320
[Guest]: stuff you can find as coming output out.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I think a lot of, from what little I know Motilal Nehru, it seems to me that he was

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.040
[Amit Varma]: actually a classical liberal, who did believe in gradualism and working sort of.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:51.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's for sure. Let's move on to the, what you call the conservative caucus

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:58.080
[Amit Varma]: within the Congress, where you point out that at the time India gained independent, we had

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:02.120
[Amit Varma]: the three golden years where, I'll again quote from your book, quote, for the first three

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:06.920
[Amit Varma]: years of independence till the new constitution came into force, the Ram Mohan Roy tradition

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:11.840
[Amit Varma]: of conservatism held sway in the country. The erudite conservative Rajendra Prasad presided

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:16.680
[Amit Varma]: over the Constituent Assembly. The incandescent conservative Raj Gopalachari succeeded Mount

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.520
[Amit Varma]: Batten as a governor general. Ambedkar, a former member of the Vice Troy's council became

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.440
[Amit Varma]: the chairman of the drafting committee for the constitution. Sardar Patel did defang

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.520
[Amit Varma]: the princely order, not a very conservative thing to do, but he understood the value of

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:35.360
[Amit Varma]: continuity if only symbolic. Stop quote. And I'll come back to, you know, you're claiming

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.800
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar as a conservative also after this.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.720
[Guest]: Ambedkar and Gandhi are, it's very difficult for anybody to claim them.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.200
[Guest]: They do contain multitudes.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:52.120
[Guest]: But the interesting thing is that many leftists call Gandhi a conservative. So, I find that

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:59.200
[Guest]: tongue in cheek kind of funny and interesting. And Ambedkar, many people criticize him for

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.240
[Guest]: having been in the Vice Troy's executive council as if that was a bad thing.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.240
[Unknown]: No, and your point was…

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.840
[Guest]: You know, he and the guy, what's his name, Bengali fellow, yeah, who was also in the

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.120
[Guest]: Vice Troy's executive council, worked on Damodar Valley Corporation. They worked on

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:19.480
[Guest]: constructive things. They were not stupid. You know, they're not unpatriotic at all.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:29.060
[Guest]: This binary, anybody who was pro-British Raj in any, even in a slight way, is not a patriot.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:34.920
[Guest]: Anybody who's gone to jail against a British Raj is a patriot is not acceptable.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.800
[Amit Varma]: I guess patriotism exists when the nation exists. But the point that you also made about

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar was that it was, in your view, a masterful move to make him in charge of drafting

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:50.920
[Amit Varma]: the constitution because he brought conservatizing influence, if I can use that neologism, upon

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.320
[Amit Varma]: the framing of the constitution. Explain that to me a little bit.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:01.800
[Guest]: See, the Government of India Act of 1935 has to be one of the finest pieces of legislation

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:11.440
[Guest]: ever written up. It was drafted after extensive parliamentary discussions, committee discussions

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:21.040
[Guest]: in Westminster. ATI was very actively involved in it. And it basically provided for pretty

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:29.840
[Guest]: much the federal structure that we have today in India. It also provided for a relatively

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:36.040
[Guest]: strong center, which is, again, what we have in India today. And offshoots after the Government

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.880
[Guest]: of India Act came the Reserve Bank of India Act, this, that and the other. They were all

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:46.640
[Guest]: came together as one bundle. They created the institutional framework for India going

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.840
[Guest]: forward. We could have simply dropped that completely and gone after a French constitution

01:32:53.840 --> 01:33:00.240
[Guest]: or Austrian constitution or something, or even an American constitution. We chose not

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:07.160
[Guest]: to. We chose to take the Government of India Act of 1935 and then add it, subtract it.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:13.840
[Guest]: And that's Ambedkar's principal contribution to the way the process worked, not the content,

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:22.800
[Guest]: the process. For instance, first past the post. First past the post is very much there

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:27.760
[Guest]: in Government of India Act, although remember at that time they had separate electorates.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.920
[Guest]: But within the electorates, it was first past the post within constituencies. Very English,

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.040
[Guest]: very American. It's not there in continental constitutions, not there in the Israeli constitution.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.720
[Guest]: They're all about proportional representation. But this is what constituency based first

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.720
[Guest]: past the post, which isn't what has given us stability and not the instability that

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:58.680
[Guest]: France, Italy, and Israel constantly experience. These ideas were taken and taken forward how

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.040
[Guest]: a comptroller and auditor general function. Very much there in 1935 Act. I mean, you know,

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:11.160
[Guest]: the way the federal court was constituted or the Morris Quire. So, all of those paraphernalia

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:20.000
[Guest]: were very well kept so that, in fact, on January 26, 1950, there was no discontinuity. And

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.640
[Guest]: one of the interesting things that the Constitution of India did was all prevailing earlier laws

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.160
[Guest]: will continue. Slowly we've changed them. You know, it took us a long time to change

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.360
[Guest]: the one on homosexuality, but invariably we've been changing them over time. But it was not

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:46.000
[Guest]: an abrupt thing. To my mind, that is the greatest achievement. Not jettisoning common law traditions,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.120
[Guest]: not jettisoning principles of equity traditions, not jettisoning the Government of India Act

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.440
[Guest]: of 1935 completely, but building on it has ensured that our constitution sticks. I've

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.680
[Guest]: lived in Latin America and in those countries every 10 years they change the constitution.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.840
[Guest]: There's complete instability and chaos as a result. You know, this has endured for more

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.400
[Amit Varma]: than 70 years now. And, you know, I mean, it's been amended so often that people often

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:16.000
[Amit Varma]: joke is a periodical and not a book. And, you know, you've kind of made the controversial

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.480
[Amit Varma]: point in your book that it's a conservative constitution, whereas a lot of other people

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.840
[Amit Varma]: would view it as a fairly radical constitution. You know, Gautam Bhatia had a recent book

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.920
[Amit Varma]: out with the title Transformative Constitution, which sort of sums it up. And I did an episode

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.200
[Amit Varma]: with the political scientist Rahul Verma, who's written a book with Pradeep Chabbar

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:42.760
[Amit Varma]: called Identity and Ideology. And his point there was that this was a radical constitution

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.800
[Amit Varma]: and that conservatives were up in arms. I mean, he didn't call them conservatisms, but

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:53.600
[Amit Varma]: the fault line here, the ideological fault line was one of statism, where conservatives

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.120
[Amit Varma]: and I don't think he used that term because he avoided those terms in that book, but I'm

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:03.520
[Amit Varma]: using it, but that conservatives felt that society is fine as it is, and the state should

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:10.040
[Amit Varma]: not try to do social engineering and reshape it. And the liberals or the radicals who shaped

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.880
[Amit Varma]: the constitution felt that no, society does need to be reshaped.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:21.960
[Guest]: Yeah, the issue really, if you think about it, despite all their pretensions to whatever

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:28.760
[Guest]: the British never abolished untouchability, for instance, technically untouchability existed

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:35.240
[Guest]: in British India. Having said that, the most egregious forms of untouchability actually

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.600
[Guest]: existed in the native states, in Travancore, for instance, not in British India. And in

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:47.520
[Guest]: British India, Ambedkar or Rabadu Srinivasan or anyone got education, got, they were able

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:57.800
[Guest]: to make their impact. And they had votes. Voting was given by property and education,

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:06.160
[Guest]: not by caste. So the Government of India Act of 1935 gave as many Dalits who were educated

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.920
[Guest]: and who had property and paid taxes, they gave them the vote, it was not based on caste.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.600
[Guest]: So it is true that abolition of untouchability was a radical act or seen as a radical act

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:24.760
[Guest]: by many people. But I see it as part of the evolutionary process. I see it as going back

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.200
[Guest]: to Macaulay, going back to Nankumar being hanged under war in his things. He was a Brahmin

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.760
[Guest]: and he was hanged. And there was a big furor in Calcutta, not so much whether he was guilty

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:40.240
[Guest]: or not guilty, but whether it was okay to hang a Brahmin. So each step it has moved

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:49.880
[Guest]: on. And so I see many of the so-called radical changes done in 1950 as being built on the

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:57.520
[Guest]: changes of 1909, of 1919, of 1935. And the continuous evolution, going back all the way

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.440
[Guest]: to the Regulating Act and British India Act in the late 18th century, from then till now.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.040
[Guest]: Queen's Proclamation of 1858, it talks about no discrimination based on caste, creed or

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.840
[Guest]: religion. British didn't always follow it. I'm not saying they followed it, but principle

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.840
[Guest]: is enunciated and there is this gradual evolution. So I disagree with both the people you've

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.560
[Guest]: interviewed from the perspective of historical process. I'm not talking about every detail

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:28.600
[Guest]: of content. There are changes in content in the Constitution, which are quite radical.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:35.360
[Guest]: But the processes, the radical step is a next step from a step taken 10 years earlier. That's

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.520
[Guest]: the way I see it. We had limited franchise. Now we had adult franchise. But at no stage,

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:49.320
[Guest]: by the way, was franchise based on gender or caste. Never. It was based on property,

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.120
[Guest]: on tax payment and education. So that was eliminated and just age was made. Anybody

01:38:54.120 --> 01:39:01.320
[Guest]: over 21 can vote. And so I see that as a step rather than as a radical break. So it's the

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.800
[Guest]: way you want to look at the history of the evolution of the Constitution and just look

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:16.240
[Guest]: at our neighbor, two of our neighbors. Pakistan never kind of built on the Government of India

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.520
[Guest]: Act of 1935. Instead, Ayub Khan came up with something called basic democracy, which was

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.360
[Guest]: a completely new idea. I'm not saying it's a good idea, a bad idea, but it was a radical

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.360
[Guest]: and that never worked. It worked for five years and then that went and another constitution

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.520
[Guest]: came. Sri Lanka, they're troubling themselves going back and forth between this and that

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:42.720
[Guest]: Prime Minister presidential and never resolving this. And in fact, creating it doesn't mean

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:48.280
[Guest]: we don't amend. Of course, we amend, but we still keep that continuity as we amend. And

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.440
[Guest]: that is the principal desiderata of conservatism.

01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of go back to the chronology and sort of the Ram Mohan Roy conservatives,

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.840
[Amit Varma]: as you say, and for three years during the transitional period, 47 to 50, they are in

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.280
[Amit Varma]: powerful positions, they are shaping the new India. And then in a sense for that, for that

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.040
[Amit Varma]: strand of conservatism, it all falls apart. Patel dies, Prasad gets a titular post of

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.360
[Amit Varma]: President, Purushottam Das Tandon is knocked out of the party, Govind Ballapant is CM of

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:27.840
[Amit Varma]: UP, but he's kind of sidelined as well. And, and it's all Nehru, VP Menon, they're sort

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.080
[Amit Varma]: of Fabian socialist vision, which is dominating.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080
[Amit Varma]: VK Menon, not VP.

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.080
[Amit Varma]: Sorry, yeah.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080
[Guest]: VP Menon's a good guy.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, my bad. VP Menon helped bring all the states together, of course,

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:44.560
[Amit Varma]: and has written a fine book on it. And, you know, and like you point out, there were some

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:50.560
[Amit Varma]: minor successes, such as they did manage to stop Nehru from carrying out collective farming.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:57.080
[Guest]: 20 million people died in China. We don't know how many people died under Stalin in

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:05.240
[Guest]: in Russia, because they didn't keep track of killings. Collective farming could have

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:12.040
[Guest]: set back Indian agriculture, could have, could have created massive chaos. And there was

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:20.880
[Guest]: a very strong lobby for it. So, Tantra Party fought it relentlessly. Charan Singh, who

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.880
[Guest]: was in and out of the Congress Party, actually, at that time, I think he was in the Congress

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:33.400
[Guest]: Party, fought it relentlessly. And somehow, the caucus prevailed. And Nehru's other advisors

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:39.980
[Guest]: who wanted to push us towards collective farming were kept back. Also, remember, at that time,

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:44.200
[Guest]: property was a fundamental right. This obscene amendment hadn't yet come.

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.760
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode on the right to property. And I agree with you, that is the most obscene

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760
[Guest]: amendment.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.840
[Guest]: This obscene amendment hadn't yet come. And Nehru never, Nehru disliked property being

01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:01.240
[Guest]: a fundamental right. He disliked the idea of justiciable compensation. But he was gradualist

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:08.560
[Guest]: enough not to tamper with it. It happened after his death. So, yes, we started, I think

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:18.600
[Guest]: the high point of losing influence was 56, 55, Avadi Congress, after which it became

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:27.640
[Guest]: very much of a left-wing, pro-Soviet, pro-central planning, pro-gigantism party on the economic

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:38.260
[Guest]: side. And on the political side, I think it remained one of kind of tops-down fixes. Community

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:44.680
[Guest]: development program, he will spend 500 crores, you know, some tops-down stuff without sufficient

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:52.040
[Guest]: citizen participation or grassroots involvements. And making some compromises like linguistic

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:58.360
[Guest]: states, which they couldn't fight off completely. And it was a very sad time for the country,

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.800
[Guest]: very sad time. And it continued for a long time, unfortunately.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:06.920
[Amit Varma]: No, and it was in an economic sense, I admire Nehru for many things. And I think he was

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.360
[Amit Varma]: a great statesman, but in economics, he was a complete disaster. And this would definitely

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.400
[Amit Varma]: have been part of the reason that there weren't enough countervailing influences and he sidelined

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.240
[Guest]: Raj Gopalachari and forced him to leave.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:22.680
[Guest]: I actually hold as economic advisors more responsible than even Nehru, Malo Nubesvi,

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:32.680
[Guest]: K. R. V. Rao, K. N. Raj, all these, Sukumoy Chakravarti, all these fellows who kept writing

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:40.680
[Guest]: theoretical papers sitting in Delhi school, and who really sidelined the chinoys of the

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:48.680
[Guest]: world and pushed through some very absurd, I mean, Malo Nubesvi actually believed that

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:55.080
[Guest]: the economy was some kind of a machine. He had no time for price signals, for, you know,

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.960
[Guest]: consumer preferences. Everything was a machine and it would work. If you made so much steel,

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.280
[Guest]: you could make so many cars. If you made so many cars, you could consume so much petrol.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.840
[Amit Varma]: And it's ironic because Hayek's great essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, was written

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.840
[Guest]: in I think, 45 or 46 before.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:15.240
[Guest]: All this was known, Baba. There's no, the idea that they didn't know that this was zeitgeist.

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.760
[Guest]: I know people like Ram Goha pushed this idea. No, no, they were just, you know, following

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.080
[Guest]: the fashions of that time.

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.280
[Amit Varma]: Which I think broadly is true. I mean, no one knew what the Soviet Union actually was

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.640
[Guest]: at that time. People sort of idealized it.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.520
[Guest]: They had put the Sputnik in space. So people thought they were ahead of the US and the

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:41.280
[Guest]: West. So there was that kind of, but there was also, I think, brazen stupidity for which

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.200
[Guest]: we are all paying a price. I mean, the point is, it's not a price that they only paid or

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.440
[Guest]: their families paid. It's a price that the whole country has paid.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.040
[Amit Varma]: I want to move on to the Bankimchandra Chatterjee School because it's sort of more relevant

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.640
[Amit Varma]: to our times. But before I do that, let's talk about the last political gasp of the

01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.600
[Amit Varma]: Ram Mohan Roy School. And of course, you have the Conservative Caucus sort of dying out

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.680
[Amit Varma]: within the Congress when, you know, Shastri dies, Gulzarilal Nanda leaves, Maraji Desai

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:10.480
[Amit Varma]: leaves. And by the end of that decade, by the end of the 60s, Svatantra Party is also

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:18.080
[Amit Varma]: a spent force. And your point is that politically, the Svatantra Party and by extension, the

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.800
[Amit Varma]: Ram Mohan Roy School of Conservatism is doomed to fail politically. Why do you say that?

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:32.080
[Guest]: As a separate political movement, institution or party, I don't think it can succeed. In

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:42.040
[Guest]: democratic politics, the issue that seems to matter most to voters is identity. And

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:48.800
[Guest]: if at all there is an interest in economics, the interest seems to be in redistributive,

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:55.080
[Guest]: goody giving, patronage economics. So, this is the nature of the voter. And this has been

01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:01.720
[Guest]: discussed even by Pericles. I mean, this is not a new thing. The nature of the voter is

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.160
[Guest]: something we have to live with, which is one reason, by the way, why many aristocracies

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:12.200
[Guest]: resisted increasing the franchise. I'm not supporting it, but I'm saying there was always

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:18.880
[Guest]: this fear that now, if you're going to vote by identity, like the Republican Party in

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:25.280
[Guest]: America is about guns, it is about abortion, it's about immigration. It's not about taxes

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:32.200
[Guest]: and trade. Those are secondary issues. The Conservative Party in England is about England

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:39.040
[Guest]: and identity and so on. And the Labour is about free immigration and more refugees and

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.240
[Guest]: so on. These are about identity issues. It's not about... And then the ideology, the economic

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:49.280
[Guest]: ideology comes. Now, what is the identity issue that Swatantra or Ram Mohan Liberal

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:57.400
[Guest]: can put up? Very difficult. It's too elitist. You don't appeal to any one caste or any religion

01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:03.600
[Guest]: or any linguistic group. You can't call yourself Telugu Desam. You can't call yourself, you

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:13.520
[Guest]: know, Muslim League or Kalidhal. So, therefore, to get elected is not possible. That's my

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:20.160
[Guest]: point I'm trying to make. A party like this as a political party. Now, can it be a movement?

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:25.240
[Guest]: Can it be a debating society? After all, Fabian Society, that left-wing group that did so

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:31.400
[Guest]: much damage to the 20th century, it was just a debating group. So, you can influence without

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:37.960
[Guest]: necessarily being a political party. That's the point I'm trying to make. And to try and

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.900
[Guest]: start a political party is a waste of time.

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:47.000
[Amit Varma]: No, the Ram Mohan School of Conservatism sort of failed there, at least in a political sense.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.320
[Amit Varma]: But the strand of conservatism which did succeed was the Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay strand

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:55.320
[Guest]: of conservatism, which no one expected. And they're in charge now.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:03.680
[Guest]: Particularly in the 50s, I don't think Jansang had more than 3, 4, 5 MPs, whatever. The communists

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:12.040
[Guest]: always had many more. No one expected the Bankim Chandra School to do so well politically.

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:20.680
[Guest]: And that's in the 62 and 67 elections. Swatantra had more seats than Jansang. So, but the reason

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:28.560
[Guest]: I think that's been able to chug along and increase its footprint, frankly, goes back

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:38.040
[Guest]: to Lajpat Rai. It goes back to, and even to Bandarkar. Bandarkar's speech talks about

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:49.040
[Guest]: the fact that, hey, you know, Hindus better become anti-caste. We better get consolidation

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.000
[Guest]: across castes. And this is also very prominent in Savarkar's writings.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
[Amit Varma]: So,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Savarkar and Ambedkar were together against Gandhi on the issue of caste. A lot

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:00.480
[Amit Varma]: of people don't realize this when they sort of

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.600
[Guest]: Yeah, so there's, and that in the initial years, when I was in college, for instance,

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:16.000
[Guest]: in the 60s, Jansang was a North Indian Hindu, Hindi party. And that too upper caste, you

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.480
[Guest]: know, light complexioned people, kind of party. It has changed. Its current leader is an OBC.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:30.080
[Guest]: I mean, hey, it's, it's been able to do what, in fact, Kanshi Ram always used to say a communist

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:36.000
[Guest]: party of India is a joke. All its politburo are Brahmins and upper caste. All the workers

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.200
[Guest]: are Dalits. And that has been the problem with virtually all political parties in India.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:48.320
[Guest]: They have been able to break that genuine Hindu consolidation that Lajpat Rai politically

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:55.840
[Guest]: wanted and which Bhandarkar intellectually argued for and Savarkar supported in his early

01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:02.280
[Guest]: days. That has happened. It's happened for a variety of reasons, including I mentioned

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:08.200
[Guest]: somewhere in the book, the Ramayan television series of what is this fellow, this

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200
[Guest]: Ramanand Sagar

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:16.080
[Guest]: In cultural history terms, he'll go down as important as Kambanur Tulsi, Das or Tyagaraja.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.160
[Guest]: Just wait and see when it's written a hundred years from now, the importance of what he

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.800
[Guest]: did. But for a variety of reasons, they have been able to, but I think this is the single

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:35.800
[Guest]: most important reason. The identity of a Samajwadi party is as of a Yadav party. The identity

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:43.240
[Guest]: of NCPs as of a Maratha party, for Kalidhar as a Jat Seekh party. This has managed to

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:53.760
[Guest]: take the identity across castes and has been able to get OBCs into it. This was very much

01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:01.080
[Guest]: Lajpat Rai's vision and that has happened. It's almost as if they've kind of systematically,

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:11.160
[Guest]: they've also looked at the ideas going back to Bankim. What is the original idea of Anandamath?

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:19.360
[Guest]: A dedicated group of Sanyasis, Bhairagis, who are worshippers of the mother goddess,

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:29.960
[Guest]: who are committed to sacrifice and freedom. Actually, today's BJP vocabulary is uncannily

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:42.880
[Guest]: similar. Vande Mataram, Mother India, spirit of sacrifice, spirit of asceticism, anti-corruption.

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:50.080
[Guest]: On the ideas side, they have gone back to Bankim quite well. On the organizational and

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:56.680
[Guest]: people side, they have been the most successful party in terms of they have a Dalit president.

01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:01.160
[Guest]: Before that, they even made Muslim president. So, they've kind of been able to do these

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:10.280
[Guest]: things quite well. And really, I'm quite impressed. The adherence to Bankim and the ongoing Vivekananda.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:18.200
[Guest]: Vivekananda is very important in Modi's vocabulary. And again, the same ideas of sacrifice of

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:25.840
[Guest]: motherland, those ideas taken forward and mingled with the political organization of

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:31.840
[Guest]: how in a democratic polity does one get the OBC vote? How does one get the Dalit vote?

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:36.440
[Guest]: How does one get the tribal vote? And long years of hard work, particularly the tribal

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:45.240
[Guest]: votes is not recent. I mean, that work has been going on for 30-40 years in parts of

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:52.480
[Guest]: tribal India, and it's finally paid off. So, there's still a problem with the South. It's

01:52:52.480 --> 01:53:00.040
[Guest]: not clear that it's been able to. Karnataka is a bit of a, you know, one swallow not making

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:06.080
[Guest]: a summer. So, we'll see if they'll be able to push through in Telangana, Andhra, Kerala,

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:12.880
[Guest]: Tamil Nadu. But the overall effect has been very, very interesting. Also, the base of

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.080
[Guest]: the leadership, the original Hindu Mahasabha leadership was really very much Bengali and

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:28.840
[Guest]: Punjabi and UP maybe. And the original RSS leadership was, you know, Maharashtra Vidarbha.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:34.000
[Guest]: Now you have Gujarat, you have, you know, different parts of the country pushing forth

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.380
[Amit Varma]: the leaders. You have an OBC Prime Minister. I'll sort of synthesize all this by quoting

01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:43.080
[Amit Varma]: from your book again, which very eloquently expresses sort of the origin of the school

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:48.000
[Amit Varma]: of where you say, quote, a frequently asked question is whether Hindu nationalism by its

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.200
[Amit Varma]: very Hindu and very nationalistic nature can be a branch of conservatism at all. This needs

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.880
[Amit Varma]: to be viewed contextually. Abraham Lincoln, who was perhaps the greatest American president,

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:03.080
[Amit Varma]: referred to the mystic chords of memory that bind people together. When you combine this

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:07.160
[Amit Varma]: with the fact that the British conquered India and pretty openly took the position that they

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:12.160
[Amit Varma]: had conquered it from predominantly Muslim rulers, it became clear that non-Muslims in

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.760
[Amit Varma]: India, taking into account that the very term Hindu was an evolving one, had no option but

01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:23.120
[Amit Varma]: to seek a renaissance if they were to sustain themselves as a community with shared mutual

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:28.880
[Amit Varma]: loyalty rather than as atomized splinters. Bankim and Lajpat Rai, along with several

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:34.480
[Amit Varma]: others realized that a shared Hindu cultural identity could be the basis of overcoming

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:41.040
[Amit Varma]: vertical and horizontal boundaries among Hindus like caste, stop quote. And you later said

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.720
[Amit Varma]: they could then be a band of brothers. And partly, like you said, this has finally taken

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:50.200
[Amit Varma]: shape in the sense that more Dalits voted for the BJP than the Congress in both the

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:56.080
[Guest]: 2014 and the 2019 elections. In UP, there might be as many Dalits voting for BJP as

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:02.440
[Amit Varma]: for BSP. Absolutely. So, you know, it's quite an achievement. Whatever, whatever activists

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:07.160
[Amit Varma]: on the outside might say, it seems the Dalits of India have voted with their feet for the

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:13.160
[Amit Varma]: moment. Now, I want to come back to a slightly more sort of troubling element. There's a

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.040
[Amit Varma]: later quote in your book, the question that arises a quote, the question that arises is

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:22.720
[Amit Varma]: whether the pre-independence Hindu nationalist movement was a conservative one or not. It

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:28.520
[Amit Varma]: certainly had a conservative flavor to it. But it also had a revivalist and rejectionist

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:35.000
[Amit Varma]: flavor, stop quote. And in a different part of the book, you talk about how the danger

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.960
[Amit Varma]: in these kinds of nationalistic movements can be in othering certain people the same

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.360
[Amit Varma]: way the Nazis did, for example, and you bring up that comparison, and you say that that

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:51.280
[Amit Varma]: othering could become something pathological, and could descend into something which is

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.440
[Amit Varma]: very far from conservatism. Can you sort of elaborate?

01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:04.400
[Guest]: Yeah, you see, when you talk about revivalist, if you say that only Gupta era or Chola era

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:13.240
[Guest]: stuff matters, the last 200 years of British era is all hell, is all poison, all to be

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:20.560
[Guest]: forgotten, all to be jettisoned, that is revivalism. You know, that is not conservatism. The second

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:26.960
[Guest]: thing in terms of othering is really, Band of Brothers is, we are together, we have a

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:33.680
[Guest]: shared culture, we have a shared community, a shared territory, whatever. Does it require

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:41.200
[Guest]: that we move to the next step of disliking another Band of Brothers? And so that's called

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:48.800
[Guest]: othering, really, essentially, to build a kind of political platform on a negative kind

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:55.960
[Guest]: of trajectory. And it's not unusual, it happens. You could be a proud German, and you could

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.640
[Guest]: have included the Jews as part of proud Germans. After all, between 1900 and 1930, although

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:08.040
[Guest]: they were 1% of the population, 30% of the Nobel prizes won by Germans were won by Jewish

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:14.960
[Guest]: Germans. They never thought of themselves. But if you choose to other them, then you

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:21.120
[Guest]: end up with a pathological situation, which in the long run can be detrimental, can come

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:27.400
[Guest]: back like a Basmasurah, it can come back to actually kill you. And this is a problem that

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:37.960
[Guest]: a lot of nationalist conservative movements have. Parnell was, you know, look at Parnell,

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:44.040
[Guest]: how he was othered. He was a great Irish Catholic leader. But the church went against him because

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:50.240
[Guest]: he had an affair or something. Purely personal reason, you othered the man. And then the

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:56.120
[Guest]: Irish lost 50 years, that they could have gotten their home rule earlier, under Parnell.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:01.720
[Guest]: So these things, you have to be very careful, you have to be extremely careful that you

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:09.440
[Guest]: don't. And that's why revivalism and being anti-British, and anti-McCauley-Putra, and

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:16.360
[Guest]: anti-British rule, and anti-English, ends up also becoming anti-Western civilization,

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:21.240
[Guest]: which is the source of so much modern good stuff for us. So it's dangerous. You should

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:27.240
[Guest]: not other, you know, anyone because in doing that, you lose. I mean, TSA Ledder is not

01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:31.880
[Guest]: a fool to read the Upanishad. He's, you know, he's reaching out to all that is great in

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:38.360
[Guest]: human traditions. We should be like that and not other, either the West or Muslims or anyone.

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.480
[Amit Varma]: And there's a passage in your book, which seemed to me that I would have agreed with

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:47.080
[Amit Varma]: if you had written it in, say, 2002, when Vajpayee was Prime Minister. But I cannot

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.240
[Amit Varma]: agree with it today, which is, quote, almost imperceptibly, the face of Hindu nationalism

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.320
[Amit Varma]: changed. Gone was the opposition to English and the attempts to force Hindi and reluctant

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:02.240
[Amit Varma]: states. Traces of obscurantism associated with the revivalist ideology were quietly

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:06.760
[Amit Varma]: jettisoned. The Ram Rajya Parishad's opposition to changes to the Hindu marriage and divorce

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:12.440
[Amit Varma]: code would appear quaint today. Hindu nationalism has acquired a chic contemporary age. Stop

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:17.480
[Amit Varma]: quote. And even if this might have been true in 2002, when Vajpayee was PM, it seems to

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:22.120
[Amit Varma]: me that it's actually shifted the other way today in the sense that cow is back as an

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:27.480
[Amit Varma]: issue. Now that they're done with 370, they're at some point going to move on to the uniform

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:32.800
[Amit Varma]: civil code, which in a sense is, you know, the Hindu code bill issue all over again,

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.600
[Amit Varma]: expressed differently as resentment against the other, you know, apply to everyone. Similarly,

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, lynchings are on the rise. You have talk of, you know, I mean, things like love

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:47.280
[Amit Varma]: jihad and all were issues in the 1920s, for God's sake, and they are back. I had an episode

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:51.880
[Amit Varma]: a while back with Akar Patel on the intellectual foundations of Hindutva, which in retrospect,

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:55.880
[Amit Varma]: I think both of us said things which were rather naive. But one of the points he made

01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:03.600
[Amit Varma]: in that was that it seems to him that a lot of Hindutva, it seems to be again, like you

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:09.400
[Amit Varma]: pointed out about the other, it's directed at someone, you know, whether it's cow slaughter

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:14.640
[Amit Varma]: directed at Muslims, whether it's UCC directed at Muslims or at appeasement of the Muslims

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:19.880
[Amit Varma]: that the Congress carried out. And that allegation, of course, is correct. But it's all about

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:26.840
[Guest]: the other. What are the positive things that this I think, I think, you know, the the best

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:33.760
[Guest]: writings of Savarkar or Shamprasad. It's not about the other at all. It's about reforming

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:39.000
[Guest]: and consolidating Hindus. It's very little reference to the other actually. Hindutva

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.840
[Amit Varma]: has a fair amount of reference to it. I mean, I've read it and but the emphasis is really

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:54.440
[Guest]: let's fix ourselves. Let Hindus get, you know, Sangatan within Hindus that let's let's get

02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:00.000
[Guest]: rid of caste. Let's get rid of egregious. That's the emphasis. The other part is kind

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:08.320
[Guest]: of there, but it's not and it can always become bigger. The question is, if it becomes bigger,

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.200
[Guest]: what are the risks? What are the dangers? There's two others. There's not I don't believe

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:19.880
[Guest]: there's only one other. One other is the West. Because when you reject English and Macaulay

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:26.360
[Guest]: Putras, and when you reject a lot of those things, you are saying that we will be a kind

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:34.200
[Guest]: of a Hindu thing without recourse to any interaction dependence with the West. And the other is

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:43.040
[Guest]: Muslim. I think the second one, post 911, has gotten a little confused with also this

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:48.320
[Guest]: jihadism and international terrorism, and of course, Pakistan sponsored terrorism and

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:56.380
[Guest]: so on. So that's become a very confused area of of dealing with it. And I don't think anybody

02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:03.040
[Guest]: has the right answers. I just saw the other day that there is a head of some Christian

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.200
[Guest]: association in Kerala was written a long letter about love jihad saying, it's all about Christian

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:15.160
[Guest]: girls who are being trapped in love jihad. So this is now, you know, and the attack on

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:20.360
[Guest]: the Christian churches in Sri Lanka and so on. This has become a bit of a difficult thing

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:27.680
[Guest]: to deal with. One can only hope and I've mentioned that there are some good signs. There are

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:35.360
[Guest]: some lots of worrisome signs, some good signs. Modi being the chief guest at the International

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:44.920
[Guest]: Sufi Convention in Delhi. He is being very prominent in the Bori Convention in Indore.

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:50.440
[Guest]: And if you noticed, in this Houston thing, there was a large number of bodies in that

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:59.400
[Guest]: traditional attire. So Bori NRIs also obviously are being courted as part of this. I think

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:08.360
[Guest]: there is a need to make that connect. And I think the most promising area, which I hope

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:18.320
[Guest]: they will, is music. Because music is an area where there has been a lot of kind of commingling

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:27.000
[Guest]: and a lot of emergence of a band of brothers spirit across Hindus and Muslims, not just

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:33.560
[Guest]: within Hindus or within Muslims. It has been one of those things. We have in Tamil a song,

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:40.800
[Guest]: Patum Nane, Bhavumum Nane. I am the song. I am the bhava. I am the feeling in the song.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:45.880
[Guest]: I am the person who has made you, the singer, sing. So this is Shiva, who is the lord of

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:52.280
[Guest]: Madurai city. And we believe that still, if you are a good devoted person, you can still

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:58.200
[Guest]: see, suddenly get to see Shiva in Madurai city. He is always there. So he is singing

02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:07.360
[Guest]: this song. And the person who wrote this, this is a 1970s, 60s, 70s song, is a guy called

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:18.520
[Guest]: Kamu Sharif, a Muslim lyricist and poet. So my point is, if you can go to the Sufi Convention,

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:25.600
[Guest]: then you should now also push along these things. Because otherwise, the narrative,

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.920
[Guest]: including what is bothering me, is international. It is no longer just an Indian problem. It's

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:38.640
[Guest]: got international dimensions in terms of this othering, that we need to, and I am hopeful.

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:46.560
[Guest]: I somehow feel that the two countries where we might also get constructive response from

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.480
[Guest]: Muslim intellectuals will be India and Indonesia, where they will come up with new pathbreaking

02:04:52.480 --> 02:05:02.200
[Guest]: ways to reach out to create band of brothers, affinities. I am very intrigued by this Pasmandha

02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:04.160
[Guest]: Muslim movement. You know about it?

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:05.160
[Guest]: No.

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:12.160
[Guest]: This is a movement in UP and Bihar of OBC Muslims. So they want to, so in a sense, they

02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:19.800
[Guest]: want, they're saying these Ashraf, you know, Arab, Persian descent, light complexion, Muslim

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:27.080
[Guest]: aristocracy, they have not helped us. They've just, you know, taken care of their sinecures.

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:34.440
[Guest]: So let us do our own movement, look for reservations, which is what everybody in India looks for

02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:41.520
[Guest]: and a few other goodies. But in the process, what are they doing? They are admitting that

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:50.560
[Guest]: they are converts of OBC castes, which is what in fact, the Hindutva people want them

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:58.080
[Guest]: to admit. So it is happening maybe for a totally different reason. But it's, so I am this girl

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:05.240
[Guest]: Salma who writes, she's a Tamil feminist writer. She's a Muslim feminist writer. Very interesting.

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:13.800
[Guest]: So there are things like that that are happening, which give me a sense of optimism. But yes,

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:23.200
[Guest]: we could, the descent from high watermark 1930 to 1940 was just 10 years. It doesn't

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:31.680
[Guest]: take very long. If you, if you make a few wrong choices, you could, hopefully again,

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:36.920
[Guest]: that's the constitution. It is it's the inherent good sense of the Indian people which will

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:37.920
[Amit Varma]: prevail.

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:42.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the great lessons of the 20th century was that one must be able to tell

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:47.560
[Amit Varma]: the difference between an ideology in its utopian form, as you've pointed out, and what

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:52.760
[Amit Varma]: actually happens. And we've seen that with the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, or whatever,

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:57.440
[Amit Varma]: where you still have people who defend communism and say that in any theory, but practice where

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:02.760
[Amit Varma]: they implemented it wrong. So my question to you then is, let's look at this school

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:07.320
[Amit Varma]: of conservatism, the Bankimchandra school of conservatism with the same scepticism,

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:12.640
[Amit Varma]: and leave aside what are in theory, the sensible aspects of it and look at what's happening

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.920
[Amit Varma]: in practice, because what I see in practice is when Modi is a master of optics, what I

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:22.520
[Amit Varma]: see in practice is that in terms of economics, his government is as statist as any government

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:26.040
[Amit Varma]: in our history. In fact, many of the things he's done like demonetization and the botched

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:30.480
[Amit Varma]: implementation of GST feels like it's right out of Indira Gandhi's book, I always say

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:31.480
[Guest]: he's her successor.

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:38.240
[Guest]: This is where I keep making the argument, we need to appeal to the non statist free

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:44.720
[Guest]: market elements within the BJP. Because there are Luddite elements also, they don't want

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:50.480
[Guest]: modern technology, but they don't want GM crops. There's there's a whole lot of elements

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:59.400
[Guest]: within this broad umbrella of Hindu nationalism, which we need to neutralize and appeal to

02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:04.080
[Guest]: those elements which are, that's why I said if you read that again, there is something

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:13.760
[Guest]: about technical thing, chic contemporary edge. Now, this meeting with Facebook, this interested

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:17.680
[Guest]: in Silicon Valley, these are the things that we need to push.

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:26.200
[Guest]: It's very tough, it's very tough to push it because the other side which wants GM crops

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:32.640
[Guest]: to be banned, which wants no privatization, they have their, you know, they're playing

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:42.640
[Guest]: the same game of using their thing. And, but it's a tough one. In general, it's been disappointing

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:47.920
[Guest]: that this dispensation has not been as market friendly, I think, as many of us expected

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.920
[Amit Varma]: it to be.

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.200
[Amit Varma]: And I didn't really even finish my question, because the second part of the first part,

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:55.880
[Amit Varma]: of course, is an economics have been completely statist, not even just as market friendly

02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.800
[Amit Varma]: as you and I would have liked, but literally Indira Gandhi level statist. But also in terms

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:06.400
[Amit Varma]: of society, our society is being polarized very deeply. And I don't think that's an exaggeration

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.720
[Amit Varma]: by what is really going on.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:15.240
[Guest]: I think it's an exaggeration. In my travels, I don't see, I think it's a very Bombay Delhi

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:25.240
[Guest]: view. When I travel around the country, I don't see any great change from the past.

02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:34.320
[Guest]: And I really, you know, wonder if in fact, there is extraordinary new levels of violence

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:43.280
[Guest]: or new levels of tension, because it seems to me pretty much the same as it was before.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:51.120
[Guest]: And it's India's never been an easy country to govern. And it's never been a nonviolent

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:59.040
[Guest]: country despite Mahatma Gandhi's best efforts. So it's there, but it's I don't the narrative

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:04.880
[Guest]: that somehow it has gone up dramatically in the last five, six years, I, I'm very sceptical

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:11.080
[Guest]: of that narrative. For instance, take this some guy has gone to a magistrate and gotten

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.560
[Guest]: some sedition case against some writers in some obscure court in Bihar. Now, this kind

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.560
[Guest]: of thing has been happening in India for the last 80 years. It's not new.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:25.760
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I have in fact written about the sedition law in columns long before this government

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:29.080
[Amit Varma]: came to power. But I think we'll agree to disagree. Because I think if you just look

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:33.720
[Amit Varma]: at the number of the lynching numbers, for example, and the way that the discourse has

02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.920
[Amit Varma]: been so polarized and has become so shrill, I think, but we can agree to disagree.

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:43.120
[Guest]: I don't know, I think maybe I have a longer memory or whatever. But have you heard of

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:51.480
[Guest]: Kela Venmani? No. Kela Venmani in 1968, 40 odd Dalit agricultural workers were burnt

02:10:51.480 --> 02:11:01.080
[Guest]: alive in a, in a hut in Thanjavur district. Now, these kinds of things have been there

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:07.160
[Guest]: and no one was punished, by the way. Commission of inquiry came up with some total anodyne

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:13.520
[Guest]: report. And this is under a DMK government, not even a Congress government. I'm not, not,

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:21.600
[Guest]: this is the, the, the, the, I remember so many of these things and I say Maliana, Meerut,

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.640
[Guest]: Moradabad. In fact, this fellow who has now become governor of Kerala, what's his name?

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:30.440
[Guest]: Arif Mohammad Khan. He makes an interesting statement. I was watching him on YouTube the

02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:36.640
[Guest]: other day. There have been no riots for some time. That's his perspective, you know, but

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:42.640
[Guest]: which is actually interesting. You want to measure by riots. It's kind of horrifying

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.680
[Guest]: idea because you know, the moment you say these things, you'll have one. It's kind of

02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:52.440
[Amit Varma]: scary, but. We'll leave this particular issue there. Let the listener decide. I've taken

02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:57.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot of your time. So I'll end with sort of a couple of more questions. One question

02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:05.600
[Amit Varma]: is that once you get into politics, your imperatives, your incentives drive you in a particular direction.

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:10.200
[Amit Varma]: And typically what happens is you're driven by the will to power. For example, Amit Shah

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:15.160
[Amit Varma]: is of course a master political strategist and the way he's done his mergers and acquisitions

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.680
[Amit Varma]: got politicians from all parties, regardless of their founding ideology, the way he's put

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:25.120
[Amit Varma]: together caste coalitions, you know, going after non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.160
[Amit Varma]: and so on and you'll be very masterful, but driven by the will to power and not by any

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:36.680
[Amit Varma]: ideology per se. So then the question is that given that political imperatives leave you

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.200
[Amit Varma]: with only one aim, which is what is the best way to come to power and nothing else matters,

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:47.160
[Amit Varma]: not issues of virtue, or what is the right thing to do, or what is good for society,

02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:53.160
[Amit Varma]: but simply how do I win the next election? Is that something that you see as a problem?

02:12:53.160 --> 02:13:01.120
[Guest]: And isn't that a more core? It is. It would be a complete violation of the principles

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.880
[Guest]: of Rajadharma. Thiruvalluvar certainly would not have approved of it. But all that is theory,

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:15.200
[Guest]: right? No, why? I mean, I mean, ruling righteously is not theory. Who has ruled righteously?

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:19.080
[Guest]: I mean, I don't like the word rule because they should serve, but who has ruled righteously?

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:25.680
[Guest]: Not perfectly. Look, you go back to the American Constitution. They are saying more perfect

02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:33.080
[Guest]: union. They're not saying the perfect union. We are not saying that we can get it all correct.

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:39.040
[Guest]: But the intention and the attempt has to be in the direction of righteousness and not

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:44.960
[Guest]: in the direction of pure pursuit of power. And that is that is a danger. It's a danger

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:55.680
[Guest]: that all kings, all quasi kings, would be kings, wannabe kings are tempted by. And in

02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:04.680
[Guest]: that process, will they adopt means that are not just moderately bad, but extremely bad?

02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:12.520
[Guest]: That's the question you're asking, right? And we've seen this again and again and again

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:18.280
[Guest]: in democratic politics when somebody says, yeah, that might be a good idea, but it's

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:24.920
[Guest]: not a vote winner. Oh, that's a vote loser. Forget it. You know, this idea that we will

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:33.120
[Guest]: only pursue vote winners and discard vote losers is in and of itself not bad. But when

02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:42.120
[Guest]: you then say, I don't mind pursuing vote winners, but I'll do it through bribery, chauvinism,

02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:49.680
[Guest]: corruption, violence, that's when it becomes it becomes a problem. I don't think we've

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:55.440
[Guest]: gotten there. The country is not there. Could it get there? I doubt it.

02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:01.640
[Amit Varma]: No, in the sense that we had something like demonetization, which was horrible economics,

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:06.240
[Amit Varma]: but good politics and carried out for political reasons, because the calculation was that

02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:11.160
[Amit Varma]: one your opposition parties funds get stunted and to the sense of schadenfreude that the

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:15.680
[Amit Varma]: poor feel about the rich suffering more than them will help them win the next UP election.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:16.680
[Guest]: And it was a landslide.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:24.760
[Guest]: You know, again, I mean, we, after the fact, it looks, if they had lost, we'd have said

02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:31.200
[Guest]: demonetization caused them the loss. My point is, after these electoral analysis, but why

02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:34.440
[Guest]: somebody wins or loses after the fact.

02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:41.080
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with you. My point of bringing this up was to say that the impetus behind

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.480
[Amit Varma]: a particular that particular economic policy and my contention is, for most economic policies

02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.280
[Guest]: that get carried out by the government is a political impetus, not an economic impetus.

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.200
[Guest]: That is correct. And that's that is the nature of democracy. I don't think you can stand

02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.840
[Guest]: up in Britain and say NHS is inefficient. You will lose. It doesn't matter whether you're

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:09.900
[Guest]: conservative or Labour or whatever. So yes, ultimately, in a democracy, politics predominates

02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:21.360
[Guest]: and not economics. And that has been one of the sadder things about the 1991 reforms,

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:29.280
[Guest]: is that it wasn't sold to the people as something that's good to this day. I don't think it's

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:33.240
[Guest]: economic reform or movement towards markets has been sold by anyone.

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.480
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's remarkable that actually the best thing in terms of policy that happened

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.800
[Amit Varma]: to this country, which got 300 million people out of poverty, is something that Rahul Gandhi

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:48.240
[Amit Varma]: actually disowns, and wants to walk back to earlier socialist times, which kept millions

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:53.880
[Guest]: in poor, which is, you know, the state of the opposition is so dismal.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:17:01.040
[Guest]: Because I think the politics of patronage may be very important for their votes. Right.

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:05.680
[Guest]: In other words, you know, exactly the point I was making, I made this point many years

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.080
[Guest]: ago, to one of my friends of the Congress. I'm talking about 20-30 years ago, not now.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.680
[Guest]: I said, yeah, as far as I can make out, the less educated a person is, the less wealthy

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:25.280
[Guest]: a person is, other things being equal, caste, gender, etc. The more likely that person is

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:33.280
[Guest]: to work for Congress party. Therefore, I said, you guys have a vested interest in keeping

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:40.640
[Guest]: people less educated and less wealthy. I mean, stupid reverse causality, I admit, it's not

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:48.160
[Guest]: a good argument. But I was making it for effect to say, these are very complicated things.

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:58.480
[Guest]: They don't, for instance, would you want Hispanic Americans to get integrated? If you are a

02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:05.640
[Guest]: Democratic Party leader in America, probably not, you want to highlight their separateness,

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:09.440
[Guest]: because then they'll vote for you. Otherwise, they might vote Republican. So these are some

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:16.280
[Guest]: very complicated things. And it's a curse of democracy, that we have to deal with these

02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:24.120
[Guest]: things. I think economic reform, we have to keep fighting for it on only two, three basis.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:33.040
[Guest]: One, it is morally the right thing to do, Raja Dharma, not to interfere in economic

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:41.560
[Guest]: activities of your citizens. Two, consequentially, all these Asian countries who adopted it have

02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:48.660
[Guest]: done better than us. Therefore, you will do better. And three, if a constituency keeps

02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:54.080
[Guest]: getting built for it, which is still very small, presumably, and not a constituency

02:18:54.080 --> 02:19:01.120
[Guest]: for freebies, I think you might, but the third one is very tough. It's very tough. Politics

02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:09.560
[Guest]: always trumps economics. And also they look at the facts. Fact is Nassim Rao lost. Fact

02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:15.400
[Guest]: is Vajpayee lost. You know, hey, wait a minute, probably our two best Prime Ministers. Wait

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.720
[Guest]: a minute, you know, economic reform, Vajpayee did the maximum amount of privatizations,

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:27.720
[Guest]: even added disinvestment ministry. He lost. So the conclusion you come to, it's a very

02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:35.560
[Guest]: strange conclusion, but you come to it that, hey, you know, the voters are supreme. And

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:44.280
[Guest]: how does one deal with that? Democracy is not an unmixed blessing. It has its problems,

02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:49.160
[Guest]: as Churchill says, it's better than other systems, but it's not necessarily a very good

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.160
[Amit Varma]: system.

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. Now, I'll let you go shortly. I'll release you from the fetters of this

02:19:54.840 --> 02:20:00.000
[Amit Varma]: drab podcast recording studio. But before I ask my final question, I just want a word

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.520
[Amit Varma]: for my listeners. I had four pages of notes for this episode, and I'm through just two

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:11.240
[Amit Varma]: of them. Among the things we could not discuss is the development of Islam in India, how

02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:17.360
[Amit Varma]: much of it was around conservative lines, how much was not. Jerry's assertion that Jinnah

02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.160
[Amit Varma]: started off as a conservative and ended as a radical. Then there are a couple of really

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:28.680
[Amit Varma]: good chapters on culture, on society, on aesthetics and education. So the book is far richer than

02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:32.160
[Amit Varma]: this, even this episode might have given you a sense of so please to go out and buy the

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:36.800
[Amit Varma]: book. But now for my last question, which is a question I ask all my guests about whatever

02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:43.280
[Guest]: the subject is. Can I come in for one minute? Particularly the culture section, I think

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:51.280
[Guest]: is something that I spent a fair amount of time and effort on. Because the problem in

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:58.840
[Guest]: today's academia, both in North America and in England and in the continent and in India,

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:05.580
[Guest]: is that it's dominated by Marxist postmodernists and Freudians, who have kind of dismissed

02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:12.080
[Guest]: the idea of an Indian culture as upper caste, hegemonic, patriarchal, this, that and the

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:18.560
[Guest]: other using their vocabulary that postmodernists like, which I don't understand, and I choose

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:28.480
[Guest]: not to understand. And I've taken a very comprehensive and a very head on attack on that, in defending

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:34.520
[Guest]: the idea of an Indian culture. So I do hope readers will get to that and spend time on

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:42.760
[Amit Varma]: that. Now, come on your question. Yeah, my final question is, speaking as a conservative,

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:50.600
[Amit Varma]: what gives you hope? And what gives you despair about the next 20 years in India?

02:21:50.600 --> 02:22:02.000
[Guest]: What gives me hope? I think, basically, the residual Marxism residual socialism, as an

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:10.360
[Guest]: intellectually coherent and respectable doctrine will go away. There is still left. I think

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:14.600
[Guest]: it will go away. That gives me hope. Because as long as it exists, it's always a danger

02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:21.000
[Guest]: and a bad thing. I think in the economics area, either because of a crisis or whatever

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:29.280
[Guest]: reason, the philosophy of supporting markets and being market friendly, will willy nilly

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:36.440
[Guest]: reassert itself. I think Indian culture is thriving. On that score, I'm quite positive.

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:43.440
[Guest]: I think Indian social change is going along fairly okay lines. There are issues like Sabarimala

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:50.800
[Guest]: and so on, which kind of distract us. But in general, it is it is moving along the directions.

02:22:50.800 --> 02:23:02.400
[Guest]: Now what am I worried about? I think one worry is that we continue to not recognize, intellectually

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:09.320
[Guest]: at least, in sufficient numbers, the continuity in our history, particularly the importance

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:16.080
[Guest]: of the British Raj as an important, constructive, positive intervention in Indian history. If

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:22.480
[Guest]: we don't, then we run the risk of doing stupid things. And that is a big risk that worries

02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:27.600
[Guest]: me again. And I see it in our neighboring states. I see it in Myanmar. I see it in Sri

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:34.240
[Guest]: Lanka. I see it in Pakistan. I see it in all of the former colonies of the British in Africa.

02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.680
[Guest]: And Naipaul talks about it when he talks about mimic men. You know, what does he say? That's

02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:44.800
[Guest]: what he's talking about. The jettisoning of that is and it could happen. It could happen

02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:49.880
[Guest]: because there is so little understanding and so little defense of it. In fact, the most

02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:56.000
[Guest]: popular books recently in Indian history have been attacking Robert Clive and attacking

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:01.320
[Guest]: East India Company without, you know, and very popular, immensely popular among Indians,

02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:07.400
[Guest]: middle classes and upwardly middle class. That worries me. That's a big worry I have.

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:18.200
[Guest]: Then I do have a concern that which you expressed that, you know, essentially we have moved

02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:27.480
[Guest]: far ahead politically without moving sufficiently economically or socially. The same issues

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:35.680
[Guest]: that Rana Dey raised 120 years ago. Please let us not go for, you know, quick political

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:42.280
[Guest]: freedom without concomitant economic and social change. That is still the curse that we are

02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:48.640
[Guest]: living with. And that means you never know. We could have some very strange and bizarre

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:57.840
[Guest]: political behavior. And we should always be very careful. The First Republic of India

02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:09.520
[Guest]: is 69 years old, yes. And, you know, it is very important that we collectively say, hey,

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:17.920
[Guest]: we want to be around in the same fashion more or less 69 years from now. And 1776 to 1860

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:25.200
[Guest]: was how many years? 84 years. A major crisis happened in the history of the other great

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.920
[Guest]: constitutional republic that we are aware of. So those these are dangerous times in

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:38.440
[Guest]: the history of any republic. We are no longer young. We're a middling, middle aged republic.

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:42.920
[Guest]: And middle age is when, you know, as you know, cholesterol and diabetes and all these things

02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:49.280
[Guest]: hit people. And that could be true for a society, too. So that gives me sleepless nights.

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.440
[Amit Varma]: On these wise words, Jerry, thank you so much for coming on the show. I learned a lot reading

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:58.640

[Unknown]: Advertising is dead. Yep, you heard me right. Advertising is dead. We're all in the content

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:58.720
[Unknown]: business now. Let's not call it news, TV, radio, etc, etc. It's all content. And we're

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:02.440
[Unknown]: in the middle of this weirdly exciting phase where all the borders and lines that have

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.200
[Unknown]: been drawn over decades has been swept away by this lovely thing called the internet.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.720
[Unknown]: We're a show where we don't dwell on just the stuff that is now but rather the wider
