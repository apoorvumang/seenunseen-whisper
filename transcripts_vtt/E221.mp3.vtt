00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
[Amit Varma]: Imagine if COVID-19 had hit the world a few centuries before it actually did.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.920
[Amit Varma]: Before we knew what a virus was, or an ACE2 receptor was, or what natural selection was.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.040
[Amit Varma]: A time when we couldn't treat any disease because we couldn't understand any disease.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.400
[Amit Varma]: A time when people considered themselves lucky to live till 30.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.320
[Amit Varma]: A time without ventilators or paracetamols.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.840
[Amit Varma]: As it happens, imagining that isn't all that hard because we've seen that picture.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.240
[Amit Varma]: The world has been struck by various pandemics in the past, and the accounts are horrific.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Chinmay Tumbe mentioned them in his fine book, Age of Pandemics, which I discussed with him

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.000
[Amit Varma]: in an earlier episode.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Writing about the plague in the 6th century, Chinmay wrote,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.320
[Amit Varma]: The demographic devastation in the Mediterranean world was stark, with records in multiple

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.520
[Amit Varma]: languages describing how thousands of people died in a single day, or how, as per one traveler,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.000
[Amit Varma]: corpses were lying in the fields and along the roadside and cattle wandering untended

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.440
[Amit Varma]: into the hills.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.880
[Amit Varma]: The historian Procopius described how the bodies came so fast that those digging the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.720
[Amit Varma]: trenches to bury them could not dig fast enough.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
[Amit Varma]: What to do with the bodies?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.840
[Amit Varma]: They climbed the towers of the fortifications where they were tore of the roofs and just

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.400
[Amit Varma]: piled in the bodies from there.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.120
[Amit Varma]: When plague struck again in the 14th century, in what is known as the infamous Black Death,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
[Amit Varma]: up to 50 million people are estimated to have died.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
[Amit Varma]: That included 35-60% of Europe.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
[Amit Varma]: Imagine that.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.720
[Amit Varma]: Half the people around you just gone.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.120
[Amit Varma]: As if it's the infinity wars.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.040
[Amit Varma]: Well, you're listening to this episode in the middle of the second wave in India, and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.840
[Amit Varma]: the world has been fighting COVID-19 for a year and still not won.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.320
[Amit Varma]: And yet it could have been far worse.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Here's the thing, our politicians have failed us, our bureaucrats have failed us, policy

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.680
[Amit Varma]: makers have failed us, the dysfunctional state stands exposed for what it is.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.280
[Amit Varma]: And in so many different ways, we have failed each other.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480
[Amit Varma]: But science has not failed us this time.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Unlike in pandemics of past times, we know what is happening.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.520
[Amit Varma]: We know what we do not know about it.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.840
[Amit Varma]: And we have made miraculous progress in coming up with the vaccines that we have.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Is it enough?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Of course not.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.160
[Amit Varma]: As my guest on today's show says, vaccines aren't enough, you need vaccinations.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.960
[Amit Varma]: If I may add to that, human knowledge is not enough.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
[Amit Varma]: You need human action.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.920
[Amit Varma]: There is a lot that is wrong with the world today.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.860
[Amit Varma]: But there is also a lot that can give us hope.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.320
[Amit Varma]: Science can give us hope.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.800
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral science.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.240
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhaluman.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.720
[Amit Varma]: My guest for today is Anirban Mahapatra, a scientist, science writer, and editor who's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.760
[Amit Varma]: just written a wonderful book called COVID-19, separating fact from fiction.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.840
[Amit Varma]: I first discovered Anirban on Twitter during this pandemic.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
[Amit Varma]: He tweets at the handle of at Bhalumanush and was one of the voices of reason during

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.900
[Amit Varma]: the last few months.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.720
[Amit Varma]: His book is much needed because it explains a complex subject in simple language from

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
[Amit Varma]: first principles.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.680
[Amit Varma]: For a layperson like me, it was a perfect way to go deep into the subject without having

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.960
[Amit Varma]: the sense that I had to work for it.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Anirban explains science so well that at moments, I felt like a child again, discovering new

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.240
[Amit Varma]: and wonderful things in wide-eyed wonder.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.060
[Amit Varma]: Now, this episode is actually like two episodes in one.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.520
[Amit Varma]: In the first half, we speak of Anirban's journey in the state of modern science and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.880
[Amit Varma]: academics and science writing and so on.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.120
[Amit Varma]: In the second half, we speak about COVID-19 itself, what the virus is, what it does, and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.920
[Amit Varma]: the different ways in which science is fighting it.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.960
[Amit Varma]: I love both halves of this conversation and I hope you do as well.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.920
[Amit Varma]: A quick note before we start, the day after I recorded this conversation, my father died

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
[Amit Varma]: of COVID-19.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
[Amit Varma]: He'd been admitted to hospital for other issues a couple of weeks before that and was

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.320
[Amit Varma]: fading in different ways.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.320
[Amit Varma]: He couldn't recognize me when I last met him.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.000
[Amit Varma]: He picked up COVID at the hospital and spent a few days in a COVID ICU.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.520
[Amit Varma]: We weren't allowed to meet him, obviously, but we were allowed one video call a day.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.960
[Amit Varma]: In those calls, he was unable to speak and we don't even know if he was in his senses.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And if he wasn't, that could have been a blessing because he was clearly in a lot of suffering.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.040
[Amit Varma]: To be honest, I haven't processed this yet.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.240
[Amit Varma]: It leads to bigger questions that no one can have an answer for.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240
[Amit Varma]: As Wittgenstein said, quote, what we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.360
[Amit Varma]: For everything else, though, there is science and rationality and those are what this episode

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.920
[Amit Varma]: celebrates.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to this conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.920
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive some games.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty and you love fine art, I have a win-win proposition

[Amit Varma]: Hi, thank you for having me today.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, the last few months, of course, have been very tough for the world, very tough

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.720
[Amit Varma]: for all of us.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.560
[Amit Varma]: If one is to look for silver linings, I think one of my silver linings is that I discovered

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560
[Amit Varma]: your work on Twitter.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.400
[Amit Varma]: I had no idea of anyone called Ad Bhalo Manoosh before, you know, COVID kind of stuck and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.340
[Amit Varma]: you obviously very quickly became one of the soundest sources on what's really going on

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.000
[Amit Varma]: during this period of time.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.880
[Amit Varma]: So now, you know, because I hardly know you at all, I just know you from your very scientific

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.760
[Amit Varma]: crisp factual tweets, I want to get to know a little more.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, tell me, you know, a bit about your childhood, where did you grow up?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760
[Guest]: What was that like?

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.160
[Guest]: Okay, so where to start?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.640
[Guest]: I was, my parents were both physicians.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.800
[Guest]: I say were because my father passed away six years ago.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.480
[Guest]: And my father came from a very small village at the Bengal-Odisha border, and when we say

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.440
[Guest]: to our children that we had to walk in the snow or so far to actually get to a school,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.040
[Guest]: in my father's case, he did have to walk from his village to get to his school.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.560
[Guest]: And from there, from that remote village where there was no electricity, there was no running

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.160
[Guest]: water, he went to medical college, and then from there to he did his post graduation,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.000
[Guest]: he did his MD from Chandigarh, and then his DM from Ames.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.080
[Guest]: My mother went to Calcutta Medical College.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.520
[Guest]: And she from there, she also went to Ames, and they were both doctors there.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.620
[Guest]: So I was born at Ames in New Delhi.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.200
[Guest]: And after that, my father was in the United States by both my parents were in the US for

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200
[Guest]: some time.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.360
[Guest]: So I went to school there for a little bit, and I came back to India.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.120
[Guest]: And then my formative years were actually mostly in India.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.160
[Guest]: So I when I came back to India, I learned to read and write in Bangla, I learned to

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.340
[Guest]: play cricket at a much later age than a lot of other people.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.600
[Guest]: And I went through school and then both my parents were like, okay, so we're doctors,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.500
[Guest]: it's basically almost inevitable that you will have to be a physician.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.680
[Guest]: But I figured out a little bit later on when I was with my father and sometimes even at

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.920
[Guest]: night because he when he moved back, he moved back to a small tertiary district town and

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.960
[Guest]: there weren't that many was a US trained board certified cardiologist and there weren't that

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.260
[Guest]: many physicians there at that time.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.680
[Guest]: And so in the middle of the night, sometimes I would have to go with him with the ECG machine

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.280
[Guest]: and help him with that.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.320
[Guest]: And I realized at that time that I was more into the research side of it, I wasn't going

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.800
[Guest]: to be a very good clinician, I just did not have that in me.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.160
[Guest]: And the other thing I realized is I really loved biology.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.760
[Guest]: And one of the things is that if you look into any life form on the planet right now,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.080
[Guest]: because it's had 4 billion years of evolution, there are some remarkable things about it,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.440
[Guest]: we just have to keep looking and be curious about it.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.960
[Guest]: So I did my bachelor's degree and my master's degree in India.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.680
[Guest]: And I got a very nice fellowship, a university fellowship to study microbiology at the Ohio

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.180
[Guest]: State University in the US.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.720
[Guest]: And I came over to the US.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.480
[Guest]: And I remember one of the first courses I took in the US.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.600
[Guest]: And I absolutely bombed it.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600
[Guest]: And that's because I didn't know how to learn anything.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.040
[Guest]: I had gone through the Indian system of basically picking up a lot of facts and trying to crack

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.600
[Guest]: exams.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.760
[Guest]: And so when I was taking this course, this was in the first semester, first quarter of

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.840
[Guest]: my PhD, and the professors, each professor was coming in, and they would just be presenting

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.160
[Guest]: a few papers of research relevant to their own work.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.720
[Guest]: I picked up all the facts in those papers.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.260
[Guest]: But when the exam actually came, they didn't ask any other facts, they wanted me to synthesize

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:50.200
[Guest]: what was in those papers to be able to come up with completely independent and open-ended

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.400
[Guest]: answers to questions that they had that were tangentially related to those papers.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.240
[Guest]: And I really did poorly in that first exam.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.800
[Guest]: But after that, I figured out that this is how I was, and this is what I was thinking

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.960
[Guest]: all along is that I was always sort of a rebellious person who asked like, the how and the why.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.400
[Guest]: And this and so then I took like a duck to water after that.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:20.840
[Guest]: And I did better after that, I was very fortunate to be able to get into a lab at the time that

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.880
[Guest]: they were doing really groundbreaking work.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:31.480
[Guest]: So the lab that I joined at Ohio State University, to do my PhD, they had at that time discovered

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.220
[Guest]: a new amino acid.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.920
[Guest]: So typically, as as most even high school students will be able to tell you, folks who

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.640
[Guest]: take biology that there are 20 amino acids that are inserted into proteins, and these

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.480
[Guest]: are coded in the genetic code.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.960
[Guest]: There are a few cases of a 21st amino acid, which had been discovered in 1986.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.400
[Guest]: When I joined the lab in 2001, the lab I joined, they had to back to back, well, they had two

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.340
[Guest]: science papers demonstrating the genetic encoding of the 22nd amino acid pyrolysine.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.120
[Guest]: And this was basically something that went into the textbooks, and it was discovered

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.760
[Guest]: as being equivalent of discovering a new particle in physics.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.400
[Guest]: And that sort of appealed to me.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.200
[Guest]: And that has sort of been my driving interest in science, is that it is not static.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.200
[Guest]: All along, we have been reading these textbooks that everything is as it has been, nothing

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.740
[Guest]: ever changes in science, the textbooks, the editions get updated, and we just memorize

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.120
[Guest]: those facts.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.720
[Guest]: But there was a great time to be in that lab.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.520
[Guest]: And I joined that lab, I had some very amazing friends that I worked with in that lab, got

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.720
[Guest]: a really great and challenging project.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.400
[Guest]: And the first paper, when we were getting it done, it was basically elucidating the

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.920
[Guest]: process by which that amino acid gets inserted into specific proteins.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.960
[Guest]: And we did all the experiments, we knew there was another group working on it as well.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.320
[Guest]: And we sent it into science as well, because the earlier papers had been in science.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.600
[Guest]: And they rejected the paper.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.400
[Guest]: They said, they gave us a very short amount of time and said the paper is, it looks good,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.440
[Guest]: but it's basically they sent us a standard of form rejection letter.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.720
[Guest]: And so we send it around in nature, we're saying we're not going to try anywhere else,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.000
[Guest]: we have confidence in our work, we're going to stay up to the high standard of the work

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.240
[Guest]: that we've done.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:37.440
[Guest]: And fortunately, they asked us to do a little bit more, we did a few additional experiments,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.120
[Guest]: but nature published it.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.840
[Guest]: And the funny thing is after when nature published that paper, science did a write up on that

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.920
[Guest]: same paper that we had published.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.120
[Guest]: So that was a really great opportunity for me.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.960
[Guest]: And that discovery that we made has some real world applications as well.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:04.840
[Guest]: Scientists are using it, using that system as a tool to insert new amino acids with different

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.920
[Guest]: structure and function as building blocks to increase the functional capability of different

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.080
[Guest]: proteins right now.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.360
[Guest]: And so after that, I had a few more really good papers.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.360
[Guest]: And then when the time came around to complete my PhD, I was like, okay, I'm going to go

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.040
[Guest]: the traditional route, I'm going to be a scientist.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:32.400
[Guest]: And I had a couple of very nice postdoc interviews done, I was ready to do a postdoc.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:40.640
[Guest]: And then all of a sudden, I saw this, this job ad for an assistant managing editor position

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.840
[Guest]: for a newish scientific journal in the field of chemical biology, which is using the tools

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.240
[Guest]: of chemistry and biochemistry to solve important problems in biology.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.200
[Guest]: And I looked at the job ad and it said, okay, at that time, it was like, I would be looking

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.080
[Guest]: at all the manuscripts that would be coming into the journal, working with the scientific

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:09.620
[Guest]: editors and deciding whether those manuscripts should go out to peer review, I would be writing

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:16.540
[Guest]: summaries of papers, I would be going to meetings and commissioning work.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:23.600
[Guest]: And then we were also doing podcasts at that time, interviews with authors in the, well,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.800
[Guest]: I say we, so what happened is I ultimately did apply for it.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.280
[Guest]: And I did get the job and I joined there, that's a little over a decade ago.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.480
[Guest]: And that was a very thrilling and intellectually rewarding experience for me there.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:45.840
[Guest]: As I started on working on a newish journal, a journal that is now fairly well known and

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:55.640
[Guest]: established and working with editors who were scientifically amazing and at the top of their

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:02.080
[Guest]: individual disciplines, but were also very, very kind to this kid who had just come out

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.440
[Guest]: of a lab and basically heard him out.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.040
[Guest]: So I do consider them my mentors.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.640
[Guest]: And so at that time I was working with some of my editors were Laura Kiesling, who's at

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.880
[Guest]: MIT and is one of the leaders in chemical biology.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.080
[Guest]: Jennifer Doudna was one of the editors I worked with at that time, and she won the Nobel prize

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.380
[Guest]: last year for her CRISPR-Cas system.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.240
[Guest]: She hadn't discovered CRISPR-Cas when I had joined.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:36.360
[Guest]: So I was actually, I know the history of that discovery and how that has moved on for genome

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.160
[Guest]: editing and the potential that that definitely has.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.160
[Guest]: And so when I was working on that one journal, I got involved in launching other journals.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.040
[Guest]: And the way that came about is like, basically my organization said, you have all these ideas

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.560
[Guest]: and we're looking to expand into new areas of science.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.280
[Guest]: Tell us about some of these ideas.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.440
[Guest]: And my first idea was we are looking at like multidisciplinary areas where we can bring

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.600
[Guest]: together different scientists from different fields.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.100
[Guest]: And neuroscience is definitely one of the next frontiers.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:18.520
[Guest]: And so I, a little over a decade ago now, I helped propose, write up and launch a neuroscience

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.280
[Guest]: journal that brought in some of the biology and the chemistry.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.720
[Guest]: And incidentally, I want to mention this because we were talking about COVID-19.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:35.480
[Guest]: One of the first descriptions or one of the first ideas of the loss of smell after COVID-19

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.080
[Guest]: was proposed by a couple of scientists based out of Pakistan who had written this perspective

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.280
[Guest]: in a journal that I had launched.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.860
[Guest]: So I was very, very thrilled by that.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.500
[Guest]: And this happened early on, I think around February or March of 2020.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.720
[Guest]: And so after that, I haven't looked back.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.480
[Guest]: I have been involved in launching other journals as well.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.400
[Guest]: I've launched a synthetic biology journal.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.400
[Guest]: So synthetic biology is basically using the tools and techniques of, of engineering to

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.560
[Guest]: biology and using cells as factories to produce products.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.280
[Guest]: So it's the, it's the next step of biotechnology.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.640
[Guest]: So I would say it's biotechnology 2.0 or 3.0.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.120
[Guest]: And so I helped launch that journal.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.480
[Guest]: I launched an infectious diseases journal.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.160
[Guest]: This was before the pandemic.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.240
[Guest]: And then I've moved on to other areas now where the portfolio of journals that I work

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:40.840
[Guest]: with include climate change, sustainable chemistry, energy, and material science, physical chemistry,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840
[Guest]: photonics.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.040
[Guest]: So I've moved.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.520
[Guest]: So one of the reasons I left the bench is because I was sort of very, very skilled and

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.440
[Guest]: I knew a lot about one very specific area of science and I wanted to become more of

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440
[Guest]: a generalist.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.560
[Guest]: And I think that that happened over, over time.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.800
[Guest]: As you mentioned, most people on Twitter don't know anything, any of this, because I kept

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.320
[Guest]: us very, very low profile and I didn't mix what I did at work with my tweets, which were

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:18.080
[Guest]: sometimes just philosophical musings and sometimes my travel and, and, and my experiments and

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.880
[Guest]: failed experiments in the kitchen.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.880
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.960
[Amit Varma]: So there is so much to unpack there and so many strands and thank God I have a notebook.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.520
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of taking notes of all the things I want to talk about.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.280
[Amit Varma]: But the first thing that kind of intrigued me was the love for biology, because I don't

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.560
[Amit Varma]: come across too many people who say that they love biology as a kid.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.480
[Amit Varma]: And this is obviously a function of the way that it's taught to us and all of that.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.720
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps, you know, your parents being doctors might have helped and all of that.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of my sort of big complaints about our education system, not just here,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.200
[Amit Varma]: but I think kind of everywhere is that, you know, many of the things we are taught, in

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.640
[Amit Varma]: fact, everything we are taught is potentially full of wonder.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.760
[Amit Varma]: Like I think about this most in the context of mathematics, that it's taught in such boring,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.800
[Amit Varma]: dull ways and people just turn away from it.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.720
[Amit Varma]: But actually, it's like so integral to our lives and explain so much and it's not even,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, difficult.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And I can see sort of a similar process with biology and I was sort of intrigued when you

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.040
[Amit Varma]: said that when you kind of took the first exam and that you as because you were in that

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.880
[Amit Varma]: rote learning kind of frame of mind, it didn't quite work out.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Some sort of wondering that, you know, this whole way of thinking like, like these days,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.020
[Amit Varma]: whenever I learn something new, I just first try to go back to first principles.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.360
[Amit Varma]: So in the sense, don't tell me the right way of doing anything, don't tell me the process

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.040
[Amit Varma]: by which one does something, I want to go back to first principles, think of it from

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.040
[Amit Varma]: there.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And then I can work a lot of the stuff out.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And then whatever I subsequently learn is kind of easy to understand.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that when I meet other people with this kind of approach, it strikes

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.080
[Amit Varma]: me that you can apply it to everything, right?

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And you've kind of spoken about how, you know, you begin in biology, but then you kind of

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.920
[Amit Varma]: spread out like this, you spoke about synthetic biology, where you're applying the principles

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.480
[Amit Varma]: of engineering to biology, which is fascinating to me, and you're bringing this other prism.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.620
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that there is, you know, a certain kind of person who does this, who'll,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, look at the first principles of everything, who'll, you know, and therefore

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.920
[Amit Varma]: for them, it's easy not to get trapped in the conventions of a particular field, but

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.680
[Amit Varma]: to go beyond and to, you know, apply other prisms, apply other methods, and it kind of

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.840
[Amit Varma]: broadens your thinking.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.280
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that many people, even many accomplished people sort of get trapped

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.040
[Amit Varma]: by the conventions of their sort of field.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.720
[Amit Varma]: So now that you've taken this interesting journey, whereby the nature of your work starting

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.160
[Amit Varma]: journals in all these different fields, you are constantly one interacting with all of

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.040
[Amit Varma]: these people, and to also sort of expanding your own knowledge and all of that, what sort

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.960
[Amit Varma]: of your sense of the ecosystem out there, like, are there many thinkers like you or

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.360
[Amit Varma]: is it kind of an exception?

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Do you wish there were more people who took a broader view of the science and at the same

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.840
[Amit Varma]: time, a deeper view than, you know, might be the case?

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Because I certainly see that, you know, in fields that I know a little bit about, like

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.240
[Amit Varma]: economics or whatever, that there will be people who are, you know, extremely accomplished,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.400
[Amit Varma]: but they're almost functioning within the bounds of what they have learned in an academic

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400
[Amit Varma]: sense.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.840
[Amit Varma]: And they're not just looking at the world around them and, you know, applying those

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.240
[Amit Varma]: principles to everything or taking insight from, you know, other methods.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.240
[Guest]: I think there are a lot of people who think like this, and I fervently believe that all

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:48.720
[Guest]: children grow up like this, that when they are very young, maybe before they have it

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.800
[Guest]: beaten out of them in school by teachers who say that this is the way that you have to

00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:00.200
[Guest]: do something, or do you know more than me, or you have to get good marks in an exam.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.000
[Guest]: I think even, and I really enjoy interacting with very young children.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.340
[Guest]: They ask some of the best questions, they do not have the same language.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.560
[Guest]: So you have to start from what you said, first principles, you cannot assume that they will

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.300
[Guest]: understand the jargon.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:26.600
[Guest]: They do not take anything for granted, or they won't, I mean, it's a simple question

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.320
[Guest]: of even asking, looking outside and saying, like, where did the moon come from?

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.140
[Guest]: And we see it so often.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.840
[Guest]: But it's not a question and it's not a question that we should discard or, or why does time

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.280
[Guest]: move in one direction is the things that after a certain amount of time, we start to take

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280
[Guest]: for granted.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.000
[Guest]: But I think all children have that sense of awe in that wonder.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: And I agree with you.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.440
[Guest]: I think children take to the basics of mathematics very, very early on, and then somehow because

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:03.840
[Guest]: of the process of which it is taught that and, and some children are told that they

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.160
[Guest]: are not good at it, and they have to do it a certain way that it just, it just gets lost

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.200
[Guest]: and it just gets beaten out of them.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.360
[Guest]: But overall, I think that was one of the reasons why I wanted to write this book.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.760
[Guest]: And for me, that was one of the challenges of writing this book is, and writing for the

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.920
[Guest]: public was, I will say, after having written perspectives, and editorials and papers for

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:37.040
[Guest]: scientists, it was much harder because there is no common language, I cannot use the language,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.800
[Guest]: the terse, precise way of writing that goes into a paper and assume that the reader will

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.160
[Guest]: be able to understand it.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:52.760
[Guest]: And so starting from first principle, and trying to develop a core set of ideas, was

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.360
[Guest]: at least for me, one of the driving principles for for writing this book.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.640
[Guest]: But as people get into their own disciplines, I have also noticed this, this is also true

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:11.560
[Guest]: of the various disciplines of biology or chemistry, they do not, there is very little crosstalk.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.560
[Guest]: And we do see it in in some other disciplines.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.840
[Guest]: And I think we did see a little bit of it during the pandemic with many people from

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.280
[Guest]: various disciplines coming together.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.280
[Guest]: But even then, that's not always the case.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.480
[Guest]: We had, just to give you one very, very relevant example with these variants, you know, the

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.680
[Guest]: first variant that came out of the UK was B.1.1.7.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: And at that point, when that first variant came out, the virologists are the people who

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.080
[Guest]: are looking at the viruses and at sort of a virus level and molecular level and at an

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.080
[Guest]: infectious level.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.560
[Guest]: The epidemiologists are looking at the spread and the trajectory of spread.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.320
[Guest]: The virologists were saying, okay, mutations happen all the time.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:07.240
[Guest]: Therefore, we do not think that this, this mutation is anything different, or that it

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240
[Guest]: spreads more.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.880
[Guest]: We have to show us in an animal model that this is, this is spreading more rapidly.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.880
[Guest]: And some virologists that I respect a lot, and have actually written textbooks at that

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.960
[Guest]: point in early January, were not believing that this was a more infectious strain or

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: variant of the virus.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.040
[Guest]: However, epidemiologists who have their own way of looking at data, and they were finding

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.920
[Guest]: in the UK that this virus was actually now becoming more prevalent than the original

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:46.840
[Guest]: strain, the lineage from Wuhan and the other mutant that was there, the B614G mutant, which

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.780
[Guest]: was predominant at the time.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:55.240
[Guest]: And so that was sort of a different line of research, no less relevant, but it's just

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.840
[Guest]: because of the individual aspects of disciplines that they were not talking to each other.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:07.080
[Guest]: And I think we'll see more examples of this across all the disciplines, not just biology

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.440
[Guest]: or physics, but even, even economics.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.440
[Guest]: My former advisor used to say that if you need to build something, if you need a stool,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.900
[Guest]: a stool has to have three legs.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.080
[Guest]: So you need three, for any major discovery, you have to have at least three independent

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:32.520
[Guest]: ways of corroborating that idea or thought, especially if it is a paradigm shift.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:41.520
[Guest]: And so what often happens is that when we don't get these different aspects, or these

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.360
[Guest]: different groups working together, we don't see the same outcomes.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360
[Amit Varma]: That's so fascinating.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about, you know, the virologists here and the epidemiologists there reminds

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.920
[Amit Varma]: me of, you know, your first chapter where you speak about the parable of the elephant,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.880
[Amit Varma]: that you know, that old parable, different blind men touch different parts of an elephant

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.080
[Amit Varma]: and they see something different.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And of course, your point in the chapter was about the virus in general, and so many different

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.000
[Amit Varma]: aspects of this pandemic, but that, you know, seems to be a little there in science also.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, sort of three conceptual questions, not conceptual, but three questions around, you

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.520
[Amit Varma]: know, different themes.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And the first of them is this, like, when I teach this writing course that I teach,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:29.040
[Amit Varma]: I often get questions about academic writing, from people who are doing PhDs, or who have

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.800
[Amit Varma]: done PhDs and all of that.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, because so much of what I talk about the importance of clarity in writing

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.040
[Amit Varma]: and all that almost goes very counter to the kind of conventions that exist.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.760
[Amit Varma]: And I point them to this great essay by Agnes Gallard, who, by the way, is a force on Twitter,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.320
[Amit Varma]: I just love her account.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.320
[Amit Varma]: And Gallard had this fine essay, I think about three months ago, four months ago, about why

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.640
[Amit Varma]: academic writing is so turgid.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.200
[Amit Varma]: And her point there was that, look, someone's completed a PhD, they are on the sort of tenure

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.920
[Amit Varma]: track, what do you need to get tenure, you need to publish specific number of papers

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.080
[Amit Varma]: in these specific journals, and all those journals have their own conventions, their

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.520
[Amit Varma]: own insider lingo, their own ways of writing.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.320
[Amit Varma]: So you're optimizing for that, you're not optimizing for, say, a larger audience to

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.760
[Amit Varma]: get read more widely and all of that.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.080
[Amit Varma]: And then that language seeps into everything else you do, maybe including letters to your

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.880
[Amit Varma]: family or whatever, though I would hope not, and you stop thinking about it.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.240
[Amit Varma]: And I was chatting about this with another friend, Ruben Abraham recently, who told me

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.080
[Amit Varma]: about how, you know, this might be true for the social sciences, but in science, per se,

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.840
[Amit Varma]: the papers tend to be very well written, eight to 12 pages, because they're very crisp, and

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840
[Amit Varma]: they know what they're doing.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And they go from point A to point B, and all of that.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of more systematic.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.560
[Amit Varma]: So he gave me a sort of a counter view to this saying that, look, a lot of academic

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.640
[Amit Varma]: writing is turgid.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.200
[Amit Varma]: But there is a lot of joy in just reading a lot of science papers, because they kind

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.520
[Amit Varma]: of bug the trend.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:08.080
[Amit Varma]: So now as someone who started off on that academic path, who wrote a paper, which got,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, published in Nature and written about by here.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sort of outlook on all of this?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.180
[Amit Varma]: Like you have also therefore been an editor, you have received a lot of this turgid writing,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:25.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, is it incredibly commonplace, and therefore a problem, when you sort of suggest

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.040
[Amit Varma]: recommendations about, you know, what changes a writer should make or how they should work

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.040
[Amit Varma]: on their paper?

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.920
[Amit Varma]: Do you also talk about the writing or do you just talk about the science and obviously,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.560
[Amit Varma]: the science is more important because the content matters, but you also talk about the

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.600
[Amit Varma]: writing, is that an imperative?

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.560
[Amit Varma]: Are these journals sort of, like I understand that they will have specialized audiences,

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.940
[Amit Varma]: but would you also like to at least make them readable by the general public at large?

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.720
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sort of just kind of thinking aloud, because you seem to be the perfect person

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.160
[Amit Varma]: at the intersection of all of this, as both an academic, a writer, an editor, a thinker,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.800
[Amit Varma]: and you know, how do you look at this space?

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.960
[Guest]: Yeah, I can definitely provide my own perspective.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.680
[Guest]: And having worked on a number of a few dozen journals and having launched 10 scientific

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:18.120
[Guest]: journals myself, I am regularly reading papers, sometimes I tweet about them as well, I read

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:26.080
[Guest]: the papers in energy, material science, microbiology, chemistry, medicine, engineering, various

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080
[Guest]: fields.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:32.880
[Guest]: And it's not that I understand all of them, but I have developed a sense of getting at

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.880
[Guest]: the gist very easily.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.120
[Guest]: And in new fields, what I do is I usually try to do some background reading.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.080
[Guest]: And so some of the reviews are written in a different manner than some of the scientific

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080
[Guest]: papers.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:55.320
[Guest]: And that's because the review is more a very large perspective of the field as well.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.280
[Guest]: But a really good paper will tell you more than what the authors have actually written.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:09.360
[Guest]: It's very terse and turgid, as you say, but you will be able to from that paper, understand

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:15.880
[Guest]: what the background is, what the what the reason is, why they actually did the work,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:22.020
[Guest]: you will be able to figure out what else has been done and who else is doing that.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:27.560
[Guest]: You will be able to figure out what experiments they did and what those experiments show.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.920
[Guest]: And you will be able to figure out what the next steps are and and what others are doing.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:38.800
[Guest]: But a scientific paper typically is not read in the same way that something else will be

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.240
[Guest]: read where you, you read the abstract, then you read all the way through.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.120
[Guest]: The way that I usually read scientific paper is I read the abstract, then I look at the

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:54.440
[Guest]: figures, then I look at the discussion at the end, then I go back and it's sort of it's

00:31:54.440 --> 00:32:00.960
[Guest]: almost like it's almost like going like hypertext, because if I see something, then I look at

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.000
[Guest]: a reference, then I'll go down this rabbit hole of maybe even an hour following a certain

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.720
[Guest]: reference down that way.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720
[Guest]: But you are absolutely right.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.200
[Guest]: Titles matter, especially in this age of even of search engines, where people are finding

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.240
[Guest]: a lot of research from from titles of articles, the titles really, really matter.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.400
[Guest]: The abstract has to be very succinct and has to say what has been done.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.520
[Guest]: Lot of journals are now doing what are known as lay summaries, which show the which demonstrate

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.440
[Guest]: the significance for a broader audience.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.560
[Guest]: And I am very much in favor of these.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:44.780
[Guest]: So when I started off as a scientific editor, one of my jobs was to write these two paragraph

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.920
[Guest]: in this issue summaries for drug discovery and biology papers.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.860
[Guest]: And so I was going through them and writing those up.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:58.900
[Guest]: And we even asked a lot of authors to submit that with their submissions as well.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.960
[Guest]: There are other journals that do this, definitely.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.760
[Guest]: I think one of the reasons there is good science writing and there is bad science writing,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.880
[Guest]: undoubtedly.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:16.560
[Guest]: One of the reasons that science is written in this sort of peculiar way is that it is

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:24.040
[Guest]: very important to be accurate as opposed to be definitive in your pronouncements.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.840
[Guest]: You have to say what you're saying, but you also have to say these are the limitations.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.600
[Guest]: And that doesn't always make for a compelling read.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:40.040
[Guest]: And I think a lot of people who peddle in misinformation, and I've noticed this, they

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.400
[Guest]: have an easier time because they don't need nuance, right?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.120
[Guest]: They don't need to say that this is this particular case under these conditions.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.160
[Guest]: And this is the setting and this is how much immunity you have.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.160
[Guest]: But look at this, immunity is not just the antibodies.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.560
[Guest]: You have all these other parts of the cells and you have T cells and these other components.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.580
[Guest]: They can just say, well, drink my concoction and you'll never get coronavirus.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:12.040
[Guest]: And those things are the ones that has no nuance and it's sort of seductive in a way

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.920
[Guest]: in that they're very, I look at these WhatsApp forwards, they're actually, people should

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.740
[Guest]: be doing research on them because they are very simple in what they're trying to demonstrate.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.280
[Guest]: And this completely the antithesis of what you're saying.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.960
[Guest]: But at some point, scientists do have to become science communicators.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.720
[Guest]: They have to be able to, because scientists are a part of society.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:41.800
[Guest]: The problem is that there really is no incentive for a scientist.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.760
[Guest]: The reward structures in science are created in such a way that scientists are always talking

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.840
[Guest]: to other scientists.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.720
[Guest]: They are talking to administrators, they are trying to get grants.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:02.080
[Guest]: So by writing, for example, a popular science book, there is, a scientist is not going to

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.360
[Guest]: get tenure, is not going to get a promotion.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:12.480
[Guest]: So I think people that do it, do it out of a sense of compulsion and maybe they have

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.560
[Guest]: a little bit more free time.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.040
[Guest]: But you're absolutely right.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:23.520
[Guest]: There is a peculiar and precise way of writing in science that is almost like you have to

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.880
[Guest]: learn another language.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, the problem you've expressed is very resonant.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.880
[Amit Varma]: Because the thing is, you know, the reason these, like I'm also fascinated by all the

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880
[Amit Varma]: fake news that spreads.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that they get right in terms of craft is that they keep it simple.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.200
[Amit Varma]: We explain the world to ourselves by telling stories about it.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.520
[Amit Varma]: And simpler stories are far easier to process.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.120
[Amit Varma]: You don't, you know, you don't have to consider a hundred nuances and all of that.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.280
[Amit Varma]: And again, I couldn't agree with you more.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is, you know, in a different context, my friend Ajay Shah, who's a public

00:35:53.680 --> 00:36:00.040
[Amit Varma]: policy guy and a great economist is also sort of, he keeps, you know, lamenting that so

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.600
[Amit Varma]: many economists are on this sort of academic treadmill, where they are pursuing a set of

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.440
[Amit Varma]: different incentives.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.840
[Amit Varma]: And if they, you know, if the incentives were slightly more aligned to say the public good,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.160
[Amit Varma]: which comes from, you know, communicating your ideas clearly and well, getting them

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.280
[Amit Varma]: out there, doing research that actually goes in those directions, rather than whatever

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.680
[Amit Varma]: might be fashionable in academics at the moment, perhaps the world would be a better place.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing about that I loved about your book is that it's like, I don't want to embarrass

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.400
[Amit Varma]: you with praise, but I thought it's just outstanding in terms of popular science writing, because

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.200
[Amit Varma]: you simplify everything so much, like not in a way of making it simplistic, but in a

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:46.080
[Amit Varma]: way of making it easy to understand in clear language, like a schoolboy with a lot of questions

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.120
[Amit Varma]: could get a lot of his questions answered through this book, without having a problem

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120
[Amit Varma]: with it.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, this process of clear writing, I want to ask you a little bit about that, you know,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.360
[Amit Varma]: a few weeks ago, Krish Ashok did an episode with me where he spoke about the pyramid of

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.080
[Amit Varma]: learning, like, how do you learn something the best, like somebody says something to

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you, you learn it one way, you read something, you learn it at a different depth, but the

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.520
[Amit Varma]: deepest way of learning is to teach something. And in a sense, trying to write clearly for

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:22.080
[Amit Varma]: a mass audience is a form of teaching. And another thing that you know, Orwell had first

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.560
[Amit Varma]: brought about, and I keep talking about in my writing classes, a link between clear thinking

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.160
[Amit Varma]: and clear writing, and how it's a two way link, like, obviously, for a clear thinker,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.720
[Amit Varma]: you're more likely to write clearly. But if you are forcing yourself to write clearly

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.560
[Amit Varma]: about a subject, then you have to force yourself to think deeply about it. Because then you

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.880
[Amit Varma]: cannot take cover in jargon or insider lingo, or, you know, obfuscatory abstract language,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.960
[Amit Varma]: you have to get concrete, you have to explain everything in kind of simple terms, which

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, you've done repeatedly through the book, you know, I just noted down so many

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.320
[Amit Varma]: of your quotes, like proteins being like origami, or your chapter on concepts where you've spoken

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:05.320
[Amit Varma]: about the importance of shape, you quoted Carl Sagan, talking about apple pie, which

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.480
[Amit Varma]: I'll come to. And all of this is just utterly sort of delightful. So and nobody starts off

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.120
[Amit Varma]: a clear writer, right? It takes a lot of work. I mean, another thing, you know, an aside

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.320
[Amit Varma]: for my listeners would be that I believe writing is one of those things which you don't need

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.040
[Amit Varma]: any inherent quality. Everybody can be a great writer. It's just a question of making the

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.800
[Amit Varma]: effort. It's not like cricket that there's a certain hand-eye coordination that is natural

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:36.280
[Amit Varma]: or bowlers need fast twitch muscles or whatever. Everybody can learn to be a great writer period.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.960
[Amit Varma]: So and everybody starts off bad, obviously, tell me about your journey as a writer, you

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:48.480
[Amit Varma]: know, thinking about how to make complex subjects easily understandable to a lay audience. And

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.440
[Amit Varma]: I feel that this must have been so much harder for you. Because in the environment that you're

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.960
[Amit Varma]: in, where you're reading turgid paper after turgid paper submitted by academics and my

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.680
[Amit Varma]: apologies to academics, I don't mean to say they're all like this, but relatively, certainly.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.040
[Amit Varma]: What was your journey discovering your kind of writing voice? What were your role models?

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.480
[Amit Varma]: What was your journey? What was it like? Tell me a bit about that.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: Well, first of all, thank you so much for the praise. It is slightly embarrassing. But

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.120
[Guest]: also, I have to tell you this, now that you mentioned it. One of the most puzzling but

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:32.920
[Guest]: also in a backhanded way, rewarding messages I got was from my sister. So she's an engineer.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:39.160
[Guest]: And she sent me a message after she read the book. And it was like, Wow, Dada, you wrote

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.080
[Guest]: a science book that's not like a science book at all. And it's sort of a backhanded way

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:51.520
[Guest]: of saying like, reminding me of all the horrible textbooks that I read. And I was like, Okay,

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.480
[Guest]: she's an engineer, but I really know where she's coming from with that. And but because

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.160
[Guest]: she's a sister, it cannot be sort of a direct phrase, there has to be like this, this sense

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:06.960
[Guest]: of like, how did you even do this? I, I underestimated you. But well, thank you so much for that.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:12.840
[Guest]: I will say that one of the things is that basically, I did think a lot about the analogies

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:19.640
[Guest]: to use. And, and for me, I am a little bit, I like to think, obviously, mathematically,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:26.720
[Guest]: but I'm also a visual thinker. And sometimes breaking down these, these concepts into into

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:35.280
[Guest]: visual pieces is very, very helpful. Fortunately, obviously, I can't embed a YouTube video into

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:42.360
[Guest]: a book. But fortunately, the process of infection is such and the process of how the immune

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:50.600
[Guest]: system responds, and how disease develops. And that whole cycle is such that you can

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:57.320
[Guest]: sit down and basically visualize it. And so that took me a while though, as you mentioned,

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.200
[Guest]: each individual part of that is one sentence in that book might actually be someone's science

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:08.880
[Guest]: paper or nature paper, or even some some major observation that it took them a while to do.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.320
[Guest]: But pieced together, if you just break it down, as you mentioned early on into the individual

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.720
[Guest]: parts of, okay, how, first of all, starting from how big is the virus? How big is the

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.060
[Guest]: cell? What does it need to do to actually get inside the body? I mean, there are millions

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.920
[Guest]: of viruses and you starting back and saying, why are there only 220 viruses that infect

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.480
[Guest]: the human body? I mean, we always say, okay, viruses, they're, they're harming us. But

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.120
[Guest]: there, among the vast number of viruses, there are only a few. So there is something special

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.960
[Guest]: about this virus compared to other viruses. And then taking it to the next step of trying

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:52.240
[Guest]: to visualize those processes, for me, at least, was very helpful. As far as right, the actual

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.440
[Guest]: writing process itself, you are absolutely right, it was iterative. And it was iterative

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:05.160
[Guest]: in the sense of also that the data was changing. I went through multiple drafts, this was not

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:13.360
[Guest]: a static. This was not a static subject where I could go through a research phase and collect

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.480
[Guest]: all the papers and then sit down in my room and then go through a writing phase. This

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.400
[Guest]: was a project where I was doing the research and the writing simultaneously. And so I went

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:32.840
[Guest]: through many drafts of writing this. But whenever I was reading a paper, apart from annotating

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:40.280
[Guest]: it and marking it up, what I was also doing is I would write a summary of that paper.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.340
[Guest]: And then after I wrote that summary, I would come back to it asking myself, why would somebody

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.520
[Guest]: who is not a scientist be interested in this? What would they actually get out of it that

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:58.400
[Guest]: would be relevant to the bigger picture of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19? And often what would

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:04.720
[Guest]: happen is that then that summary, which was two paragraphs, would then be condensed into

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.200
[Guest]: maybe two sentences. And then after that, I would start to expand that because you don't

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:17.680
[Guest]: also want to leave them with basically without any particular context or any perspective

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.120
[Guest]: of what this might mean. So I don't know how successful I was, but that was the process

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:28.480
[Guest]: that I had to use. And then integrating it together. I also, as you probably have noticed,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.140
[Guest]: when I wrote the book, I also had a framework of basically systematically deciding what

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.520
[Guest]: each of these chapters would be and breaking it down into that. And that was very, very

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:45.440
[Guest]: helpful to have those specific buckets. And so that I didn't go off in a way that I would

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.600
[Guest]: if I had been doing another form of writing such as poetry or creative writing.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.880
[Amit Varma]: And did those buckets come at the start? Like, did you sit down at the start and first make

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.800
[Amit Varma]: the structure and then say, I'll go according to the structure? Or does it kind of evolve

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.160
[Guest]: as it goes along?

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:08.720
[Guest]: That evolved. I had a little bit of a sense of what I wanted to write. But when I was

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:15.920
[Guest]: first thinking about this project, I did not know the final shape of what this book would

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:23.260
[Guest]: actually be. And I have to thank my publishers for for putting up with me and for letting

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:30.240
[Guest]: me hand in a book that was slightly different or maybe significantly different from the

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.280
[Amit Varma]: proposal that I wrote.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Another crazy thing that kind of strikes me about it is like you correctly said, everything

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.680
[Amit Varma]: is changing while you're writing, right? So people often speak of journalism as the first

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.760
[Amit Varma]: draft of history, which, you know, has its dangers as well. And while you're writing

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:50.080
[Amit Varma]: this book, in a sense, it is not a definitive book of everything that the COVID-19 is about,

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.160
[Amit Varma]: because we are still learning so much about it. We are in a sense, you know, in a fog

00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:00.040
[Amit Varma]: of war situation, where there are so many things that we don't know. So is that something

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.440
[Amit Varma]: that kind of worried you? Or I mean, for the majority of the book, of course, you've looked

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.880
[Amit Varma]: at basic concepts and first principles and just kind of explained everything from scratch.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've, you know, there's nothing in it that is in a sense going to be falsified,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.280
[Amit Varma]: so to say, you've, you know, but it can provide a lay reader a bedrock of understanding exactly

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.120
[Amit Varma]: what is going on, which is what is so good about it. But how do you how do you then in

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:32.440
[Amit Varma]: the in the process of writing? Is there a point and this is relevant, not just to the

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.160
[Amit Varma]: knowledge that you're putting in the book, but also in the in terms of crafting the writing

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.520
[Amit Varma]: itself, that does there come a point where you say that, listen, I'm not totally happy,

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.160
[Amit Varma]: but I have to let it go now. Because I'm guessing that, you know, complete satisfaction with

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:50.720
[Amit Varma]: whatever is there is kind of impossible, right? So what was that like for you? Did you did

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.640
[Amit Varma]: you have imposter syndrome? Did you did you think that, you know, can I do this? What

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640
[Guest]: was that like?

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:04.680
[Guest]: So one thing I did do will say is that it is important to have this sense of epistemic

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:11.960
[Guest]: humility that in a pandemic, you cannot know every single aspect of what is going on. And

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:17.720
[Guest]: this is why it was a lot of work, but it was helpful to actually have references and notes

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:24.080
[Guest]: in the back of the book where I could reference the experts and say, this particular sentence

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.160
[Guest]: or this particular idea, which is prevalent at the time is not an idea that I have come

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.600
[Guest]: up with, because I think a book, maybe if I write fiction in the future, that I will

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.360
[Guest]: come up with something more imaginative, but a book on public health during a pandemic

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:46.280
[Guest]: is not a time for significant independent theories or unsubstantiated ideas. So all

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.840
[Guest]: of those chapters, I'm not an expert, I want to stress again, that I'm not an expert, I

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:59.560
[Guest]: relied on my ability to translate the science and to condense it. But all of those aspects

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:06.720
[Guest]: are cited in the back and people can use that as a jumping off point, as you mentioned,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.520
[Guest]: after they have a sense of the broader landscape. So I did not want it to be this scientific

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:22.040
[Guest]: document or this monograph at all. As far as leaving it at a certain point, yes, there

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:29.800
[Guest]: were aspects that obviously, I could have pursued further. And we don't have the answers

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.400
[Guest]: to that. One thing you will notice about the book is I've always said, this is what we

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.440
[Guest]: don't know. And I've used that as to the best of my ability to say, this information is

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.160
[Guest]: unknown at this point of time, it may take us six months, it may take us years to look

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:51.040
[Guest]: into this. And that varied from some very contentious issues, such as the lockdown,

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:58.240
[Guest]: to prior immunity, to the various, the extreme heterogeneity of people who are getting very

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:05.040
[Guest]: sick to people who are having asymptomatic infections, to long COVID, or post COVID syndrome,

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:10.840
[Guest]: which affects different people in different ways. And so I left it at that with a sense

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.600
[Guest]: of being comfortable with saying that, I don't know this, nobody knows definitively at this

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:23.800
[Guest]: time. It was a good stopping off point in that I knew about the vaccines. So I think

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:31.600
[Guest]: this, I would have felt a little bit bad, if the book had been written, and it had come

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:38.680
[Guest]: out before we had approved vaccines. I also knew about the UK variant and that it was

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.580
[Guest]: more infectious. I had not foreseen or didn't know about the other variants. And perhaps

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:51.160
[Guest]: that can be sort of an additional appendix, or a 23rd chapter. But I did know that the

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:57.080
[Guest]: variant was coming and that it had been shown that it was more infectious. So at that point,

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:05.640
[Guest]: I did have that sense of what was going to be happening in the next few months, at least.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.480
[Guest]: What this book has absolutely avoided is going into the daily numbers and into the daily

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.760
[Guest]: curves. And I did that for a number of reasons. One is that it reduces the shelf life of a

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:23.000
[Guest]: book of this nature. The second aspect of this is that it takes us away from the sense

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.720
[Guest]: of humility. Because even when I was writing this book, I said during the first wave, there

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.060
[Guest]: were some countries that had fared well. One of them was Germany. And Germany got absolutely

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.560
[Guest]: devastated during the winter because of some measures that they didn't take, but also because

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:48.480
[Guest]: of the variant strains as well. And then I was very careful in not making any precise

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:55.240
[Guest]: prognostications about the trajectory of the pandemic in India and what was happening.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.960
[Guest]: Because I wasn't riding the wave and I didn't want to ride the wave of saying, well, the

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:08.240
[Guest]: cases went down because Indians have immunity. And then regretting a few months later, well,

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:14.560
[Guest]: I was wrong here, the cases went up. And so I tried to avoid that as much as possible.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:22.480
[Guest]: With all of that said, because I'm in a field where the shelf life of documents and of papers

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:28.280
[Guest]: is very short to begin with, this is something that we are all resigned to. I know that when

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.980
[Guest]: I wrote my thesis, when I write papers, when any one of us writes anything, it is going

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:39.600
[Guest]: to get outdated pretty soon. So we try to do our best. The book allowed me an opportunity

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.080
[Guest]: to, as you pointed out, and thank you for saying that, try to bring in the broader concepts,

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.220
[Guest]: which I hope will not be obsolete in the near future.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:54.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just inform our listeners at this point that this is actually being recorded

00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:01.080
[Amit Varma]: on April 13th, 2021, though it is April 12th where Anirwan is. So do consider that the

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.400
[Amit Varma]: miracle that I am asking my questions on the 13th and he is answering them on the 12th,

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.700
[Amit Varma]: the miracles of science, perhaps. I'm struck by this phrase that you used, epistemic humility,

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.120
[Amit Varma]: because I used it in a prior episode. And then one of my guests used it in a previous

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.520
[Amit Varma]: episode, in an episode after that, when we were talking about COVID, in fact, the policy

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.840
[Amit Varma]: responses to it. And someone wrote into me saying, hey, Amit, you say never use jargon,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:31.560
[Amit Varma]: why have you? But yeah, but in a sense, you know, to not to cut the jargon part of it,

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.560
[Amit Varma]: you can say it's just about being humble about what you know. And that's kind of what I want

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:42.020
[Amit Varma]: to ask you about, because it strikes me that there is, if you're achieving excellence in

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:48.140
[Amit Varma]: anything, you know, there is this balance to be struck between having confidence in

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:52.400
[Amit Varma]: what you are, what you know, and what you're capable of, and also having the humility to

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.160
[Amit Varma]: learn more. And, you know, an example I often give is, you know, people think Virat Kohli

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:06.160
[Amit Varma]: is like a very aggro kind of person, arrogant and full of himself. But to get to the level

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:11.200
[Amit Varma]: where he is, he must have spent 1000s of hours in the nets focusing on what he's doing wrong.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.640
[Amit Varma]: So there is an inbuilt humility in that process. Now, in the world of science, also, it strikes

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.040
[Amit Varma]: me that if you're too humble, if you think that I don't know anything, everything could

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.840
[Amit Varma]: be wrong, it possibly becomes difficult to proceed. So you have to have a certain amount

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:30.680
[Amit Varma]: of belief in your knowledge and the value of the work you are doing, and so on and so

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.600
[Amit Varma]: forth. But at the same time, there also has to be a certain amount of humility, like what

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.960
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out in the clash between or the argument between the virologists and the epidemiologists.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, there has to be that humility and that openness. And you can't just sit

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:51.480
[Amit Varma]: back and say that, no, this is my field, who are these other lay people to, you know, comment

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.720
[Amit Varma]: on it and, you know, make Twitter threads about something that they haven't actually

00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:04.760
[Amit Varma]: received training in. So, given that you are someone who's obviously, due to the work due

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.640
[Amit Varma]: to being an editor, due to being a science writer, or, you know, that's inbuilt in you.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But when you look at all these people who are submitting papers, people who are working

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:18.600
[Amit Varma]: on the cutting edge of science, how does that come in? What is the level of humility you

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:25.800
[Amit Varma]: think that we need? You know, is this a trap that people fall into, of not having adequate

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.600
[Amit Varma]: humility? What's your take on this?

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:36.680
[Guest]: I think scientists as a group, fill all sorts, you will find people who are absolutely humble

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.280
[Guest]: and down to earth and will, and these are even Nobel Prize winners that you can approach

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.960
[Guest]: them and you can talk to them and they will have coffee with you and they will discuss

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:52.440
[Guest]: the science with you. And scientists in general, the one thing is they'll do love to talk about

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.680
[Guest]: their work with anyone. I think that is basically the hook to if you're talking to anyone from

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.840
[Guest]: someone starting off with their lab or someone who has won the Nobel Prize. If you just ask

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:09.480
[Guest]: them what they do and why they do it, they can go on for a really long time. But there

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.640
[Guest]: are people who are very good at, and at a certain extent, you are absolutely right.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:24.760
[Guest]: You have to play up the value of your work. And sometimes that is actually exaggerated.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:30.240
[Guest]: The thing is other scientists are, after a while, very good at picking up on those exaggerations.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.760
[Guest]: I don't think the public always is, and sometimes the press can even be taken for a ride. So

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:41.880
[Guest]: I don't blame the press for this when a scientist said, well, and we see a lot of this in the

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:48.960
[Guest]: media as well, when someone says, well, I have now created this molecule in my lab and

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.800
[Guest]: it works really well against cancer cells. And so it gets, and they get taken in by that.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:04.520
[Guest]: But someone in the field would also know that the path to drugs is treacherous. Very few

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:09.440
[Guest]: promising drugs actually make it down that path to actually become drugs that become

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:16.000
[Guest]: approved and used in humans. And so some people are very, very good about exploiting that

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.160
[Guest]: and using that to their benefit. But you're right. So everyone has to do it to a certain

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.400
[Guest]: extent. Complete humility doesn't get you anywhere. I mean, nobody knows what you're

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:36.400
[Guest]: doing and there has to be a certain amount of excitement also conveyed to the audience.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.880
[Guest]: And that has to come across both in the way that scientists speak, but also in the way

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:49.640
[Guest]: that they write. Otherwise, it's just a collection of facts. And so they may seem like dry stories,

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:55.040
[Guest]: but a lot of the research articles are actually presented in the form of a narrative. It's

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.560
[Guest]: a different form of a narrative, but it is a narrative.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:04.120
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned the press and I'm reminded of this phrase that Michael Crichton coined

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.840
[Amit Varma]: in honor of his friend Murray Gell-Mann, you know, is Gell-Mann amnesia, which basically

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.920
[Amit Varma]: means that, you know, if you're the specialist in a field and you read something in a general

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.440
[Amit Varma]: newspaper on your subject, you realize that is bullshit, that the guy just doesn't get

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.400
[Amit Varma]: it. But when you read the rest of the newspaper, you take it as gospel because, hey, it's in

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.720
[Amit Varma]: a big newspaper. Now, you know, journalists tend to be generalists and that's more true

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:34.160
[Amit Varma]: today than ever, you know, Prem Panikkar in a recent episode with me spoke about how this

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:39.600
[Amit Varma]: is one of the things where Indian journalism is just in a horrendous place that you have

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.120
[Amit Varma]: cost cutting. It's always journalists who are let go. And if you have less journalists,

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.160
[Amit Varma]: you have more journalists. If you have, sorry, if you have less journalists, you have more

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.400
[Amit Varma]: generalists and you know, so your science beat reporter with a few notable exceptions

00:56:53.400 --> 00:57:01.240
[Amit Varma]: won't necessarily be someone who really gets it. And that can actually harm, you know,

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:08.480
[Amit Varma]: how the people sort of understand science. So a dual question here. One is that, is this

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.040
[Amit Varma]: a big problem and are there ways around it? And the other question is that what technology

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:20.920
[Amit Varma]: has run in the last 20 years is that any specialist can go out there and put, you know, her views

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.000
[Amit Varma]: out there. You can start a blog, you can start a newsletter, you can make YouTube videos,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.280
[Amit Varma]: all the technology is within our reach. So you don't have these gatekeepers anymore,

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.600
[Amit Varma]: anyone can communicate. Of course, the gatekeepers fulfill a useful function of being a filter

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:40.400
[Amit Varma]: for quality. But you could argue that water finds its own level in any case. So, you know,

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.600
[Amit Varma]: whether you're on YouTube or blogging, ultimately, the quality of your work will determine the

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.720
[Amit Varma]: kind of credibility that you have. So there is this dual thing where, you know, journalism

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.960
[Amit Varma]: and I find and I find that that this is inevitably true. Whenever I read journalism about a subject,

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:02.280
[Amit Varma]: I know something about I am like WTF is this, you know, and but at the same time, what I

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:09.560
[Amit Varma]: am heartened by is that a lot of people who are either specialists or are sort of passionate

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:14.560
[Amit Varma]: about a subject are going out making their own content, all of that. So, you know, in

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:19.120
[Amit Varma]: the broader context of bringing science to the people of sort of popularizing all of

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.480
[Amit Varma]: this, what do you think? What's the ecosystem like? How is this playing out?

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:29.520
[Guest]: This is a very good question. And I think I want to say that despite some of the challenges,

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:35.800
[Guest]: many journalists during the pandemic, despite the constraints and the lack of information

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.560
[Guest]: and knowledge, have done a tremendous job. And there are some Indian journalists as well

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:47.200
[Guest]: who have even in the midst of even when the transparency hasn't been 100%, they have tried

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:53.680
[Guest]: to get the best information. And so I do want to applaud them for for what they've done.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:59.520
[Guest]: As you mentioned, we all have our narrow focuses. And I can speak to what happens in in science

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.500
[Guest]: and in science journalism. And I think the first thing that has to happen is that people

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:09.960
[Guest]: need to be fine with with paying for good content. I mean, that's that's essentially

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:17.680
[Guest]: where it starts. Good journalism takes time, it takes money, and it takes it's a person's

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.360
[Guest]: profession. And so we have to be fine with paying for it. And then once we pay for it,

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:28.800
[Guest]: we have to be fine with investing in those organizations. And in those journalists, I

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.760
[Guest]: think if newsrooms are getting cut, and if newspapers are worried about about their science

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.440
[Guest]: pages, then that's going to have an effect despite regardless of everything else, that's

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:46.680
[Guest]: definitely going to have an effect. The other thing is that science takes time to get answers.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.960
[Guest]: And if sometimes if someone has a deadline that they have to get something out, that

00:59:50.960 --> 01:00:02.800
[Guest]: is 500, 600 words, by by 4pm, or 9pm, then it becomes very difficult to get a full story

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:09.480
[Guest]: to be able to do that background reading and to get that research done. And so often what

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.760
[Guest]: happens is that we see results that are presented uncritically without the broader picture,

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:24.320
[Guest]: the broader framework of of what actually happened there. So often, it is just a rehash

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.840
[Guest]: of the press release, and then a bunch of quotes from different people. And it's sort

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:37.120
[Guest]: of this drip drip system of getting news out that doesn't put the picture in a bigger context.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.960
[Guest]: I would also say that journalists often strive for balance. And balance isn't always necessarily

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:50.360
[Guest]: a necessarily a good thing if we're talking about topics like deforestation, or climate

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:58.880
[Guest]: change or pollution, or, or air pollution, or groundwater being polluted. And you bring

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:05.040
[Guest]: in all the scientists on one side, and then you bring in either the person who's polluting,

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:12.120
[Guest]: or you bring in all the people who believe or have data that backs up climate change,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:17.280
[Guest]: anthropogenic climate change, and then you bring in industry interests on the other side.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.640
[Guest]: That's not balance. And so putting what happens is if you put both sets of quotes together,

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.880
[Guest]: then it looks like that it's balanced. But I think journalists have to be reporters have

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:34.040
[Guest]: to be fine with moving away from that sense of balance, with that sense of reporting everything

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:42.160
[Guest]: as a as a short piece of something and trying to instead bring it into a framework of putting

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.840
[Guest]: more context into it. But all of that requires money.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, there's that old thing that journalists say that, you know, if you're a journalist,

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and one person tells you it's raining, and the other person tells you it isn't raining,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.360
[Amit Varma]: your job isn't to report both of them, it is to go to the window and report what you

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.960
[Amit Varma]: see outside. And, you know, but this becomes difficult if you're a generalist, and you

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.120
[Amit Varma]: have to turn in a piece by four o'clock, because you don't possibly have the base of knowledge

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.600
[Amit Varma]: to be able to make those judgments yourself, which is why I think we kind of need more

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.840
[Amit Varma]: specialists. You know, speaking of journalists, you know, the outliers who have done a great

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.080
[Amit Varma]: job really stand out. I've loved the work of Zainab Tufekci, for example, during this

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: pandemic, I think some of her reporting has been outstanding. Before we actually get to

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.680
[Amit Varma]: your book, a few, a couple of more sort of questions about, you know, your personal processes

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.360
[Amit Varma]: and thinking and all of that. What do you do for knowledge management? Because you're

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.600
[Amit Varma]: taking in a lot of information, especially for this book, you know, it's written in very

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.920
[Amit Varma]: simple language, so it doesn't appear to, but it's packed with, you know, information

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.960
[Amit Varma]: and insight. What do you do for knowledge management are the particular apps that you

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: use? And in general, this is surely something that even outside the context of this book,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.760
[Amit Varma]: something that you must have kind of faced, you know, maybe in the context of productivity,

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.600
[Amit Varma]: but even otherwise, you must be reading so much. Are there some hacks or tips or processes

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
[Amit Varma]: that you've adopted?

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:11.600
[Guest]: Yeah, I read a lot. And even though the book has a few hundred references, I read over

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:19.040
[Guest]: 1000 papers, even just writing this book, 1000 scientific papers. And I would say, for

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.920
[Guest]: a time, I was reading all the major stories in Indian Express, Washington Post and the

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.720
[Guest]: New York Times, particularly during that lockdown phase, when there were a lot of reports coming

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:39.640
[Guest]: out. And, and I use Mendeley, which is a reference manager. And so what it has is it has this

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:47.040
[Guest]: web plugin, where when I go to the website of a publisher, scientific publisher, and

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:53.400
[Guest]: I see that, that paper, I can click on the PDF, and it will immediately download that

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:59.000
[Guest]: PDF and put it into the database. And then in the database, it's also a reference manager,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.480
[Guest]: it has all the references there. So I can see all of those papers, and later I can I

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:10.600
[Guest]: can read those, I read and annotate on my iPad. And I like to use the highlighter feature

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.560
[Guest]: to do that as well. I still sometimes take for the for the actual outlines of the chapters,

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:23.680
[Guest]: I use notebooks, I like to basically draw mind maps, and and do that, go through that

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:31.240
[Guest]: process for for doing that as well. So I would say those are the the main ways that I, I

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.960
[Guest]: decided, or I figured out how to do it. There are some really good accounts on Twitter that

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.760
[Guest]: are a good source of information in terms of so I did bookmark a certain number of tweets

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:52.800
[Guest]: of of people as well, to get some information. As far as my own Twitter account, I used it

01:04:52.800 --> 01:05:00.800
[Guest]: as as a test testing ground for seeing what people were interested in over the course

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.900
[Guest]: of the year, they didn't know I was writing a book, I hadn't decided at that point either.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:12.800
[Guest]: But how I was framing things, whether that was useful or not. And I did a couple of of

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.920
[Guest]: polls as well through the year, that definitely helped me out with that. One thing about the

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:25.760
[Guest]: coronavirus pandemic, I'll say is that almost all scientific publishers made their coronavirus

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:33.520
[Guest]: content free and outside of the paywall. And that was beneficial for someone like me. And

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.640
[Guest]: this didn't this wasn't only with respect to the scientific publishers, I do subscribe

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:44.600
[Guest]: to the New York Times and the Washington Post and Indian Express. But even they made the

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.120
[Guest]: US publishers made their coronavirus content free.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.760
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. And, you know, as this is still ongoing, and we're all searching for information,

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.040
[Amit Varma]: are there are there sort of which are the Twitter handles you said that you follow that

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:03.920
[Amit Varma]: you considered the best sources on this as it was unfolding? And also at a general level,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.560
[Amit Varma]: which are the best sources for understanding popular science, like in the context of economics,

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.120
[Amit Varma]: for example, you have that great blog Marginal Revolution, which is, you know, done such

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:21.140
[Amit Varma]: human service in, you know, popularizing the just the field in general. So let's say someone

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.920
[Amit Varma]: is interested in science, they want to learn more about it. Like after my friend Ruben

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.240
[Amit Varma]: Abraham told me about, you know, he sent me a bunch of science papers, which he's been

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.240
[Amit Varma]: reading over the last few weeks, which he really likes, and I was kind of struck by

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.000
[Amit Varma]: them. So let's say you're speaking to a layperson like me, I want to kind of know more about

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.560
[Amit Varma]: what's happening on the cutting edge of science, I want to know who to follow, and whose work

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.240
[Amit Varma]: is interesting. And, you know, are there blogs, are there Twitter handles? How does someone

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.920
[Amit Varma]: like me navigate this complex and messy field?

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.080
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a good question. I will first answer the first part of that about the during the

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.600
[Guest]: Coronavirus pandemic, certain people that I definitely would recommend following. One

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:11.560
[Guest]: of them is at Eric Topol. So Dr. Eric Topol, who is at the Scripps Research Institute,

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:18.200
[Guest]: and he is sort of a renaissance man of medicine. He is a cardiologist by training, but he's

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:27.800
[Guest]: been on top of the Coronavirus pandemic. His, his work, his tweets are mainly covering the

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:33.800
[Guest]: scientific articles. So some of it may be a little bit technical, but he covers all

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:40.440
[Guest]: the major outlets, nature, science, cell, and some of the other journals as well. Whatever

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:48.960
[Guest]: comes out, you will probably see some of the main conclusions in his, in his Twitter account,

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:55.560
[Guest]: in his Twitter feed. I also follow Angie Rasmussen. She's moving to, she's a professor moving

01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:02.160
[Guest]: to Saskatchewan in Canada now. She's a fantastic virologist, but she also has a no nonsense

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:09.480
[Guest]: way of presenting concepts in virology in a way that's very digestible to people. Natalie

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:16.520
[Guest]: Dean is a professor in Florida, and she's a bio statistician. And that is very, very

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:23.760
[Guest]: helpful to understand the statistical aspects and the mathematics beyond the, for example,

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:29.080
[Guest]: the efficacy trials and herd immunity and things like that. Mark Lipsitch is a professor

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.000
[Guest]: at Harvard Chan, and he is one of the leading epidemiologists who talked about the parameters

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.060
[Guest]: of the pandemic early on. Karl Bergstrom is at University of Washington. He's written

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:48.000
[Guest]: this book called Calling Bullshit with Jevin West. And that is about misinformation and

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.300
[Guest]: dealing with, with misinformation. And his Twitter account is a source of a lot of great

01:08:54.300 --> 01:09:01.480
[Guest]: wisdom regarding misinformation during the pandemic. Adam Kucharski is at, is in the

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:07.960
[Guest]: UK, I think at a School of Tropical Medicine, if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, and he has some

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.880
[Guest]: really good work. He's written the Rules of Contagion, which is a book written before

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:19.680
[Guest]: the pandemic, but it has some of the mathematical aspects of, of how to deal with pandemics

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:27.200
[Guest]: and the parameters of that. And there are some other accounts as well. Ed Yong, obviously,

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.560
[Guest]: Carl Zimmer, Helen Branswell, they are writing some absolutely top notch work as well. In

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:40.480
[Guest]: terms of following the science as it is coming out, I would say there are some really good

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:47.080
[Guest]: Twitter accounts. So there's a news account for Science Magazine and a news account for

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:54.460
[Guest]: Nature. The news articles in Science and Nature are definitely geared towards more of a lay

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:59.880
[Guest]: audience as opposed to the peer reviewed scientific research that gets published there. I also

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.820
[Guest]: get the Nature newsletter every day. It's a very nice newsletter that has a roundup

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:12.000
[Guest]: of all aspects of science in a very accessible manner, including, for example, the search

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.920
[Guest]: for life on, on Venus and the search for life on Mars and things like that. So it's, it

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:25.320
[Guest]: gives a broader perspective of that. For those who are interested in biology, at a slightly

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:31.760
[Guest]: deeper level, there is a magazine called The Scientist. And that covers a lot of in depth

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.340
[Guest]: articles in science as well. So but I think following some Twitter accounts and then getting

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:42.440
[Guest]: some newsletters is definitely very helpful in keeping up to date.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I'll put links to all of these in the show notes. And whichever ones of these

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm familiar with, I agree with completely. In fact, talking about Eric Topol, I produced

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.520
[Amit Varma]: a show also called Brave New World, which is an interview show hosted by Vasanth Dhar.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.880
[Amit Varma]: He had been a guest on the scene and the unseen a few weeks ago. And he does a show called

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.240
[Amit Varma]: Brave New World. And we had Eric Topol as a guest on there. So, you know, so Vasanth

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.600
[Amit Varma]: and Eric had a delightful conversation. This was episode four of Brave New World. The title

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.440
[Amit Varma]: of the episode is Human and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. And Eric's book Deep Medicine

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.080
[Amit Varma]: is also quite so eye opening in different ways, isn't it?

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.360
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. And this is the thing about Dr. Eric Topol that that absolutely amazes

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.380
[Guest]: me is that he goes from one day talking about about wearables for preventing heart disease

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:38.620
[Guest]: to the next day, having an opinion about on mass and an asymptomatic spread of COVID-19.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.880
[Guest]: So he has a deep and wide grasp of many aspects in medicine.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.240
[Amit Varma]: It's so incredible that it's now that we can have public intellectuals of this sort because

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.040
[Amit Varma]: technology makes it so possible for them to get their voice out to sort of, you know,

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.520
[Amit Varma]: build these sort of presences in people's lives using tech. So a couple of questions

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.000
[Amit Varma]: while we are, you know, before we actually get take a break and get to your book, who

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.320
[Amit Varma]: were your influences when it comes to science writing? You know, like when you sort of start

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.560
[Amit Varma]: thinking about the notion that science needs to be popularised that it cannot just be academics

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.280
[Amit Varma]: talking to each other. When you think about writing your own book, is there something

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.280
[Amit Varma]: that you're looking at as a model and saying, you know, this book nailed it or this is a

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of voice that I want and so on. So what was sort of influences in that sense? And

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.240
[Amit Varma]: they don't even have to be overt influences where, you know, you take a model from something

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.720
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, but which are the science books that you have loved reading as you have grown

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.960
[Amit Varma]: up? Or, you know, is there a book that kind of changed the way you think about the world

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.400
[Amit Varma]: or that caused that moment where you know, a light bulb goes on in your head and you

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.240
[Amit Varma]: see things differently?

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.320
[Guest]: One of my favourite science writers definitely is Carl Sagan. And I've quoted him, and I

01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:02.440
[Guest]: admire him deeply. And his way of connecting and bringing the social passion, the passion

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.720
[Guest]: for social justice into science and the broader picture is absolutely evident. And people,

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.320
[Guest]: when they talk about Carl Sagan, they talk about Cosmos. But the Demon Haunted World

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.360
[Guest]: is a much, much better and deeper book. Cosmos was a companion to a television show that

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.640
[Guest]: was that I came out, I believe came out in 79 or 80, whereas the Demon Haunted World

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:32.840
[Guest]: was much later and contained full length articles. So definitely, I like his work. I feel that

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:39.560
[Guest]: the physicists do a much better job in general than the biologists in conveying maybe because

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.520
[Guest]: their questions are grander on a grand on a much grander scale. So if you think about

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:51.880
[Guest]: like Brian Greene or Michio Kaku or Jim Al-Khalili, who wrote what I thought was the best science

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:57.040
[Guest]: book last year, which is The World According to Physics, has done a really, really good

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:05.080
[Guest]: job with respect to that. I read voraciously. So I read last year, I read about 100 books,

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:12.240
[Guest]: of which many of them were definitely science books. Michael Benton does a tremendous job

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.760
[Guest]: in talking about dinosaurs. And I think that's a topic that a lot of people are interested

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:26.880
[Guest]: in. So yeah, there are definitely a lot of people who do write well. In general, my observation

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.960
[Guest]: is that the physicists do a much better job than the biologists.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:36.760
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating. And you know, you mentioned Sagan and I love this quote from your book

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.480
[Amit Varma]: where you quote Sagan saying, quote, if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.600
[Amit Varma]: must first invent the universe, stop quote, which is such a fantastic quote and which

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.760
[Amit Varma]: applies to like just so many things, you know, it's beautiful. Now, my final question before

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.520
[Amit Varma]: the break and before we get to both the delightful subject of your book and the difficult subject

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:04.240
[Amit Varma]: of COVID-19, which is that through the process of writing this book, how have you changed?

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.800
[Amit Varma]: How has it changed you as a person, as a writer, as someone who thinks about the world, you

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.480
[Amit Varma]: know, because writing forces you not just to examine your subject that much more deeply,

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.240
[Amit Varma]: it also forces you to examine yourself, you know, and especially in these difficult times,

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.840
[Amit Varma]: I think there's a lot of self reflection everyone has kind of gone through, which for a writer

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.280
[Amit Varma]: can become explicit, because sometimes they're writing about it, sometimes they're not, maybe

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:33.120
[Amit Varma]: it's not even in the book, maybe it's in sort of the meditative tweets that you might put

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.840
[Amit Varma]: out once in a while. But through this period, through the last few months, when you've written

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:43.040
[Amit Varma]: this book, how have you kind of personally changed? How are you different from what you

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.760
[Amit Varma]: were say, you know, 15 months ago?

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I had never planned to write this book. This was I never thought that this would be

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.760
[Guest]: my first book. If I thought that I would be writing something I had actually thought that

01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:03.960
[Guest]: I would be writing perhaps fiction or in Bangla or meditative essays about about travel or

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.800
[Guest]: cooking or something of that nature. But when the pandemic struck, I felt and people were

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.720
[Guest]: asking me all these questions, I felt that there was because of my experience, I had

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.080
[Guest]: at least something that I could offer. And so I felt that it was a sense of obligation

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:26.040
[Guest]: that I had to write this. It was a very humbling experience, the entire pandemic, but the course

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:36.320
[Guest]: of writing. And, and I will say that I am now more attuned to myself and more. I think

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:42.160
[Guest]: I'm fine with saying I don't know, and I'm fine with more uncertainty now. I was more

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:49.200
[Guest]: certain about certain things at the start of the pandemic. And as and moving forward,

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.600
[Guest]: that has changed. I had started with the idea of writing a book that would be a mainly a

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.280
[Guest]: scientific book, but very early on, it became evident that that the science alone was not

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.640
[Guest]: going to determine the outcome of this pandemic, it's not going to determine the outcome of

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.960
[Guest]: any aspect of the major challenges that humans face today, including climate change or deforestation

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:22.200
[Guest]: or antimicrobial resistance. Science is probably one of the easier pieces. I mean, if we look

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.920
[Guest]: at the scientists worked hard, they got the vaccines created in time. But that is just

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:37.000
[Guest]: a small piece of of the larger tapestry of society and all the the the components that

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.360
[Guest]: go into this pandemic. And the other realization was that every single source of inequality

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:51.960
[Guest]: or of injustice that we had in our society was magnified during the pandemic. We like

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.440
[Guest]: to say that, okay, we are all in this together. I do not believe that now having gone through

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.840
[Guest]: this, we are not all in it together in the same way for someone like me, who was privileged

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.440
[Guest]: and I did get a sense of my own privilege of being able to actually stay at home and

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.520
[Guest]: write a book during a pandemic. I mean, that's immense privilege. And someone else who is

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:21.120
[Guest]: basically having a difficult time making his or her living. That is that is definitely

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:26.320
[Guest]: something that got magnified. And the other pieces of I mentioned some of these things

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.840
[Guest]: in the book is that we tell people to wash their hands. But how can we tell someone who

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.560
[Guest]: doesn't have clean water how to wash their hands with soap? How can we tell someone who

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:41.920
[Guest]: lives in the slums to socially distance? So we have to make our society more equitable.

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:49.480
[Guest]: And that was for me, one of the other observations. And then finally, a lot of the things that

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:57.640
[Guest]: I saw that I feared would happen, and they did happen because of this, this sense of

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:03.760
[Guest]: mistrust in science and this, this society that where we have built where experts are

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:09.440
[Guest]: often vilified. And this happened to a great extent in the United States where I currently

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.320
[Guest]: live. But it happened elsewhere as well, where we were the science was way ahead of what

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:21.080
[Guest]: people were doing. But people were still dying because they were not taking simple measures.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:27.040
[Guest]: I mean, wearing a mask became an ideological issue. That should be a public health matter.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.600
[Guest]: And we can go on and on about that. But I think overall, it was a very, very humbling

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:38.560
[Guest]: experience for me to see that and to see the disparities. I mentioned a couple of examples

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.120
[Guest]: in the book. One of them is in the part on the impact where I was talking about a large

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:52.440
[Guest]: fraction of the world is not going to get basic immunizations for diseases like measles.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.560
[Guest]: And on the other hand, there are privileged people in other parts of the world who are

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:03.720
[Guest]: using zoom and they don't like how they look on zoom. And they're going for plastic surgery.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.480
[Guest]: So just by putting these two facts together, you can see the dichotomy in society. Or even

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.120
[Guest]: during the lockdown, we had people who travel for miles and they didn't even have any food,

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:19.440
[Guest]: they had nothing to eat. And on the other hand, we there are people who are surreptitiously

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.560
[Guest]: getting onto golf courses because they needed to get their 18 holes of golf in during the

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:33.200
[Guest]: pandemic. And so, yeah, it's just the scale of this was, was perhaps you don't see that

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.040
[Guest]: outside of a pandemic. But definitely it brought into sharp relief the divisions that we have

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.560
[Guest]: in our society. So it started off as a science book, it definitely didn't end that way. And

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.680
[Guest]: it's definitely changed me as well through the process of writing this.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.640
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's so fascinating. And I didn't know that people are getting plastic surgery, because

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:57.080
[Amit Varma]: of zoom. Like, you know, I haven't got a haircut in months, as you can see, but thankfully,

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.480
[Unknown]: the podcast is not a video thing. And that's something I've kind of been reflecting on

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.600
[Amit Varma]: as well. Like I've been extraordinarily fortunate during this pandemic to be able to do the

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.160
[Amit Varma]: things that I do to be able to you know, I've worked from home for 12-13 years. So it's

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.400
[Amit Varma]: not a big deal. Just shoot up my laptop, do what I do, it's completely okay. But especially

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.480
[Amit Varma]: in India, these differences are so stark. If you look at what happened to the migrant

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:23.800
[Amit Varma]: laborers, you know, they used to be stories during the partition that when trains from

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:28.600
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan would come into India, or vice versa, trains from India would go there, you know,

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.280
[Amit Varma]: the train would reach the final destination with everyone inside it dead because they

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.920
[Amit Varma]: had been killed. And I did an episode with Ruben Mascarenas on, you know, who did a lot

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:44.640
[Amit Varma]: of work feeding hungry people during the pandemic in Mumbai. And he spoke about how, you know,

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.440
[Amit Varma]: there were actually trains where they would put a migrant worker on a train and they would

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.280
[Amit Varma]: feed them in Mumbai, but everywhere else there's no one feeding them. And three days later,

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, the guy stumbles out on the platform wherever he is in his hometown and just dies,

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:02.280
[Amit Varma]: dies of starvation in in like the 21st century. So that's, that's just completely nuts. We

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.480
[Amit Varma]: will, of course, discuss a little bit more about the politics of it after the break.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.960
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that I think the pandemic really made stark, especially in an Indian

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:18.520
[Amit Varma]: context is how dysfunctional our state is. The various ways, I mean, the state fundamentally

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.440
[Amit Varma]: in India, I've always said there is no rule of law for most people. The state is absent,

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.880
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't do any of the things that it should do properly and does a lot of things that

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:33.080
[Amit Varma]: it should not do at all. And we've seen an exacerbation of this. Like it's just coming

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.120
[Amit Varma]: to stark relief through the last few months. I've written a column on this, which I linked

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:44.000
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes. But it's kind of distressing that, you know, that in a sense, in this terrible

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.920
[Amit Varma]: tragedy, at least there are some things that we should be able to see more clearly, which

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:55.880
[Amit Varma]: should not immediately get normalized as this gets over. And these are these thoughts are

01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:01.960
[Amit Varma]: too deep, we have to take a break. So we'll take a break and come back in a minute.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.840
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.600
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009, and

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.240
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.880
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.360
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.480
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at India

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Anirban Mahapatra about

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:18.400
[Amit Varma]: his fabulous book on COVID-19. And let's actually now start talking about COVID-19. You know,

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.240
[Amit Varma]: in your book, I love the sequencing in your book where you have these 22 chapters, each

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.080
[Amit Varma]: of them is like a one word thing, you know what it's about, you go really systematically

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.400
[Amit Varma]: through all of the book. Let's let's kind of begin though with your chapter three, which

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of gets down to the most, you know, at a fundamental level talking about the virus

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:44.240
[Amit Varma]: itself or even chapter four, where you talk about how structure is related to function,

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.520
[Amit Varma]: which is something I randomly say in the case of content where it is certainly true, the

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:54.320
[Amit Varma]: structure of your content determines what your content actually is. But I was fascinated

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.280
[Amit Varma]: and almost blown away to find that it's like that in biology as well, that shape determines

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.480
[Amit Varma]: everything, you know, which is I was never taught that in school, not that I was particularly

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.880
[Amit Varma]: attentive in the biology class. Tell me a little bit more about that.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:13.080
[Guest]: Yeah, I was not taught that at school either. And I mentioned that in the book that it's

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.800
[Guest]: one of the most fundamental concepts in biology and definitely one of the most mind blowing

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:24.040
[Guest]: aspects is, well, all biology is at a certain level chemistry and all chemistry if you go

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:31.320
[Guest]: down deeper is physics. And most of physics is is mathematics. But at the level of biological

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:37.160
[Guest]: molecules, when we have different biological molecules that perform different functions,

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:46.840
[Guest]: the shape determines often what the function of that molecule is. And by by shape, I mean,

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:54.520
[Guest]: the the the actual structure is is not static as well, the structure is changing over time.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.640
[Guest]: And one of the examples that I use in the book that might be relevant for for someone

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:07.360
[Guest]: who's who's interested in COVID-19 is this example of now the infamous spike, which is

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:14.600
[Guest]: on the surface of the coronavirus and juts out and gives the virus this sun like appearance

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:23.400
[Guest]: and and how different changes to its actual shape are determining how well it infects

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:32.640
[Guest]: cells. So it has a complementary surface to the to the the ACE2 receptor, which has a

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.160
[Guest]: different function in the body. It's a it's a cellular receptor on on certain cells. But

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:46.280
[Guest]: what the virus is capable of doing is is using that to get its viral package inside cells.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:53.160
[Guest]: Now one concept in this is that that I just mentioned is is the is the shape changes over

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:59.960
[Guest]: time what we have seen. So OK, so let me step back again. The shape of this is determined

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.800
[Guest]: by the building blocks. In in this case, it's a protein. So the building blocks are the

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:11.020
[Guest]: amino acids. As I mentioned earlier, there are typically 20 of these. So if we can think

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:15.920
[Guest]: of this as almost like a Lego set, and there are different pieces that are getting put

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:23.440
[Guest]: here, that's the same set is used by the virus. And it's the same set used by by humans. And

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.160
[Guest]: that is one of the unifying concepts across biology is that proteins. I mean, that's why

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:34.640
[Guest]: the the blueprint that determines this is called the universal genetic code, because

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:41.360
[Guest]: it's this this this blueprint of numbers. Sorry, it's this blueprint of letters. And

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.660
[Guest]: as I mentioned it, this gets translated into transcribed into this intermediate compound

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.760
[Guest]: and then get gets translated into this origami like three dimensional structure, which is

01:27:52.760 --> 01:28:01.040
[Guest]: which is quite fascinating. But in the case of the coronavirus, what was observed was

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:07.280
[Guest]: the spike protein or parts of the spike protein were able to bind or attach because of the

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.880
[Guest]: complementarity of the shape and some of the chemistry were able to attach reasonably well

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:19.000
[Guest]: to the ACE2 receptor one part of it, which is the cognate part. So the part of the spike

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.280
[Guest]: protein that was binding is called the receptor binding domain and it was it was attaching

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:30.960
[Guest]: quite nicely and doing so at a way that was we can calculate that in terms of biochemical

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:37.160
[Guest]: parameters. It was doing that better than the original SARS, which as you may recall

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:44.020
[Guest]: was not as infectious. Now, what structural biologists, so this is entire field of biology

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:49.840
[Guest]: called structural biology. And what they do is they create structures of of various proteins

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.080
[Guest]: and other biological molecules and they use that structure to determine what the function

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.840
[Guest]: is and how that function might might change over time. Structural biologists were very

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:07.220
[Guest]: quick to determine the structure of the spike of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus. What they

01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:15.280
[Guest]: had noticed that one part of this of this protein, which has a little bit over 1,300

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.400
[Guest]: different amino acids. So you can think about this as a three dimensional structure of or

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:28.720
[Guest]: over 1,300 amino acids. And what they noticed is that there was this one part of the cell

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.700
[Guest]: that was hanging out, let's say, as a hand. But on the other side, there was another piece

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:39.360
[Guest]: that was that was not fitting it or it was it was attaching to it, but almost not in

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:45.680
[Guest]: a perfect complementary manner. Now, what they had predicted at that time is that if

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:52.160
[Guest]: the other side was also like an open hand, then there would be a better touching point.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.680
[Guest]: Remarkably, that was that is actually what has been observed for one of the variants.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:03.640
[Guest]: So this is a case where structure and function are absolutely related, where the complementarity

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:12.000
[Guest]: of a structure on the on the receptor and a structure on the virus are so well attuned

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
[Guest]: through the process of evolution, that we have a variant now that is more infectious.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.280
[Guest]: And what basically blows my mind is that we are looking at differences on the atomic level

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:32.560
[Guest]: of something, a virus that we cannot see is this nanoscale virus that has real world implications

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:39.000
[Guest]: for millions of people, billions of people around the world. So that is definitely one

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.280
[Guest]: of these cases. The other thing is that the immune responses. So right now, as we are

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.480
[Guest]: speaking, there's a lot of discussion about the variants and whether the vaccines will

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:56.440
[Guest]: work and whether people will get reinfected after they get infected by one of these variants,

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:01.720
[Guest]: particularly the one that came from Brazil and the other one that came from South Africa.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:08.000
[Guest]: Those are the two of major concern right now. We don't know much about the one that is that

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.680
[Guest]: has come up in Maharashtra and and perhaps we will in the next few days. So what antibodies

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:23.360
[Guest]: do is they also use this concept of structure by trying to find the piece of the virus that

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:30.120
[Guest]: is attaching to the cell and getting there first because they attach better, getting

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:37.800
[Guest]: there first and blocking it, actually physically blocking it from attaching to the receptor.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:44.400
[Guest]: And at one level, this is so visual and so beautiful, but this is not something that

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:51.680
[Guest]: we are we are taught in biology in class at all. We basically thought of it as a number

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:57.280
[Guest]: of or biology is taught as a series of facts that we have to memorize.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I was I was so struck by the geometry of this. And correct me if I'm oversimplifying,

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.540
[Amit Varma]: but how it kind of struck me is that it's a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Everything

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:11.760
[Amit Varma]: has a different kind of shape. Yeah. And what the virus does is that it kind of, you know,

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.600
[Amit Varma]: mutates and mutates and then natural selection will, you know, throw up these random variants

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.880
[Amit Varma]: which fit perfectly. And, you know, then they fit perfectly and they can replicate. And

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:26.440
[Amit Varma]: so that kind of becomes much more common. And you know what antibodies do and what a

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.080
[Amit Varma]: lot of, you know, medical ways of fighting this is also at the level of geometry. Like

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:35.680
[Amit Varma]: if there is a spike that is fighting something, either you sort of create something that fits

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.960
[Amit Varma]: that spike first or you attack the spike or wherever the spike is fitting, you fit that

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:45.600
[Amit Varma]: with something else. So the spike has nowhere to go. I hope I'm not being too kind of simplistic,

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.280
[Amit Varma]: but this is such a sort of, you know, just thinking about the geometry of it and the

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:56.760
[Amit Varma]: way that you made it visual was so kind of fascinating. Let's, you know, take a step

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:00.960
[Amit Varma]: further back. What is a virus? You know, tell me a little bit about how we should because

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:05.480
[Amit Varma]: most lay people just know that, oh, there are germs and there are bacteria and there

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:11.920
[Amit Varma]: are viruses and it's like two different categories like Hindu, Muslim and, you know, and so but

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.120
[Amit Varma]: what are viruses? Where do they come from? I remember at one point, you've, you know,

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.680
[Amit Varma]: spoken in your chapter on the coronavirus on how before there were any living creatures,

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.200
[Amit Varma]: it was an RNA world, right, you know, and you've spoken about how viruses are the most

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:33.240
[Amit Varma]: successful biological entities, you know, another interesting sort of TIL for me there

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:38.120
[Amit Varma]: are, you write at one point, quote, even in the human body, there are probably 100 times

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:45.880
[Amit Varma]: as many viruses as there are human cells. So what are kind of viruses? Exactly? How

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.800
[Amit Varma]: do they interact with the human body? How do they evolve? How do they grow? What's the

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.520
[Amit Varma]: whole deal? What's the role that they play?

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:58.600
[Guest]: We can we can do a whole episode on this, but I'll try to keep this absolutely succinct.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:07.560
[Guest]: Viruses are and they are obligate parasites in that they have functions that are similar

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:15.800
[Guest]: to living things once they're inside living things. So they absolutely have to get inside

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:21.120
[Guest]: other living, they have to get inside living cells to be able to replicate and by replicate,

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:28.100
[Guest]: I mean that they create new virus particles and that fulfills their prerogative from a

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:35.240
[Guest]: perspective of evolution of spreading. And so a virus just wants to spread and by saying

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:41.960
[Guest]: just wants to spread, maybe I'm treating it in a more, giving it a human-like property,

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.200
[Guest]: but that's not the case. This is just simply the biological prerogative or the biological

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:58.560
[Guest]: objective rather of the virus to spread. So outside of a body, a virus is very much like

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:07.120
[Guest]: a chemical. It is not living, it doesn't have that many living attributes, but within cells

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:15.960
[Guest]: it definitely has a lot of the hallmarks of living entities. And viruses may predate life,

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.500
[Guest]: that's definitely one of the theories. There are other theories, especially that have come

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:26.980
[Guest]: in the last few years from a certain class of viruses known as giant viruses that they

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:31.540
[Guest]: may actually be stripped down version or some of them at least may be stripped down versions

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:40.580
[Guest]: of cells. So for every living organism, starting from bacteria all the way up to humans and

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:48.660
[Guest]: definitely plants, there are viruses that infect them and can parasitize viruses. Not

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:55.100
[Guest]: all viruses are harmful and this is something that is definitely lost on a lot of people.

01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:01.900
[Guest]: They are involved in biogeochemical cycles, especially in the water where there are a

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:08.820
[Guest]: large number of bacteria. And so viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophages

01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:16.180
[Guest]: and they are involved in a lot of the turnover in water. Scientists are now even looking

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:25.060
[Guest]: to viruses for therapeutic uses, in particular cases for bacteria that have become resistant

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:32.200
[Guest]: to a number of antibiotics by figuring out which viruses do this. And there's some really

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:39.020
[Guest]: exciting work that has come up on bacteriophage therapy in the last few years with respect

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:48.340
[Guest]: to that. Viruses are a huge class of biological entities. Some of them have RNA as their genetic

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:57.020
[Guest]: material and the coronaviruses are a category of viruses there. And then there are the DNA

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:06.260
[Guest]: viruses as well. The RNA viruses are particularly promiscuous. RNA is not a molecule that is

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:13.280
[Guest]: used as genetic material in living organisms because of certain reasons. DNA is better

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:20.720
[Guest]: suited for that, but it still stays on in certain viruses. And they have a very high

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.800
[Guest]: mutation rate, as people are now finding out with the coronavirus that we're looking at

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:35.240
[Guest]: right now and the disease that it's causing. Viruses have been infecting us since life

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:45.760
[Guest]: began. And there are traces of viruses in our own genetic code. Certain classes of viruses

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:52.840
[Guest]: which are known as retroviruses, they actually integrate into our genetic material. Now coronaviruses

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:58.340
[Guest]: are not retroviruses, so they're slightly different. So we actually have the archaeological

01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:06.200
[Guest]: remains of viral infections in our own genetic material, and that's more than 8%. So even

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:13.720
[Guest]: if we disregard all the viruses that are inside our body, so we are also part virus because

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:19.960
[Guest]: of the viral genetic material we have in our genomes. One of my pet peeves actually to

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:25.600
[Guest]: go off on an aside is the synonymous use of genetic code with genome. They're slightly

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.320
[Guest]: different. So I wanted to get that right.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.320
[Amit Varma]: This is fascinating because I'm so happy to find out that I no longer do I need to describe

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:40.880
[Amit Varma]: myself as half Punjabi, half Bengali. I'm actually 46% Punjabi, 46% Bengali and 8% virus.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.040
[Amit Varma]: Now that you mentioned, what's the difference between a virus and a bacteria?

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:54.600
[Guest]: A bacteria is a cellular form of life. And so bacteria is living and it has all the hallmarks

01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:03.320
[Guest]: of living organisms, whereas a virus outside of cells is not living. A bacteria may cause

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:09.760
[Guest]: infection, it may be free living as well. Viruses definitely have to infect to be able

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:18.360
[Guest]: to propagate and to create new viruses. And then the other aspect about is from a public

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:26.280
[Guest]: health perspective, antibiotics work against bacteria, but they don't work against viruses.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:32.400
[Guest]: Antivirals are much fewer in number as we are painfully finding out during this coronavirus

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:39.820
[Guest]: pandemic. And that's definitely not the case with bacteria. So we have been doing a much

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:47.520
[Guest]: better job in controlling bacterial infections by and large, as opposed to new emerging viral

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.520
[Amit Varma]: infections.

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:53.080
[Amit Varma]: So here's the deal. So you've pointed out, you know, what viruses are and how they kind

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.200
[Amit Varma]: of there are so many of them. And you said that a virus needs to enter a cell to replicate.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about this process of replication. Like let's say a virus figures out a way to

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.560
[Amit Varma]: enter a cell, which in the case of the coronavirus, which by the way, you've described the history

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.800
[Amit Varma]: in the book about why it's called a coronavirus is that when they first saw it, it sort of

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:19.320
[Amit Varma]: was a little bit like the corona of the sun. So they kind of went with that. So how does,

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:25.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, once a virus enters a cell, what is the process there? How does it replicate?

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.380
[Amit Varma]: What are the different components of that?

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:34.320
[Guest]: So one of the things about the virus actually getting in the cell is it's a random process.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:40.240
[Guest]: Viruses don't have any way of propelling themselves. A lot of bacteria can do that. So through

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:47.760
[Guest]: random means, a virus will find a cell and it will find a receptor. And that's why viruses

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:55.120
[Guest]: often are in like these teeming large numbers. And as we discussed earlier, there are so

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.640
[Guest]: many different viruses. So we are probably ingesting through the air, as we're speaking

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:04.200
[Guest]: now, a number of viruses as well. But they're not causing disease because they have to be

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.680
[Guest]: able to find the specific receptor that they can recognize to be able to get inside. And

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.160
[Guest]: it's similarly with when I'm drinking tea or eating anything, there might be plant viruses

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:24.560
[Guest]: there. But over, even among the animal viruses, there are over 1.6 million predicted animal

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:31.680
[Guest]: viruses, but only a few are able to infect humans. Once they get inside cells, though,

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.720
[Guest]: their immediate job is to create the protein part of the cell, which is a structural part

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:47.440
[Guest]: of the additional virus particles, but also to replicate their genomes. And in the case

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:56.160
[Guest]: of the coronavirus, the genetic material is the RNA. And that serves both as the template.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.640
[Guest]: So the beauty for the virus perspective, the beauty from the perspective of the virus is

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.160
[Guest]: that that can serve both as the blueprint for the creation of these other particles

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:11.920
[Guest]: that it will need as building blocks, but it's also the genetic material so it can make

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:17.400
[Guest]: copies of that. So it's making both the structure and the genetic material from this compound.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:25.520
[Guest]: Now, one thing about the virus, though, is that the RNA viruses, they are, because they

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:32.560
[Guest]: don't use DNA as their genetic material, they have a different copier enzyme than we do.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:40.280
[Guest]: And this is called the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. And part of that, or that, and that enzyme

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:46.120
[Guest]: is often used as a target for drugs because we don't have it in our body. One of the drugs

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.000
[Guest]: that has been used during this pandemic to stop the coronavirus infections, at least

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.260
[Guest]: early on, is remdesivir. And remdesivir, one of the modes of action that it's thought to

01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:03.760
[Guest]: work is to stop this RNA dependent polymerase, this copier enzyme, from making future copies

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:10.320
[Guest]: of itself and being able to, being able to replicate. The virus also brings in a couple

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:15.400
[Guest]: of other enzymes of its own, and these are turning out to be targets as well. There are,

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:21.040
[Guest]: I mentioned, there's a, there's a class of enzyme called proteases. And these are basically,

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:28.160
[Guest]: they act as cleavers. And they cut at very specific sites when the entire protein is

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.460
[Guest]: created. So basically, it's like a large, almost like a large piece of cloth that has

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:37.880
[Guest]: to be cut at specific places to make designs. And those are going to be part of the building

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:44.280
[Guest]: blocks of the virus. So that's another target right now. And I know Pfizer right now has

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:51.160
[Guest]: a drug in, in phase one of clinical trials to, to hit those. So one of the ways of drug

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.280
[Guest]: discovery, as you mentioned, is that the structure determines what the drugs will be and using

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:04.200
[Guest]: that structure activity relationship to create drugs for these unique targets that are found

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:10.440
[Guest]: within the virus, but not within people. And so, and the reason for that is then there

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.720
[Guest]: will be less adverse effects. Once the virus particles or once the subunits of the virus

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.880
[Guest]: and the genetic material are made, then they're assembled within the cell. For this entire

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:29.200
[Guest]: process, the cellular machinery has been hijacked. So it's basically our cellular machinery that

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:35.960
[Guest]: is making the virus particles for themselves. And it uses a part of the cell as well to

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:43.760
[Guest]: be able to get outside as well. And this system is mostly used to get rid of cellular trash.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:50.520
[Guest]: So it uses the trash compaction system. So it uses one system of receptors to get in,

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:57.520
[Guest]: then it completely subverts our cellular machinery to make the virus copies of itself. And then

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:00.400
[Guest]: it uses the trash compaction system to get out.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.040
[Amit Varma]: That's beautiful. And I love the phrase trash compaction. You know, maybe it can be used

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:12.120
[Amit Varma]: one day in the context of the IT cell of certain parties. But so I kind of want to take a brief

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:16.520
[Amit Varma]: digression, not exactly a digression, because it's a point you mentioned in your book also,

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:20.680
[Amit Varma]: but I think it's worth stressing on for many lay readers. You know, one of the big sort

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:24.560
[Amit Varma]: of aha moments of my life, which really made me look at the world differently was when

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I discovered natural selection. Like Douglas Adams once said, you know, that there's no

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.640
[Amit Varma]: reason to believe in God, because if you just understand natural selection, the awe of what

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.560
[Amit Varma]: you experience is far beyond anything that any religion can give you. And you yourself

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.920
[Amit Varma]: here have quoted someone called Theodosius Dobzhansky, who writes, quote, nothing in

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.280
[Amit Varma]: biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. So at the risk of getting a little

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:57.360
[Amit Varma]: too simple, but just, you know, in case there are lay people listening to this who might

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:03.160
[Amit Varma]: be wondering that, hey, this is so incredibly complex that it's, you know, you've got a

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.560
[Amit Varma]: virus getting inside the cell, it's got this mechanism, it's got that mechanism, it's copying

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.240
[Amit Varma]: itself, RNA is happening, cell also has trash, trash compaction units, it's got an IT cell

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:17.640
[Amit Varma]: of its own. And all this, you know, humongous complex shit is happening, you know, surely

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:21.760
[Amit Varma]: there is God who designed this. And what do you mean when a virus wants to replicate?

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.480
[Amit Varma]: So I just want to take a brief moment to kind of talk about that, which I will do in my

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.440
[Amit Varma]: simple terms. And if I've missed out anything or missed a nuance, you can kind of fill in

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:34.040
[Amit Varma]: because I think, you know, understanding natural selection is just so key to understanding

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.400
[Amit Varma]: our world and life, which is basically that look, there are millions of viruses, they

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.240
[Amit Varma]: don't all fit into cells. And, you know, but they will all mutate in different ways. And

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.160
[Amit Varma]: accidentally, some will happen to fit into cells, and they'll get into the cells, right?

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:51.840
[Amit Varma]: Part one done. Now, out of all the ones that get in accidentally, you know, there will

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.080
[Amit Varma]: be a few that have the right properties to start one process. And out of all of those,

01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.120
[Amit Varma]: there will be a few that will have the properties to start another process. And at the end of

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.160
[Amit Varma]: all of this, the ones that successfully replicate are the ones who were essentially formed by

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:10.360
[Amit Varma]: accident. But once they are, they replicate and then there are more and more of the viruses

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:14.960
[Amit Varma]: like that. So it almost seems like so when you say a virus wants to spread, that wanting

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.560
[Amit Varma]: is a metaphor. Yes. So you know, if anyone hasn't read Richard Dawkins's book, The Selfish

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:25.360
[Amit Varma]: Gene or a lot of his other work, Daniel Dennett as well, go out and kind of do that, because

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.720
[Amit Varma]: that will explain it much better than I can. But this whole process is so joyous, that

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:35.640
[Amit Varma]: is iteration, iteration, iteration, everything is accidental. But then something just works

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:40.920
[Amit Varma]: and multiplies. And you can ascribe directionality to this and say, hey, this was meant to be

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:46.000
[Amit Varma]: or you can, you know, ascribe intention to the virus, a virus wants to do this, the virus

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.120
[Amit Varma]: is a bad guy. And all of that, you know, understanding natural selection is so much the bedrock

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.720
[Amit Varma]: of this that I thought I should bring in this aside for people who like I once wasn't exposed

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.280
[Amit Varma]: to it and understand it. It's just it's always when I think about it, that how everything

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.920
[Amit Varma]: is emerged from it is so incredibly wonderful. So did I leave out anything essential in my

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.800
[Guest]: brief description? I think you you you hit the nail on the head with the importance of

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.200
[Guest]: evolution by natural selection, as you mentioned, I even included it in the book and had it

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:23.280
[Guest]: as part of a chapter on on concepts, because it is an absolutely essential concept to understanding

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:30.120
[Guest]: anything in biology, your description of it is accurate, I would say, one other piece

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.240
[Guest]: that I would definitely add is that there's always a selection pressure. That's what's

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:40.480
[Guest]: basically driving the selection of those changes. Because otherwise, somebody might say, well,

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.280
[Guest]: what is the designer, what is pushing it towards it becoming more infectious, and it's that

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:50.880
[Guest]: selection pressure. And then the other thing is that it's always happening because the

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.280
[Guest]: world is not static situations are changing all the time. And I would say that's the other

01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:02.560
[Guest]: really, really beautiful thing about it is there is no static environment in the world

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.520
[Guest]: anywhere. And so what may seem like an organism getting an upper hand briefly, over time and

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.840
[Guest]: over 4 billion years of evolution, that doesn't seem to be the case at all. So I absolutely

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:20.320
[Guest]: love it. And everything I I try to understand in biology, I definitely try to understand

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:27.340
[Guest]: from the perspective of evolution by natural selection. And to those naysayers who doubt

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:33.200
[Guest]: it and don't understand what you mentioned, the repetitive or the iterative process of

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:39.360
[Guest]: natural selection, people are using it now. And there's Francis Arnold won a Nobel Prize,

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:45.760
[Guest]: and others have been using it as well, for actual benefit to be able to use the process

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:53.160
[Guest]: by having this repetitive process and the selective force to make proteins and other

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.920
[Guest]: macromolecules even better over time. And this is what is known as directed evolution.

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:08.000
[Guest]: And it's a definitely a force in biological engineering to use evolution as a force for

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.800
[Guest]: for creating molecules. So everything doesn't have to be rational. I guess that's my main

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:19.960
[Guest]: point is if you have a large number of molecules and you have this selection pressure, and

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:26.480
[Guest]: you give nature time, then over time, it will find a way to get through.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.620
[Amit Varma]: So here's one question, which might also seem like a nice question. Now, there are all these

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:36.240
[Amit Varma]: tons of viruses, and some of them get successful in kind of propagating themselves. Now, I

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.200
[Amit Varma]: would think that logically, a virus doesn't actually have to harm the host. You know,

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:45.320
[Amit Varma]: it's like, which are the successful domestic animals are the dogs and cats and the ones

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:51.720
[Amit Varma]: that get along with us and, you know, perform different kinds of emotional functions for

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.480
[Amit Varma]: us, which are completely beneficial. If they weren't, they wouldn't be domestic animals.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you'd imagine that a virus to replicate successfully and to not have, you know, medicines

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:08.560
[Amit Varma]: targeted at it and all of that would be ones which would cause no harm to the host and

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.520
[Amit Varma]: they would just chill and the host would just keep spreading them and everybody's happy.

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:18.560
[Amit Varma]: It's a positive some game and so on and so forth. But so is it the case that there are

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.720
[Amit Varma]: many, many viruses and most of them are completely harmless and they spread like that. And there

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.960
[Amit Varma]: are only a few that are accidentally dangerous to hosts and it's not actually necessary for

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.360
[Amit Varma]: them to go back to the metaphor to harm the host. Or, you know, so what's going on here?

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.160
[Amit Varma]: What's the deal here? Why do they harm us? They don't need to harm us.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.640
[Guest]: That's an absolutely fantastic question. I'm glad you asked that question. And you are

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:48.680
[Guest]: absolutely spot on that the essential aspect of the virus is not disease. Disease is important

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:55.080
[Guest]: to us from our perspective as someone who has been infected. The reason we care about

01:51:55.080 --> 01:52:00.520
[Guest]: certain viruses is because they cause disease. I mean, you can think about this coronavirus

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:06.600
[Guest]: SARS-CoV-2. If it had gone through humans without causing any disease, then perhaps

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:12.600
[Guest]: we might have identified it by accident or perhaps not even at all. And we only think

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:20.440
[Guest]: about the viruses that tend to cause disease and more often serious disease. I wrote about

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:27.720
[Guest]: the previous pandemic when I was a managing editor. I wrote an editorial about H1N1 influenza

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:32.960
[Guest]: and that pandemic was not taken very seriously because it didn't cause severe disease. It

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:39.240
[Guest]: spread reasonably well, not as well as SARS-CoV-2, but it spread reasonably well, but it didn't

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:47.120
[Guest]: cause disease. Disease is an outcome of a virus spreading well, because if you remember

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:53.400
[Guest]: the process that we discussed, once the virus actually gets inside the cell, it uses up

01:52:53.400 --> 01:53:01.240
[Guest]: some of the cell resources and the cell machinery. So if it is very successful in replicating,

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:07.600
[Guest]: then it causes harm to the cell. And so that is one of the primary outcomes. The secondary

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:13.880
[Guest]: outcome is often what we see as disease is not caused by the virus, but by our reaction

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:22.760
[Guest]: to the virus. And often in cases of COVID-19, that second phase of the dysregular or abnormal

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.680
[Guest]: immune response is what is causing harm in people. And that's why some people are receiving

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:34.560
[Guest]: dexamethasone as well towards that phase. And so if you are not able to mount the appropriate

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.360
[Guest]: immune response, not a too strong immune response, not too weak an immune response, if it's too

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:46.400
[Guest]: strong an immune response, what can happen is then the immune response is actually destroying

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:52.960
[Guest]: many of the cells and inside the body as well. And that is actually what is happening in

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:59.600
[Guest]: a number of cases of COVID-19, where the virus itself is not causing that damage. But it

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:05.200
[Guest]: is really a great question that you ask. Early on, what microbiologists thought was essentially

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:09.720
[Guest]: what you are saying, and you will still find some microbiologists who believe that over

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:18.160
[Guest]: the course of time, a virus will invariably grow weaker in terms of how it causes disease

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:27.320
[Guest]: as it gets more attuned to the host. And so what happens is with a zoonotic infection,

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:34.080
[Guest]: because it doesn't have that much of a quote unquote history with us, at that early time,

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:40.440
[Guest]: then it can cause more severe disease, but over time, it gets milder. However, new modeling

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.320
[Guest]: studies suggest that that may not be the case. And the reason for that is actually what is

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:51.640
[Guest]: playing out in real time with these variants, where it, as we just discussed, nothing is

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:58.480
[Guest]: static in biology. So it's not that there is one direction that it can go. For the virus,

01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:06.360
[Guest]: the mathematical optimal situation is one where it is not a complete pushover. But it's

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:12.160
[Guest]: also not killing the host before it's able to spread to other people. So it has this

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.920
[Guest]: sort of range in the middle where it can settle in where it can cause some disease, even severe

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:23.400
[Guest]: disease in some people, but it's creating a lot more of a viral load that it can infect

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:30.160
[Guest]: other people. So the short answer is it's not as simple as even microbiologists thought

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.440
[Guest]: it was maybe 100 years ago.

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Wow. And by the way, you use the phrase zoonotic for the benefit of my listeners, that means

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:42.440
[Amit Varma]: a virus that comes from an animal to a human being. And we'll discuss that a little more,

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.480
[Amit Varma]: because I want to talk about bats also and murdered minks, which is makes me very sad.

01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.160
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to that, I'm kind of curious about this point, you mentioned about the

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:55.920
[Amit Varma]: optimal virus, right? Because if you think of it in game theoretic terms, and you think

01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:01.560
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, somebody creating viruses and is a great game theorist, what do you do?

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And what you don't want to do is create something like Ebola. Now, Ebola is very lethal. It

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:10.080
[Amit Varma]: kills a large percentage of the people who get it, but it doesn't spread that easily.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:14.800
[Amit Varma]: It is not a symptomatic spread. And you know, once you know someone's really ill, they can

01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.200
[Amit Varma]: get isolated. Whereas, so you want a virus that spreads a lot equally, you want it all

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:24.080
[Amit Varma]: you want a certain amount of lethality. If it kills nobody, it's really like what is

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.400
[Amit Varma]: a virus even doing so that your evil virus designer is not successful there. So it seems

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:37.000
[Amit Varma]: that you need a certain sort of level of infectiousness and a certain level of lethality. And your

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.400
[Amit Varma]: ideal virus should be something that is spread by asymptomatic people. And even people who

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.760
[Amit Varma]: don't have severe symptoms who don't realize what's going on and the lethality comes later.

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:52.280
[Amit Varma]: So you are killing a certain percentage of the people but not too many, because then

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:57.320
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't spread that well. Is it fair to say that SARS-CoV-2 or the you know, this

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.760
[Amit Varma]: COVID-19 virus basically is as close to optimal as possible?

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:07.200
[Guest]: There are certain aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that make it also very difficult to deal with compared

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:13.760
[Guest]: to a number of other viruses. And definitely the way that it's spread makes it primed for

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:20.160
[Guest]: a pandemic because it's a respiratory virus. And because with other things like there have

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.520
[Guest]: been pandemics in the past that have been caused by cholera, but cholera has been mainly

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:32.640
[Guest]: eradicated from many countries. And we can choose to not drink the same type of water.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.400
[Guest]: We can definitely choose to not eat the same kind of meat or even the same food. But we

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.040
[Guest]: all have to breathe the same air. I mean, we can filter it to a certain extent. But

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:48.280
[Guest]: that's one of the reasons, the fact that it's a respiratory virus. And then a lot of the

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:53.460
[Guest]: spread is asymptomatic, as you mentioned. And a lot of the infectiousness is during

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:59.200
[Guest]: that early phase of asymptomatic. That silent spread is happening in a number of people

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:06.920
[Guest]: who are carriers that make it very difficult to control as well. But even among the viruses,

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:12.680
[Guest]: you hit on a really great point. But even among the viruses, you mentioned Ebola. Ebola,

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:19.360
[Guest]: because it kills the people that it infects, it has to have a massive viral load. It is

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.840
[Guest]: basically teeming and coming out of every orifice of the person who is infected. And

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.280
[Guest]: even when the person dies, the World Health Organization has been saying, you have to

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:37.120
[Guest]: be very careful about how you perform the last rites of these bodies. Because often,

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:42.360
[Guest]: what happens with Ebola is that it is a disease that spread through love, through caregivers

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:48.360
[Guest]: who want to take care of those who are ill, and who want to give the last rites to others.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:53.800
[Guest]: Because it spreads in such massive numbers. On the other hand, there are other viruses

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:59.560
[Guest]: that cause these type of chronic and latent infections. And they don't need those large

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:06.920
[Guest]: numbers and they don't need to cause disease immediately. And definitely, HIV is one of

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:14.860
[Guest]: them. The virus that causes hepatitis is another one of them. And so in most people, they can

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:21.660
[Guest]: be sort of causing no disease at all and asymptomatic. And most people won't even know about it.

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:27.420
[Guest]: And they can even linger in people for years before they have a type of disease. And so

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:34.620
[Guest]: in those cases, based on what you were saying, and just on a rational idea of what would

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:40.500
[Guest]: be necessary, you can envisage that the number of viruses needed to infect and that do infect

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:46.660
[Guest]: is much less than in a case of Ebola, which has a very short infectious cycle and very

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:50.020
[Guest]: acute infection versus these other chronic infections.

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:55.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm struck by a phrase you just used. And it strikes me that then what is common

01:59:55.500 --> 02:00:02.380
[Amit Varma]: between both humanity and Ebola is that they are diseases that spread through love. I love

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:06.660
[Amit Varma]: that phrase. And I had done an episode a few weeks back with Chinmay Tumbe about the pandemics

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:11.500
[Amit Varma]: India has been struck by and that has a lot about cholera as well. And it's it's so fascinating

02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:16.220
[Amit Varma]: to sort of see that all this has played out before, you know, at least the bad parts of

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:20.060
[Amit Varma]: it has played out before we have never had, you know, so many vaccines within a year.

02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:25.340
[Amit Varma]: And the kind of science work that is happening is sort of remarkable. So a follow on question

02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:29.540
[Amit Varma]: from there that assuming that this is kind of close to optimal, that it is both infectious

02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.940
[Amit Varma]: and lethal, I would have thought that just logically, like, where is the flaw in my thinking

02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:39.380
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, that logically it would like many viruses have done of the past also, including,

02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:44.760
[Amit Varma]: I think, influenza strains, that it would naturally evolve towards becoming more infectious

02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:50.100
[Amit Varma]: and less lethal. Because, you know, that would seem to be the natural consequence. It seems

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:55.260
[Amit Varma]: kind of counterintuitive that it can become both more infectious and more lethal or even

02:00:55.260 --> 02:01:01.660
[Amit Varma]: as lethal. So what are we seeing right now? Like here we are actually talking in April.

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:07.100
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, your book is actually remarkably up to date, given when it came out that it

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:10.820
[Amit Varma]: talks about all the vaccines and the British variant and all that. But what we are seeing,

02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:15.820
[Amit Varma]: for example, right now in India, it would seem just looking at the raw numbers and it's

02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.780
[Amit Varma]: evolving. So the whole picture could look different five days from now, and I have no

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.900
[Amit Varma]: way of telling. But just from a layman's perspective, just looking at sort of the data, it seems

02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:28.980
[Amit Varma]: that cases have gone up massively, but the death rate hasn't quite gone up to the same

02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:34.740
[Amit Varma]: extent. Is it possible that it is a strain that is more infectious and less lethal, which,

02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:39.980
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you would kind of expect? Or, you know, are there nuances here? Are there other

02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.740
[Amit Varma]: possibilities that we and obviously, I realized that nobody knows right now, we are still

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:49.340
[Amit Varma]: in a sense in the fog of war. But what's your kind of take on that?

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:55.600
[Guest]: Yeah, that's definitely one aspect of it is over time, what can happen is the virus can

02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:03.020
[Guest]: become more infectious and less lethal. But the other side of it is your immune response.

02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:07.400
[Guest]: So let's say you get vaccinated, or you get infected, or you have an asymptomatic infection

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:14.700
[Guest]: that you don't know about, you may have antibodies and you may have T cell responses, that when

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:21.420
[Guest]: you have that second reinfection, it's not as severe anymore. So there are these two

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:27.660
[Guest]: sets of factors that are determining what that is. And maybe in a number of people,

02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:32.660
[Guest]: they didn't know that they were infected the first time. And in those cases, they are actually

02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:39.180
[Guest]: having reinfections. The point that you made about previous pandemics is actually quite

02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:49.020
[Guest]: a good one. And with H1N1, which happened in 1918 and 1919, because that was such a

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:56.980
[Guest]: deadly and dominant virus. One thing is that every single virus, even the ones that circulate

02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:03.340
[Guest]: within human populations right now, and then cause seasonal influenza, apart from the ones

02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:10.060
[Guest]: that are causing bird flu and are not transmitting very well, and they just come every few years

02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:17.940
[Guest]: with different variants. But all of the circulating influenza A strains right now, are in some

02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:25.980
[Guest]: manner derived from that H1N1 of 1918 and 1919. And there is a theory, it isn't very

02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:31.540
[Guest]: well substantiated, that one of the human coronaviruses, there are human coronaviruses

02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:37.780
[Guest]: that cause colds, may have caused a pandemic in the 1800s. And then it just became very,

02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:44.140
[Guest]: very mild over time. What we are seeing now with SARS-CoV-2, it's still too early right

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:49.820
[Guest]: now. And a large proportion of the world has not even been infected once. So we will know

02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:55.460
[Guest]: this. And that is actually how the pandemic ends. The pandemic doesn't end because SARS-CoV-2

02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:02.460
[Guest]: gets eradicated. It ends because either through vaccination or either through different variants,

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.420
[Guest]: it becomes into a mild disease that we no longer have to worry about anymore.

02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:11.140
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly. And as you also pointed out in your book that, you know, unlike, say,

02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:15.300
[Amit Varma]: the way we eradicated smallpox, that is simply not possible with SARS-CoV-2, because it is

02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:20.180
[Amit Varma]: not only humans who have the virus. Other animals also have it. You've written at one

02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:26.980
[Amit Varma]: point in your book about how 600,000 minks were culled last June in Netherlands by suffocation.

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:30.900
[Guest]: Like, how, how were they suffocated?

02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.820
[Guest]: So the issue here is, and this has been observed for...

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:39.020
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm not asking why, I'm saying how, like you put them in a gas chamber or you take

02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:42.740
[Guest]: one mink at a time and you suffocate it.

02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:44.780
[Amit Varma]: No, I have no idea what they did there.

02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:49.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's kind of striking. Let's talk a little bit about the origins. Like, you know,

02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:53.980
[Amit Varma]: earlier you used the phrase zoonotic and zoonosis, of course, is viruses coming from animals

02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:58.020
[Amit Varma]: to humans, as indeed they do. And most of the time they won't even enter our cells and

02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.940
[Amit Varma]: most of the time when they do, nothing will really go wrong. So we won't even notice it.

02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:07.180
[Amit Varma]: So this is kind of a selection bias that we give viruses a bad name by picking on the

02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:14.140
[Amit Varma]: ones that actually do serious damage to us. What do we know about the origins of the Corona

02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:19.300
[Amit Varma]: virus? Like in the sense that, you know, you've spoken about how, you know, what we took seriously

02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:25.180
[Amit Varma]: earlier was the influenza virus, which is 1918 and the Hong Kong flu in the late 60s

02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:30.180
[Amit Varma]: and the mid 50s and whatever. So you've had the flu virus around a long time that also

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:34.780
[Amit Varma]: uses RNA replication, but you've pointed out that there are some differences and no one

02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:39.900
[Amit Varma]: really took Corona viruses seriously. Perhaps when the first SARS came, which you said,

02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:43.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, at that point you were active in the profession and you kind of thought about

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:48.140
[Amit Varma]: it and wrote about it. That's when people started taking it seriously. What, you know,

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:53.020
[Amit Varma]: how are Corona viruses different from say the influenza virus? You know, how do they

02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:57.940
[Amit Varma]: originate? What's the whole deal? And how did this particular, how did SARS-CoV-2, what

02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:01.420
[Amit Varma]: are the theories about the origin and how it kind of reached humans?

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:07.420
[Guest]: Yeah, as I mentioned, there are a certain number of, there are four Corona viruses that

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:15.700
[Guest]: cause common colds in humans. Two of them were discovered a few decades ago and nobody

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:21.440
[Guest]: really paid that much attention to Corona viruses. There was a perspective in science

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:28.220
[Guest]: that I mentioned in the book with respect to a scientific meeting where the total number

02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:35.460
[Guest]: of people attending a meeting on Corona viruses could not fill an entire room. They were like

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:40.420
[Guest]: empty seats. There were so many empty seats. There were so few people at that time working

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:47.380
[Guest]: on Corona viruses. And this was before SARS basically hit the scene. And so Corona virology

02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:52.940
[Guest]: at that time was considered one of the backwaters of virology. There weren't that many people

02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:59.940
[Guest]: working on this obscure class of viruses. And obviously after that, what happened is

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:09.860
[Guest]: the first SARS pandemic happened in the first part of this century. And SARS spread to a

02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:16.140
[Guest]: number of other countries. It was fairly lethal. It was much more lethal in general than the

02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:22.700
[Guest]: current Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2. But as we were discussing, because many of the people

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:28.860
[Guest]: or actually most of the people who were spreading the disease, most of the people who spread

02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:34.780
[Guest]: the virus did so after they were showing signs of disease, it was much easier to isolate

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:41.340
[Guest]: it. So there weren't that many silent infections. And after a while, in the summer, the disease

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:47.020
[Guest]: basically died down. It hasn't been eradicated. It could pop up at any time, but officially

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:53.380
[Guest]: there hasn't been an outbreak. And then after that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.420
[Guest]: first appeared in cannibals in the Middle East, that one also like SARS is thought to

02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:05.340
[Guest]: have originally originated from bats. Now bats for some unknown reason, and I have some

02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:12.020
[Guest]: theories in the book, as it might pertain to flight and the stresses and strains of

02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:18.660
[Guest]: flights in bats. Bats are mammals that do fly, harbour a disproportionate number of

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:25.300
[Guest]: Corona viruses that don't cause any severe disease in them. And so MERS definitely spread

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:31.940
[Guest]: from camels to people. It was very deadly, but it was not very infectious. And so with

02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:40.460
[Guest]: respect to the current Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, the original reservoir animal is almost certainly

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:46.540
[Guest]: a bat. Now whether it came directly from bats many years ago, and then went through the

02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:52.100
[Guest]: process of mutation to become more infectious is one theory. And that may have happened

02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:59.540
[Guest]: over a few decades where it wasn't causing a very severe infection, wasn't causing very

02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:05.100
[Guest]: severe disease, and then it wasn't infecting very well, but it gained some mutations because

02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:10.660
[Guest]: of the natural selection pressures that we mentioned, and then it exploded at one time.

02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:15.020
[Guest]: That is definitely a plausible theory, and that is in line with what we're seeing with

02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:20.820
[Guest]: some of the variants as well. That happens quite frequently. The other thing about Corona

02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:28.120
[Guest]: viruses is that two Corona viruses can infect a cell at the same time. Influenza viruses

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:33.200
[Guest]: do this as well, but their genetic material is actually broken into pieces. So when they

02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:39.460
[Guest]: enter a cell, they can actually mix and match pieces and create a totally new virus. Corona

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:44.580
[Guest]: virus is not broken into pieces, but it can take parts from other viruses, other Corona

02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:50.220
[Guest]: viruses that infect the same cell. So very early on, there was this theory that there

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:57.340
[Guest]: was an intermediate pangolin host. So a pangolin had been infected by a bat Corona virus, and

02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:03.600
[Guest]: so a pangolin and a bat Corona virus entered the same cell. They mixed and matched pieces,

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:09.340
[Guest]: and one of the parts of the current Corona virus is very, very similar to a pangolin

02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:15.860
[Guest]: Corona virus, and that's the part that's useful or essential for binding to the receptor.

02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:21.660
[Guest]: That's the receptor binding domain. And so that theory has also been put out there, and

02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:26.860
[Guest]: definitely an intermediate animal has precedent in what is thought to have happened with the

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:32.540
[Guest]: original SARS, with civets being thought to be the original, civets thought to be the

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:37.940
[Guest]: intermediate animal in that case. So which of these two theories is correct is not known

02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.780
[Guest]: at the time. Formally, I know a lot of people like this theory, formally we cannot still

02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:54.000
[Guest]: rule out that there was a viral escape from any lab, but viral manipulation or manipulation

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.020
[Guest]: is, does not have to be, I mean, going by Occam's razor, that's not the simplest answer.

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:05.140
[Guest]: And when we see that we are infected by these viruses, then it does happen naturally. And

02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:10.100
[Guest]: there are a large number of Corona viruses in bats. And even before this pandemic, there

02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:15.740
[Guest]: were scientists like Vineet Menachery and Ralph Baric who were saying that there are

02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:21.420
[Guest]: Corona viruses we need to look at and watch out for because they can infect human cells.

02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:26.940
[Guest]: With all of these lines of evidence, I don't think at the present, we need to entertain

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:32.100
[Guest]: the idea that this was created in a lab in Wuhan.

02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:37.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And at some level, it doesn't really, I mean, at a geopolitical level, it may matter

02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:41.180
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, but you know, at the level of biology, it is what it is, it's out there.

02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:45.020
[Amit Varma]: And you pointed out that, you know, there are more than 5000 known bat Corona viruses,

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:50.580
[Amit Varma]: which is so incredibly scary. Any random one can mutate and do something and come to humans

02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:55.580
[Amit Varma]: and do something far worse. And as far as pangolins are concerned, I like this is one

02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:01.940
[Amit Varma]: of my favorite names for a living creature. It's like, you know, Middle Eastern martial

02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:07.140
[Amit Varma]: arts warrior, you know, you can make a graphic novel on the pangolins fighting for the survival

02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:12.620
[Amit Varma]: of the species. No, actually, pangolins are scaly anteaters. And yeah, so somehow bats

02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:17.820
[Amit Varma]: and pangolins partied and this is and earlier, you know, you mentioned RNA as being much

02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:22.180
[Amit Varma]: more promiscuous than DNA, at which point I thought that in India, then DNA would be

02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:29.340
[Amit Varma]: looked upon as much more sanskari than RNA, which is merrily mixing all over the place,

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:34.220
[Amit Varma]: which is by the way, what we indeed used to do in India until, you know, a while back,

02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:39.820
[Amit Varma]: Tony Joseph's book and his episode with me has much more. So now, what I kind of find

02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:44.060
[Amit Varma]: interesting about it and where this current outbreak in a sense has come at the right

02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:48.860
[Amit Varma]: time, like I think that if it came 40 years ago, we would have no idea what to do with

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.940
[Amit Varma]: it. It could have been you could argue it would be less devastating because global travel

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:57.660
[Amit Varma]: was less and therefore it may not have proliferated so fast. But there would have been some point

02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:02.220
[Amit Varma]: in time where global travel would have been you know, frequent enough for a big enough

02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:07.140
[Amit Varma]: for it to spread fast, but the science wouldn't have gotten to where it was. And this time

02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:12.100
[Amit Varma]: what you've sort of spoken about is that in January itself, we had sort of the genetic

02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:19.300
[Amit Varma]: sequence of, you know, SARS-CoV-2 and already people began working on a vaccine as far back

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:24.220
[Amit Varma]: as then, which is one of the reasons that it's kind of come so far. So tell me about

02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:28.900
[Amit Varma]: what happens to the scientific community? What happened to the scientific community

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:33.020
[Amit Varma]: last year when this sort of erupted? Because like you said earlier, you wouldn't fill a

02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:38.260
[Amit Varma]: room with people studying the coronavirus. And now it's just an existential threat to

02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:43.740
[Amit Varma]: all of us. So everybody's kind of on it. So what is the kind of research happening there?

02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:48.460
[Amit Varma]: You know, is it a kind of, you know, a fortuitous moment in time that a lot of other developments

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:52.980
[Amit Varma]: have come together at a time where we can actually handle this, we sort of can figure

02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:57.540
[Amit Varma]: out a way ahead. Tell me what's happening in the science now, like you also pointed

02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:02.460
[Amit Varma]: out about how, you know, by the end of 2020, there were like 1000s of papers on coronavirus

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:06.180
[Amit Varma]: just proliferating all over the place, so much productive work kind of happening on

02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:10.900
[Amit Varma]: this, which can, you know, show benefits down the line for future pandemics, or even understanding

02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:15.500
[Amit Varma]: our biology a little better in general. So give me a sense of what's been happening in

02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:18.300
[Amit Varma]: the science since this was discovered.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:23.920
[Guest]: Yeah, some of this was happening. You are absolutely right that it was in many ways

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:30.300
[Guest]: fortuitous that it happened when it did happen, even I would say, as opposed to five years

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:35.540
[Guest]: ago, I wouldn't even go back 40 years, I would say even, even five years ago, or 10 years

02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:44.180
[Guest]: ago, or 20 years ago, we have to think about when when HIV first started infecting, or

02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:51.420
[Guest]: when HIV became a major cause of AIDS in the 80s, and was spreading all across the world

02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:58.380
[Guest]: at that time, it took many years for the genomes to be sequenced. At that time, there was no

02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:06.060
[Guest]: RT-PCR diagnostic test. And then if we flash forward from that to even SARS, which was

02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:15.140
[Guest]: when I was doing my PhD, at that time, it took months to get the sequence of a genome.

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:20.900
[Guest]: And now we can get genome sequences very quickly. And that has been part of what has been done

02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:27.180
[Guest]: with this genomic surveillance. It is scary that we are finding variants, but we are finding

02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:31.780
[Guest]: variants because we are able to look for variants, and we're able to sequence hundreds of 1000s

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:37.960
[Guest]: of genomes fairly quickly. We would not have known about that in the past. So, so the science

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:43.440
[Guest]: at that level, and that's because of, of next generation sequencing, and the both the cost

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:49.260
[Guest]: of that has gone down, and the speed and accuracy of that is, is just mind blowing from that

02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:55.220
[Guest]: respect. With respect to vaccines, also, the platforms that are available now with all

02:15:55.220 --> 02:16:01.140
[Guest]: the molecular platforms and the RNA platform, a number of things had to happen to be able

02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:09.060
[Guest]: to make the RNA stable and to be able to deliver that because RNA is a fairly unstable molecule.

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:14.940
[Guest]: And to be able to deliver that and the seminal papers happened just a few years before this

02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:22.100
[Guest]: mRNA vaccine came out for or these two mRNA vaccines, the Pfizer one and the Moderna one

02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:28.660
[Guest]: came out last year and were shown to have fantastic efficacy. And so, again, I mentioned

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:34.260
[Guest]: the history of that and that was definitely a perfect storm of that. One other aspect

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:39.820
[Guest]: of this is we were just talking about the structural biology, but the spike protein

02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:46.620
[Guest]: was the structure of the spike protein was determined very, very quickly because there

02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:54.700
[Guest]: were a couple of labs, Jason McClellan being one, who had identified the structure of the

02:16:54.700 --> 02:17:02.180
[Guest]: MERS coronavirus spike protein. And he used a very ingenious technique of basically stapling

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:07.940
[Guest]: it with two molecules, two building blocks, which are known as prolines. So he used two

02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:14.380
[Guest]: prolines to be able to stabilize it and and he knew that trick. And that trick was utilized

02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:20.740
[Guest]: in the design of three of the vaccines that seemed to be working very well, the Pfizer,

02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:26.020
[Guest]: the Moderna and the J&J vaccine. So all of these things happened. Most people are not

02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:30.900
[Guest]: aware of them and perhaps they don't need to be aware of them. But you are absolutely

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:35.100
[Guest]: right. And now that these platforms have been shown to work, that we know that we can go

02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:43.740
[Guest]: through trials in such a rapid manner, they will be used for other viruses and for other

02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:49.940
[Guest]: infectious diseases. But also the pace by which these booster shots can now be created

02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:56.020
[Guest]: for any variants of concern is also quite spectacular. And that's definitely on the

02:17:56.020 --> 02:18:01.900
[Guest]: scientific front. On the non-scientific front, just the technology that has advanced over

02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:07.460
[Guest]: the past few years, and has allowed us to work from home and even have this conversation,

02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:13.660
[Guest]: this didn't exist, the Wi-Fi, the broadband, none of this existed, even 10 years ago at

02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:18.540
[Guest]: the level that people could work from home in large numbers. And then finally, I will

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:23.820
[Guest]: point out the information on the internet where people can actually look at cases in

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:29.260
[Guest]: their own area. And information can sometimes be paralyzing, but I always feel that it's

02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:33.380
[Guest]: better to know than the alternative and then to be ignorant. And to be able to see the

02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:40.100
[Guest]: cases in the area, the measures that are being taken in real time. This is the first pandemic

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:46.380
[Guest]: of that, of the flattening the curve, so as to speak. And all of these things happened

02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:50.220
[Guest]: at this time, it would not have been possible in any previous pandemic.

02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:54.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's so stunning. And I couldn't agree with you more about, you know, that even this

02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.660
[Amit Varma]: conversation would not have been possible 10 years ago, we may not have known of each

02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:01.500
[Amit Varma]: other. You know, you may never have written the book because who knows, you know, to sort

02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:04.700
[Amit Varma]: of just be asked by a publisher who's looking at your tweets and saying, huh, this guy knows

02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:09.820
[Amit Varma]: what he's talking about. So it's quite remarkable. But it's also a thought that, you know, as

02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:13.700
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned earlier, that not everybody has this. I mean, if you just for example,

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:16.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, we take the internet so much for granted, the people in Kashmir went so many

02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:21.900
[Amit Varma]: months without it, you know, and for us, it's like oxygen, we can't imagine life without

02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:27.300
[Amit Varma]: it. At one point in this book, you talk about how these viruses that cause respiratory diseases

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:31.460
[Amit Varma]: are a problem, because you said, I think I'm quoting from memory here, quote, breathing

02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:36.220
[Amit Varma]: is not optional, stop quote. And in a similar sense, I think for many of us who are now

02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:40.940
[Amit Varma]: used to it and take it for granted, the internet is something like that. Before I kind of move

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.700
[Amit Varma]: on to my next question, I also want to sort of, you know, you mentioned the structure

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:50.180
[Amit Varma]: again, another line that I was struck by from the book about what the virus does about,

02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:53.660
[Amit Varma]: you know, the way it's looking to fit into a cell is that at one point, you wrote, quote,

02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:58.220
[Amit Varma]: a virus is like a thief going from one house to another with one key, trying to see what

02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:02.980
[Amit Varma]: it can open with it, stop quote, which is a stunning line, like, you know, I'm going

02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:08.060
[Amit Varma]: to, you know, show this to my writing students as an example of show don't tell about how,

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:13.020
[Amit Varma]: you know, just with one visual, you make so much so clear. And at another point, another

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:17.420
[Amit Varma]: line of yours that I loved, was when you talk about how we can't make out the colour of

02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:22.500
[Amit Varma]: the virus, and contrary to the popular depictions of it, which is red and all that. And you

02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:28.020
[Amit Varma]: say, quote, SARS-CoV-2 does not look like a lychee, stop quote. So all this is, you

02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:31.900
[Amit Varma]: know, and the book is full of stuff like this. So for anyone who's listening, you know, just

02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:37.300
[Amit Varma]: kind of pick up the book, you'll read it in one sitting and hopefully, you know, gift

02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:41.300
[Amit Varma]: it to all your friends, because everyone needs to know this stuff. So my next question is

02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:48.140
[Amit Varma]: about what does this virus do within the body? Because even that some someplace where our

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:52.020
[Amit Varma]: knowledge has been evolving, and perhaps the virus has also been evolving, but our knowledge

02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:57.740
[Amit Varma]: has been evolving, like, it's not just a respiratory thing. It's, you know, it does so many different

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:01.940
[Amit Varma]: things it, you know, the symptoms are, can be different, they can be respiratory, they

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:07.020
[Amit Varma]: can be fever, they can be gastrointestinal, where it, like you pointed out, it attaches

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:14.420
[Amit Varma]: to the, you know, ACE2 receptors within those particular tracts. And it causes blood clotting.

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:17.780
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes a virus doesn't kill you, the immune system does with, you know, what are

02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:23.180
[Amit Varma]: called cytokine storms, which you also described and explained so well in your book. Give me

02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:28.180
[Amit Varma]: a picture of what happens, you know, what are the different things that the virus does

02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:33.140
[Amit Varma]: within the body? And what are those things which, you know, make it so much more lethal,

02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:38.540
[Amit Varma]: and so much more something we should worry about than some of the previous sort of viruses

02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:39.540
[Guest]: of this sort?

02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:46.340
[Guest]: Yeah, so in a lot of asymptomatic people, and those who have very, very mild infection,

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:52.860
[Guest]: the extent of the virus spread is basically the nose and the upper respiratory tract.

02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:57.180
[Guest]: And they are still infectious, because when they are sneezing, when they are breathing,

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.980
[Guest]: those virus particles, at least in the early part of the infection, they are, they are,

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:07.540
[Guest]: they're coming out from their nose and their mouth and their throat. After a while, the

02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:13.100
[Guest]: virus though, it goes in certain people. So that may be the extent of infection in a lot

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:17.060
[Guest]: of people who are spreading the disease. In other people, though, then the virus goes

02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:22.940
[Guest]: down into into the delicate parts of the lungs, and then infects there. And that's when the

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:29.420
[Guest]: disease starts to get more severe. And we have people who need oxygen, sometimes ventilation

02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:34.620
[Guest]: as well. And from that point, once it goes down there, and then the immune response starts

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:40.820
[Guest]: with the hyperactive immune response, and the cytokine storms, that's when it becomes

02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:46.500
[Guest]: almost a battle. And then from there, the virus can go through the bloodstream and infect

02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:52.540
[Guest]: other parts of the body as well. And this is sort of has been a moving target. At first,

02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:57.380
[Guest]: everyone, as you mentioned, thought it was a respiratory virus. But now it's known to

02:22:57.380 --> 02:23:03.380
[Guest]: infect various other parts of the body as well. It's been definitely found, even in

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:10.940
[Guest]: the nervous system. And, and even it's thought to be found in parts of the brain, and is

02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:17.940
[Guest]: responsible for this aspect of long COVID now, which is also referred to as post COVID

02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:24.540
[Guest]: syndrome, in which people are having mental effects of this. In addition to the the loss

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:31.380
[Guest]: of smell that's happening, there are GI tract disturbances, as well in a number of people.

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:38.180
[Guest]: Early on, it was thought that it was spread a lot through through fecal matter. That does

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:44.260
[Guest]: not seem to be the case. Early on, it was thought to be spread a lot through surfaces

02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:51.580
[Guest]: and surface contamination. That now is thought to be minor and surface cleaning and decontamination

02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:57.100
[Guest]: does not have to be as much as it is before. But basically, you are right, it can in the

02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:02.060
[Guest]: first stage, it's in the upper part of the respiratory tract, then it goes down to the

02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:09.060
[Guest]: lower part of the respiratory tract. And then there is this, this hyper immune response stage

02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:15.100
[Guest]: as well, that that happens in people. And because of this, because it's such a moving

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:22.020
[Guest]: target, there is no single drug that is a magic bullet. Because in the early part of

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.180
[Guest]: the stage, what you're trying to do is you're trying to stop viral replication. But later

02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:30.980
[Guest]: on, you're actually trying to slow down your immune response. You don't want to slow down

02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:34.780
[Guest]: your immune response at the first part of the infection, because then it might get to

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:39.420
[Guest]: become more life threatening as well. And then what happens is if you use a lot of the

02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:45.020
[Guest]: antivirals towards the last part of the last part of the disease, then it's it's not as

02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:52.260
[Guest]: effective anymore, either. Most antivirals work very well in the early part of the infection.

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:57.020
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things that I noticed about the policy response was that the policy

02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:02.420
[Amit Varma]: response initially consisted mostly of blunt tools, you know, like lockdown and like whatever.

02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come back to that later. And part of that is just state capacity, both intellectual

02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:10.700
[Amit Varma]: capacity and your actual manpower and all that. But, you know, if we move away from

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:14.780
[Amit Varma]: policy to the scientific response, one, there has been some remarkable science happening

02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:20.140
[Amit Varma]: in all these really different vaccines coming out. And we'll discuss that in detail as well.

02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:24.780
[Amit Varma]: But as far as the treatment is concerned, it seems that what was thrown at the disease

02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:29.860
[Amit Varma]: to begin with, were blunt tools in the sense that they were things that might have worked

02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:35.940
[Amit Varma]: in the past for, you know, other viruses, or I think remdesivir was tried during Ebola

02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:40.380
[Amit Varma]: and didn't really work even there. And there are, you know, even though everyone in India

02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:45.100
[Amit Varma]: is talking about shortage of it, it's still, you know, trials haven't really shown that

02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:49.980
[Amit Varma]: it even works. There still seems to be this massive fog, people have tried drugs of the

02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:54.540
[Amit Varma]: past, people have thrown all kinds of quackery at the problem. What's been the reason for

02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:59.540
[Amit Varma]: that, that when science quickly figured out structure, and, you know, genetic code, and

02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:03.300
[Amit Varma]: all of that, all of those things, and came out with all these incredible vaccines, why

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:09.300
[Amit Varma]: is it so difficult to treat when it actually gets going? And what are the sort of the different

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:14.580
[Amit Varma]: methods that have been tried and that haven't worked? And, and here, it seems that it is

02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:18.500
[Amit Varma]: almost like science in the battlefield. It's not like you're doing science in a lab, you're

02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:22.660
[Amit Varma]: doing science in a battlefield where every day, you know, medics are also coping with

02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:27.660
[Amit Varma]: the pressure of trying to figure a way out this, this shit then gets politicized. Because

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:33.020
[Amit Varma]: if Trump says hydroxychloroquine is the answer, then everyone, you know, gets on that bandwagon.

02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:38.540
[Amit Varma]: Where is the science on it? Why is this aspect, you know, so difficult?

02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:42.540
[Guest]: And that's one thing that I worry about as well is that when the next pandemic strikes,

02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:48.380
[Guest]: if it is a respiratory virus, if we don't have a medicine cabinet of drugs, if we don't

02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:54.740
[Guest]: have a way to develop vaccines very quickly, if we don't have pan coronavirus vaccines

02:26:54.740 --> 02:27:00.940
[Guest]: and pan influenza vaccines in the future, then we will be stuck with a similar situation

02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:07.860
[Guest]: just like this, where the tools at the start of the pandemic are very blunt instruments,

02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:13.340
[Guest]: such as the measures that were taken during 1918 and 1919. And even before that, with

02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:19.100
[Guest]: lockdowns and quarantines and school closures and, and businesses closures and masks and

02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:22.940
[Guest]: things like that. They are effective, but you are absolutely right. They are not very

02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:29.100
[Guest]: precise tools. They are very blunt instruments. And part of that is that it takes really a

02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:37.580
[Guest]: long time to develop drugs longer than to develop vaccines. Vaccines can use these platforms

02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:42.220
[Guest]: and they can, they can be created in at least what we noticed in this case, they can be

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:47.460
[Guest]: created in a shorter amount of time. So all the drugs that we have for this were repurposed

02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:56.100
[Guest]: from previous diseases and for other, other outcomes and they're used as other treatments.

02:27:56.100 --> 02:28:02.580
[Guest]: And so what we have here is that drugs that were not designed for this particular virus.

02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:08.400
[Guest]: So we know all the structure, we know what the function is. And now we are at the stage

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:13.380
[Guest]: that a number of these drugs are in phase one and some of them are, I believe are in

02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:18.940
[Guest]: phase two as well, where they will be available. So, but you can see it's taken over a year

02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:25.680
[Guest]: and in pandemic terms, that is not acceptable as, as far as I see it. So we do need to build

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:36.300
[Guest]: up a set of other broadly applicable or broadly usable drugs for future pandemics that, that

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:43.640
[Guest]: target some of these specific targets that we know to be existing for RNA viruses. The

02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:50.780
[Guest]: problem with that, and I've mentioned this elsewhere is, is a lot of the incentives and

02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:56.300
[Guest]: a lot of the economic aspects of creating a drug where it takes a few hundred million

02:28:56.300 --> 02:29:02.140
[Guest]: dollars to actually get a drug. And it takes many years to go through and run the entire

02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:07.860
[Guest]: gauntlet of trials to get the drugs out there. But when there isn't a pandemic, there is

02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:13.820
[Guest]: no demand for that drug. So there, you cannot price the drug to actually even recoup your

02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:19.540
[Guest]: costs. So I think the description of this that's been used, and I like it a lot, is

02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:25.340
[Guest]: that no one really values the fire extinguisher until there's a fire. So how are you going

02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:29.500
[Guest]: to price that fire extinguisher? How are you actually going to go through the research

02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:35.340
[Guest]: and development process to make that? And my hope is that now with this pandemic, people

02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:43.620
[Guest]: will see this as a serious threat to human populations in the future, and there will

02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:48.460
[Guest]: be public investment. I think there has to be a certain level of public investment in

02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:55.140
[Guest]: many of these drugs for the future. And so when the next pandemic invariably hits, we

02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:59.740
[Guest]: will be better prepared to respond with drugs at the outset.

02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:03.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that's a great point. The incentives problem is massive. And it's something that

02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:08.460
[Amit Varma]: I've also addressed in my past episodes, that if you think back at a politician, say, 10

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:13.220
[Amit Varma]: years ago, you know, if he spends a ton of money preparing for something that does not

02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:17.540
[Amit Varma]: happen, you know, there's so many other things he could do with that money, there's so much

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:24.380
[Amit Varma]: opportunity cost, how do you even and politicians have short lifespans in terms of there is

02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:28.620
[Amit Varma]: always the electoral cycle, they're always looking at the next election. So spend the

02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:33.500
[Amit Varma]: money on something that will help them get those votes, rather than, you know, spend

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:38.420
[Amit Varma]: on the unseen, you know, preventing a pandemic, because if you if you're too successful, no,

02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:42.180
[Amit Varma]: you know, people will think, hey, why did he kind of do all that spending, and hopefully

02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:48.340
[Amit Varma]: this pandemic will sort of be like a reality check and push for more of that. So it's not

02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:54.700
[Amit Varma]: so bad the next time around. Tell me now about the vaccines, because I remember, you know,

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:59.300
[Amit Varma]: up till a few months ago, you had, you know, scientists and doctors and all of that going

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:03.980
[Amit Varma]: on air and saying entirely plausibly, that listen, there has never been a vaccine for

02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:08.020
[Amit Varma]: any Coronavirus. For example, though, you've pointed out in your book that in animals that

02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:13.300
[Amit Varma]: has but I think, but not in none of the ones that affect humans, that scientists have been

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:18.860
[Amit Varma]: trying for decades to find a vaccine for HIV, and they haven't succeeded, we may never have

02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:23.620
[Amit Varma]: a vaccine. And, and now we have so many vaccines, and they're all so different. And they're

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:28.780
[Amit Varma]: all remarkable. And you know, with the mRNA ones, it seems like they're kind of, you know,

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:34.540
[Amit Varma]: designed on a computer. It's just like miraculous. Take me a little bit, I mean, you know, share

02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:38.860
[Amit Varma]: a little bit of the wonder of what has just happened, and which I think most normal people

02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:43.460
[Amit Varma]: just don't get that what a freaking miracle it is almost.

02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:49.420
[Guest]: Yeah, and they were partly designed on a computer and they worked really well. And definitely,

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:57.460
[Guest]: so I have a friend who works for one of the major vaccine manufacturers for the mRNA vaccine.

02:31:57.460 --> 02:32:03.660
[Guest]: And he and I converse quite a bit on Twitter, he, he reviewed a certain number of chapters

02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:10.060
[Guest]: of this book. And we were just talking about it the other day that even I don't think anyone

02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:19.060
[Guest]: expected the those vaccines to work as well as they did. If you recall, the initial efficacy

02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:25.740
[Guest]: target was anything above 50% efficacy will be approved if it and the the endpoint that

02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:31.060
[Guest]: they use was because they wanted to lessen the severity of disease and hospitalizations

02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:37.720
[Guest]: and death was was basically symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease. But now if you tell anyone

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:43.580
[Guest]: you have to take a 50% efficacy vaccine, nobody will take it. Everyone is talking about even

02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:51.740
[Guest]: AstraZeneca, which has been remarkably successful in in halting the number of cases in the UK

02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:57.220
[Guest]: and saying I don't want to take that vaccine because there are now vaccines with with 95%

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:03.700
[Guest]: efficacy that that have been created. And in this case, this has happened because the

02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:13.620
[Guest]: spike protein was relatively a soft target for for the immune system and in terms of

02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:19.180
[Guest]: the antibodies and the T cell responses that were possible. With the case of HIV, HIV is

02:33:19.180 --> 02:33:26.500
[Guest]: so elusive. If you think about the variants that we have, you can think about HIV as variants

02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:33.060
[Guest]: times a million or even times a few few million in that you're not actually looking at even

02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:39.700
[Guest]: one one virus that you can create as a certain set of immune responses to you're you're looking

02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:46.380
[Guest]: at a whole galaxy of viruses under that HIV umbrella. So in this case, we were quite lucky

02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:52.780
[Guest]: in that there was basically, essentially one virus. And we were also lucky that when the

02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:57.540
[Guest]: predominant strain changed, there was one mutant that became predominant in the middle

02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:03.920
[Guest]: of 2020. Most people didn't care about it because it wasn't that much more infectious

02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:09.860
[Guest]: and all the vaccines seem to work against it. We definitely got quite lucky, although

02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:15.780
[Guest]: it remains to be seen now like how long that immunity lasts for. It could be anywhere from

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:20.700
[Guest]: I suspect it would be in the order of at least a year. But I think scientists are saying

02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:22.980
[Amit Varma]: it could be anywhere from eight months to two years.

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:27.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And there's a striking quote in your chapter on vaccines where, you know, right

02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:33.140
[Amit Varma]: at the end, you say, quote, vaccines don't save lives. Vaccinations save lives, stop

02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:38.260
[Amit Varma]: quote. And this again, you know, takes a focus away from the science purely to everything

02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:42.380
[Amit Varma]: else that is happening. And you said earlier in this episode that, you know, the science

02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:46.620
[Amit Varma]: is the easiest part of many problems to solve. You know, there's all this other stuff that

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:50.820
[Amit Varma]: is happening. Like we've seen, you know, in the course of the last year, how much things

02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:56.420
[Amit Varma]: get politicised, you know, the wearing of masks almost became an ideological issue,

02:34:56.420 --> 02:35:01.020
[Amit Varma]: you know, and all of that. And you know, once you take a stand, you harden down on the stand

02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:06.140
[Amit Varma]: and then it's, you know, you've got your own narrative going on. And that's all that matters.

02:35:06.140 --> 02:35:12.580
[Amit Varma]: So as a scientist, just looking at how the response has been and how, you know, everything's

02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:17.340
[Amit Varma]: panned out, what are your kind of feelings on what is happening? Like, is it a sense

02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:20.980
[Amit Varma]: of that look, you know, science could have progressed much more, but fine, these are

02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:25.420
[Amit Varma]: setbacks, but at least we are progressing. Or is it do you sometimes feel like what is

02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:29.500
[Amit Varma]: even the point when you look at all this nonsense that's happening in the real world, all this

02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:33.680
[Amit Varma]: incredible politics where we now know, you know, we are in the second wave in India,

02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:38.260
[Amit Varma]: and you've got these large public gatherings, you know, happening all over the place. And

02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:41.980
[Amit Varma]: in your book, of course, you've, you know, in past pandemics, and in your book, I think

02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:46.020
[Amit Varma]: you've mentioned a couple of them. We know what the large gatherings do, you know, I

02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:50.340
[Amit Varma]: think you mentioned cholera, and Chinmay may have mentioned in his book cholera during

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:57.060
[Amit Varma]: the Kumbh Mela, or even during the Hajj, just so that we don't seem to be picking on one

02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:02.380
[Amit Varma]: particular community, you know, so what does kind of one do about all that? What are your

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:03.580
[Guest]: feelings on this?

02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:10.700
[Guest]: It is incredibly frustrating to see this. And I saw this play out over the course of

02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:16.380
[Guest]: the last year. And in an over, over time, as I've lived in the United States, you here

02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:22.820
[Guest]: you have this country, which in terms of the scientific output, and in terms of scientific

02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:28.900
[Guest]: and medical advances, is definitely one of the countries at the forefront. And you see

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:35.820
[Guest]: this in terms of the research, the guidance, even the CDC plan, they had a pandemic preparedness

02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:42.740
[Guest]: plan for just this kind of situation. And then on the other hand, you see this, this

02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:50.100
[Guest]: subset of people, who regardless of what is presented to them, live in this post truth

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:58.200
[Guest]: world where ideology dictates what they believe, and that has real world and, and consequences

02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:07.580
[Guest]: on people's lives. I mean, at this time 550,000 people have died in this country of a largely

02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:12.540
[Guest]: preventable disease. I'm not saying that, that people would not have died. But so many

02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:18.980
[Guest]: people did not have to die in this country. And that definitely is infuriating. And from

02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:27.200
[Guest]: that perspective, I will say yes, that it is a failing of society in general. And maybe

02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:33.860
[Guest]: we don't inculcate enough critical thinking, or maybe we don't, we don't see things from

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:39.580
[Guest]: the perspective of the broader holistic view. And we're thinking more in terms of our group

02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:45.860
[Guest]: and our community and our own selfish needs and our desires and beliefs. But that is something

02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:51.700
[Guest]: that definitely will need to be solved. And I think in 2021, one of the big issues of

02:37:51.700 --> 02:37:57.700
[Guest]: this year is going to be around vaccination. Inequality definitely plays a part with some

02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:03.460
[Guest]: countries having received very few doses of the vaccine. And those might be breeding grounds

02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:10.380
[Guest]: for future variants as well. But even within India, you see like this dichotomy right now

02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:17.680
[Guest]: of people, a lot of people, mainly urban, mainly educated, mainly middle class to upper

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:23.160
[Guest]: middle class or even rich, who want vaccines and are now queuing up and demanding that

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:30.220
[Guest]: they receive vaccines. And a large number of people who are unaware of what these vaccines

02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:37.420
[Guest]: might do to prevent severe disease, who have somehow, who are somehow under this notion

02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:42.780
[Guest]: that this, this pandemic is not really a big deal or wasn't even a big deal. They don't

02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:50.220
[Guest]: see these variants as causing any future disease and are really more scared of the vaccines

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:57.540
[Guest]: than they are of the, of the disease, of the virus and of the variants. And so I see this

02:38:57.540 --> 02:39:01.580
[Guest]: as a communications breakdown to both sets of people. I mean, the communications have

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:07.580
[Guest]: to be different to both groups of people. You have to communicate and have outreach

02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:12.140
[Guest]: to people to convince them to take the vaccine. And in that case, it can be sort of a heavy

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:17.860
[Guest]: handed way of pushing people or, or, or lathi charging them and forcing them to take vaccines

02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:23.940
[Guest]: or even financial incentives always tend to backfire because people think that there is

02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:29.620
[Guest]: something wrong with the vaccine. That's why I'm getting paid to get the jab. So that's,

02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:34.100
[Guest]: that's the type of outreach that, that definitely hasn't happened to that extent. And then the

02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:39.940
[Guest]: other outreach of having a clear and consistent vaccine policy as to when people will be receiving

02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:45.540
[Guest]: vaccines for those people who actually want them right now. And, and yeah, I mean, it's

02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:46.540
[Amit Varma]: definitely a mess.

02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:50.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. I mean, I've heard so many crazy things about vaccine that I like, I don't even know

02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:53.940
[Amit Varma]: how to respond. Like one person I know said that they might as well put boiled water in

02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:57.540
[Amit Varma]: the vaccine. It doesn't make a difference. Another person said that the vaccines are

02:39:57.540 --> 02:40:02.420
[Amit Varma]: causing the second wave. A third person said that the reason the second wave is happening

02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:06.860
[Amit Varma]: is because the money bags behind the vaccines want you to get the vaccine. So you have these

02:40:06.860 --> 02:40:12.380
[Amit Varma]: ridiculous sort of theories going around. Now, another thing I want to kind of explore

02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:18.460
[Amit Varma]: and it's something that I've been thinking about is how differently a public policy people

02:40:18.460 --> 02:40:23.540
[Amit Varma]: on the one hand and scientists on the other hand may explore the question of truth and

02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:29.860
[Amit Varma]: evidence. For example, you know, for a lot of public policy, there is no definitive evidence

02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:34.460
[Amit Varma]: because you can't do a controlled experiment. Like my friend Shruti Rajgopalan once sort

02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:39.880
[Amit Varma]: of gave a great analogy. She said that imagine that you want to find out whether dropping

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.260
[Amit Varma]: a coin in water displaces water or not, right? Does the water level go up or down? Simple

02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:49.380
[Amit Varma]: enough to do. Now in a lab, obviously you can just take two beakers and put the coin

02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:53.340
[Amit Varma]: in one of them and you can measure it and everything is controlled. But imagine doing

02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:57.780
[Amit Varma]: it in a swimming pool where you put the coin in the swimming pool and you try to see what's

02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:03.120
[Amit Varma]: happening. And there is no way of getting a meaningful result. And there are just so

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.820
[Amit Varma]: many other factors, so many variables that come into play. And you don't know counterfactuals

02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:12.780
[Amit Varma]: either. You know, now I see this that, you know, a public policy people may therefore

02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:17.940
[Amit Varma]: come from an ideological lens. And you know, and it's really interesting how the ideological

02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:24.180
[Amit Varma]: lens affects how people look at certain measures like lockdowns. So people on the right over

02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:28.740
[Amit Varma]: here because Modiji did the lockdown, were with the lockdown. But in the US, it was just

02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:35.020
[Amit Varma]: the opposite where because Trump did not want a lockdown, they were like, you know, we don't

02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:39.100
[Amit Varma]: need a lockdown and all of that. Now the thing with a lockdown is that you can never actually

02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:43.860
[Amit Varma]: get evidence, evidence on whether it worked or not. You simply don't know the counterfactuals.

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:47.380
[Amit Varma]: Forget every country being different from each other. Every district is different from

02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:51.940
[Amit Varma]: each other. Bandra is different from Andheri. You cannot possibly do a controlled experiment

02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:56.720
[Amit Varma]: or have any sense of whether something worked or not. So in public policy, you're handling

02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:02.820
[Amit Varma]: all these variables. In science, you're not. Now, what I see is that both of these sort

02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:09.220
[Amit Varma]: of lenses of looking, which are perfectly valid lenses in their specific fields, that

02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:14.220
[Amit Varma]: a public policy person always has to believe that even if the evidence appears to be for

02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:17.980
[Amit Varma]: him, it may not be. Correlation may not be causation. There are so many other factors

02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:23.580
[Amit Varma]: involved. Nothing is definite. But taking this lens to science becomes a huge problem

02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:28.780
[Amit Varma]: and vice versa. That if science people are always, you know, that what works, what doesn't

02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:31.900
[Amit Varma]: work, we want a clear answer. There has to be a clear answer. There has to be a way to

02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:37.420
[Amit Varma]: design a clear answer that wouldn't work. Now, one example of the former kind where,

02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:43.140
[Amit Varma]: you know, people within politics or policy take that sort of lens where the truth is

02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:47.620
[Amit Varma]: kind of up for grabs and it's a narrative that matters that can really affect the response.

02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:51.100
[Amit Varma]: Like just a couple of days ago, our Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said something about

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:55.500
[Amit Varma]: homeopathy must be encouraged and the Ministry of Ayush. And I've written about them in the

02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:59.220
[Amit Varma]: past. Even in your book, you talk about, for example, how so many people don't get the

02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:05.640
[Amit Varma]: importance of double blind, randomized control trials. And it's not just that people think

02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.860
[Amit Varma]: homeopathy works because of the placebo effect. They also think it works because, and like

02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:14.300
[Amit Varma]: you've pointed out in your book and I've written about it in columns in the past, that many

02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:18.460
[Amit Varma]: diseases will just revert to the mean, that you'll be bad, you'll be bad for a while and

02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:22.140
[Amit Varma]: then you get better and people will ascribe that and give credit to the medicine and all

02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:27.260
[Amit Varma]: of that. And once they believe in a particular medicinal system, it almost becomes an ideological

02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:31.140
[Amit Varma]: thing. And then the confirmation bias kicks in. And when it appears to work, they'll be

02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:35.660
[Amit Varma]: like, wow. And when it doesn't work, they'll be like, whatever, it could have been worse.

02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:41.220
[Amit Varma]: And all this shit happens. So but the fundamental question is about these conflicting mindsets,

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:45.460
[Amit Varma]: where some people take the mindset to science, where they don't realize that there are definite

02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:49.660
[Amit Varma]: truths out there. And all science is a quest to get closer and closer to that you never

02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:55.020
[Amit Varma]: absolutely know everything. And similarly, there can be an attitude, which is not a science

02:43:55.020 --> 02:44:01.300
[Amit Varma]: attitude, more an engineering attitude, perhaps, where, you know, that where people will believe

02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:04.780
[Amit Varma]: that all society can be fixed from the top down, and we can find the right answer for

02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:07.900
[Amit Varma]: everything. Is this something that you've thought about or noticed?

02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:13.660
[Guest]: I have and I think you expressed some of the limitations of each of these approaches. Each

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:19.180
[Guest]: of these approaches quite succinctly, definitely with respect to drugs and the confirmation

02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:27.620
[Guest]: bias, but that applies to anything that we look at. Retrospectively, we can look at previous

02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:32.620
[Guest]: pandemics and say, okay, this is we should have prepared for this, because something

02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:39.300
[Guest]: in this pandemic was is very similar to this. And we can say, no, this pandemic is absolutely

02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:43.860
[Guest]: different from every other pandemic, because these other additional aspects are different.

02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:49.820
[Guest]: So we will, the observer will find out what he or she seeks and confirm that bias with

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:57.260
[Guest]: any type of retrospective analysis. With any type of forward looking analysis with a very

02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:05.380
[Guest]: heterogeneous and large system with so many variables and unknowns, basically stochastic

02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:13.460
[Guest]: processes, it becomes extremely, extremely difficult. I think the keys here are to basically

02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:20.500
[Guest]: before the experiment is to set what the objectives are. If you're going to institute a lockdown,

02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:25.940
[Guest]: what is the objective that you want for that lockdown? And you can't change that or shift

02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:30.940
[Guest]: the goalpost halfway through or not make that clear. That has to be absolutely transparent

02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:36.820
[Guest]: for any public policy initiative. And that has to be known to the public as well, to

02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:41.820
[Guest]: get their buy in to get their involvement in that as well. And once they know the threat

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:50.060
[Guest]: of the disease, what the goals of that public policy outcome are. And then so in that sense,

02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:57.100
[Guest]: pragmatically, if you take an approach, and things don't turn out as badly as the model,

02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:04.500
[Guest]: then that's good. And why it exactly happened is not necessarily relevant. I mean, there's

02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:11.380
[Guest]: a parable involving the Buddha and it says, basically, there was someone who had been

02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:17.460
[Guest]: struck with an arrow. And when the person is struck with an arrow, he wants that arrow

02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:23.200
[Guest]: removed and he wants to get better. So all the processes of how that happens and why

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:28.900
[Guest]: that happens that can come at a later date. That does not necessarily appeal to me as

02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:35.220
[Guest]: a scientist, where I always feel uncomfortable with not knowing. And I always feel that there

02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:43.060
[Guest]: are too many uncertainties around that. And I saw that when the pandemic curve, the epidemic

02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:48.300
[Guest]: curve went down for India, and everyone was saying, well, the pandemic is over. And I

02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:53.200
[Guest]: said, well, it will take time to figure this out to tease out why this happened. And we

02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:59.300
[Guest]: cannot say that it happened because of any one favorite reason or any one favorite hypothesis

02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:04.620
[Guest]: until we figure it out. Because the exact opposite reason can contribute to a resurgence

02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:09.700
[Guest]: as well. And now we've seen a resurgence and there are many conflicting reasons as to why

02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:13.860
[Guest]: it happened. It could be any one of them, it could be all of them. But again, that will

02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:19.740
[Guest]: take time. So science sometimes takes as you mentioned, it takes time to figure out answers.

02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:25.500
[Guest]: And in that sort of fog of war, we don't have time to tease out what those answers might

02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:33.420
[Guest]: be. In that case, so what do we do? I think there are some models that we can apply. Now,

02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:38.140
[Guest]: as George Box said, all models are wrong, but some models are useful. So we have to

02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:45.420
[Guest]: figure out which model is actually useful for the parameter that we want. And again,

02:47:45.420 --> 02:47:50.700
[Guest]: as he said, all models are wrong, because a model is inherently based on the parameters

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:58.180
[Guest]: of that model, and, and the the variables and the constraints that you impose upon it.

02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:05.220
[Guest]: And it has to be for something as large and and as, as drawn out as this, it has to be

02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:11.300
[Guest]: extremely reductionist. It can only have a few variables. Otherwise, we're going to,

02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:17.940
[Guest]: but in the real world is is very full of chaos and of instances like the butterfly effect.

02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:23.980
[Guest]: So we don't know what, what changes early on determine and that's the case even with

02:48:23.980 --> 02:48:29.720
[Guest]: the trajectory of a pandemic. We don't know what could have stopped the pandemic early

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:35.220
[Guest]: on when it hit the scene in Wuhan. And were there things that could have been done at

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:42.300
[Guest]: that time that could have changed the trajectory of the pandemic. So certain events definitely

02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:47.860
[Guest]: play a part in that. And no model can can account for that. So I have thought of that.

02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:51.860
[Guest]: And I that's why I give you this, this long winded rambling answer that doesn't really

02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:54.260
[Guest]: get to answering it properly.

02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:59.980
[Amit Varma]: Oh, it's a lovely answer. And sometimes, you know, just asking the right questions and

02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:03.980
[Amit Varma]: teasing out the question is more important than finding an answer. And by the way, for

02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:10.140
[Amit Varma]: the many, many, many, many fashion model friends I have, I wish to validate your existence

02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:15.500
[Amit Varma]: and say that some of you are useful. And, you know, getting back to what you said about

02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:20.020
[Amit Varma]: the butterfly effect and chaos theory, and sometimes we don't know, and it strikes me

02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:25.820
[Amit Varma]: that these words we don't know, are actually so important for so many of us to internalize.

02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:31.460
[Amit Varma]: We are always so desperate to tell stories to ourselves, or, you know, get stories from

02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:37.780
[Amit Varma]: elsewhere, which explain everything, and everything can't quite be explained. So in this context,

02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:42.620
[Amit Varma]: before I get to my next question, I want to read out a great quote by Douglas Adams, which

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:48.900
[Amit Varma]: I love. This is Douglas Adams quote, imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking,

02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:53.020
[Amit Varma]: this is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in fits

02:49:53.020 --> 02:49:57.380
[Amit Varma]: me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been

02:49:57.380 --> 02:50:02.900
[Amit Varma]: made to have me in it. Now the puddle stop quote, Adams continues, this is such a powerful

02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:08.140
[Amit Varma]: idea that as the sun rises in the sky, and the air heats up, and as gradually the puddle

02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:12.060
[Amit Varma]: gets smaller and smaller, is still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's

02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:16.060
[Amit Varma]: going to be all right, because this world was meant to have a minute was built to have

02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:21.420
[Amit Varma]: a minute. So the moment he disappears, catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be

02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:27.020
[Amit Varma]: something that we need to be on the watch out for. And my question goes back to, you

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:31.060
[Amit Varma]: know, something we discussed earlier in another context, which is humility. And here, it's

02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:36.220
[Amit Varma]: humility about our species, that we tend to believe that we are masters of the universe,

02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:40.220
[Amit Varma]: we have sorted everything out. I have heard elsewhere that we are basically colonized

02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:44.260
[Amit Varma]: by bacteria, bacteria are the masters of the universe. In a different context, you could

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:49.380
[Amit Varma]: say that hey, viruses were possibly there before and they rule the roost and everything

02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:54.740
[Amit Varma]: is contingent, existence is contingent. And everything is so fragile. And if anything

02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:59.380
[Amit Varma]: over the last year, we should have got a greater sense of that and therefore developed more

02:50:59.380 --> 02:51:05.580
[Amit Varma]: humility and perhaps a compassion that comes with more humility. And so what, and it seems

02:51:05.580 --> 02:51:12.060
[Amit Varma]: to me that scientists would have the closest view of this, because you guys actually, you

02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:16.500
[Amit Varma]: know, every day confronting all those, all these miracles of nature, and realizing how

02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:22.220
[Amit Varma]: small a place, you know, we play in the universe. What are your sort of thoughts on this?

02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:31.540
[Guest]: I agree with you completely. I am constantly, I'm constantly amazed by how long humans live,

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:37.020
[Guest]: considering the amount of abuse we put on our bodies through our entire lives, and how

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:44.660
[Guest]: much we disrespect ourselves and all the things that we do. I mean, life itself is absolutely

02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:53.260
[Guest]: fascinating for me. And what you said definitely resonates with me, it strikes a chord. And

02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:59.380
[Guest]: this is where I disagree with some other experts like Harari, who wrote in Homo Deus, that

02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:05.500
[Guest]: there is this arc of progress where humans will continue to progress. But as you mentioned,

02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:11.300
[Guest]: a lot of it is just like so much dependent on random events. Our species could have been

02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:17.100
[Guest]: wiped out so many times in the past. And there are these pieces of evidence now that you

02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:23.340
[Guest]: can look at from a scientific perspective. And I think Tony Joseph, whose book you mentioned,

02:52:23.340 --> 02:52:28.100
[Guest]: he mentions a certain number of them. But there are others as well, where humanity could

02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:32.780
[Guest]: have been wiped out at any moment in the past, as when we were, when our ancestors were in

02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:38.620
[Guest]: Africa, when they were coming out of Africa. And even more recently, during the Cold War,

02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:44.860
[Guest]: when we were at the brink of mutual destruction between the superpowers, the world could have

02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:49.980
[Guest]: ended at that point. And just the fact that it didn't end doesn't mean that it had to

02:52:49.980 --> 02:52:55.260
[Guest]: be that way, as you so eloquently said, using that puddle analogy.

02:52:55.260 --> 02:53:00.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, the eloquence was Douglas Adams's, not mine. And in fact, if you think about

02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:03.980
[Amit Varma]: it, you know, the law of truly large numbers tells you that the universe will end one day,

02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:07.980
[Amit Varma]: it is incredibly inevitable. I mean, the law of truly large numbers, by the way, is different

02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:12.820
[Amit Varma]: from the law of large numbers. For my listeners, the law of truly large numbers says that if

02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:16.860
[Amit Varma]: there are enough iterations of something, then no matter how unlikely the you know,

02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:21.740
[Amit Varma]: the unlikeliest event is inevitable to take place, if there are enough iterations. I once

02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:26.020
[Amit Varma]: wrote a column on this in the context of poker, where the I think the headline of the column

02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:31.500
[Amit Varma]: was in unlikely is inevitable, that if you understand the law of truly large numbers,

02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:37.220
[Amit Varma]: you realize that you can't take anything for granted. There's so much luck in everything.

02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:40.580
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I've taken a lot of your time. And what I had actually planned to do was

02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:43.980
[Amit Varma]: talk about each chapter of your book one by one. But now I realized that that'll take

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:48.260
[Amit Varma]: another five or six hours, because there are such, such depth to the book. So we won't

02:53:48.260 --> 02:53:54.140
[Amit Varma]: do that. So I'll just ask kind of a couple of general questions before we end. And the

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:59.280
[Amit Varma]: first of the general questions is this, that how will this impact on medical sciences done

02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:05.840
[Amit Varma]: in future going ahead? Because like, is this sort of an inflection point for where maybe

02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:10.580
[Amit Varma]: in terms of focus on how we do things differently, or maybe just in terms of how a lot of the

02:54:10.580 --> 02:54:15.860
[Amit Varma]: other science, like, you know, understanding genetics, like even AI and medicine, which

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Eric Topol has written about so much, how were we at a turning point anyway? And has

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:24.340
[Amit Varma]: this accelerated the turning point? Moving ahead? What can we expect? Like one of the

02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:29.220
[Amit Varma]: things that I keep hearing about, and I wonder what your much more informed view on that

02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:33.940
[Amit Varma]: would be, is about how one day we can stop aging or reverse aging, which sounds wonderful

02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:38.420
[Amit Varma]: to me, because, you know, I was happier being young than middle aged, but I'd rather not

02:54:38.420 --> 02:54:44.620
[Amit Varma]: be old. What are your views on that? And in general, going forward, you know, what's the

02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:48.940
[Amit Varma]: state medical sciences in and, you know, do you think we'll be better prepared for the

02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:53.460
[Guest]: next pandemic? I definitely hope that we are better prepared for the next pandemic. And

02:54:53.460 --> 02:55:00.660
[Guest]: I think, at least with certain aspects, people will be more quick to, if it is a respiratory

02:55:00.660 --> 02:55:06.300
[Guest]: virus than to wear masks and to socially distance. We certainly understand the parlance, we everyone

02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:10.900
[Guest]: knows a lot more about viruses than they did a year ago. And I think that's definitely

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:16.960
[Guest]: a positive science is moving at breakneck speed, there is a lot more funding and realization

02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.560
[Guest]: in the world. One of the things that we noticed is that, again, maybe it's a confirmation

02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:28.260
[Guest]: bias on my part, but some of the countries that dealt with the first wave of the virus

02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:35.680
[Guest]: were ones that were not prepared during the SARS epidemic a few years ago. So their populations

02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:43.380
[Guest]: were very quick to wear masks, and were more compliant of some of the measures that were

02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:49.080
[Guest]: taken. Whether or not that there's a sort of a causal relationship there, I don't know.

02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:54.140
[Guest]: But that's just a very interesting observation. With respect to science and aging, that's

02:55:54.140 --> 02:56:01.780
[Guest]: a fantastic topic and one that I've been looking at myself as populations age over time. And

02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:09.220
[Guest]: it's something that we can go on about is basically around the 1800s onwards, we have

02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:15.560
[Guest]: added, most of the world has added about three decades to our lives, through basic hygiene,

02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:22.540
[Guest]: through antibiotics, and through modern medicine now. And now so we can see most of us will

02:56:22.540 --> 02:56:28.040
[Guest]: be able to see our children grow up, most of our children will survive into adulthood

02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:35.860
[Guest]: and see some of our grandchildren as well, which was not possible for most of humanity

02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:42.300
[Guest]: during our history. I don't think most people realize what an amazing achievement that is

02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:48.540
[Guest]: to be able to do that within less than 150 years. Now the next milestone is increasing

02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:54.420
[Guest]: that and making sure that people not only live longer, but actually have a very good

02:56:54.420 --> 02:57:00.100
[Guest]: health span where they are healthy during most of their life. And so that was actually

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:07.180
[Guest]: been a Faustian bargain in the sense that most of the world does not worry about diseases

02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:12.300
[Guest]: that cause infant mortality and infectious diseases. But on the other hand, there are

02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:18.700
[Guest]: diseases now of progressively older people that are becoming more prevalent, like heart

02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:25.260
[Guest]: disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism, that are affecting the quality of life. So

02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:30.700
[Guest]: if you live longer, at one point, everyone has to die, and they have to die of something.

02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:35.460
[Guest]: If you live longer, the diseases that you will die of are different than the diseases

02:57:35.460 --> 02:57:41.440
[Guest]: then you would have died of perhaps 150 or 200 years ago. What will happen in terms of

02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:49.340
[Guest]: society and how society responds once the pandemic is over is much, much harder to predict.

02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:55.420
[Guest]: On the one hand, I am hopeful that people will take infectious diseases more seriously.

02:57:55.420 --> 02:58:01.580
[Guest]: There will be more interest in science and in medicine. But on the other hand, I am also

02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:08.320
[Guest]: disheartened by the fact that even when certain countries are seeing that the pandemic is

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:14.560
[Guest]: raging on in other parts of the world, where millions of people are infected and thousands

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:21.180
[Guest]: of people are dying, they are immediately eager to move on and to just say that that's

02:58:21.180 --> 02:58:29.340
[Guest]: not my problem. And that sort of lack of foresight is not going to help us when we deal with

02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:34.980
[Guest]: a number of the major problems that face humanity right now. And I say right now because they

02:58:34.980 --> 02:58:40.660
[Guest]: are staring at us in the face in the next 10, 20 years. We are at the tipping point

02:58:40.660 --> 02:58:47.980
[Guest]: of climate change, deforestation, extinction of species. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics

02:58:47.980 --> 02:58:54.800
[Guest]: is going to cause a resurgence of antibiotic resistant superbugs. And all of this is happening

02:58:54.800 --> 02:59:01.000
[Guest]: right now. And they will require a longer term focus and more investment in science.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:07.200
[Guest]: But it depends on, I'm an optimistic person, but it depends on the day and what I'm seeing

02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:14.040
[Guest]: in the world around me. I'm not convinced that people take problems that are not immediate

02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:15.360
[Guest]: as seriously as they should.

02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:19.720
[Amit Varma]: So these are very wise and eloquent words. I mean, next time we do a podcast, we should

02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:22.920
[Amit Varma]: do a 10 hour episode because there is so much to discuss.

02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:28.280
[Guest]: No, I really enjoy talking with you because you're asking questions in a way, not just

02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:34.920
[Guest]: the questions, but in a way that you're actually half answering them. And I really like that.

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:41.640
[Guest]: There's a story by Sheckley, who's a science fiction writer, and it's basically a machine

02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:47.080
[Guest]: that knows the answer to everything. And this machine has been created, but the machine

02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:56.400
[Guest]: cannot solve any problems or provide any answers because to be able to do that, the questions

02:59:56.400 --> 03:00:01.680
[Guest]: have to be formulated in such a way that part of the answer is actually known. And I felt

03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:06.480
[Guest]: that having this discussion with you is just, we were just so much on the same wavelength

03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:09.240
[Guest]: and we were hitting a lot of the answers.

03:00:09.240 --> 03:00:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much. I'm not done, by the way, in case you think it's over. My final question

03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:16.760
[Amit Varma]: is to come. But my observation before my final question is about what you pointed out about,

03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:19.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, I asked a question about the state of the science after the pandemic and you

03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:24.320
[Amit Varma]: spoke about the state of society after the pandemic. And I think that's a fantastic subject

03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:29.520
[Amit Varma]: to think about. And it's like one of the things that I think has happened and it's not a good

03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:35.180
[Amit Varma]: sign is that the relationship between the society and the state has shifted to kind

03:00:35.180 --> 03:00:39.760
[Amit Varma]: of favour the state over this period of time where, you know, the state is asserting more

03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:44.440
[Amit Varma]: and more of its control. You see random rent seeking happening over things like whether

03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: people are wearing a mask when sitting alone in a car, you see more of state control, more

03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:53.280
[Amit Varma]: authoritarianism, you know, and one wonders whether, you know, freedoms taken away never

03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:57.480
[Amit Varma]: kind of get, you know, it never gets rolled back, it never comes back. So one has to sort

03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:01.160
[Amit Varma]: of think about that. But here's my last question that, you know, where we are sitting in April,

03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:05.020
[Amit Varma]: we are still kind of in a fog of war. And your brilliant book, which I hope everyone

03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:09.920
[Amit Varma]: listening to this reads will kind of give us a certain foundation of understanding about

03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:13.880
[Amit Varma]: everything that is happening. But beyond that, even having read the book, there are still

03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:19.320
[Amit Varma]: so many questions I have and questions that people have in general, such as that what

03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:23.200
[Amit Varma]: exactly is happening, you know, the second wave and it's just going on and on, when is

03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:30.120
[Amit Varma]: it going to end? What are the dangers? What is long COVID? Will the new normal after everything

03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:35.520
[Amit Varma]: settles down be different from what life was like before? And also how should we live?

03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:39.840
[Amit Varma]: Which is, you know, a deep question in terms of broader philosophical and ethical this

03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:44.800
[Amit Varma]: thing, but just in this context, just in the context of COVID that, you know, we now know

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:48.720
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of the washing of hands and all of that is a little bit of security theatre

03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:54.720
[Amit Varma]: because it doesn't really spread through surfaces. And, you know, even the temperature thing,

03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, fever is not necessarily a ubiquitous symptom. It's not even that common, but perhaps

03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:04.740
[Amit Varma]: it's okay. I don't really mind harmless bits of security theatre and all of that. But if

03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: you had to advise people on that broader question that look, COVID is not over. COVID is not

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.920
[Amit Varma]: 2020. It's very much 2021. It's still here with us. And like you said, we'll have to

03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:19.360
[Amit Varma]: live with it forever, perhaps in hopefully in much milder forms and with our bodies better

03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:23.680
[Amit Varma]: prepared for it and all of that, maybe, you know, whether an annual vaccine like the flu

03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:29.600
[Amit Varma]: vaccine in some places or whatever. But in general, what would you say that there's still

03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:35.720
[Amit Varma]: a lot of confusion about this? What advice would you give the non-scientist lay person

03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:41.120
[Amit Varma]: like me, who is just wondering that, hey, you know, what is happening and how long and

03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:46.920
[Guest]: what must we do to, you know, going forward? Yeah, I would say my first thing to say right

03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:58.080
[Guest]: now is don't worry too much. There are things in with aspects of unknown that we have to

03:02:58.080 --> 03:03:02.880
[Guest]: be able to deal with this uncertainty. And we have to be able to deal with this uncertainty

03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:12.400
[Guest]: over time and worrying does not change what is beyond our control as individuals and as

03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:18.120
[Guest]: participants in society. We have to think about the things that we can do, both in terms

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:25.040
[Guest]: of changing our society and being valuable contributors to our society, not just in the

03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:31.920
[Guest]: public health realm, but beyond that in what you were saying about ensuring our liberties

03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:39.360
[Guest]: as well. Beyond that, I would say definitely get vaccinated when your opportunity comes.

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:45.800
[Guest]: The vaccines will provide protection. You may be worried about how they do against variants.

03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:50.960
[Guest]: But again, science takes time. The vaccines are here now. They offer you some protection.

03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.080
[Guest]: If it is not adequate protection, then there will be booster shots, then you will take

03:03:55.080 --> 03:04:00.320
[Guest]: the booster shots. And so this is an ongoing thing. But you cannot, like you were mentioning

03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:05.960
[Guest]: Chess, it doesn't help to think about the end game all the time. Just think about maybe

03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:10.640
[Guest]: the next few moves and then we'll work out what the what the end game is. The variants

03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:17.720
[Guest]: are definitely contributing to the pandemic in various parts of the world and the resurgence.

03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:25.080
[Guest]: And based on what has been happening in India, we don't have the genomic data to say it with

03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:33.160
[Guest]: certainty. But I would say it's very, very likely that the various pandemics are causing

03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:41.040
[Guest]: this or are partly responsible for this new wave. And then people are obviously loosening

03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:45.060
[Guest]: their measures. There's another theory that people may be staying more indoors because

03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:49.960
[Guest]: of the warmer months. I don't know how much of these individually contribute to that.

03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:57.000
[Guest]: But I mean, the cases are real. The disease is real. It is serious. And long COVID, as

03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:03.400
[Guest]: we talked about, is something that is happening and it is real. So protect yourself. Hope

03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:09.440
[Guest]: for the best. Get vaccinated. The same measures that you were using in the past will be the

03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:14.920
[Guest]: same measures that will work for the variants as well. It's not a different virus. So conceptually,

03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:20.360
[Guest]: I had mentioned that you can think of people as virus factories as they're breathing out

03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:26.720
[Guest]: viruses in the book. So what you can think about with a variant as a very sort of simple

03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:34.120
[Guest]: analogy is that people are still virus factories. They're breathing out perhaps more viruses

03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:41.500
[Guest]: and perhaps fewer viruses need to enter your body to cause that level of disease as before.

03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:46.960
[Guest]: There might be more viral load and the infectious dose might be less. There could be other factors

03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:52.800
[Guest]: as well. But again, to simplify that, those are probably a certain number of factors that

03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:57.560
[Guest]: are involved in making some of the variants more infectious. But if you see that as well,

03:05:57.560 --> 03:06:02.000
[Guest]: you can see that the measures that you are taking, such as wearing masks and socially

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:09.080
[Guest]: distancing and limiting activities indoors will continue to be important. And then the

03:06:09.080 --> 03:06:15.240
[Guest]: broader question about life, that is definitely a philosophical one. And I think we always

03:06:15.240 --> 03:06:20.920
[Guest]: have to get back to the social aspects of this and the inequalities that we have been

03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:28.840
[Guest]: seeing all around the world. And we saw this even with HIV. And I mentioned this even at

03:06:28.840 --> 03:06:35.160
[Guest]: the end of the book, that the pandemic doesn't end when it ends only for us. And my fear

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:41.760
[Guest]: and worry is that even when it has ended for us and we are vaccinated and we're protected

03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:49.960
[Guest]: that COVID-19 becomes a disease of the underprivileged, of a disease of poverty, disease of certain

03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:55.400
[Guest]: parts of the world where it lingers on as a serious disease while we go on with our

03:06:55.400 --> 03:06:56.400
[Guest]: business.

03:06:56.400 --> 03:07:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Wise words again. And I must clarify here to my listeners that when Anirban is saying

03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:05.360
[Amit Varma]: limit indoor activity, he does not mean have all your sex in the park. What he basically

03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:10.760
[Amit Varma]: means is that, listen, we know that the spread of the virus really happens indoors. It's

03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:16.120
[Amit Varma]: much less outdoors. It really happens indoors, especially in air-conditioned spaces. So be

03:07:16.120 --> 03:07:21.240
[Amit Varma]: careful of social gatherings and all of that, especially the current virus with the infectious

03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:26.840
[Amit Varma]: levels it is at. We need to be careful. And I'll again double down on your wise advice.

03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:31.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, get vaccinated, take precautions, wear a mask. You know, I love the way that,

03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:36.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, in Southeast Asia, because of their past experience with, you know, pandemics

03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:42.080
[Amit Varma]: and pandemic scares, it almost became a cultural thing that if you have any kind of respiratory

03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:47.240
[Amit Varma]: disease, even if it's a flu, you wear a mask not to protect yourself, but out of concern

03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:51.240
[Amit Varma]: for your fellow person, you know, and that's become part of the culture. And that's a beautiful

03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:57.600
[Amit Varma]: thing. That is what a mask is. It is not meant to protect us as individuals, but to sort

03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:03.880
[Amit Varma]: of in a sense, you know, assert our place in society that we have a responsibility for

03:08:03.880 --> 03:08:08.840
[Amit Varma]: each other as well. And wearing a mask is part of that, but get vaccinated certainly.

03:08:08.840 --> 03:08:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And one more thing, if I might add, kindly do hop over to your nearest bookstore online

03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:19.240
[Amit Varma]: or offline and pick up Anirban's wonderful book. Anirban, thank you so much. I really

03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:21.840
[Amit Varma]: love this conversation. So much I learned today.

03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:25.920
[Guest]: Thank you so much for your kind words on the book and having this conversation with me.

03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:30.280
[Guest]: It's been a few hours, but it's like time has flown by. And as you mentioned, I could

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:33.840
[Guest]: have kept speaking with you for a few hours more.

03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, someday we'll no doubt meet again.

03:08:36.480 --> 03:09:05.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.
