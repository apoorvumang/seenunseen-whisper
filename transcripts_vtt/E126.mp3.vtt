00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Before we move on with this episode of the scene in the unseen do check out another awesome podcast from IVM podcast

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Cyrus says hosted by my old buddy Cyrus brocha

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.700
[Amit Varma]: The last time I tried to do push-ups I fell asleep here's what happened

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.160
[Amit Varma]: I decided that my life was too sedentary and I needed to get some exercise

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.440
[Amit Varma]: So I dusted off an old yoga mat last used in the 1990s

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Spread it on the floor and got down to do some good old push-ups

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.320
[Amit Varma]: But the problem is that I'm half Bengali and once I was prone on the floor

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.400
[Amit Varma]: I decided that the moment was too good to waste on activity and I drifted off to sleep

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.320
[Amit Varma]: I did do one push-up and I woke up and that's because I had to get up from the yoga mat and I suspect my

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Form wasn't too great

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.460
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, I'm not really the exception here in India fitness is not a big part of our culture

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.360
[Amit Varma]: Though I do see a lot of well-toned Bollywood wannabes around me in Warsaw

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.360
[Amit Varma]: And I have a private suspicion that they work out just to troll me

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.240
[Amit Varma]: But most Indians have low fitness levels and sport is also not a big deal among Indians

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.640
[Amit Varma]: We don't have a sporting culture as our lack of Olympic medals indicates the one sport

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.280
[Amit Varma]: We do follow cricket has lots of breaks in the action and until a couple of decades ago

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: It was not unusual to see potbellies on the cricket field

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.400
[Amit Varma]: There are many who argue that for a variety of reasons whether culture genetics India can never be a sporting nation

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
[Amit Varma]: But there are some who believe otherwise

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.440

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.320
[Amit Varma]: And if you are not moved and inspired by his account of that journey in the second half of this episode

[Amit Varma]: He's had a hell of a journey, but before we cut to the conversation, let's take a quick commercial break

[Amit Varma]: I've actually wanted to have you on the show for a long time

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.640
[Amit Varma]: It's a wonder that it took more than a hundred and twenty five episodes to finally get you on

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me and my listeners a little bit more about yourself

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.400
[Guest]: Okay, so really I started my career in a company called Patni which is better known for the place where people like in and then

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.720
[Guest]: Illegally and there the whole Infosys gang made it

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.280
[Guest]: But I started as a software engineer and at some point in time by doing that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.120
[Guest]: I was already into quizzing seriously into quizzing you appeared on quiz time. I was appeared in quiz time 1988 and I

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.240
[Guest]: thought that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.680
[Guest]: At that point in time. I was going around with this girl

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.960
[Guest]: Who was a brilliant student and she seemed to be really interested in computer science?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.440
[Guest]: And I said and she planned to spend the rest of her work life working on computer science

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.440
[Guest]: and I thought at that point in time that I

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.120
[Guest]: Should do something that I should be at least as interested in as she is in computer science to which point I said, okay

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.280
[Guest]: I'll do a year of software and then you know, do whatever else I that really interests me and it turned out to be quizzing

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.720
[Guest]: So that's where I joined Derek O'Brien worked in a company called big ideas for a year and a half

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.000
[Guest]: After that, you know once you get into television once I started doing the Bonita quiz contest and from there

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Guest]: I came to Delhi with a company called

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.880
[Guest]: TWA in those days. It was known as business India television, which was the business India group and I was there for a year and a

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.960
[Guest]: half and

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.880
[Guest]: From there. It was a company called Transworld International which at that time had the rights to Indian cricket Indian football in Indian

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.080
[Guest]: Hockey at the same time

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.360
[Guest]: So I spent a fantastic year and a half there and then why I detoured through Siddharth Basu's doing mastermind

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.080
[Guest]: I came back and joined ESPN star sports as their first sort of production

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.400
[Guest]: person in India worked there for six and a half seven years ended there as head of production for India and

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:55.240
[Guest]: And since then it's been mostly sport. I mean 2008. I joined KKR. I started off with KKR spent seven wonderful years out there

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.840
[Guest]: Then went on to the under 17 football World Cup where we managed to get actually on paper

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.240
[Guest]: We had more people watching on ground the under 17 football World Cup than the 2011 cricket World Cup

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.200
[Guest]: It's a bizarre statistic, but it's true and then now I'm just we're running this volleyball league, which is absolutely amazing

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.120
[Amit Varma]: You know some of this time you were behind the camera some of this time. You were in front of it like for

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.120
[Amit Varma]: Mastermind for example you set all the questions, which is like really interesting and then you spend all of that time in sport

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know when you were telling me about

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.360
[Amit Varma]: How when you decided you want to do something you're gonna be you you're passionate about and you thought of quizzing

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.920
[Guest]: I thought you're gonna say sport. No, it's strange. I mean I actually got into sport via

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.680
[Guest]: quizzing and it started off I remember I used to do a cricket quiz for business India television

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.320
[Unknown]: And I was obviously interesting sport. I've played you know the host also

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.040
[Guest]: Yeah, and I was at that point in time you know in the university

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.360
[Guest]: I played basketball for the university fairly seriously so after that when I was there doing this show

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.160
[Guest]: I heard that TWA at the same time had started a cricket show okay, and they had a very well-known statistician

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.560
[Guest]: Who's a very nice man still one of the best addition business as their question writer?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.240
[Guest]: So TWA was just upstairs from me

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.000
[Guest]: So one day I turned on and I felt like doing my good deed for the day because my series had just ended

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.640
[Guest]: So I went up and I met these two gentlemen there one of them who heads I think Facebook for sport around the world

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.080
[Guest]: and I said that you know getting a statistician to write a

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.400
[Guest]: Sports cricket quiz may not be the best thing because it's not important that

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.240
[Guest]: Gavaskar's average is if it's not a 98 point you know it's not like a 99.4. It doesn't make a difference

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.560
[Guest]: However the fact that Gavaskar batted left-handed in a match because Raghuram Bhatt was running through the Mumbai batting order

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.200
[Guest]: May be a much more interesting statistic, so it's not a statistic much more interesting fact

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.160
[Guest]: So I basically give them this 10 minutes PL

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.840
[Guest]: And I came downstairs and as it turned out they went up after that and they gave it to the statistician

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.040
[Guest]: Two episodes later I get a call saying you know are you happy to set questions for us, so I said great

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.240
[Guest]: So in those days I sat and I wrote four episodes of the questions

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.160
[Guest]: And I gave it to them and they put it on air it was a rolling success

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.800
[Guest]: And they came back and said you know we can pay you so much for the questions

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.840
[Guest]: We can you know this is how much and that was almost my salary in those days and time working with

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.640
[Guest]: TVI that is business in their television, and I said sorry I can't take money because I'm working for another company full-time and

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.440
[Guest]: I remember everyone including my wife telling me you must be out of your mind walking

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.680
[Guest]: I think all my listeners are thinking the same thing. Yeah, I said have bigger fish net

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest]: So I gave them another four episodes for free and another four episodes and after that their producer called me upstairs and says

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.800
[Guest]: Can you look at the show and say you know what works? What doesn't work with the show?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.480
[Guest]: So I said you know this works. This doesn't work. This is better

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.200
[Guest]: This is so they figured out that I knew television as well because that's been a year and a half two years doing television

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.120
[Guest]: And then they finally said that you know a bit sick of running this cricket quiz show will you come and run it for us?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.120
[Guest]: Upstairs, I still can now we are talking

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.600
[Amit Varma]: This is not a long play. It was a long play, and I sweated it through I have to say right and

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.200
[Amit Varma]: And and then of course you spent a few years in sports broadcasting. What was it like?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean one of the things you just alluded to for example is that

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.480
[Amit Varma]: you know the under-17 football World Cup had more on-ground viewers and the

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.920
[Amit Varma]: 2011 cricket World Cup and one reason for that obviously is that cricket seems to be a sport made for television

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.800
[Amit Varma]: Authorities in India don't really give a damn if people go to the ground or not grounds are so incredibly unfriendly

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.540
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense what you were doing behind the scenes in television and the television broadcasting of cricket was the whole game

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.760
[Guest]: No, no absolutely and that has been the way that almost everyone in India has looked at any sport in India because see

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.960
[Guest]: The spectators are supposed to be crazy enough to be able to

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.800
[Guest]: Survive an experience in the field that means seven eight hours without access to decent water to access to proper toilets to access

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: Which is why you'd rarely see in Indian grounds

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.760
[Guest]: You'll ever see women and children

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.960
[Guest]: And this is whatever's happened has really happened after 2009 and for give him credit Lalit Modi in fact

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.380
[Guest]: I remember in 2009 just after the 2008 IPL. He said that to if 2008 was about

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.520
[Guest]: The experience of the cricketers in the field giving them good places to stay giving them five-star hotels giving them

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.660
[Guest]: You know proper net training facilities

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:21.380
[Guest]: 2009-10 from now on is going to be with the experience with the spectators and that has

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.260
[Guest]: Dramatically improved in India otherwise I'll take you to the old is being on one one grounds where you know football

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.740
[Guest]: We talk about the nurseries of Indian football, and it's almost impossible for somebody to sit out there

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.140
[Guest]: It's like you're sitting literally on each other's laps. You're sitting on you know hard

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:41.420
[Guest]: You know wooden planks basically you're sitting on planks these planks are sometimes half rotten they break down

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.700
[Guest]: There isn't a bathroom to be had you wouldn't reach one for love or for money

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.100
[Guest]: so the experience was so bad that you know it was almost as

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.580
[Guest]: You're telling women and children don't come anywhere close to the field and that's what's now slowly slowly

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.980
[Guest]: They realize that boss. We can't do it with broadcasting anymore or

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.660
[Guest]: Two three really big events dominate broadcasting, okay?

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:07.480
[Guest]: So we have to now make a spectator experience worth being there must be toilets for women

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.100
[Guest]: There must be places where you can sit there must be places where you can get hot food without having to line up for 45

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.500
[Amit Varma]: Minutes in the middle forget, so I'm just curious newbie question

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.260
[Amit Varma]: How much of the revenues of the sport actually come from spectators at the ground itself as opposed to television?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.420
[Guest]: I assume it must be negligible. It is negligible, but you know this is negligible say compared to

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.300
[Guest]: till about

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.220
[Guest]: Seven six seven years back though that numbers again changed because the new deal

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.020
[Guest]: about 21 to 22 percent of Manchester United's

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.740
[Guest]: Money came from gate receipts because they would price them at such a level

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:46.140
[Guest]: I know many people who are fairly well off who would go and buy a ticket for when Wigan men made it to the Premier

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.260
[Guest]: League to

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.940
[Guest]: Then Manchester, but they'd buy a Wigan ticket because they knew that they'll at least get to watch Manchester once a year

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.180
[Guest]: Because it's that expensive

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.340
[Guest]: And that experience has that much value so that's what I'm saying that

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.100
[Guest]: It's it is it's not that it's ever going to be the way broadcast revenues

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.820
[Guest]: But you're talking about broadcast revenue for the top broadcast events

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.580
[Guest]: You know what I'm trying to say is that if I'm going to compare IPL broadcast every and say that okay?

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.420
[Guest]: This is what IPL revenue is versus

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.700
[Guest]: This is the number of people in the IPL ground if I turn on and said that I had to do a Ranji trophy

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.540
[Guest]: And I made reasonably better conditions, or I had a Ranji t20 which had reasonably better conditions

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:27.940
[Guest]: And say I could easily make 20 15 20 lakhs from that match that match wouldn't have 10 lakhs worth of revenue on air

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:35.500
[Guest]: So when you compare you have to compare there are only two three really big sporting events in this country that make serious revenue

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.500
[Guest]: Everything else you probably if you have good hit revenue

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.460
[Amit Varma]: You're probably going to get a really good deal out of it and at some level does it also come down to incentives?

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.220
[Amit Varma]: I mean what Indian sport has been plagued by is that most Indian sport is of course run by the government

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.060
[Amit Varma]: Cricket to some extent isn't so it's a little better people don't realize this that the BCCI is actually much better than many of the

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:59.420
[Amit Varma]: Other sports organizations, but when it comes to things like grounds most of the grounds are essentially controlled by these old

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.140
[Amit Varma]: Government like organizations where there are no incentives to make things better

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.220
[Amit Varma]: And you'd imagine in the IPL age that would change because the franchises really want to build their own followings and cultures

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.180
[Guest]: So the interesting thing so the IPL also does not actually allow you to change

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.020
[Guest]: You know why because the BCCI has something else it doesn't have the government sitting on its head like everyone else does

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.100
[Guest]: But it has something else which is most important to all these guys, which is voting members so today

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.100
[Guest]: You think that a Mumbai Indians cannot build their own stadium. They could build it tomorrow

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.740
[Guest]: They'd build it in them in a heartbeat if they got the opportunity not allowed to know they can't yeah exactly

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.820
[Guest]: They're not allowed to because if they do then the MCA loses its primacy

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:42.940
[Guest]: And if you see there's a rule today in the IPL saying that every player that has made it has to make it through the

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.900
[Guest]: Auction even if your first class player now if that had been the rule

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.160
[Guest]: You know three years four years back a John Wright a Kieran Morris saw

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.020
[Guest]: Bumrah or a Hardik Pandya spoke to a John Wright a John Wright went and saw them

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.580
[Guest]: They then saw these guys signed them up and then they came into the IPL now if this rule had been there

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.740
[Guest]: there would have been no incentive to even spot a

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.620
[Guest]: Jasprit Bumrah or a Hardik Pandya because hell all of these guys are going to come to the auction all I have to do

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.860
[Guest]: Is another team is not even bothered to scout them all I have to turn on and say that whoever Mumbai's bidding for just

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.860
[Guest]: Keep bidding them. That's all I have to do

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:24.140
[Guest]: So actually what you're doing by doing creating a system like this is there's a total disincentive

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:31.100
[Guest]: Actually, if you look at it that way to scout or prepare talent for Indian cricket by the IPL by the IPL teams

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.500
[Guest]: There's no incentive for them teams are still doing it for some reason because they want to

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.940
[Guest]: Create academies create basis

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.580
[Guest]: But there's no logic to it in the sense that if a player comes up

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.980
[Guest]: He has to come up by the auction then every all teams have dibs on him

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.740
[Amit Varma]: Maybe every one of them can go for him. That's a little crazy because I mean one of the reasons the IPL was even named

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.940
[Amit Varma]: The IPL was big inspired by the EPL obviously and in the English Premier League you have the clubs with their academies

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.980
[Amit Varma]: You have a Phil Foden who's been nurtured by Manchester City now and is coming up you had the phenomenal bun

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.300
[Amit Varma]: That you had a class of 91. I think Manchester United who were all again there

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.100
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I thought the same system was in play because I keep talking about

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:15.060
[Amit Varma]: You know the rise of boom Ryan Hardik in particular as examples of how good incentives work because the teams had the incentives to do

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.500
[Guest]: This absolutely and now you're in a situation where these incentives from the last three years of IPL

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.900
[Guest]: This thing do not work anymore because you cannot sign a player before him coming into the auction

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.700
[Guest]: What's the impetus for the rule change then the impetus for the rule change basically is exactly that that

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.500
[Guest]: Larger systems can crank out more scouts put out more people on the ground and make sure that everyone is covered and

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.540
[Guest]: Also what they can do, of course, there's also wastage implied today

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.620
[Guest]: Technically a Mumbai Indians could sign a hundred and fifty players and you know put them out there and say that okay

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.820
[Guest]: I'm gonna sign you all guys up and then maybe only three make it and those

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.260
[Guest]: 147 remaining players don't have a chance to go anywhere else. So that might also happen

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.420
[Guest]: Remember in 2013, what was Kuldeep Yadav doing in 2014?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.540
[Guest]: Kuldeep Yadav played the under-19 World Cup and then he played for KKR and did pretty well

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.580
[Guest]: He played the Champions League and did pretty well by 2015

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.460
[Guest]: He was an India player in 2013. He was bowling for

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.540
[Guest]: Completely spent his whole season bowling in the Mumbai Nets

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.140
[Guest]: He was one of the people who was part of the Mumbai signed up by Mumbai, but not part of their squad

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:23.100
[Guest]: So that's what I'm saying that so there is a certain amount of wastage involved because if you are a large organization

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.220
[Guest]: you can go and sign a hundred hundred fifty players and not do that, but I

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.540
[Guest]: Think that the way the the situation is now

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:36.100
[Guest]: I think it there is no incentive for any IPL team to really develop new talent

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:42.620
[Amit Varma]: Beyond looking at it as a profit-making opportunity. I mean that particular problem of wastage could I presume I'm just thinking aloud

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.380
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure it's been thought through by others could just be solved by saying that whoever from their academy

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.260
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai doesn't sign in any given season is open game for anyone else. Yeah, I think exactly

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.940
[Guest]: There are many ways to be sensible about it

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.700
[Guest]: I think they threw the baby out with the bathwater and I think that you know

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:04.460
[Guest]: What Mumbai that scouting process of Mumbai gave at least five players to Indian cricket, which will serve in intricate and very good state

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.500
[Guest]: And stopping it does not you know, really work

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500
[Guest]: I don't think that that stops Mumbai from going in scouting

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.420
[Guest]: But I just think that it gives the others an unfair advantage

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.300
[Guest]: They can just hang back and watch what Mumbai does and just go after them

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:24.020
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I remember in around 2003 or 2002 when I was in cricket for I was covering a test match in Mohali

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.620
[Amit Varma]: And I met up with Bindra who was then out of favor with the authorities and I interviewed him

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.940
[Amit Varma]: that'll be linked from the show notes and this was probably 2003 and

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.940
[Amit Varma]: All the year before and Bindra said something very interesting to me at the time

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.660
[Amit Varma]: He said that you know

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:43.420
[Amit Varma]: What India needs is something like we need to move beyond playing for your country and for your states. We need a franchise model and

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.540
[Amit Varma]: There is this friend of mine called Lalit Modi. He's been banging on about this idea since 1996 and

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:56.340
[Amit Varma]: Basically laid out the IPL for me except that it wasn't t20 in their minds because it was a 50 over

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.620
[Amit Varma]: Thing but it was a whole franchise basing and he laid out the whole vision and do you think in some sense?

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.860
[Amit Varma]: that that vision was sort of

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.180
[Amit Varma]: Inevitable or do you going to happen at some point or do you think I mean this is again a question

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.220
[Amit Varma]: I put to the historians who appear on the show, you know

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.980
[Amit Varma]: when I talk about Thomas Carlyle's

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:20.180
[Amit Varma]: concept of the great man in history that is history sort of inevitable and flowing along larger currents or

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.540
[Amit Varma]: Are they great men who changed them decisively in certain directions?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.500
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, for example without Lalit Modi and perhaps Bindra

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.980
[Amit Varma]: Would the IPL ever have happened or would we still have been drifting along? I think two three things happened

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.340
[Guest]: I mean Lalit Modi definitely they had but remember they had that proposal that's and the guy who wrote it

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:45.220
[Guest]: I remember was Arun Lal and they had gone to the detail of actually making sure that every match the man of the match would

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.140
[Guest]: Get a Mercedes car. That was the whole plan, you know

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.940
[Guest]: They'd get you know, so dead they detailed it to that extent the Tata's were willing to do it

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.140
[Guest]: It would be night matches all that was ready

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:59.220
[Guest]: The point was that it didn't float and it wouldn't have floated at all two things happened which really helped it

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.260
[Guest]: one was the 2007 World Cup win, which also think about it if for example if

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:11.100
[Guest]: If Saurav, Sachin and Dravid had gone for the 2007 World Cup, we would have lost. We probably wouldn't have won

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.540
[Guest]: I mean not the same team. It won't have been Dhoni captaining

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:19.620
[Guest]: We wouldn't have won. Secondly the ICL had started and the ICL was a push means these two things basically made it

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.140
[Guest]: Inevitable that they have to launch it this craziest thing about it is a lot of people don't realize

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.100
[Guest]: Then the first season the IPL they did not the Indian players didn't know anything at all

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.060
[Guest]: The international players did not think it was a big deal

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.540
[Guest]: So they had to be signed up. So if you remember he had a

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:46.420
[Guest]: $400,000 contract won signed a $400,000 contract McGrath signed a $400,000 contract and that's a minimum guarantee

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.220
[Guest]: It's not as if I'll put my name on auction

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.340
[Guest]: They said $400,000 you agree to pay me

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.620
[Guest]: I'll put my name in the league and they actually signed many players like this even a player

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.180
[Guest]: I think a Salman, but was signed for a hundred fifty thousand dollars, which is a ton of money for those guys anyway, give me

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.180
[Guest]: a ton of money for those guys and

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.540
[Guest]: Therefore if you remember when want came up the first bid they said was four hundred thousand dollars

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:16.260
[Guest]: Fortunately for them. He was picked up by Rajasthan because Rajasthan whatever felt that they needed to do a favor to mr

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.500
[Guest]: Modi, but they took him the fact of the matter was that

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.540
[Guest]: Even players who went for below that so if say a Salman, but for in for a hundred thousand dollars later

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.220
[Guest]: The extra fifty thousand was paid by the BCCI in year one

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.340
[Guest]: Because it was a minimum guarantee and I know and I've met Jacques and you know

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.180
[Guest]: I remember Jacques and Boucher being in year one in Bangalore and

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.260
[Guest]: They came and thought it was a bit of a you know hit and a giggle and we're gonna have some fun

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.820
[Guest]: We're gonna have some drinks. It's like any you know over the overage league is about, you know

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.580
[Guest]: You just play a few game then you go back, you know

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.660
[Guest]: It's like a festival matches used to be in India in the 90s, you know benefit matches and festival matches

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.620
[Guest]: And then after season one they realized, you know, hell no, this is serious stuff

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:04.100
[Guest]: This is a really really comparatively and if you see calluses record of a year one to year two

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.500
[Guest]: I think year two he became the highest scorer in the IPL and he was a completely different player because suddenly says no

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.480
[Guest]: Hold on. This is serious cricket. This is really high quality serious cricket

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:20.340
[Guest]: So forget about Lalit Modi even the players who came for year one said boss either give me guaranteed contracts

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.820
[Guest]: I'm not gonna come to a league

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:28.020
[Amit Varma]: That's what it was. So, how did you kind of get involved with KKR because few months before the IPL auctions happened if you remember

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.260
[Guest]: Yeah, you were there

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:35.700
[Amit Varma]: I was in Delhi with our mutual friend Devanshu and he took me out for lunch with you and Aruna was saying and the game

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:42.580
[Amit Varma]: Theorist yeah, and you and Aruna were working on something an auction strategy for KKR and the next thing I know you're in the dugout

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.580
[Guest]: So it was it was a strange one because it as it turned out what happened was that we I

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.340
[Guest]: Was looking at the IPL when it came out and they had the auction and a long time back

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.700
[Guest]: I had actually designed a game called super selector

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.140
[Guest]: Okay

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.620
[Guest]: And super selector what it meant was it was the first really fantasy game show

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.900
[Guest]: No serious to host and was big for a while

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.980
[Guest]: And I think it was just before his time because you know

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.620
[Guest]: They couldn't just get enough paid people on to it at that point in time

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:13.740
[Guest]: But what super selector did in terms of that was say that okay within a thousand points you have to buy an 11

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.260
[Guest]: Which is going to play and you have a certain amount of substitutions

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.380
[Guest]: And I said that is basically exactly what you know

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:26.100
[Guest]: This is about I mean an auction is about except the difference is there all of you could buy the same players here

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.100
[Guest]: You know if he buys a player you can't

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.740
[Guest]: So I said and I went to Devanshu and I told him that you know

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.100
[Guest]: I think this can be done if I can sit with a couple of guys who do game theory I can make an algo for

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.260
[Guest]: maximizing games for that

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.980
[Guest]: So that's exactly what we did we when they designed it those guys helped me design it

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.980
[Guest]: We put it together, and then I just suggested it to a friend of mine called jeet who was at that time

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.580
[Guest]: You know he was speaking with various franchises. I suppose is jeet

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.340
[Guest]: I suggested it to the Mumbai Indians, and I suggested it to Rahul Dravid who was there in Bangalore

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.700
[Guest]: And I remember it's a very interesting how all of them reacted to Rahul actually said you know come across

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.700
[Guest]: We'd be interested in looking at the algorithm

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.940
[Guest]: The Mumbai Indians said you know what we'll pay you a certain amount of money

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.420
[Guest]: Just to see it. It's not exclusive to us so their attitude was

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.780
[Guest]: We don't necessarily believe that what you're doing is the right thing

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.660
[Guest]: But just in case it is the right thing you I have as much knowledge as anybody else equalizing that

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.740
[Guest]: Very interesting way of looking at and jeet said that you know what?

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.100
[Guest]: Shahrukh is you know wanted to talk and meet and

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.380
[Guest]: He's suggesting why don't you go? It looks like a journey. They've promised nothing at this point in time. No money

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.860
[Guest]: No, nothing

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.300
[Guest]: Why don't you land up and so we landed up that night, and I remember sure if Ganguly was there and in those days

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:46.180
[Guest]: I used to smoke, and it was a sort of Shahrukh's at one long library and the two other guys

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.260
[Guest]: They were Andrew and Adrian who were the physio and the trainer, and they were very well-recommended the finest guys

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.060
[Guest]: Yes, in fact the only two guys still in the franchise from year one Andrew Lepus and Adrian

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.660
[Guest]: Adrian little and Andrew Lepus and they almost died of the smoke because of the amount of smoke

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.820
[Guest]: Hey, there's Shahrukh smoking. There's I'm smoking sure of was there and we all sitting and look and at two o'clock at night

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.740
[Guest]: Sure work that comes for the visit and said, yeah, Mary is the saracno, you know, which which is such a

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.340
[Guest]: It was quite a thing

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.620
[Guest]: So I was there the auction and then they were looking for someone to hang on with the team and run it and I said

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.340
[Amit Varma]: Hell in for a penny in for a pound. So what was your role then?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.380
[Guest]: so

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.140
[Guest]: Technically, I was team director and which meant that it was like running the team on the ground

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.860
[Guest]: There was nobody else. My job was to everything from basically in those days John Buchanan was the coach. So

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:44.660
[Guest]: From working with him to working out logistics to working out systems to even looking at sponsorship to look at sponsor

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:51.140
[Guest]: Not so much selling sponsorship, but what you call sponsorship servicing, you know looking after making sure that happened

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.500
[Guest]: Working with the IPL any rule changes any issues?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.260
[Guest]: So it was a very very overall role in those days. No, those are the early days

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:04.300
[Guest]: I feel it was the Wild West because and one of the things was that you know, take somebody like a Lalit Modi

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.780
[Guest]: He was you know, it's very difficult for us from outside to look at him and said, you know, okay

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.100
[Guest]: He was a brash man. He was this he was that I've worked with the BCCI much before, you know, when we were in

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:21.060
[Guest]: I'm GTW and then with the Spain's task force, you know getting boards to make a decision or a change take so much time

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.900
[Guest]: I remember sending a mail because you know when the league is new new things keep popping up saying that okay

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.220
[Guest]: You know this rule doesn't make sense because of this reason and so can we have a look at it?

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:36.340
[Guest]: And I remember sending a mail at 730 at night and at 830 at night a mail comes back saying noted

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.580
[Guest]: This is now the new rule. This has to change

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:44.020
[Guest]: This is a team note to all teams that if this happens this particular rule has to be interpreted in this particular way

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.940
[Guest]: In one hour, there was a message

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:52.540
[Guest]: You would not have that happen for love of a money in the BCCI before Lalit Modi came in and that was what he bought

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.820
[Guest]: And had he not bought that had he not bought the kind of thing saying that okay logo has to be this size

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.260
[Guest]: Those are things that BCCI didn't look at in those days

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.060
[Guest]: But if you allow people if you allow one team to make a logo a particular size and somebody else has a larger logo

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.300
[Guest]: Then finally, you know the law of economics

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.040
[Guest]: Everyone will end up with the large logo because they'll be forced by the various brands to sort of increase the size

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.080
[Guest]: So making restrictions on that making sure it was a thoroughly professional setup

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.520
[Guest]: I think that you have to hand it to Lalit Modi. He did it almost

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:27.600
[Guest]: Single-handedly, maybe a bit of an exaggeration. But yeah, it was very much. He was driving force behind it. What exactly happened there?

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean on the one hand it was this great entrepreneurial move and it was being so well

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Managed by Lalit Modi with so much dynamism, but on the other hand behind the scenes

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.400
[Amit Varma]: It was also politics and they were also

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Manoeuvring and machinations and eventually the poor guy had to go. So whatever that that happened for a very different reason

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.560
[Guest]: I think there is I firmly believe whatever the reasons that he went in 2010

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.200
[Guest]: Well, there was only one man who could have really bought down Lalit Modi and that was Lalit Modi

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.640
[Guest]: Okay, and I think he went by promising too much to people who were new franchises

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.680
[Guest]: I think the year he was looking out there. The Adani's were also looking for a franchise

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.360
[Guest]: I think so what Supriya Sule and you know, Sharad Pawar that group and

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.480
[Guest]: And somehow to keep four important people happy the third people were Shashi Tharoor and the Kochi team and then there was a Sahara team

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.600
[Guest]: And there were only two franchises and four people who were really interested in getting a franchise in those days

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.920
[Guest]: And I think he just didn't manage to make sure that you know

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.200
[Guest]: It was a matter of making which are the two people I can afford to keep unhappy and I think

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.720
[Guest]: For whether he chose wrong or it went wrong. I think that's exactly what happened

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.440
[Amit Varma]: So what was sort of the challenges and of running a sort of a franchise team?

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Well, you have people from different countries and different levels of the game all mixing together in the dressing room

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.760
[Guest]: Absolutely. It was chaotic because he at one level. So if you look at the KKR, you know dressing room

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.160
[Guest]: So you have Brendan McCullum your Ricky Ponting?

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.200
[Guest]: Okay, your players of that level you're out there and you have guys who have played three first-class matches for Bengal

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.080
[Guest]: They were with the dash was played three first-class Ashok Dinda who played one match for Bengal in

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.200
[Guest]: 2005-06 and then was dropped

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.680
[Guest]: So Ashok Dinda came to and that's again why the IPL is so important to Indian cricket

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.640
[Guest]: Ashok Dinda was basically fell foul of the selectors

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.920
[Guest]: He was he was a bit of a you know character a bit of a tearaway and he kept fighting with them

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.240
[Guest]: So he was completely banned. He was not playing

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.640
[Guest]: He was playing for a club called Kalighat as it turned out Jeet Banerjee at that point in time

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.720
[Guest]: Ran the Kalighat team in the sense that he was a guy who was you know behind the Kalighat team

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.160
[Guest]: So he said, you know, we need net bowlers

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: So when KKR net bowling started we called up the Kalighat bowlers and said why did you come and bowl?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.560
[Guest]: Dinda bowled in the nets and he looked pretty good and John Buchanan saw him and

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.080
[Guest]: Brendan saw him and they said you know what this guy is pretty decent

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.040
[Guest]: So then they turned on and said that let's put him in the squad. They put him in the squad

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:51.480
[Guest]: From there on Dinda went into the 11 and the first ball in the IPL was actually bowled by Ashok Dinda

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.640
[Guest]: And if you look at his record, you know, you'll look at it

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.840
[Guest]: And you know, it does a bit of a meme now in international IPL cricket

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.800
[Guest]: Because the way he gets has got hammered in the final few overs

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.320
[Guest]: But that man from not being picked for Bengal for three years went on to go and get picked for India got more than four

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.080
[Guest]: Five hundred first-class wickets and that happened because the IPL opened a situation

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:20.600
[Guest]: Where a selector did not have the monopoly of Bengal selector state selector did not have the monopoly on deciding a kid's future

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.160
[Guest]: So if you see the explosion of talent in the last 10 years, it's not because the talent was not there before

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.300
[Guest]: But because now thanks to the IPL you have a situation where a good kid can go anywhere in the nets

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.880
[Guest]: Show himself as a player and he'll get an opportunity to perform today

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.080
[Guest]: The Uttarakhand selector or the Delhi selector can't close down Rishabh Pant

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.840
[Guest]: Just as much as they couldn't close down Ashok Dinda 10 years back

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.800
[Guest]: And that's why you suddenly have these 20-25 30-35 good players have come to Indian cricket

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.040
[Amit Varma]: So in fact, like I keep pointing out, you know before the IPL happened

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Indian cricket and in fact all cricket and all national sport in a sense was a monopsony a

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.720
[Amit Varma]: Monopsony is like the inverse of a monopoly

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.400
[Amit Varma]: you have only one buyer and and therefore that buyer can for your services and the therefore that buyer can just rule the roost and

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.200
[Amit Varma]: you don't have options and

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.800
[Amit Varma]: You know

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.280
[Amit Varma]: The power balance is totally on the buyer side and what the IPL does is you have all these franchises

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Competing for talent. You have multiple buyers for a player's

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.160
[Amit Varma]: abilities and in fact before the IPL began I remember there were a lot of

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.080
[Amit Varma]: Criticisms of the IPL for being this commercial Tomasha thing and I wrote a piece in

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Cricket for at that time pointing out that this would be the biggest benefit that we would discover new talent

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:42.240
[Amit Varma]: Because the incentives have kind of completely changed and how did it sort of once the players realized that this is serious shit

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.600
[Amit Varma]: How did it change from year one to year two? Like are they looking at it differently strategically?

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Is there a different kind of conscious coaching culture coming up where you have to nurture players? How does it all work?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.760
[Guest]: How do you hold it together? No, I think year two was so far

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.000
[Guest]: See, I think the first three years ran by because every year there was some controversy or the other year two was a great move

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.880
[Guest]: You know is the IPL happening not happening and I remember sitting in February, you know

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.920
[Guest]: Month month and a half before none of us knew what it's gonna happen because you know that you know

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:14.480
[Guest]: Here's Lalit Modi up against Chidambaram who's the home minister of the country and the fact that they managed to move the tournament in 17

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.680
[Guest]: So year two was a lot about just making the tournament happen and even in that, you know

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.440
[Guest]: The way Lalit Modi went about it. I mean the sheer chutzpah of having a

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.140
[Guest]: You know a parade of IPL teams in Cape Town on the open buses

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.900
[Guest]: I mean the South African team wouldn't have a this thing like that and you put out

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.600
[Guest]: International teams with a lot of Indians and you put out a parade then he has this

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.600
[Guest]: you know goes and picks the most expensive hotel in Johannesburg to you know or Cape Town to be based out of you know has

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:48.400
[Guest]: One of his team owners has a Lamborghini, you know, which come came from Cairo because it was the only number available in Africa

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.760
[Guest]: Okay, and I remember the best part of it is he threw a party there

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.200
[Guest]: For the teams before and how did he make it the talk of the town in South Africa?

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.680
[Guest]: He just went out there and said here are the hundred top celebrities

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:09.160
[Guest]: According to people I've spoken to in Africa. If you don't have at least 80 of these people in the party, you've lost your job

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.040
[Guest]: And I remember the amount of press that was there and you'd be I would be

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:21.720
[Guest]: Continually amazed and look at it and said can you imagine the South African Premier League being all over Indian getting this kind of press?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.840
[Guest]: I mean this guy for whatever it's worth

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.940
[Guest]: He did things that you know have not been done before and that was actually where he was at his best when he had

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:36.940
[Guest]: Concrete mountains to climb or things to actually achieve when he was left to his own device and everything was smooth. He would

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.100
[Guest]: Let it would find a way to make it difficult for himself, right?

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.980
[Amit Varma]: How does the sport itself change like, you know, I keep thinking of the counterfactual

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.660
[Amit Varma]: what if t20 cricket for some reason didn't happen or what if like you said that they selected the senior guys in the

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:55.620
[Amit Varma]: 2007 Indian squad and we didn't win the World Cup and the IPL never happened because you know

00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.380
[Amit Varma]: I think there did seem to be a little bit of a crisis brewing in the sense that

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.780
[Amit Varma]: And tell me if you agree with this that back in the day, you know cricket was a big sport in India

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.780
[Amit Varma]: But people had lots of free time

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.740
[Amit Varma]: You could actually spend five days watching a test match

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:16.620
[Amit Varma]: but now with the world so globalized so interconnected because of technology and the internet and all of that that the

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:23.100
[Amit Varma]: Opportunity cost of the time you spend watching cricket has gone up exponentially and there are so many things you could be doing with your time

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:28.740
[Amit Varma]: that watching a five-day test match or even of a match that lasts a full day when all other sports are like a couple of

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740
[Amit Varma]: hours or

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.940
[Amit Varma]: even less

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:37.180
[Amit Varma]: Makes absolutely no sense and did you kind of think the IPL came along just in time to revive it or do you think it?

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.180
[Guest]: Would have kind of coasted along and you know, I think I think it saved international cricket. It's saved international

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.700
[Guest]: I don't just say Indian cricket

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.740
[Guest]: It's a bit national cricket because if you look at people like even Nepal

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:53.740
[Guest]: Afghanistan these guys are now seriously playing cricket why because you finally have a situation where you have

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.860
[Guest]: Guys who can play 20 or cricket from them who can play as well as anyone around the world

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.660
[Guest]: Today you're just hearing what the European League which is starting with Ireland and Netherlands and all these countries participating

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.740
[Guest]: They're serious Caribbean Premier League. The West Indies is really invested in the Caribbean Premier League

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.880
[Guest]: They are investing seriously in the US Premier League the US Canada Premier League as well

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.960
[Guest]: So suddenly you have a situation where from being a shrinking market being ready is a growing market

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.480
[Guest]: I think the only single big challenge left to make t20 cricket because in many ways I think it's

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.180
[Guest]: easily as complex and interesting a game as

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.640
[Guest]: Baseball which is what its closest equivalent would be and I think given the fact of you know

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.060
[Guest]: You have this two and a half 1.3 billion Indians and that many

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.440
[Guest]: Pakistanis in Bangladesh she's watching it

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.960
[Guest]: I think the only problem with the ICC needs to solve to have really go

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.600
[Guest]: This is the problem of pitches because that's the one thing that stops cricket from being dropped on and played anywhere in the world

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.640
[Guest]: good drop-on pitches means, you know a

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800
[Guest]: reasonably standard template of playing and

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.160
[Guest]: Already this game is exploding. It'll explode and in terms of technology is that near is

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.320
[Guest]: Already there. In fact in Divya Patil they've used drop-on pitches in Divya Patil for cricket games

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320
[Guest]: They've used it at the MCG and you know

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.880
[Guest]: Because you have concerts and all and the whole this thing for the pitch is just dropped on three days four days before

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.800
[Guest]: So you actually have that because that will give you a level playing field

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.520
[Guest]: The biggest problem is creating a pitch over three months four months to a year and you know

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.840
[Guest]: Dedicating that pitch for cricket. That's basically your

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.160
[Guest]: Problem in being able to proliferate today if you take away that problem, there's nothing else left

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.720
[Amit Varma]: Why wherever you can play baseball you can play cricket and also the diaspora is so large

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Like I'll take this opportunity to recommend one of my favorite literary novels of all time Netherland by Joseph O'Neill. Have you read it?

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:43.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a beautiful book. It's about a cricket fanatic in New York who's trying to start a cricket club there

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.240
[Amit Varma]: I think and a lovely book at many other levels the cricket is just part of it

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:52.440
[Amit Varma]: So you work closely with a lot of cricketers a lot of stars and the thing is from the outside

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.360
[Amit Varma]: It often seems to fans that oh these guys are so aloof or so arrogant or so

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:03.600
[Amit Varma]: Whatever and one of the theories I've always had about cricketers is that no matter how they behave in real life

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.640
[Amit Varma]: To just get to that elite level you have to possess enormous humility

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Because what achieving a certain level of excellence involves is that you are recognizing your own mistakes and you're spending hundreds of hours in the net

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's sorting out your own mistakes

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:26.560
[Amit Varma]: How true is that and does some of that humility also come on to the approach in other things and do people get carried away?

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.600
[Amit Varma]: By the sudden stardom and the money that can come upon you

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.280
[Guest]: Lots of it. I mean, okay, let me start by where it used to be. And that was I remember

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.240
[Guest]: Arun Lal, Arun Lal used to be one of my favorite cricketers because he was a grinder never had the talent

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.880
[Guest]: But you know played four test matches for India made it there

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.520
[Guest]: So Arun Lal was also a commentator for the longest time with ESPN star and many other bodies and I said, you know

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.880
[Guest]: And I know Arun well enough to say Arun, you know, I just want to ask you one question

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:58.720
[Guest]: He said why I said why you cricketers such assholes such absolute test readers such absolute assholes and he sort of smiled and he said

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.560
[Guest]: I'll tell you something joy. So I said what and this is mind you this is the days before the IPL

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.840
[Guest]: He said after playing tests for India and I play just four tests for India

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.400
[Guest]: It's not as if I played 50 tests

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.280
[Guest]: he said it took me two years to learn to say thank you again after that and he says it's not and

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.280
[Guest]: Here's what I'm gonna say again after that. It's not our fault because in our part of the world

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.920
[Guest]: We are treated like gods

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.720
[Guest]: I've never even have to think about where I've left my bag because somebody has picked it up

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.280
[Guest]: I'm like we are all treated like this so much and that's actually even more

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:37.440
[Guest]: Before because you know test cricket or the international kid was the only game in town that people are suddenly you take that away from them

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.920
[Guest]: This it's a completely different ballgame

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.440
[Guest]: So cricketers are used to once you reach that elite level you are used to being totally spoiled

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.360
[Guest]: Having said that if I look at the cricketers again that you know

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.840
[Guest]: I had the opportunity to deal with especially guys who just had come into the system

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.440
[Guest]: So it's you shouldn't be judging us in a you know an IPL experience for somebody like it

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.960
[Guest]: I will drive disorder sure because he's played seven eight ten years of international cricket, but the guys who came on fresh

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.720
[Guest]: for a lot of them

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.600
[Guest]: see

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.160
[Guest]: Humility is one thing I think

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.760
[Guest]: To their two ways in which cricketers are reacted to is one is a such and then they'll cause rock college school

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.800
[Guest]: Which is that they were so good that they just kept playing their game

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.240
[Guest]: They never had any doubt as to what decisions they would take. That's one. That's one kind of guy

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.680
[Guest]: Okay, and there there's no decision to be taken. It's it's almost an inevitability that once they're on the path

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.300
[Guest]: They're so good barring injury or something serious

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.360
[Guest]: They are going to go through

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.280
[Guest]: The second is the guy who is the what I call the Iqbal Abdullah kind of cricketer

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:41.420
[Guest]: Kid from Azamgarh picked up comes to Disney College plays well for you plays 119 India gets into KKR plays for Bombay now for him

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:48.660
[Guest]: Cricket was what it is for, you know, the ghettos in America basketball is it's an opportunity to get a life

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:53.380
[Guest]: You do not have an opportunity to get a it's an opportunity to earn to make money to do stuff

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.140
[Guest]: So these two guys it's very clearly defined for them

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.660
[Guest]: you know they have to you know one of them because they are sort of destined to greatness the other because

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.860
[Guest]: This is their only opportunity for getting up in a normal life

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:10.020
[Guest]: Where the where it falls in the cracks is the ones who have to actually make this decision

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:15.020
[Guest]: You are decent at studies. So very good case is a chap who he was in a KKR camp

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.020
[Guest]: We had a camp in Mumbai looking at promising cricketers in 2008 and the chap called Saurabh Netravalkar

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.500
[Guest]: Who we thought was the best in the camp. So by the time we next spoke to him, he says no, I'm sorry

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:31.020
[Guest]: I'm out of it. I'm planning to go to the US. So he went to Cornell. He studied in Cornell

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.300
[Guest]: I think it was Cornell. He went and studied out there. Then he's now the captain of the US national team. Oh my god

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.580
[Guest]: Yeah, see in fact, one of the questions I've asked is that you know, so he's played under 19 for India

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:47.620
[Guest]: So my pet question is of the players who played under 19 for India in that 2009 or 2010

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:53.740
[Guest]: Under 19 who's the first person to captain his nation and was Saurabh Netravalkar, but he was captain in the US

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.260
[Guest]: He wasn't captain in India. Mind-blowing. Who are the others who have captained the nation?

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:03.420
[Guest]: Nobody else. It's not that generation who's the first. So yeah, I think if you see Virat captain 2008 Virat is now captain

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.620
[Guest]: Yeah, I think now yeah all the rest because they'll have to wait because Virat is just gonna hold it for a while

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:14.100
[Guest]: But I have a suspicion that at some point Prithvi Shah and Shubhman Gill will captain the country given the amount of time they have

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think the World Cup before this last one. I think Ishaan Kishan was a captain, but he's not gonna captain India

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.240
[Guest]: Yeah, and you have I mean, yeah, there is Ishaan Kishan look at

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.980
[Guest]: our Delhi cricketer 2012

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:33.780
[Guest]: That kid who wrote the book. Chand, Unmukh Chand. Unmukh Chand just not being picked for Delhi also right now

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.260
[Guest]: It's very interesting. How are under 19 cricketers go is a book by itself

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.980
[Amit Varma]: It's somebody should write. What you're saying about Saurabh Netravalkar is also very interesting because then you wonder that if that same

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.940
[Amit Varma]: Situation if that same choice was to occur to a player say today when the IPL is as big as it is

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.620
[Guest]: Would he make that same choice?

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.500
[Guest]: Yeah, I think I think it find it much more difficult in Saurabh's case

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:57.220
[Guest]: The other thing was that he was a brilliant student, but I'll give you an example of somebody who was an excellent student as well

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.820
[Guest]: at the same time

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.180
[Guest]: Was Jaydev Unadkat. Jaydev Unadkat has been a topper almost all his life

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.300
[Guest]: And it's just that he's chosen cricket because cricket just has given so much money and opportunity for him

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.380
[Guest]: But he's a sharp guy as sharp as he can get and I could have seen him going to an IIM Ahmedabad and

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.660
[Guest]: Studying out there just as much as I could have

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.460
[Guest]: Played cricket so for him those choices would be more difficult

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.140
[Guest]: But given the kind of money that the IPL has opened up, I think it's an inevitable that he'd made the choices

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:30.340
[Guest]: He did then see the second thing is today's management institutes and all they actually celebrate this kind of a

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:37.020
[Guest]: Background so for example two guys. I know who've been to ISB. Viren Raskina played hockey for India went to ISB and

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.380
[Guest]: Shemal Vengankar again played Ranji Trophy for Mumbai played against a visiting English side and took three four wickets

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.580
[Amit Varma]: He's also gone to ISB. In fact I've seen that match where he played that game against visiting England side

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.460
[Amit Varma]: He was a very controlled line and length Magrathas bowler, but slower, so

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.940
[Amit Varma]: Magrathas bowler but slower is a problem

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.780
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but still Magrathas

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.940
[Amit Varma]: Always argue with 700 test wickets. Yeah, yeah always in that corridor. So how many years were you with KKR?

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.740
[Guest]: I was seven years with KKR and yeah, I mean I was fortunate because I saw the bad stuff first

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.300
[Guest]: You know what is a bad stuff the bad stuff in the sense that you know we had a coach who was you know?

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:25.820
[Guest]: obviously saw it at that point in time as something that this is going to be the ultimate moneybags leak because you know the

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.700
[Guest]: Kind of owners the kind of people and so he saw it as an opportunity

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:35.260
[Guest]: And I think what John at that time wanted to do was he wanted to control the cricket and one of the you know

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:40.300
[Guest]: We talked about this four captains theory for year two and then you know McCullum was made captain, but at that point in time

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:47.500
[Guest]: He wanted to run the team and I think and what we've realized over time if you see the KKR teams that have been successful

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.020
[Guest]: It's been the coach who's supported a captain

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:56.180
[Guest]: But it's a captain's call finally of what the team was and I think you cannot run a team from outside

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:02.260
[Guest]: Not a cricket team you see football and all that the managers are really the bosses because this you put your input before the game

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.340
[Guest]: But in a game what can a football captain do within the course of a game almost nothing?

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.580
[Guest]: He doesn't even have a chance to talk to them, but it's in cricket. You're changing fielding positions

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.700
[Guest]: You're doing everything you're encouraging the guy at the other end

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.300
[Guest]: You're sending out messages saying you know do this increase the bowling date

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:23.380
[Guest]: so a captain has a lot more say in cricket than he does in almost any other sport and therefore you cannot have a

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:29.780
[Guest]: Captain who's completely subservient to the coach, and that's what I think he was trying to do truth

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.880
[Guest]: Is we also didn't have enough talent in 2009 because Gale and all were going back early

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:39.800
[Guest]: So we didn't have enough firepower our Indian batting we had depended our theory was getting a lot of good Indian bowlers

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.340
[Guest]: And our own Indian batsman was going to be sure of and somebody you know a couple of the other guys

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:50.500
[Guest]: That didn't happen at all and sure of himself was obviously disincentivized given the fact that his captaincy had been removed

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500
[Guest]: So it was one bloody mess

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:58.220
[Guest]: And I think it was very good that it happened to kick at that early on because it sorted out a lot of things for

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.220
[Amit Varma]: The team and you know whatever I read about

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.980
[Amit Varma]: Say basketball or baseball or the way it's run in the US and all and it's clear to me that you know when you own

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.780
[Amit Varma]: A franchise there are a lot of moving parts which need to come together

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:14.420
[Amit Varma]: There's a sort of the culture that is there's how the owners approach the franchise and the kind of freedom

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.020
[Amit Varma]: They give their people there's a sort of the management culture the dressing room culture

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.780
[Amit Varma]: there's a whole thing happening with scouting and analytics and

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.220
[Amit Varma]: you know a lot of moving parts need to come together and

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:31.860
[Amit Varma]: And did people who ran the franchises at the IPL from the start think about that in a systematic way or is it that is

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.740
[Guest]: That something that came with time. I think it came with time. I'm being very honest with you

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.940
[Guest]: I think it came with time everyone, you know, everyone at some point has read money ball, but you know

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.900
[Guest]: And see again money ball again to accept it for that

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.700
[Guest]: Everything it said was the right way to doing things is also not necessarily true and a lot of teams of the others

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.420
[Guest]: They did the you know

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.220
[Guest]: They threw the baby out of the bathwater saying that you know

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.860
[Guest]: This analytics makes no sense at all and you know, we should just abandon it and go back to basics

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.300
[Guest]: It's famously Delhi in 2011. I remember looked at it that way saying, you know, this is too much

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.300
[Guest]: We don't need this other teams when the other way they went too far into analytics and you know

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:10.020
[Guest]: Analytics does not look at how a player gels with another player and you know that can have huge consequences in a team

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.860
[Guest]: You know players being insecure for example is a huge issue

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.860
[Guest]: So the single one golden rule and this is the great thing I had

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.140
[Guest]: After John Buchanan, I had the opportunity of working with two very very good coaches

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.300
[Guest]: One was to have what more coach Sri Lanka change the world of cricket

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:31.580
[Guest]: I'm what Sri Lanka did 96 just took the 92 New Zealand theory forward to its logical conclusion and won them a World Cup and

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:38.540
[Guest]: Then Trevor Bayliss who was a fantastic coach. He was he was a guy was Sri Lanka 2011, you know, you make them reach the finals and

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:46.020
[Guest]: Both these guys the way they ran the franchise, you know, it was a very simple in their heads

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.660
[Guest]: The two things that they were very clear about was communication

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.780
[Guest]: So communication meant why is a particular player going to play?

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.100
[Guest]: He should know what his job is

00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.940
[Guest]: He should know and he is not playing he should know what needs to change for him to play

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.060
[Guest]: So for example for Bisla

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:09.520
[Guest]: It's clearly a situation that if Brendan McCullum cannot play for any reason either is injured or we don't have

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.820
[Guest]: We need four other foreigners other than Brendan McCullum. You're going to play

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.180
[Guest]: Before that you don't have the opportunity to play but keep yourself fit because given the fourth

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.100
[Guest]: You can have only four international players

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.880
[Guest]: You might just have an opportunity and that's exactly what happened just before the 2012 finals

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.020
[Guest]: Balaji got injured

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.960
[Guest]: We needed another fast bowler Brett Lee had to come into the team the moment Brett Lee came into the team

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:38.380
[Guest]: Brendan McCullum had to be dropped because you have Shakir who's of all-rounder Jacques who's an all-rounder and

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.500
[Guest]: You have Sunil Narayan. They couldn't be dropped. So Brendan even though he had top score in the previous match

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.060
[Guest]: So that's exactly how Bisla knew that he had to step in there

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:53.220
[Guest]: But if you tell that to Bisla one day before that this is you're gonna play he's not going to be ready for it

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:59.540
[Guest]: So what is the single most important thing firstly during the IPL there is very little coaching

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.980
[Guest]: Why very little coaching firstly what you're going to coach?

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:08.580
[Guest]: How many players need to coach Sunil Narayan or a Brendan McCullum or a Brett Lee? What are you gonna teach them?

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.340
[Guest]: You're not going to teach them anything

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:16.540
[Guest]: secondly, even the Indian players the IPL is so tough and as a routine you may have two three practices before and maybe

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.660
[Guest]: Three four during the IPL. I have not seen more than five or six practices in any IPL

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.540
[Guest]: What are you going to get done in five or six nets nothing?

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:31.180
[Guest]: So what do you do you manage the talent that you have you manage their health very well

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.700
[Guest]: you make sure that they gel in the best possible way for these one and a half months and

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:42.460
[Guest]: Then you try and make sure that when they win they maintain their shape when they lose they maintain their shape as a team so that

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:48.380
[Guest]: They can recover fast. That's it. You can't go there, which is why I feel that Gary Kirsten

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.900
[Guest]: You know when people thought that he's going to be the next great thing in IPL t20 coaching

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.860
[Guest]: My thing was that I love Gary

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:59.780
[Guest]: I think it's a fantastic coach, but Gary so far is used to coaching national teams for nine to ten months a year

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:07.060
[Guest]: Working with players giving them the opportunity building them over time the IPL is a completely different game altogether

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.980
[Guest]: Here are my players here my moving parts. I've got them together three days before the tournament. I've got one net

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.300
[Guest]: I've got to decide no team and on the run next in the next 45 days

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.020
[Guest]: I'm going to play 14 matches, which is going to decide my fate

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:25.060
[Guest]: So to even compare a national team coach and compare the situations he comes in with to this is I mean

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:30.420
[Amit Varma]: It just is a completely different ballgame really different skills. We'll take a quick commercial break now and when we come back

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:26.020
[Amit Varma]: Just spoken about cricket and KKR and all of India is interested in that

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:32.260
[Amit Varma]: So let's move on from that to something not so many Indians would really care about deeply which is football

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.620
[Amit Varma]: Which was your next project? So tell me a little bit about that

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.300
[Amit Varma]: Like why did you leave KKR and how did how did football happen?

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:42.700
[Guest]: So KKR those days this was 2014 remember and we just won we won the KKR

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.700
[Guest]: We won the IPL and then we reached the finals of the Champions League

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.500
[Guest]: Champions Trophy, you know, it was called Champions League and then Sunil Narayan got called for

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.460
[Guest]: Just two days before and the strangest part of it is and I still debate this with Javagal Srinath

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.740
[Guest]: That the balls that they gave him

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.380
[Guest]: You know

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.300
[Guest]: They called in one match and the balls that they called him for the next match were totally different deliveries

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.820
[Guest]: So my point was that I mean either that's a chuckle. This is a chuckle. What are you trying to say?

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.980
[Guest]: I mean, you know, even your calls are not consistent. So any for whatever it is

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.620
[Guest]: He was called we lost that match, but that was it

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.420
[Guest]: I mean if we had won 14 matches in a row and I think you know

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.820
[Guest]: We were just on a roll and I thought that I'd never have an opportunity

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:26.700
[Guest]: Where so much has happened with KKR and so many good things have happened and at that point in time

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.100
[Guest]: I just heard and I'd done some work with football for a while and

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:36.820
[Guest]: I'd heard that they were looking at the under-17 football World Cup and it was really exciting was to bring a FIFA event into

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.460
[Guest]: India was really huge

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:44.700
[Guest]: so they had a panel of guys to interview us and they would at that point in time looking at a CEO and

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.500
[Guest]: The person who also came the only person who came from abroad to apply for the job

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.020
[Guest]: There were a couple who was in the same there was about 300 odd Indians

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:58.660
[Guest]: Was this chap called Javier Chepi who had been running Chile the Chilean World Cup at that point in time?

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.380
[Guest]: But he had just resigned for you know differences and Chile's

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.020
[Guest]: Football system was particularly, you know dire at that point in time. So

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.980
[Guest]: Javier knew exactly how to run FIFA wants a World Cup to be run and

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.260
[Guest]: When I was there, they said that you know what joy is also here and you know

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.060
[Guest]: Maybe what joy can do is what government needs what marketing needs?

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.460
[Guest]: what how does football work in this part of the world and how

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.660
[Guest]: How you can bring what FIFA needs and what the international standards are and you sort of become a double header

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:35.260
[Guest]: So he was a tournament director. I was a project director and as it turned out that Javier is the most difficult

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.780
[Guest]: honoree mad

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:43.640
[Guest]: Human being that I have the privilege to work with but it was an absolutely it was in some senses

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.860
[Guest]: It could have been a marriage made in hell or a marriage made in heaven as it so turned out

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.020
[Guest]: we had an absolute blast together, I mean and

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:57.640
[Guest]: And the great thing about it was four days within getting that we were around the country looking at venues

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.660
[Guest]: You know because the first thing you need to do if you have a World Cup is

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.940
[Guest]: What are the places where you can actually play and there are two parts to it?

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.620
[Guest]: One is the stadium itself

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.660
[Guest]: So in all the issues of the stadium I say for example one thing that FIFA will have that

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:15.300
[Guest]: No Indian Stadium normally has is four dressing rooms because you had double headers and FIFA

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.180
[Guest]: Will not have a situation where both teams don't have

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.900
[Guest]: Proper dressing rooms. So even in cricket, I've been there in a double header in

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.580
[Guest]: Hyderabad and one team has had to wait outside in a sort of

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.140
[Guest]: Assembled area jury rigged area just because they are not two dressing rooms

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.380
[Guest]: FIFA would not allow a game to happen under the circumstances

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.420
[Guest]: so firstly we were looking at all the stadiums and what the dressing rooms are about and

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.900
[Guest]: then we are looking at practice grounds because the practice grounds have to be as good as

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.580
[Guest]: The normal turf because that's where most of the teams are going to spend most of their time playing

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.820
[Guest]: So if that turf is not good enough, you're gonna have injuries. You will have injuries means the main tournaments affected

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:58.300
[Guest]: So finding four grounds in every the same that's actually the real bequest of FIFA also because those

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:04.240
[Guest]: 24 practice grounds in those six cities are what matches are going to play on anyway in the main

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.420
[Guest]: I mean the main stadiums are going to be used anyway this way that way but how well you make the other stadiums is what

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:15.460
[Guest]: Happens and I remember we were in Kochi and we were in the middle of a field and it was completely swampy field was near

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.900
[Guest]: The Maharaja Stadium. No, it was the fisheries state

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.300
[Guest]: it was an area owned by the fisheries and we were there with our

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:28.060
[Guest]: Tape measures measuring lens and all and I remember going back to Delhi and three days later seeing a you know

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:31.620
[Guest]: Nice new story saying 21 foot python found inside that area

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.060
[Guest]: but it was like that we went from and

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:42.220
[Guest]: Literally Javier and me Javier firstly here this and I speaking as a quizzer. He had a thirst for facts that

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:46.380
[Guest]: Was unbelievable. So he knew every name of every ground in Goa

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:53.780
[Guest]: Exact, you know uber distance this takes seven point nine two kilometers to this ground. He knew the pronunciation and

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.620
[Guest]: We tracked down every possible ground in the country to play in those six stadiums

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:06.180
[Guest]: So it was it was that and secondly, he was really dedicated about you know, wanting to raise the standard he was in that sense

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:11.140
[Guest]: Socialist in his belief saying that you know, we need to make this it was always our World Cup

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:15.980
[Guest]: It was not India's World Cup. It was our World Cup and so we did a whole lot of things

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:21.180
[Guest]: so the most interesting thing is and I keep saying this that we went to the government for the first time Javier and me to

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.020
[Guest]: Meet in those days how we are actually picked up a lot of Hindi by the time he reached the end

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.280
[Guest]: But those days we went to meet a sort of mid-level official

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.860
[Guest]: Who looked at us and he sort of he was wearing those shoes that look like chappals

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.000
[Guest]: I mean chappals that look like shoes. They're like shoes in the front and chappals at the back

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:36.620
[Guest]: Okay

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.800
[Guest]: he's picking his nose and he was sitting in front and we waited for half an hour you go inside and he said

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.920
[Guest]: How are you a World Cup can I have a football wallet? You near I said, huh?

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.080
[Guest]: So yes, I have keen to kill them. So up

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.560
[Guest]: but I did you got FIFA go

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.040
[Guest]: Do team in the killing India India be on the host in a lot of team Banta

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.320
[Guest]: So however that point does not understand that much in this. So he's hearing India

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Seeing you in show

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:06.920
[Guest]: So it's in a nickel in this half up so she must have coming and that was that I mean and how here I sort of

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:12.120
[Guest]: Dragged him away because he had a temper and he didn't know enough Hindi to be able to figure out

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.840
[Guest]: But that was the kind of official we dealt with

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.280
[Guest]: So after that the government of India came and asked us that you know

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.960
[Guest]: Can you give us a report on what needs to be done?

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.260
[Guest]: So how we are prepared a Gantt chart, which had 8,000 items in it

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.320
[Guest]: Magnificent. Okay, and Javier was he was

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.760
[Guest]: He was the fastest typer and you know

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:38.120
[Guest]: He was very good at what he did and he was very fast and he went into this 8,000 for three months

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.800
[Guest]: We didn't hear from them after three months. He came back and they said that

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.120
[Guest]: By the way, can you simplify it a little bit? So he said yeah, this has about seven and a half thousand

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.120
[Guest]: How many do you want?

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.240
[Guest]: He said about 14 would be really good

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.600
[Guest]: So from seven half thousand they wanted us to bring it down to 14

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.040
[Guest]: Soon we realized we had a real problem and then we found a real solution

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:03.280
[Guest]: The problem we had was every ground remember is owned by a regional state government

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.520
[Guest]: A satrap sport is a subject which is a state subject, you know in that sense

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.760
[Guest]: So Kolkata is run by Mamata Banerjee

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.600
[Guest]: You know at that time Goa is run by the then chief minister of Goa Parikar was there at that point in time

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:20.280
[Guest]: Kerala is run by first it started with the Congress government and then it became a this thing CPM government

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.360
[Guest]: Delhi is run by a different government altogether

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:27.360
[Guest]: So each of these are a government then you have the government of India who has certain amount of overlays

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.440
[Guest]: Certain amount of money certain amount of things you want to know then you have FIFA who's a government by itself

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:38.760
[Guest]: Then you have FIFA's global sponsors like coca-cola adidas these guys then you want to get sponsors of your own

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.600
[Guest]: So there's so many all these are people who basically are invested in you

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.200
[Guest]: and you have to manage all these parties to be able to run a world cup and

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.560
[Guest]: Within two months we realized it's impossible to keep all of these people happy

00:57:53.560 --> 00:58:00.840
[Guest]: So after that basically what we did was we said the only people we can really keep happy and keep this running is FIFA

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:07.040
[Guest]: Fortunately the All India Football Federation the guy who got us on board and was with us Kushal Das was the secretary-general

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.080
[Guest]: He was a cool guy. He was really wanting to make this world cup. So he backed us to the full

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.200
[Guest]: What we did after that was write rules

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.040
[Guest]: So every time the government of India or any state government came up with an objection

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.000
[Guest]: We wrote a rule which FIFA has never heard of before and told them that you know

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.760
[Guest]: This is the FIFA rule about this. I'm sorry. It has to be followed

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.240
[Guest]: Okay, so I have calculated that over his you know, three years of being in India

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.000
[Guest]: Javier has written about 150 FIFA rules

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.320
[Guest]: Which if I would not have heard of in their career my god

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And there's no situation where the government is like saying the throwing an ego fit and saying we don't care if this is a FIFA

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.480
[Guest]: Rule this is FIFA. We would always see that way

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.800
[Guest]: We were very good with the imagery and all FIFA and we said no under 17 World Cup will the last I mean

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.960
[Guest]: People who play in the under 17 World Cup are players like Neymar

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.080
[Guest]: These are all the players, you know

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:58.520
[Guest]: These are the guys who emerged from the under 17 World Cup and all the top footballers from Mbappe to Neymar

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.640
[Guest]: To this thing they've all come from the under 17 system. I said those are the guys who want to play

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.020
[Guest]: This is the rules you want them. You don't want to make up your mind

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.400
[Guest]: So I think we did a good job with that and I think you know

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.520
[Guest]: It was it was not done in a bad way

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.320
[Guest]: We never wrote something that didn't need to be written

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.420
[Guest]: But sometimes even things that FIFA normally said but has not been documented. We said that okay

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.420
[Guest]: This is it. This has to be done and

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:25.460
[Guest]: It worked famously because I think you can't you can't be subject to 10 people

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:30.780
[Guest]: You know having completely different opinions and within that we also had a great great urge to try and make a difference

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.700
[Guest]: So we started something called mission 11 million

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.260
[Guest]: It was an interesting thing that we said that you know

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.540
[Guest]: How can we make a difference because you can't just make a difference for the 22-day tournament

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:45.500
[Guest]: So mission 11 million what we basically said was that forget academies academies are 1.001 percent of India's sport

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.940
[Guest]: The only pipe in India that reliably works in getting to children

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.900
[Guest]: is

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:58.220
[Guest]: Schools because education is so important that the school system is the one not system in India not broken

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.140
[Guest]: So mission 11 million is a very simple thing. What was our objective?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.900
[Guest]: We said in one year, we can't coach them to become better players. We don't have the scale

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.420
[Guest]: We don't have the time but what we can do is

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.460
[Guest]: incentivize kids to play football and

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:17.620
[Guest]: And incentivize teachers and schools to want them to play football. So what we went and did was a very simple thing

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:23.220
[Guest]: We went to the government we went everywhere and we said that look boss. This is what you need to

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:30.420
[Guest]: We would have a seminar. We'd call the principal of the school because we saw a sports teacher in the

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:36.700
[Guest]: Picking order of things in school was just above the you know security guard sometimes below him as well

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.860
[Guest]: I mean, I'm being very totally honest with you

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:44.140
[Guest]: That's how it is because you know, it's a maths teacher who's on top the English teacher the below the principal

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.140
[Guest]: These are really the teachers one

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.300
[Guest]: So we said that if we even if we tell this guy that you know

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.260
[Guest]: Promote football in your school is not going to make any difference. We called in the principals

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.740
[Guest]: We'd have a one-hour seminar where we showed them what the World Cup was about and the most important thing

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.180
[Guest]: We showed them was you can play football

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:06.340
[Guest]: Anyway, one of the biggest wastages that happen in our India system is you have so many schools were insisting on having this big ground

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:10.100
[Guest]: Where 11 and 11 kids play nowhere in the world below the age of 15

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:16.060
[Guest]: Will you have 11 and 11 games being played by kids because kids are just not physically fit to play on these big grounds

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.740
[Guest]: So what happens one kick kids kicks a ball it goes in the other side by the time it comes back

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.980
[Guest]: It doesn't we show them take this entire field now break it up into eight fields

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.260
[Guest]: One two, three, four, five six seven eight play five and five with free substitution each of these fields

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.820
[Guest]: So now you have five and five ten. Okay, plus a free substitution say about 16 kids

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.460
[Guest]: 16 into say 8. Okay, that's what 144 kids or

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.380
[Guest]: 128 kids are playing in a place where a maximum 17 18 20 kids are normally playing and

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.540
[Guest]: Then we said you can play in any small area is the greatest thing about football is such a resource light sport

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.180
[Guest]: You need four stones and you know one ball

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.060
[Guest]: That's all you need to play football and that's how you be incentivized to play football and we'd say

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.820
[Guest]: I'm going to address and said don't give us money. We don't need money

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.740
[Guest]: We've got certain amount of money from the government of India. Give us merchandise. Okay, we went to Hero Motors

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:13.420
[Guest]: Don't give us money. Give us six motorcycles for the teachers for the best teachers in each region

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.420
[Guest]: We implemented mission 11 million. Let's give them motorcycles

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:21.340
[Guest]: so that teacher is also in shit somebody got a motorcycle for actually promoting football and

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.580
[Guest]: We bought and give away some 60,000 balls and we just say play the sport

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:32.380
[Guest]: If you play it well send us the things your school could feature so not only can the kids win merchandise and stuff

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.620
[Guest]: But the school principal could get interviewed they could win something the teachers could win something

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:43.540
[Guest]: So we incentivize the entire ecosystem of Indian football and we said what are we doing?

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:48.460
[Guest]: We're just giving away kids to play more football as much as we can and that's what we did with it

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.420
[Amit Varma]: So what can you interest me is that you're brought into this project as a project director to say?

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:56.820
[Amit Varma]: Okay, set up this World Cup set up this event, but you also taken upon yourself

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.700
[Amit Varma]: The ambit of doing something for Indian football per se so I have sort of two related questions here

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.220
[Amit Varma]: one is that is

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.340
[Amit Varma]: football a sport that Indians can excel in

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.940
[Amit Varma]: Naturally for a couple of reasons one is obviously we're a tropical country and weather and blah blah blah

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.300
[Amit Varma]: And we're not really a sporting culture in that sense. And I mean are we suited for the sport?

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:28.100
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know genetically you would assume it has been theorized that Indians are not good at sports

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:33.900
[Amit Varma]: Which require either extreme speed or extreme stamina and therefore we excel in sports

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:39.700
[Amit Varma]: Which requires skill like batting and cricket does or badminton and so on and we won't really have 100 meter sprinters

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:46.420
[Amit Varma]: Or we won't really dominate marathons and so on and so forth and we'll be middling in all of those is football

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:51.180
[Amit Varma]: Therefore something that like do you think those barriers exist? Okay, two things

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:57.300
[Guest]: So, you know, I think it's a it's fairly this point has been debated although one is that you look at Chile Chile has about

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.380
[Guest]: 16 million people 15 16 million people

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:06.780
[Guest]: So 16 million people having the same build Chile was you know number at one time rated number two three four five in the world

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.100
[Guest]: Okay to have 16 million people who have a similar genetic build to Chileans

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.020
[Guest]: I'm sure we do because our genetic, you know

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.700
[Guest]: Masala is so thick that it is there to is that you know

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:21.140
[Guest]: The second argument that we kept coming across was look at the Europeans look at the grounds

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:25.220
[Guest]: They have you know, look at the grounds in England. Look at the grounds in Germany. Look at the grounds in France

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.260
[Guest]: We'll never be there and I said, okay boss 11 World Cups have been won by countries like that

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:34.780
[Guest]: Look at the nine World Cups out there. Look at Brazil. Look at Argentina. They're shambolic

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.620
[Guest]: I'm telling you the facilities in Uruguay Argentina Brazil are shambolic

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:45.780
[Guest]: They're worse than Indian grounds kids play on the streets kids make it out there their system is more political than us more corrupt

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:51.900
[Guest]: And us why do they make it because at a very young level parents are invested in the game

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:57.380
[Guest]: So it's passion for football that has made a difference. It is not the fact that they had more facilities than us

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.100
[Guest]: Passion translates into one more thing, which is also a realistic thing

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:06.220
[Guest]: It's not so much the difference in talent, but the difference I'll tell you is somebody like for example a

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:13.140
[Guest]: a good example is a Messi a Messi has been picked up from say 6 7 the age of 6 7 by the time a

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.600
[Guest]: Equivalent of a Messi say playing for Brazil for the under 17 World Cup came to India

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:24.500
[Guest]: He's played some six being played when a competitive football. I'm not saying this thing

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.180
[Guest]: It's the it's what the level is. It's he's been playing competitive matches since he's 7 8 years old

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.900
[Guest]: So he's played 10 years of competitive matches

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:38.020
[Guest]: 150 500 competitive matches typically in India a kid starts playing

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.660
[Guest]: Comparative matches only at 13 14 so in fact one of the big things that they're now trying to do is

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:50.540
[Guest]: Promote what we call baby leaks where kids at the age of 7 8 9 because if talent wise you've got to go

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.380
[Guest]: Go there you have to be picked up at 7 8 you can't they can't afford to you know

01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:00.300
[Guest]: See you at 13 14 you'll have a few late bloomers, but if you're not starting to tap

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.940
[Guest]: Top level talent at 7 8 which is what it happens around the world you can't catch up

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:09.940
[Guest]: So I think that will make a difference, and that's what you know it's all about that getting them there

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:15.440
[Guest]: I think genetically is a less of a problem as creating systems and see it's not just you know

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:20.940
[Guest]: How do baby leagues work baby leagues don't work on government support anything baby league works on?

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:28.300
[Guest]: Communities where in this school the parents are coming to watch because the football is a real interest how many parents do you see?

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.860
[Guest]: Of a previous generation still now it's become a bit more common

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:36.060
[Guest]: Do you see of a previous generation going to watch the kids playing football or playing a match something it never used to happen because?

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.540
[Guest]: Yeah, it's roti kapda makhan a padai karo get on with it now

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:45.060
[Guest]: You're getting a little more of that, but you're getting it where you're getting it still in upper-class urban, India

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.260
[Guest]: You're not getting it. You know at the places where it matters

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.500
[Guest]: You're not getting it in the ranch ease and the you know the these things bear ample to the world and the you know

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:58.860
[Guest]: But in does with the world that's where at that level if you start spotting kids at that level

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.980
[Guest]: It is play 45 50 matches a year. That's when you're gonna get results

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:08.220
[Amit Varma]: I guess the dual conditions for you know football really flourishing in India would be a culture and be institutions and

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.660
[Amit Varma]: speaking of the first and it strikes me that you know the

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:16.900
[Amit Varma]: Phenomenon that you point out that in some of these football crazy countries you have parents going with their kids and watching them play and

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.580
[Amit Varma]: All of that and that culture is there, but if you look at the incentives in place because it's an aspirational thing

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:26.340
[Amit Varma]: They know that if the kid reaches the top or even if he doesn't reach the top and has a middling kind of career

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.500
[Amit Varma]: He can still make a hell of a lot of money and be a star

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:34.380
[Amit Varma]: Is there a vicious circle in play in India where because you know?

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:40.180
[Amit Varma]: There's no culture and ecosystem football isn't really a lucrative sport for Indian players

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.180
[Amit Varma]: And therefore because of that people aren't incentivized to get

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.700
[Guest]: Interested enough play enough and of course it is see but the other thing is that you know

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.260
[Guest]: You'll be surprised two things really make a difference one is you know the actual play

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:58.140
[Guest]: The second is what we call making of legends making of stars if you go say to rural

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.380
[Guest]: Indiana you know Kentucky in Indiana especially really what we call basketball country

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.380
[Guest]: They're hardcore basketball country, and if you go there

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:09.220
[Guest]: And you'll see there are high school heroes who are revered for the past 30 years

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.820
[Guest]: You know that guy that was a year they won the state championship or whatever. He's not even played in the NBA

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.620
[Guest]: He's not even played really well in college

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:22.140
[Guest]: But he was a high school star, and they have a system or a system where these people are recognized

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.580
[Guest]: I've seen that in small parts in certain parts of the country

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.340
[Guest]: I mean there are certain parts of Rajchi where you know you know certain

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.580
[Guest]: You know a dung dung as a hockey star was really revered and you know in that community dung dung was very big

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.340
[Guest]: And that's why a lot of Adivasi kids tribal kids wanted to play a hockey for example

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:43.780
[Guest]: But it's not happened over systematic. You'll see little bits of it in Bombay

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:49.300
[Guest]: You have kanga league legends in India. You know you have that legend, but that's what you know at that level

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:56.260
[Guest]: The guy must be incentivized even if he's a star in this little place that people want to come and watch him shake his hand

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.300
[Guest]: And say you know he can sell cars because somebody wants to go and buy it from the salesman who's a you know high school

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.300
[Guest]: Star you know that's the level at which

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.140
[Guest]: You actually make a difference support if you expect him to make a difference only if he reaches the NBA you simply will not have

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:15.380
[Guest]: Enough people in that ecosystem, and I don't see that haven't seen that happening often in India. There are little pockets in Kolkata

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.740
[Guest]: For example you know you play club level football at some level of football you you got that opportunity

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:25.380
[Guest]: More in the suburbs of Kolkata and this thing are you that guy used to play for Aryans yet?

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.260
[Guest]: He's still a big name in the locality. He's played first division football

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940
[Guest]: That is what you know

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:35.140
[Guest]: makes sport happen because sport the truth of it is

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:42.060
[Guest]: Everyone will tell you you know look at America and be and all that the truth of it is in any sport in the world

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.460
[Guest]: Any sport in the world the proportion of people wanting to play to the proportion of people being?

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.380
[Guest]: Professionals is so small that it is never a bet worth taking

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:58.220
[Guest]: the only reason it's a bet worth taking is if you actually feel the stars in the starlight and you're foolish enough to dream for

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.420
[Guest]: It and you get recognition even at this level that you know it makes you feel good about yourself

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.460
[Guest]: Professional sport is never a rational proposition

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.180
[Guest]: Unless your surname happens to be tendulkar or callous

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:16.100
[Guest]: I mean and you're so touched with greatness that from the age of 13 everyone's looking at you and saying dude this guy's gonna play

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.380
[Amit Varma]: First but in that sense to turn that around when you say it's not a bet worth taking of course it isn't but then the

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.300
[Amit Varma]: Point is in a lot of countries people

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:27.500
[Amit Varma]: Kids don't get into sport because they're taking a bet they get into sport because there is a sporting culture

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.060
[Amit Varma]: And that is what they would do naturally

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:34.500
[Amit Varma]: I mean just contrasting Australia and India for example that there you have so many more people in the free time will go

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:40.100
[Guest]: Surfing or they'll go absolutely, but the truth of it is you're right, but that's in India

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:45.980
[Guest]: Playing sport is an effort much more than it is anywhere else and that's the difference

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:50.380
[Guest]: I mean look I'll give you a very simple example the number of caddies in India who become champions

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:54.700
[Guest]: Why have they become champions because they have have they are people who have had access to those?

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:59.620
[Guest]: You know the kit that these things the links for the longest time the access itself is

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:05.260
[Guest]: Huge problem in India. It's a huge problem in the axis a huge problem in that time is a huge problem in India

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.140
[Guest]: These are things that come in the way you're right if I play it long enough

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.700
[Guest]: And I suddenly say wow I'm good enough at it

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.300
[Guest]: I have to play that many games to be able to get that opportunity and again in football

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:21.820
[Guest]: What is the problem if by 9 10? I'm not spotted. I'm mostly I'm too late for really making it big internationally

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:28.300
[Amit Varma]: Right and and football you would imagine is is actually a game suited to India and at least one respect that access is not such

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.300
[Guest]: A big deal. It's a very cheap sport. That's what we try to do mission lemon resource light

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:36.900
[Guest]: Just get kids as many kids playing as possible then get little

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:42.060
[Guest]: Organized little leagues as possible and just get them to kick a ball the only way you know

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.580
[Guest]: Resource like sports are very important, which is I volleyball

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.060
[Guest]: Also, I'm a huge proponent of for that one reason you just need one net and one ball

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:53.580
[Guest]: And it can be played at a variety of levels. I mean even cricket requires a certain amount of skill to play

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:58.340
[Guest]: Okay, and volleyball and football are that way the easiest and just to get a ball across the net

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.260
[Amit Varma]: You know forget this and everyone's involved. It's not like in cricket just keep us bad

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.660
[Amit Varma]: He's batting and taking the bat home and correct exactly

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.900
[Guest]: So and I'm that's what we told it and we said in football before the age of 15

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.740
[Guest]: Nobody should be paying anything other than five of five and five four and four three and three

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.460
[Guest]: Because those are the games that way everyone is involved

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:20.780
[Guest]: In 1111 big games kids people are not involved. It's meant for more professional style of play

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860
[Amit Varma]: So what were the challenges you faced?

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:29.180
[Amit Varma]: In both of these just mean one in organizing the event and be in just making football a deeper part of the culture

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:36.260
[Guest]: So big so first the challenges we faced were you know in making this event happen was just actually getting grounds ready

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.500
[Guest]: And I remember you know in India

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:43.900
[Guest]: We look at grounds exactly the opposite way that say a FIFA looks at it and for all its sins

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:48.260
[Guest]: in the political part of the organization the side of FIFA that we dealt with was the

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:54.780
[Guest]: Administrative the project side the people who actually did things so I remember we went to Guwahati for a match and the first thing

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.820
[Guest]: We did was we went straight out in the middle of the field you know and these people were all there to meet us

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.260
[Guest]: You know from the Assam Football Association

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:05.700
[Guest]: And we went straight in the whole FIFA delegation went straight to the middle of the pitch first

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.620
[Guest]: Because a single most important thing to FIFA was the pitch and the state of the pitch

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.140
[Guest]: From the pitch they move to the dressing room. What were the dressing rooms like and that's how an inspection happens

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:20.300
[Guest]: Then they go to the stands what the stands like what are the bathrooms like for the men's bathroom like for the women's bathroom

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.140
[Guest]: Like what is the proportion of bathrooms to you know?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:28.660
[Guest]: Teams of spectators, that's that then they move basically to the

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:34.020
[Guest]: Media Tribune is the media is the place enough for the media to sit are there enough connections are there enough?

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:39.860
[Guest]: Places for them to get food is a view okay for them are there enough televisions are there enough factories

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:45.180
[Guest]: That's a third and then you move to the fourth which is you know where's the VIP area where the people where do they need?

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.780
[Guest]: To sit how do they?

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:52.940
[Guest]: This path that they traverse is exactly the opposite that most Indian sport including football traverses

01:13:52.940 --> 01:14:00.460
[Guest]: So Indian sports starts with the VIP then moves to the media guy then moves the spectator and absolutely the last is

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:06.020
[Guest]: The actual sportsman and this is true of almost all sports cricket is an honorable exception

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.580
[Guest]: Which is why for whatever for all the problems you have with the BCC. I think it has done one thing

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:15.460
[Guest]: It has put Indian sportsmen cricketers right at the top of the heap, and that's I think that's very important for sport

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.540
[Guest]: But in football this was exactly the problem as it is and I remember going to a South Asian games

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.540
[Guest]: I was talking about in Guwahati and

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:29.780
[Guest]: We had players lined up Indian people who have represented their country, and this is all India Pakistan

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.780
[Guest]: You know all these countries were there Bangladesh

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:37.140
[Guest]: And they're standing in a narrow corridor for one and a half hours wearing blazers with no

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:41.940
[Guest]: Air-conditioning no fans waiting for the VVIPs to first come

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:49.020
[Guest]: Then give their speeches then for the opening ceremony to start and then to walk on to the field and that is cruel and remember

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.940
[Guest]: We are doing this in Guwahati and some of them are going to be playing in Shillong the next day

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:59.260
[Guest]: So not only do they finish that and they're like dehydrated and three hours in a suit a day before a match

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.260
[Guest]: Then the next day they're going to they're going to travel another three four hours go to Shillong and play a match

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:09.420
[Guest]: And that's when you look and say how badly we treat these people how badly we treat sportsmen in this country

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.260
[Amit Varma]: It's not funny. I mean the whole I mean this kind of reminds me of ancient Rome where you know you have gladiators

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.260
[Amit Varma]: Who are there just for entertainment?

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:22.860
[Amit Varma]: They are the spectacle and it should really be the other way around the player should be the star and everything flows from there

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:26.460
[Guest]: And that's that's one thing that again as I said FIFA BCCI they do well

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:30.460
[Guest]: They may be political in their own way, but there's no doubt who is the hero of that

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:37.460
[Guest]: I mean the dressings room we made for the teams here and that's that's a benefit that will stay for a long long time

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.460
[Guest]: The the practice fields that we make and you know what we used to do is to have this very simple thing

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.460
[Guest]: It was easy for us to say jury rig up lights because you needed practice at nights

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:49.460
[Guest]: And you need because there were only one team is practicing you needed only one dressing room and one

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.460
[Guest]: This thing you need one dressing room and one set of bathrooms

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:58.460
[Guest]: What we said was that look what's the point of doing that if you're going to get a state government to make that

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:05.460
[Guest]: Let's make it two dressing rooms two sets of bathrooms and permanent lights because that means that once this FIFA World Cup is over

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.460
[Guest]: This is where the local tournaments will happen

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:11.460
[Guest]: You see the big field is not going to impact play in this state

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:17.460
[Guest]: These small fields these four small fields with floodlights and lights, you know, whether it's in Benalim

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:23.460
[Guest]: You know where the places we did it those fields are really going to be fields which are going to be used year in year out

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.460
[Guest]: Those floodlights are going to make a difference to Indian sport Indian football for the next 15 years

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:32.460
[Guest]: Huge knock on effect more people come to see the games as more glamour around the game more of the aspirational

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:37.460
[Amit Varma]: And we genuinely that is the one thing whether we succeeded or failed Javier and me said

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.460
[Guest]: We can't just come here do a World Cup 23 day World Cup and go it makes no difference

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.460
[Guest]: If he cannot at least make so whatever Mission 11 million

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:51.460
[Guest]: I remember getting a really bad newspaper report about it over you into the school and nothing was there

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.460
[Guest]: And here they must have been, you know, we did 21,000 schools in Mission 11 million

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:59.460
[Guest]: There must have been 10,000 schools when nothing happened. They just took the balls and went home

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:06.460
[Guest]: But if they were even you know 10,000 schools where people kids distributed footballs and few more kids played football because of us

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:12.460
[Guest]: It's because we decided to at least try and make a damn difference to what happens to sport in our country

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:16.460
[Guest]: And that was important to us, you know, really I remember this great story about this school

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.460
[Guest]: I do not want to mention the name in Goa. They were a girls school and they said, you know

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.460
[Guest]: Girls, you know, they come in skirts. So I said they'll play in skirts

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.460
[Guest]: They said that you know, there's a cement ground. I said, you know, they can kick the ball in the cement ground

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.460
[Guest]: And he said it's too small. It's a badminton court. I said they can play three on three four and four in that

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:41.460
[Guest]: And then the next day they started playing and this mother superior sort of raised her habit a bit and kicked off the ball for the first time

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.460
[Guest]: And that picture I have and I will live with that picture and they send me pictures later saying that, you know

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:48.460
[Guest]: Every day we still play football in the school

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:53.460
[Guest]: And that those are the kind of stories that make you feel that is that picture for public consumption

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.460
[Guest]: Can I post it? I will I will get that picture of you

01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:03.460
[Amit Varma]: If a movie is made on that, I can imagine that being a pivotal scene either at the start or at the end

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.460
[Guest]: It does things to you, you know, and that's it. You know, there's this

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:10.460
[Guest]: I mean, we we send a photographer really good friend of mine again

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:16.460
[Guest]: We paid him nothing and said, you know, we can pay for you to go and shoot football kids around the country for this mission

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.460
[Guest]: So go there. We can't pay you, but do it. And he did this book

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:27.460
[Guest]: It is absolutely gorgeous. The kind of pictures that he's taken. What's it called? It's about mission

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.460
[Guest]: I mean, it's just about mission. I mean, just just covering on the kids

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.460
[Guest]: And, you know, we went to a school for the, you know, differently abled kids and, you know, they're playing

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:42.460
[Guest]: And it's it's it's one of those things that you look at and say, OK, this was worth it for whatever it's worth

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:46.460
[Amit Varma]: It was worth it. So now it's, you know, you two guys, you and Javier, you're doing this

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.460
[Amit Varma]: You've taken this upon yourself, though it's probably not part of your ambit per se

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:55.460
[Amit Varma]: But now you're done with it. I mean, obviously, to some extent, you've kindled a passion and that continues in various ways

01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:01.460
[Amit Varma]: Your infrastructure is there and that culture is there in some schools, but you need longer lasting institutions

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.460
[Guest]: We know, but that's what we knew we couldn't. We knew our ambit was there for three years

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.460
[Guest]: But we whatever difference and we made many differences

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:13.460
[Guest]: I mean, one of the differences was that every time we go to meet them, they used to ask us

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:20.460
[Guest]: Sir, please give us the number of the car. Because remember, now with Shastri Bhavan on the ministries, you have to give the number of the car

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:24.460
[Guest]: So it can go inside because there was a lot of chaos about, you know, people coming to the ministry and doing things

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.460
[Guest]: And when I used to reply on an almost regular basis that we're coming in the metro

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.460
[Guest]: They just couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that, you know, these two guys

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:41.460
[Guest]: So the other funny story was that we used to have some people out there who were still there from the 2010 Commonwealth Games

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.460
[Guest]: Who were still hanging around there doing something or the other, you know, the court cases or whatever it was

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:52.460
[Guest]: So they used to see us and regularly we used to walk into the Sai canteen, Sports Authority of India canteen

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:56.460
[Guest]: And stand and eat the 30 rupees, the standard fare out there

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.460
[Guest]: And one of them who was a sort of their senior officer, let it be known

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:07.460
[Guest]: He called us one day and said, some of my juniors have said that the canteen further down, which is in the next building

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:11.460
[Guest]: That canteen is actually better food than out here

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:16.460
[Unknown]: So he doesn't eat, but some of his juniors have informed him

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.460
[Unknown]: And we say, yeah, thanks for the tip

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.460
[Guest]: So the next day onwards, we went to that canteen and he was right, it was much better

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:26.460
[Guest]: But we'd go in the afternoon, stand out there, eat our stuff, go in metros

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:33.460
[Guest]: So the thing about it was, we also sort of tried to have a culture in our team and everyone there saying that, boss

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:39.460
[Guest]: This is what it's about. And especially if you're working in football in this country and you are staying in five-star hotel

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.460
[Guest]: There's somewhere, there's a disbalance of what's happening

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:47.460
[Guest]: So we, to a certain extent, we certainly worked our talk to whatever extent it was possible

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:51.460
[Guest]: And I think that made a difference, the kind of people who worked with us

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:57.460
[Guest]: Remember, while our team started small, it ended up with, you know, more than 400 people working across it

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.460
[Guest]: These guys are also going to be working probably in the indoor sport ecosystem for the next 10-15 years

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:05.460
[Guest]: I think, yeah, there was a start made somewhere about, you know, what sport means

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:10.460
[Guest]: And a large part of it is Javier because of just the way he was

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.460
[Amit Varma]: And I guess one of your ambits also must have, to make the event a success

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:18.460
[Amit Varma]: Would also have been to get more bums in seats and to sort of increase the viewership

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:19.460
[Amit Varma]: How did you kind of think about that?

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.460
[Guest]: So we did a lot of things and we did very interesting things because we knew we didn't have money

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.460
[Guest]: So what we played off was other stuff

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:30.460
[Guest]: So for example, you know, we were in a situation where our ticketing launch was happening

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.460
[Guest]: And it was very interesting, our ticketing launch in 2017 was the same time as the Confed Cup's ticketing launch

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:38.460
[Guest]: Confed Cup is the year one Russia before

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.460
[Guest]: And we said, how do we make it big? How do we actually make sure tickets are sold?

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:50.460
[Guest]: So I had an idea and I said, 1911 was, if you remember, when Mohun Bagan beat East Yorkshire regiment

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.460
[Guest]: For the first ever time that, you know, it was the first real milestone in Indian football

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.460
[Guest]: I love the way you said, if you remember

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.460
[Amit Varma]: We are both oldish, but not that old

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:03.460
[Guest]: Exactly, I don't remember too much nowadays

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.460
[Guest]: But the truth is, I said, so what I did was, Carlos Piol was coming down, which FIFA had sponsored

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:14.460
[Guest]: 1911, the captain was Bijay Das Bahaduri and I think Shibdash was one of them

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:19.460
[Guest]: And his granddaughter-in-law was the only surviving relative of that team

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:26.460
[Guest]: And I flew her down, it was the first time she'd gone to a flight in her life, with Carlos Piol

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:33.460
[Guest]: And I launched the ticket exactly at 7.11pm, that's 1911 in the evening

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.460
[Guest]: As a tribute to Mohun Bagan's first thing

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.460
[Guest]: So what have I done? I've paid for a ticket for a lady who's never got onto a plane and come out here

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:47.460
[Guest]: And I've basically, I've taken that moment and said that this is in honour of Mohun Bagan

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.460
[Guest]: Can you imagine the impact it had in Calcutta?

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:56.460
[Guest]: So a lot of marketing is not just about, you know, how much money I spent in the media

01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.460
[Guest]: It's the message I give, that I may be FIFA, but I care for India

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.460
[Guest]: And we cared, FIFA cared for India, FIFA cared enough

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:11.460
[Guest]: And the way FIFA puts out tickets, they put out 5%, then 5% more, then wait, like that's how it happens

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:15.460
[Guest]: Those first 10% of tickets in Calcutta were sold out within an hour and a half

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:20.460
[Guest]: And I remember at that point in time, Carlos Piol's agent was very close to Infantino

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.460
[Guest]: He called up Infantino and said, by the way, the tickets are sold out here

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:27.460
[Guest]: He said, can you send that team to Russia because we haven't managed to sell tickets for the Conference Cup right now

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.460
[Guest]: And we were sending, so that's the thing, that, you know, even using marketing

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.460
[Guest]: And then we used to turn around and say, look at it, this is where Neymar has come from, you know

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.460
[Guest]: This is where this player has come from

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:43.460
[Guest]: All these guys are top stars, started their careers with the FIFA U-17 World Cup

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:48.460
[Guest]: So you're going to watch players who are going to dominate world football over the next 5, 10, 15 years

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.460
[Guest]: And it's happening, Mbappe is already dominating

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.460
[Guest]: Mbappe played in Chile, the tournament just two years before us

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:56.460
[Guest]: The guys who played for us already, they're making a bond

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.460
[Guest]: Jadon Sancho is Borussia Dortmund, he's doing

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.460
[Guest]: Vinicius Junior came for the qualifying tournament

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.460
[Guest]: Vinicius Junior has just been signed by Real

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.460
[Guest]: Phil Foden is a star and he's going to be a star in the making as well

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.460
[Guest]: So all these guys are now making it

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:14.460
[Guest]: And that's what, you know, people in sitting in stadiums in India would have said, we saw these guys first

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.460
[Amit Varma]: And it was an amazing atmosphere

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.460
[Amit Varma]: And how was the television viewership?

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.460
[Amit Varma]: Like, how does it compare to, I mean, you can't compare anything to cricket

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.460
[Amit Varma]: But how does it compare to before when football was better?

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.460
[Guest]: No, no, so, look, the viewership, the interesting viewership we got was actually on-ground viewership, which was crazy

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.460
[Guest]: And I remember there was a match between Japan and East Caledonia

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.460
[Guest]: Because East Caledonia had qualified for, somehow managed to qualify from the Oceania group

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:42.460
[Guest]: And I think East Caledonia's complete population is about 200,000

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.460
[Guest]: And there were 60,000 in the stadium that day

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.460
[Guest]: And all these guys got out and they just couldn't this thing

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.460
[Guest]: So we had amazing, amazing on-ground crowds

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:56.460
[Guest]: Especially Kolkata, Goa, Kochi gave us fantastic on-ground crowds

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.460
[Guest]: And what we did get was a knock-on effect on television

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.460
[Guest]: That means we got decent ratings

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:04.460
[Guest]: But these were decent ratings by football standards

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:07.460
[Guest]: They were obviously nowhere close to what cricket did

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.460
[Amit Varma]: And what does the whole project teach you about Indian sport per se?

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.460
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, we just tend to be all about cricket, cricket, cricket

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.460
[Amit Varma]: Cricket gets all the eyeballs, cricket gets all the money

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.460
[Amit Varma]: Cricket is also the one sport which is not run by the government

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.460
[Amit Varma]: All the others, like football, are run by the government

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:26.460
[Amit Varma]: Did it kind of give you the sense that it is not because we are not a sporting nation

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:33.460
[Amit Varma]: But somewhere we have lost an opportunity in, you know, tapping the sporting instinct within people?

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.460
[Guest]: Absolutely, I think, you know, I still take a class in IIM Cal almost every year

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:43.460
[Guest]: Where one of the lectures I do is about this, and I call it, and it has changed in my head also

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:46.460
[Guest]: The sorry tale of Indian sport in 16 and a half slides

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.460
[Guest]: So very much, and to basically try and explain

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.460
[Guest]: Because this question everyone will turn around

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.460
[Guest]: Hari, you are working in Indian sport, you are 1.3 billion people, you know

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.460
[Guest]: Why don't we produce more winners?

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.460
[Guest]: And the question has only changed in the last 20 years

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.460
[Guest]: That it was 1 billion people at one time, it's now 1.3 billion, you know

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.460
[Guest]: The essence has not changed

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.460
[Guest]: So what I do is, you know, I take them back

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.460
[Guest]: And I said, you know, this is why sport

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.460
[Guest]: And let's leave Kabaddi aside for a moment

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.460
[Guest]: Or, you know, the Indian, traditional Indian sports

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.460
[Guest]: Sport was really brought to India by the British

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.460
[Guest]: Who wanted their soldiers to have a good time

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:18.460
[Guest]: And who happened to think that playing a match against India is a much better way of letting off steam

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.460
[Guest]: Than throwing a bomb against us

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.460
[Guest]: Which is why they promoted football in Calcutta

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:26.460
[Guest]: To make people get off their energies and their angers and their angst

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:30.460
[Guest]: By sport rather than taking it as a, you know, taking it as war

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.460
[Guest]: The second thing was that from there

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.460
[Guest]: When they moved out in 1947

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.460
[Guest]: The rest of the country was too busy

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.460
[Guest]: To, you know, roti kapra, makan, survival

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.460
[Guest]: Pakistan on one side

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.460
[Guest]: East Pakistan on the other side

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.460
[Guest]: China on top of us

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.460
[Guest]: We are going to starve as a country

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.460
[Guest]: We had too much on our hands

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.460
[Guest]: The only guys who actually had time to spare in sport

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.460
[Guest]: Was actually royalty

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.460
[Guest]: So notice, Maharaj of Santosh, Maharaj of Patiala

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.460
[Guest]: Karni Singh, this thing, Singh

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.460
[Guest]: Why? Because they are the only people who have time to spare

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.460
[Guest]: So if you see

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.460
[Guest]: Sporting organizations were dominated for a long time by them

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.460
[Guest]: And then came the sort of combination

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.460
[Guest]: The politician and the bureaucrat

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.460
[Guest]: And I remember telling this tale

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.460
[Guest]: Especially till two years

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.460
[Guest]: It was completely relevant

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.460
[Guest]: It still is

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.460
[Guest]: That in 1971, Mrs. Gandhi, you know

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.460
[Guest]: The 71 war is happening

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.460
[Guest]: Mrs. Gandhi is being called Durga by people

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460
[Guest]: Who we, you know, we don't want to name out here

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.460
[Guest]: And, you know, she is

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.460
[Guest]: It's a cold war is going on

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.460
[Guest]: And then comes, limitation talks are happening in the USA

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.460
[Guest]: And a young man gets selected

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.460
[Guest]: As the head of the Indian Archery Federation

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.460
[Guest]: His name is Vijay Kumar Malhotra

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.460
[Guest]: Cut to 2016

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.460
[Guest]: And the grandson is now trying to fight

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.460
[Guest]: To political power, the cold war is much

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.460
[Guest]: Is much ended, 7-8 American presidents

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.460
[Guest]: Have passed since then

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.460
[Guest]: And who is the head of the federation?

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.460
[Guest]: It was Vijay Kumar Malhotra

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.460
[Guest]: And that's what Indian sport was

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:52.460
[Guest]: Because in those days when you started off

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.460
[Guest]: For the Indian sports person

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.460
[Guest]: For the Indian administrator

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.460
[Guest]: Remember, if you went abroad in the 70s

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:00.460
[Guest]: You'd normally be allowed to carry

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.460
[Guest]: 20 dollars foreign exchange, that was it

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.460
[Guest]: So who would

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.460
[Guest]: For an administrator, the great opportunity

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.460
[Guest]: Was going for a paid holiday abroad

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.460
[Guest]: And they are the kind of people

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.460
[Guest]: Who dominated Indian administration

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.460
[Guest]: The politicians and the bureaucrats

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.460
[Amit Varma]: And it's really only after

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.460
[Guest]: Was there a lot of money to be made for them?

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:20.460
[Guest]: No, it's not much money, it was power

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.460
[Guest]: It was exactly as I said, power

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.460
[Guest]: Exactly like I was talking about in Dinda

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:26.460
[Guest]: Where you have a selector who can say

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.460
[Guest]: You are the guys who are doing it

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.460
[Guest]: So one, it was power, it was influence

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.460
[Guest]: And it was 2-3 foreign visits

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.460
[Guest]: In 76, why do we go to AstroTurf?

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:36.460
[Guest]: We went to AstroTurf because

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.460
[Guest]: The Canadians were unsure

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.460
[Guest]: That in 1976

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.460
[Guest]: In Montreal they'll be able to play

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.460
[Guest]: With proper turf grounds hockey

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.460
[Guest]: So they had to change the rules towards AstroTurf

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.460
[Guest]: And the Indian and Pakistani guys

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.460
[Guest]: Just did not bother

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.460
[Guest]: Because they were too busy on a pleasure trip

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.460
[Guest]: For shopping and doing other stuff

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.460
[Guest]: And we basically sold

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.460
[Guest]: And the funny thing is it didn't just hurt

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460
[Guest]: Indian and Pakistani hockey

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.460
[Guest]: It hurt hockey because Indian and Pakistan

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.460
[Guest]: Nosedived and these were the only countries

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.460
[Guest]: Where hockey was a number one or number two sport

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.460
[Guest]: The rest of the world, it was always number four

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.460
[Guest]: So suddenly come the 2000s

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:12.460
[Guest]: They said, we need Indian hockey

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.460
[Guest]: To revive again

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.460
[Guest]: The Indian administrators gave it away

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.460
[Guest]: The rest of them were very happy to dominate Indian hockey

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.460
[Guest]: And suddenly realized without Indian and Pakistan

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.460
[Guest]: We don't have a game worth watching

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.460
[Guest]: Because we are too small a part of the pie

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.460
[Guest]: To really make a difference

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.460
[Guest]: So that's how badly

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.460
[Guest]: Administration has hurt India

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.460
[Guest]: And I remember, I was part of a

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.460
[Guest]: You know, when I was in All India Football Federation

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.460
[Guest]: Working with the World Cup

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.460
[Guest]: We were part of a general body meeting

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.460
[Guest]: And I remember once the general body meeting

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.460
[Guest]: Was there and said, the registrations

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.460
[Guest]: For the local state associations

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.460
[Guest]: For all the associations

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.460
[Guest]: Went from 500 rupees to 10,000 rupees

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.460
[Guest]: Now mind you

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.460
[Guest]: Every guy who's sitting out there

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:54.460
[Guest]: Who's a state representative

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:56.460
[Guest]: Has been flown down from his city

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:58.460
[Guest]: Or his or her city of origin

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.460
[Guest]: To Bombay or Delhi where it was for a meeting

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.460
[Guest]: Kept up, put in a five star hotel or a four star hotel

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.460
[Guest]: So 30,000 rupees must have been spent on that

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.460
[Guest]: And four guys, associations

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.460
[Guest]: Got up and said, 10,000 rupees

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.460
[Guest]: That's so much, how can we manage

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.460
[Guest]: And Baijung Bhutia was there in the room

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.460
[Guest]: You know, again as an observer for some other reason

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:16.460
[Guest]: And he just couldn't help saying it

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.460
[Guest]: And he said that, you know

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.460
[Guest]: If in one of the most popular states in India

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.460
[Guest]: You find it difficult to raise 10,000 rupees

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.460
[Guest]: For the world's most popular game

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.460
[Guest]: Then maybe you're not the right guys

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.460
[Guest]: To run the association

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.460
[Guest]: And there was an absolute furor

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.460
[Unknown]: But that's the truth of it

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.460
[Guest]: That is the truth of it

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.460
[Guest]: And you know, people say that all these people

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.460
[Guest]: Are corrupt, not all of them are corrupt

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:40.460
[Guest]: Some of them are just really scared

01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:42.460
[Guest]: That they run their association

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:44.460
[Guest]: With gmails and hotmails

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.460
[Guest]: And mom and pop shops

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.460
[Guest]: Which is somebody's basically drawing room

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.460
[Guest]: And somebody's bedroom

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460
[Guest]: That's how state associations are run

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.460
[Guest]: And they're terrified that if this sport really grows

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.460
[Guest]: And the right people come to run it

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.460
[Guest]: Then what will happen?

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:00.460
[Guest]: They will lose them because they don't have the ability

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.460
[Guest]: To control the rise of the sport

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:04.460
[Guest]: They don't have the ability

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.460
[Guest]: They've just been there for 30 years in the sport

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.460
[Guest]: And they're stuck and they've got their position

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.460
[Guest]: And they look forward to this annual trip to Delhi or Bombay

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.460
[Guest]: To go there and association vote

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.460
[Guest]: And this thing

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.460
[Guest]: They go there to have their local association

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.460
[Guest]: Where somebody will put flowers around them before the local tournament

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:20.460
[Guest]: And that's all going to be taken away from them

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.460
[Guest]: So the truth of it is

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.460
[Guest]: I mean, one of the startups that I've

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.460
[Guest]: Wanted to propose for the longest time is

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.460
[Guest]: Find the money

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.460
[Guest]: To get the good people into Indian sport

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:32.460
[Guest]: At the state association level

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:34.460
[Guest]: Right at the top, you actually have a lot of associations

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:36.460
[Guest]: Who are very smart and intelligent people out there

01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.460
[Guest]: But the 30 states

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.460
[Guest]: That make the voting block

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.460
[Guest]: If that does not change

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.460
[Guest]: If the quality of the people there does not change, nothing is going to change

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.460
[Amit Varma]: And one solution it seems to me

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.460
[Amit Varma]: Is kind of what the IPL did to cricket

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:50.460
[Amit Varma]: Is that you bring market incentives into play

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.460
[Amit Varma]: You change the incentives

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.460
[Amit Varma]: And that sort of now brings me to your next move

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.460
[Amit Varma]: After the U-17

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.460
[Amit Varma]: World Cup is over

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.460
[Amit Varma]: You're the CEO of the Volleyball League

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.460
[Amit Varma]: And how

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.460
[Amit Varma]: How was that conceived? Why was that conceived?

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.460
[Amit Varma]: Why Volleyball? What was the aim?

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.460
[Amit Varma]: What was your ambit there?

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.460
[Guest]: What is your ambit there?

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.460
[Guest]: So the guys who actually sold the U-17 World Cup

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.460
[Guest]: And they did about 5 and 5 and a half million dollars

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.460
[Guest]: Of sales in the U-17 World Cup

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.460
[Guest]: Which is a huge number

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:24.460
[Guest]: Because the highest number before that ever sold for an U-17 World Cup

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.460
[Guest]: I'm not counting Dubai 2015

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.460
[Guest]: Because Dubai, no not

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.460
[Guest]: Because no Dubai money is

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.460
[Guest]: I mean Sheikh might just sponsor it

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.460
[Guest]: But otherwise

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.460
[Guest]: The last record was

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:38.460
[Guest]: 300,000 was the maximum ever sold

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.460
[Guest]: In a U-17 tournament

01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:42.460
[Guest]: And we sold about 5 million dollars

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:44.460
[Guest]: First time we had LED boards and all that

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.460
[Guest]: So we changed the way we looked at it

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.460
[Guest]: So these guys I knew were very competent guys

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:50.460
[Guest]: Baseline in promoting or finding

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.460
[Guest]: Sponsorship for sport

01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:54.460
[Guest]: So they basically had worked out a 10 year

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.460
[Guest]: Association with the Volleyball

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.460
[Guest]: Federation of India

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.460
[Guest]: And so they said that would I be interested

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.460
[Guest]: So before sort of I got on board

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:04.460
[Guest]: What I said was first let's go and have a look at the sport

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.460
[Guest]: Because one of the problems football suffers

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.460
[Guest]: From in our part of the world is that

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.460
[Guest]: International football looks just so much better than Indian

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.460
[Guest]: Football that it's very difficult to put them

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:14.460
[Guest]: On side by side and keep watching

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.460
[Guest]: Indian football. So I wanted to see

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.460
[Guest]: Was the Volleyball watchable to

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.460
[Guest]: Start with and I went

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.460
[Guest]: We went first to Calicut and then to a place

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.460
[Guest]: Which is about 40 kilometers from Vijayawada

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.460
[Guest]: And I loved the

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:28.460
[Guest]: Volleyball, the quality of the play was very good

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.460
[Guest]: And again I say this

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.460
[Guest]: With an untrained eye, maybe there are

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.460
[Guest]: People who, International Volleyball viewers will see

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.460
[Guest]: It and say it's not good enough

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.460
[Guest]: But for a spectacle that you want to watch

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.460
[Guest]: It's good enough for you

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.460
[Guest]: To have top quality Volleyball out there

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.460
[Guest]: And the moment, the place was called Bhimavaran I remember

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.460
[Guest]: And once I came

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.460
[Guest]: Back I said this is worth doing

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.460
[Guest]: And the other reason I looked at it was

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:52.460
[Guest]: If you look at sport, today sport is going to be

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.460
[Guest]: Driven by whether we call it television or

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.460
[Guest]: OTT or whatever, it's going to be driven by

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.460
[Guest]: Remote viewership. Now if you look

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.460
[Guest]: At sports, there are some sports

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.460
[Guest]: Which are perfect for remote viewership

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:04.460
[Guest]: There are some which are not

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.460
[Guest]: So give you a very very good example

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.460
[Guest]: Hockey is a tough

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:10.460
[Guest]: Sport to do for remote viewership

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.460
[Guest]: Why? Because the ball is very small

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.460
[Guest]: The action moves over a fairly large

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.460
[Guest]: Field very fast and there are

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.460
[Guest]: A lot of routes which are difficult to get through

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.460
[Guest]: So hockey is a

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.460
[Guest]: Difficult game to watch, on the ground

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.460
[Guest]: It's a terrific game to watch

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.460
[Guest]: But it's a very difficult game to watch

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.460
[Guest]: Additionally table tennis is a

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.460
[Guest]: Pretty great sport to play

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.460
[Guest]: It's not a great sport to watch on television

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.460
[Guest]: Whereas tennis is a very very

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.460
[Guest]: Riveting sport because the size

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.460
[Guest]: Of the ball and the size of the gladiator

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.460
[Guest]: Ship comes through in tennis

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.460
[Guest]: It just doesn't seem to in table tennis

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.460
[Guest]: So when we looked at it that way

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.460
[Guest]: I mean there were three sports which I thought

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.460
[Guest]: Were built for television

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.460
[Guest]: One is football. Though football is built

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.460
[Guest]: For television but it's not built for commercial

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.460
[Guest]: Exploitation because the way it is you know it's very little

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:56.460
[Guest]: Time for you to exploit it. You can only put up

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.460
[Guest]: The scoreboard at the top. That's all. You can't do very much

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.460
[Guest]: Else with it. The second is

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.460
[Guest]: Basketball which is perfect because

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.460
[Guest]: You have a large ball. Lots of action

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.460
[Guest]: Happening. Lots of changing action

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.460
[Guest]: Large ball. Lots of commercial

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.460
[Guest]: Breaks. Lots of ability to monetize

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.460
[Guest]: Volleyball is exactly the same

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.460
[Guest]: High flying aerial sport. Lots of

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.460
[Guest]: People jumping, smashing

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.460
[Guest]: Points, sets. So there are lots of

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.460
[Guest]: Commercial breaks. Large ball

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.460
[Guest]: The action is very visible. So we said

01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.460
[Guest]: I knew that this is one of the sports

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:26.460
[Guest]: Where you can actually make a difference

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:28.460
[Guest]: And that's from where it started and then I

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.460
[Guest]: Realized that in Kerala for example

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.460
[Guest]: It's almost a religion. Volleyball is a huge religion

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.460
[Guest]: Kerala, Chennai, Tamil Nadu

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.460
[Guest]: That belt has a huge religion and

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.460
[Guest]: Then there's a belt out here which is

01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.460
[Guest]: Madhya Pradesh, Shatisgarh and then up there Punjab, Haryana

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.460
[Guest]: These are the belts where a lot of

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.460
[Guest]: Volleyball is played

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:46.460
[Guest]: And therefore we started getting together teams

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.460
[Guest]: And you know we got. What we got was in fact

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:50.460
[Guest]: We had a team from Kochi. We had one from Calicut

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.460
[Guest]: Two from Kerala, one from Chennai

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.460
[Guest]: One from Hyderabad. Ronnie Suwala took over

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:56.460
[Guest]: The Mumbai team and we had

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.460
[Guest]: A team from Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.460
[Guest]: Which was you know people who run the Special Olympics

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:02.460
[Guest]: They are one of India's largest groups

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.460
[Guest]: In sport, they were there

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.460
[Guest]: And we had some

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.460
[Guest]: The amazing part of it is we played year one only in

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.460
[Guest]: Kochi and Chennai and the beauty

01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:12.460
[Guest]: Was something that I

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.460
[Guest]: My heart warmed to that

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:16.460
[Guest]: I believe that you can make out whether a game works

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.460
[Guest]: Or not by real spectators

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.460
[Guest]: So the mad day before the Kochi

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.460
[Guest]: Calicut match, we actually

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.460
[Guest]: Had to have a meeting with the police

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.460
[Guest]: To say where is Kochi going to sit

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.460
[Guest]: Where is Calicut going to sit. We had a toss of the coin

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.460
[Guest]: To say they are going to sit this side

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.460
[Guest]: And it is the most amazing sight. I have to show it to you

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.460
[Guest]: It's still there on my phone

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:36.460
[Guest]: That you know a thousand guys, they call themselves the Chembada

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:38.460
[Guest]: Chembada is the Red Army of Calicut

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.460
[Guest]: Has just landed in buses

01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:42.460
[Guest]: And they are marching with their drums

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.460
[Guest]: On to the field. And the Kochi

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.460
[Guest]: Blue Sky Army is coming with their body paint

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.460
[Guest]: And on to the other side

01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:50.460
[Guest]: And it's fantastic because I said

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.460
[Guest]: This is what sport is about. This is not artificial

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:54.460
[Guest]: You can't create this. It's not a marketing

01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.460
[Guest]: Gimmick. Guys are painting

01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.460
[Guest]: Themselves, getting on to a vehicle and coming out here

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:00.460
[Guest]: And when the finals was held in Chennai

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:02.460
[Guest]: You know, Calicut reached the

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.460
[Guest]: Finals, so did Chennai

01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.460
[Guest]: And Chennai by then had caught fire

01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.460
[Guest]: And there were 6000 people inside that stadium

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:10.460
[Guest]: In Chennai. We originally had

01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.460
[Guest]: Decided not to open the top tier but we had

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:14.460
[Guest]: To because there was so much demand

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.460
[Guest]: There was a sea of yellow and there were

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.460
[Guest]: Thousand guys in red and white sitting out there in the middle

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.460
[Guest]: Which is the

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:22.460
[Guest]: Calicut supporters. And they were as loud

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.460
[Guest]: As the other five and a half thousand

01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:26.460
[Guest]: So it was absolutely fantastic

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:28.460
[Guest]: Because my belief is that that's when

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.460
[Guest]: You get a game. When actually at the

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.460
[Guest]: Grassroots people are watching, people are

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:34.460
[Guest]: Singing. You know there's this shot

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:36.460
[Guest]: Somebody sent me of

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.460
[Guest]: In Calicut. People standing outside

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.460
[Guest]: You know one of those television shops

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:42.460
[Guest]: And watching. Like typically as you do

01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:44.460
[Guest]: For cricket, you know World Cup action happens

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.460
[Guest]: You stop and you watch. And then you say okay

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.460
[Amit Varma]: This will work.

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.460
[Amit Varma]: One of the things I just learned 180

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.460
[Amit Varma]: Seconds ago from you is that

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:54.460
[Amit Varma]: There is actually a volleyball culture in India

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.460
[Guest]: Yeah, it's huge. There used to be a chap

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Called Jimmy George who was a

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.460
[Guest]: Hero and they made a film on him and he

01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.460
[Guest]: Played in the Italian league. He was a star in the Italian league

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.460
[Guest]: Passed away in an accident in

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.460
[Guest]: 87 I think in the 80s

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:08.460
[Guest]: But he was a spectacular player

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.460
[Guest]: And he was 6 feet 1 or 2 and he would jump

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.460
[Guest]: As much. And he was quite

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.460
[Guest]: Volleyball see that way if you

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.460
[Guest]: Notice as a game it sort of comes

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.460
[Guest]: In from till schools

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.460
[Guest]: And then at some point it just disappears. Every school

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.460
[Guest]: Has a volleyball court. You know so there's volleyball at

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:24.460
[Guest]: Some level played. I've played it in schools. Yeah

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:26.460
[Guest]: And then you'll see even now the oldies

01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.460
[Guest]: In the ground will go and play it. You know just getting the ball

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:30.460
[Guest]: Across. That volleyball happens all the time

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.460
[Guest]: But because it's not consistently

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.460
[Guest]: Shown on television, there's no sport

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.460
[Guest]: To catch it. And so we've just done

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.460
[Guest]: That and there's this chap called Ajit Lal. They call

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.460
[Guest]: Him Hydrogen

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.460
[Guest]: In Kerala because he jumps so quickly

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.460
[Guest]: Sort of takes off

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.460
[Unknown]: So he's called Hydrogen. And there are kids

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.460
[Guest]: Who now call themselves Ajit. And we put

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.460
[Guest]: Some innovations in the game. So we had something called a

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.460
[Guest]: Super point. So super point is

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.460
[Guest]: Every match before

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.460
[Guest]: 11. So our games are 15. Before 11

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.460
[Guest]: Each team can call a super point

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.460
[Guest]: On that point you either

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.460
[Guest]: Double your points or you double your losses depending on

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.460
[Guest]: Who gets it. Either you get 2 points or they get 2 points

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:06.460
[Guest]: And it becomes like really

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.460
[Guest]: Tense. So kids in

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.460
[Guest]: Localities in Kerala are playing and they have

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.460
[Guest]: Super points. And then that's

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.460
[Guest]: When you know that you're catching it. In fact

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.460
[Guest]: The most interesting part of it was that they were

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.460
[Guest]: Watching our telecast in FIVB

01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.460
[Guest]: Which is the world body of volleyball

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.460
[Guest]: And they came down to the finals. They were absolutely

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.460
[Guest]: Delighted. They came down to the finals

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.460
[Guest]: They want to do a lot more

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.460
[Guest]: With Indian volleyball and the truth of it

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.460
[Guest]: Is who doesn't want to do a lot in

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.460
[Guest]: A country which has 1.3 billion people

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.460
[Guest]: So they're really invested in it and

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.460
[Guest]: That's the one advantage maybe volleyball has over

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.460
[Guest]: Kabaddi which has right now a much larger

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.460
[Guest]: Base. Is that there's you know

01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.460
[Guest]: 220 countries play volleyball over the world

01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.460
[Guest]: And it's a big sport worldwide and

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.460
[Guest]: You know they want India to do well

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:48.460
[Guest]: And one of the first things they did after

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.460
[Guest]: That within 2 months was

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.460
[Guest]: That the FIVB actually has

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.460
[Guest]: Paid for and got

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:56.460
[Guest]: For India a proper

01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.460
[Guest]: Coach and 2 physios

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.460
[Guest]: From abroad who are going to work with the Indian

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.460
[Guest]: Team. Because their belief is

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.460
[Guest]: The first place that will make an impact is with the Indian

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:06.460
[Guest]: Team. And where are we ranked

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.460
[Guest]: In the world? So it's a very funny thing. We were ranked

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.460
[Guest]: 38th in the world

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.460
[Guest]: Then for 2 years the organization was banned

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.460
[Guest]: Because there was some amount of this thing. So it went

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.460
[Guest]: To 131. Now I don't know

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:18.460
[Guest]: Where we are again. Because it's a strange one. We

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:20.460
[Guest]: Our team, the team that won this

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.460
[Guest]: Played the Asian Club Championship

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.460
[Guest]: And it reached the final 4

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.460
[Guest]: It lost a heartbreaker to the team that was

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.460
[Guest]: The eventual champion. In a 4 set

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.460
[Guest]: I think they lost 25-23 in the last set

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:32.460
[Guest]: So yeah, it's, I think

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.460
[Guest]: As I said, there's a very

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.460
[Guest]: Genuine chance of

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.460
[Guest]: 20 seems tough in my

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:40.460
[Guest]: Opinion. 24 is a very reasonable

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.460
[Guest]: Olympic qualification

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Chance. You know sport is relatively

01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Cheap to play. Can easily

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.460
[Guest]: Catch on. How was season 1?

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.460
[Guest]: Season 1 was excellent. I mean season 1 we had

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.460
[Guest]: A reach of 21 million. And this

01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.460
[Guest]: Was in a time when we

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.460
[Guest]: When the February 1st

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:58.460
[Guest]: TRI stopped that bunching of channels

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:00.460
[Guest]: I mean you couldn't bunch channels anymore

01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.460
[Guest]: So they have actually put out this thing

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:04.460
[Guest]: Saying ratings for those 2 months, February

01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:06.460
[Guest]: And March should not be considered because there was

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.460
[Guest]: Complete disruption. And we were on from

01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:10.460
[Guest]: February 2nd to 22nd. But decide

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:12.460
[Guest]: That the reach we got

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.460
[Guest]: 21.6 million was very encouraging and

01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.460
[Guest]: I think the most encouraging for us

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.460
[Guest]: Was the thing that we could look at was

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:20.460
[Guest]: Time spent. And time spent

01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.460
[Guest]: Was actually higher than it was of

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.460
[Guest]: Almost any sport. It was more than ISL, it was more than

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.460
[Guest]: Kabaddi. Because, so what we

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.460
[Guest]: Got to understand was anyone who

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:30.460
[Guest]: Watched it, really liked

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:32.460
[Guest]: It. And that's what we have to work

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.460
[Guest]: With. And say that our job is now to

01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:36.460
[Guest]: Make sure as many people sample it

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:38.460
[Guest]: As possible. Because we know the game works

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.460
[Guest]: As a game it works, it's very

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.460
[Guest]: Watchable. So our job is to just make

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.460
[Guest]: Sure people know that this game is on

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.460
[Guest]: It works and this is the time that it's on. And that's

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.460
[Guest]: The big challenge for us. And that's more of a marketing

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.460
[Guest]: Challenge. Because I think what has happened

01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.460
[Guest]: Now is of all the 3 of the

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.460
[Guest]: P's of everything else, we have product

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.460
[Guest]: At least, we have the product. And that's

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.460
[Guest]: No thanks to us, that's thanks to intrinsically

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.460
[Guest]: And the international players also we got were excellent

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.460
[Guest]: Players. And people like David Lee

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.460
[Guest]: Again, 2016 Olympic champion

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.460
[Guest]: Is playing for us. That tells you a

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.460
[Guest]: Certain bit about the fact that given

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.460
[Guest]: The market, an equivalent

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.460
[Guest]: Football guy wouldn't be able to get a guy of that quality

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.460
[Amit Varma]: And you guys

01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:16.460
[Amit Varma]: Actually have. Which is, you know

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.460
[Amit Varma]: Since you mentioned the market, a related question I had

01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:20.460
[Amit Varma]: Is that, you know, all this is happening

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:22.460
[Amit Varma]: Now, but is it partly

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.460
[Amit Varma]: Enabled by the fact that

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:26.460
[Amit Varma]: We have grown to the extent that

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.460
[Amit Varma]: There's so much globalization, the markets are much

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.460
[Amit Varma]: Bigger. And in a big market like India

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.460
[Amit Varma]: Even a niche can actually end up

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.460
[Amit Varma]: Being big in itself. Absolutely

01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.460
[Guest]: And that's the only reason they're growing

01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:38.460
[Guest]: That's the only reason they were growing. All these

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.460
[Guest]: Opportunities were there before as well. It's only

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.460
[Guest]: Now that it becomes commercially viable. It's

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:44.460
[Guest]: Also now that I realized working with FIFA

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.460
[Guest]: How closely

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.460
[Guest]: The world looks at India, especially

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:50.460
[Guest]: Indian sport. Because the opportunities

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:52.460
[Guest]: Out there is, we are the

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.460
[Guest]: Everyone, I mean the NBA says it very

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:56.460
[Guest]: Openly in 2030, you are the world's largest

01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.460
[Guest]: Market. Can we afford not

01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.460
[Guest]: To be present in the world's largest market?

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.460
[Guest]: And that's exactly

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.460
[Guest]: The kind of thing that's fueling

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.460
[Guest]: You might not know it, Major League Baseball

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:08.460
[Guest]: Is making a major play to come to India

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:10.460
[Guest]: American football wants to make a major play

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.460
[Guest]: To come to India. Because who can afford

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.460
[Guest]: To ignore 1.3 billion people?

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:16.460
[Guest]: That's a fact of it. We are the world's

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:18.460
[Guest]: Largest open market sitting and waiting

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.460
[Guest]: For people. So every sport

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.460
[Guest]: Will want to do it. They might burn their fingers

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.460
[Guest]: Some may work, some may not work

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.460
[Guest]: But there is no doubt in my head that

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.460
[Guest]: At least of the 10, 15

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.460
[Guest]: 20 such ideas, thoughts

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.460
[Guest]: Leagues that will happen, at least half of them

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.460
[Guest]: Will survive and really flourish over time

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:36.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we're running out of time. So I'll

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.460
[Amit Varma]: Kind of wrap it up with

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.460
[Amit Varma]: One final question, which is, you know

01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.460
[Amit Varma]: Looking ahead and you're obviously still in charge

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Of the volleyball league and you're deeply involved with sport

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:46.460
[Amit Varma]: And passionate about sport in various

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.460
[Amit Varma]: Ways. Looking ahead, where do you think this is

01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:50.460
[Amit Varma]: Going? Will India become a really big sporting

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.460
[Amit Varma]: Nation at some point? Will we start winning many

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.460
[Amit Varma]: Olympic medals and so on and so forth?

01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.460
[Amit Varma]: And also, is that something

01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Where you have to allow market

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:00.460
[Amit Varma]: Processes to play out more and those incentives

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.460
[Amit Varma]: To come into play? How should the

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Government look at sport? Like how should

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:06.460
[Amit Varma]: India's sports minister, for example

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.460
[Amit Varma]: Look at the sports

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.460
[Amit Varma]: Ecosystem? Should they try to micromanage

01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.460
[Amit Varma]: Or should they put institutions

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.460
[Guest]: In place? How does it work?

01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.460
[Guest]: I mean, the sports code

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.460
[Guest]: Which they've been threatening to do for the longest

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.460
[Guest]: Time is a fairly good

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:22.460
[Guest]: Document to start with, if you can

01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:24.460
[Guest]: Enforce it. It didn't put together a lot

01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.460
[Guest]: Of people. People I respect a lot

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.460
[Guest]: Have put their weight behind it

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.460
[Guest]: So I think you have to. I think the biggest

01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.460
[Guest]: Problem in India is, you know

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:34.460
[Guest]: A friend of mine, he's a lawyer called Nandan Kamath

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.460
[Guest]: Put it very well. He said, you know

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.460
[Guest]: Indian sports administrators look for ambiguity

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:40.460
[Guest]: Because in ambiguity lies power

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.460
[Guest]: When there's no ambiguity

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:44.460
[Guest]: There's no power, okay?

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.460
[Guest]: And the sports code's job is to

01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.460
[Guest]: Try and get rid of this ambiguity as much

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.460
[Guest]: As possible. So I think one of it will be

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.460
[Guest]: Institutional, legal. You have to create

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:54.460
[Guest]: Like Ambedkar did many years

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.460
[Guest]: Back, the kind of institutions

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.460
[Guest]: That hold over time

01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:00.460
[Guest]: That give you crystal clear

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.460
[Guest]: Rules as much as possible about what will happen

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.460
[Guest]: Forward. The second is market forces

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.460
[Guest]: And I see this

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.460
[Guest]: Period, this, you know, next

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.460
[Guest]: From the last 5 years for the next 10-15 years

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:12.460
[Guest]: To be a huge struggle between

01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:14.460
[Guest]: The guys who are stubbornly holding on

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.460
[Guest]: To the institutions and places that they've managed

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.460
[Guest]: To get in. Because 30 years back

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.460
[Guest]: The sport was really small and they've sort of wheedled their way in

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.460
[Guest]: And until this is completely

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:24.460
[Guest]: Cleared, we are not

01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.460
[Guest]: Going to be on the fast lane. Still now

01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.460
[Guest]: There are so many roadblocks in Indian sport

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:30.460
[Guest]: It's got much better. Some institutions

01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:32.460
[Guest]: Have got better, some organizations have got better

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.460
[Guest]: Some federations have got better

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.460
[Guest]: But until these roadblocks are cleared

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:38.460
[Guest]: And there are many, many, many of them

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:40.460
[Guest]: I think it's going to be difficult

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.460
[Guest]: So I see the next 10 years a lot of churn

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Hopefully from then on

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.460
[Amit Varma]: It'll get faster. Joy, thanks
